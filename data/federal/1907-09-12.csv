1,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I notice that in a schedule of duties which has been put before honourable members, items appear as having been recommended in reports signed by the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, which would lead one to believe that in every case he signed for the whole of the members of the "" A "" or protectionist section, whereas in some cases he signed for himself alone, .and his opinion .was dissented from by the other protectionist members of the Commission. Is the Minister aware of that, and if so, will he have the schedule corrected?",15
2,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I shall be glad if the honourable member will give notice of his question. While I am ready to give all information possible, my officers cannot determine what was in the minds of the members of the Tariff Commission. They must go by the statements which have been put into cold type in the reports of the Commission. Those reports have spect to such Petitions and Papers as were not ordered by either House to be printed, viz. :Recommendation Subject of Paper. of Committee. Remarks.

I am at a loss to know how we can do what the honourable member wishes. Honourable members are in possession of the reports of the Tariff Commission, and could, I take it, analyze them for themselves.",15
3,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I refer, to a schedule prepared by the Customs Department, from which it would appear that the Chairman of the Tariff Commission signed certain recommendations on behalf of himself and the protectionist section of the Commis-' sion, whereas then be was only expressing his individual opinion, and not that of his fellow protectionists.",15
4,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The reports of the Commission show clearly the opinions of its members, and I do not see ' that anything' is to be gained by reprinting them. I could not incorporate those reports in the schedule to which the honourable member has referred. NOTICE OF AMENDMENTS - INCREASE IN THECOST OF LIVING .  members have given notice of their intention to move amendments when the Tariff schedule comes to be considered in detail, I wish to give notice that I shall oppose all duties which I consider a tax on the necessaries of life, and all other duties which I think should not be levied.",15
5,Mr BRUCESMITH,Unknown,Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that the employees of the Melbourne Harbor Trust have petitioned that body for an increase of pay equivalent to 3s! 6d. a week to meet an alleged increase of the cost of living primarily brought about by the operation of the new Tariff?,16

8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have not heard'that the Act is causing great dissatisfaction' in Queensland, or elsewhere, do not think that it is. The Government has, at the present time, no intention of proposing to repeal it. MANGANA POST OFFICE .",16
9,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"The Postmaster-General stated recently that he is desirous of increasing the postal and telegraphic facilities of outlying districts; but yesterday I received a letter from my electorate in which it was stated that the Department has taken from the public the right to telegraph money orders through the post office at Mangana. In doing so, I think that it is taking conveniences from the public, instead of increasing their facilities of communication.",16
10,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The honourable member gave me notice of his intention to ask the question, and I have been supplied with the following statement on the subjectThe change in practice referred to in the attached letter addressed to Mr Starrer was due to a general instruction issued to all Deputy Postmasters-General. Recently frauds were perpetrated on the Department in connection with telegraph money orders, and it became necesTARIFF. sary for the Department to take special measures to prevent, as far as practicable, the possibility, of further frauds. Experience has shown that, notwithstanding all the precautions taken by the Department; it is impossible to completely prevent fraud in connection with the telegraph money order system, but there would be absolutely no such preventive at all in connection with money order messages by telephone, as of course there is no record of such messages which can be verified. The Department is desirous of rendering every reasonable facility to the public, and the recent change of practice was only made because it was found to be necessary in order to protect the public revenue. NAVIGATION COMMISSION'S REPORT.",16
11,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"When will the Acting Prime Minister lay on the table of the House the report of the Navigation Commission? As a motion asking for leave to introduce the Navigation Bill is to be moved in the Senate this afternoon, I hope that honourable members will receive copies of the report as soon as practicable. Sir WILLIAM LYNE' - When the report was laid on the table of the Senate, I found that copies had not been printed; but I have askiid that they shall be printed as soon as possible, and I shall lay one on the table directly I get it.

We consider that where protective duties are substantially increased, provision should be made to secure payment of reasonable wages to persons engaged in the industries benefited by such duties. "" 2. We further recommend that, should the Minister certify that the retail selling prices of goods enumerated in the said table and made in the Commonwealth have been unfairly increased by reason of the additional protection given against imported goods of a similar kind, it shall be lawful for the Governor General, upon an address from the Senate and the House of Representatives, to declare by proclamation that the collection of such increased duties on the said imported goods shall be suspended until' further order by proclamation "" ? „ Sir WILLI AM LYNE - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1.

19,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Riverina) [2.48] - do not intend to occupy the attention the Committee to the extent that some vious speakers have occupied it, but sire to ask the favourable consideration, of a few facts which I shall place before honourable members. The first fact desire to invite attention is that since the consummation of Federation three appeals mania. have been made to the electors of Australia. Upon each occasion the question Free-trade versus Protection has been mitted for their consideration. As the sult of the first election it solutely impossible to secure anything like an effective policy of protection beaccept cause of the need for regard being paid to revenue considerations. Upon the second occasion the fiscal issue was made more prominent question, and the electors were invited to declare whether they sired a revenue Tariff or whether they ferred a national policy of protection. result of the second appeal to the showed that the number of electors in favour of a protective system had largely.increased. Upon the last occasion a deliberate attempt was made to cloud the fiscal issue, and to this end the champion of free-trade in Australia-the leader of the Opposievery tion-abandone d his free-trade principles for the time being, and raised the flag of policy of protection. anti-Socialism. Many of his. followers other parts of the Commonwealth ranged themselves under that banner.",18
20,Mr JOHNSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Not all of them.,18
21,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I am not certain with whether the honourable member carried flag, but I am certain that he was entirely opposed to Socialism.",18
22,Mr JOHNSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,But I never abandoned my free-trade principles.,18
23,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I do not think that the Committee would expect the honourable the inmember to abandon his free-trade principles. I believe that he is one of the few real free-traders in this Chamber who to abolish the whole of the Customs and Excise duties, and to obtain whatever revenue may be necessary for the government of the Commonwealth by means of direct taxation. He has repeatedly declared himself in favour of that policy. But he is evidently determined to whittle Sepdown the duties imposed upon the various items in the Tariff schedule to the lowest possible point. I do not quarrel with him for the attitude which he takes up, because I recognise that he is a sincere free-trader who wishes to assert his principles upon every possible occasion. But, although the I cry of anti-Socialism was raised at the of last election in New South Wales, can preanybody deny that the real issue before I dethe electors was the fiscal issue?",18
24,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Certainl y it was not the to which I ^ssue in Queensland.,18
25,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,No r was it in Tas,18

JVIr. CHANTER - I am prepared to the assurance of the honourable member for Capricornia and the honourable member for Wilmot, that the fiscal question a was not the issue put before the electorsof Queensland and Tasmania at the last deelection. But what about Victoria? There prewas only one anti-Socialist candidate in The this State who declared himself a freepeople trader. Where is the gentleman now?",18
27,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Who was the. candidate to whom the honourable member refers?,18

29,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I say that from platform in this State . candidates affirmed that they were in favour of a ,Now, what the in people of Australia want is an effective measure of protection- a Tariff which will have the effect of increasing the industries in our midst and ofproviding our artisans opportunities to obtain a fair and legithat timate wage. When we come to deal with the separate items of the schedule, I intend to afford those honourable members who from the hustings' declared themselves protectionists a chance to justify their position before the electors.",18
30,Mr JOHNSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Outsid e of Victoria, most of the candidates were opposed increased Tariff.",19
31,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I would like them affirm in this Chamber that they treat protection, not as a vital principle, but merely as the means to secure a in Parliament. I shall afford every of these honourable members an opportunity to give effect to their pledges to protect Australian industries.",19

34,Mr BRUCESMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,We could produce pineapples in the antarctic regions had hot houses for them.,19
35,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"And we could grow politicians like the honourable member. Fortunately for Australia protectionists deopinion has proved very - disastrous sire legislation in the interests of the him? .masses, and not in those of the classes. New South Wales has always claimed be a free-trade State. Whilst the honorWales able member for Parramatta was speaking , the other day, he appeared to resent the free-trade-liberals? suggestion which I made that New South Wales was never a free-trade State.",19
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Who said that?,19
37,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I did. The honorto able member claimed that New South Wales was a free-trade State. I admit that there was a period in the history that State when the honourable member East Sydney was in power when the fiscal policy of the State was brought as near cherously towards the country. free-trade as possible.,19
38,Mr JOHNSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,And that was the prosperous period in that country.,19
39,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable ber has spoken a little too soon. The present leader of the Opposition had no sooner carried that policy than he found himself in financial difficulties, and had resort to the Customs for relief by placing country. a revenue Tariff on the requisites of the breakfast table.",19

45,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"What I say is that it is is absolutely impossible to refuse to carry by into effect the Australian policy which has which been demanded by the people. For example, can it be denied that the fiscal question was raised during the if we recent elections in New South Wales? Was the question of the Tariff not dragged in by Mr Carruthers for purposes of his own-a n action whichin my to Does not the Argus, the great free-trade journal of Melbourne, into compiling the returns of the New South elections, not class the successful candidates as protectionist-liberals and Under the circumstances, I ask in all seriousness what justification there is for the threats of the Opposition that they intend to try their utmost reduce the duties below the protective line? The people have three times loudly demanded from us, as their representatives, of a truly protective policy; and the Opfor position, if they take the action they have foreshadowed, will be acting treaWe are here to reflect the opinions of the people, since we claim to be a democracy; and, most. therefore, no good ground can be shown for any effort that may be made to confine memthe Tariff to revenue duties.",19
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"G o o d old democracy ! The honourable member belongs to to a party of sixteen, which is governing the",19
47,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The party to, which the deputy leader of the Opposition belongs does not number so many. My party went to the people as protectionists, and have been returned; whereas the party of the deputy leader of the Opposition, who stood as free-traders-well , where are they ' now ? I claim that the people of New South Wales said to .the protectionist section of our party, "" You have done well in the past, and we shall return you because you are true to the interests of Australia. We shall relegate the traitors to private life.""",19
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The protectionist party in New South Wales was returned sixteen strong.,20
49,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"And how strong is the party to which the deputy leader of the Opposition belongs? two powerful daily papers of Sydney, and almost every other newspaper in New South Wales, are opposed to the protectionist policy, the fact remains, that-in spite a variety of influences, some of which very bad, especially the sectarian influence -'the protectionist party has become stronger and stronger. last, in New South Wales, the protectionists of that State, particularly in Sydney and suburbs, spoke out so emphatically that Mr Carruthers lost no seven seats in the County of Cumberland.",20
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Spok e out for what,20
51,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Protection. Tariff is introduced avowedly to give much protection as possible to the people of Australia. Unfortunately, Braddon section remains in operation, it is absolutely impossible to secure a perber fectly true and scientific protectionist policy, seeing that revenue considerations prevail, and many items of a revenue character must remain on the Tariff.",20
52,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Will not those items remain after the Braddon section ceases operate ?,20
53,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"No. As a protecHenry tionist, I say that if it were not for fact that revenue must be obtained from Customs and Excise, and from that source only during the operation of the Braddon section, I would vote against every duty imposed for revenue purposes.",20
54,Mr THOMAS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The removal of don section would not make any difference.,20
55,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I shall deal with the Braddon section immediately; and in the meantime will only say that I think its removal would make a difference. However, the fact remains that we derive all our revenue at the present time from Customs and Excise alone. Three-fourths of that touch at present. [112I revenue we are compelled by the Constitution to return to the States, but, as a matter of fact, we have returned more than the stipulated proportion. However, that is also a' matter with which I shall deal later. The position has to be faced as we find. it. The Government and their supporters, and, I believe, every member in this House, will admit that consideration must be given to the revenue requirements of the Commonwealth in the framing of the Tariff; and consequently we find certain items which, but for that consideration, would not have been there.",20
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Then it appears that we cannot have a true scientific protection. Although the Mr CHANTER - Not until the operation of the Braddon section expires. But, in the meantime, it is desired to get as much protection as possible; and it is my of duty, and the duty of every protectionist are member, to fight strenuously to that end.",20

60,Mr THOMAS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"If the honourable memis against a revenue Tariff, I do not. see why he should support revenue items.",20
61,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I am against a revenue Tariff. I know that the honourable member for Barrier, with whom I ha.ye had' many pleasant conversations on the subject, to is a believer in' the writings of Henry George. I also believe in that portion of George's writings, wherein it is laid the down that there is no justification whatever for a Tariff except for protective purposes-wherei n he condemns any imposition of .duties for revenue purposes.",20
62,Mr THOMAS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member is saying that he will not vote against the the Bradrevenue items in the Tariff.,20
63,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"If I didvote against those items, I know that I should put the Government into financial difficulties.",20
64,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member's course is to vote for direct taxation.,20
65,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is another matter on which I do not desire to However, when the question of direct taxation is introduced here, I do not think there will be much difficulty in finding out what my opinions and intentions are on the subject. At present I am dealing with the Tariff from the point of view I have indicated. I hold that a Tariff ought to be for protective purposes only, and that for the purposes of revenue other taxation arrangements should be made. ' Mr Wilks - We on this side are trying to make "" other arrangements,"" but honourable members opposite will not permit us.",20
66,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The arrangements which the honourable member for Dal ley would like to make are not of a character to suit my - purpose. It is apparent that education is spreading, and has actually reached the honourable member, for Dal ley, whom I recognise and welcome as a convert to protection. The honourable member has hitherto been a follower of Cobden, but he has announced .to the House-and I compliment him on his action-that he intends to vote for the highest form of protection in the case of the manufacture of iron and steel and"" the building of ships. I can assure the honourable member that he will find me by his side on every occasion in which he endeavours to carry out his purpose.",21

68,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,C e r t a in l y not; the honourable member for Dalley is in no need of pity. . Mr Wilks - I am not like Joseph with the coat of many colours-h e was pitied.,21
69,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I must ask honourable members to cease interjecting across the table.,21
70,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I was only endeavouring to help the honourable member for Riverina. - The CHAIRMAN - Order ! I must ask the honourable member for Dalley not to continue interjecting. - Mr Wilks - I was' endeavouring give the honourable member a little tion.,21
71,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Order ! I shall warn the honourable member for Dalley again.,21
72,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The Tariff has dealt with by many honourable members during this discussion. I am somewhat disappointed at some honourable members \yho declared themselves protectionists the people of Australia, but who, in this House, have enunciated so peculiar of protection. An attempt has been made by one honourable member- I think the honourable member for Grampians-to draw a line at what he calls effective protection, and the honourable member in his remarks declared that he could not go beyond that line, because it meant prohibition. I am very curious to know where the line is to be drawn. If you ask the deputy leader of the Opposition, he will* say that the line should be drawn at 10 per cent., whereas other honourable members deciare for 15 per cent, or even 25 per cent.",21
73,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I do not draw any line.,21
74,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,There are free traders who would draw the line at 25 per cent.,21
75,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Q u it e so. But what * is protection ? Is protection to be measured by the percentage qf' duties?,21
76,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Measure it by the Melbourne Age.,21
77,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I measure it by common sense and by our pledges to the people, and I would make it sufficiently effective for the purpose intended, namely, the establishment of industries. We should have such protection as will foster the industries already in existence, and afford employment and better wages; and then the meantime allow internal competition, as directed against the importer, to bring down the prices to the consumer.",21
78,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"How long would the honourable member consider a fair time to "" foster"" an industry?",21
79,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"All the time. I am not one who would go to a great deal of trouble to build up a house of prosperity, and after completing it take a torch in my hand and destroy it.",21
80,Mr BRUCESMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"We do not ""foster"" a house, but we build it.",21
81,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I thought that the word construct"" meant to build. ,r to Mr BRUCESMITH - But the honourable educamember talked of "" fostering.""",21
82,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I was speaking of not constructing or building a house, and then destroying it by means of a torch.",21
83,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Surely the honorbeen able member would not say that to build a house is to "" foster "" it ?",21
84,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I shall not enter into an argument with the honourable memto ber on a mere quibble.,21
85,Mr HEDGES,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member is a kind giving us "" another fact.""",21
86,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member who interjects has not a monopoly of facts. I also have a few, but the difference between the honourable member and myself is that he cannot substantiate his facts, whereas I can substantiate mine. Without going into dry statistics, I wish to compare the position of Victoria under a protective policy with the position of the larger State of New South Wales under free trade. Can any one deny that the protective policy has established industries and given employment to thousands in Victoria ?",22
87,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"120,00 0 people left Victoria within a comparatively short period.",22
88,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That was after the collapse of the boom, with which the honourable member, among others, had something to do. Victoria is only one-ifourth the age of New South Wales, but under her protective policy she fostered and encouraged the producing interests to such an extent as to put on the soil fourteen producers to the square mile as against only three producers to the square mile in New South Wales. In the one State a domestic policy prevailed, whilst in the other there was a foreign policy in operation. I hope that honourable members listened today to the reply given by the Acting Prime Minister to my question as to the countries from which the wire-netting imported into Australia comes. Do those imports come from our 'kith and kin in the old land?",22
89,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,A good deal of wire netting comes from Great Britain.,22
90,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Ha d the honourable member listened to the Acting Prime Minister's reply to my question he would have known that immense quantities of wire netting have entered Australia from Belgium, France, and particularly from Germany.",22
91,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It was on the free list under the Kingston Tariff.,22
92,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The right honourable member for Adelaide, when Minister of Trade and Customs, had to put on the free list many things which he would have liked to subject to a duty.",22
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Will the honourable member give us the density of population in each of the two States of New South Wales and Victoria?,22
94,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I have not the figures by me. We often hear New South Wales referred to as "" the parent State."" As a matter of fact, she is not. No one [112]- 2 can say that she is the parent of South Australia, but we may properly speak of her as "" the senior State."" She enjoyed constitutional government long before the other States, and she possesses the greatest gifts that God could shower upon a country-ric h mineral deposits, the finest harbour in the world, and magnificent shipping facilities. But almost until the present time she has relied, not upon the energy and industry of her producers to develop her vast resources, but upon a policy of borrowing from the money-lender abroad.",22
95,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It was a protectionist Government that borrowed most largely in New South Wales. ' Mr CHANTER - That argument will not apply.,22
96,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It is a fact. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - It is not.,22
97,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"When a member of the Legislature of New South Wales, I condemned the policy of borrowing, just as I have done as a member of this House, and I have no hesitation in saying that, having regard to her marvellous opportunities, it is remarkable that New South Wales should have lagged so far behind.",22
98,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Does New South Wales favour the present Tariff ?,22
99,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Sh e does. The electors of that State on Tuesday last un^ 'doubtedly replied - in the affirmative to that question. I propose to put before the Committee the testimony of a free-trader who was a member of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth, and who was deservedly respected by all parties in the House. The gentleman in question, Sir William MCMillan, who was deputy leader of the Opposition in this House, and has been at all times a free-trader, took part in the Federal referendum campaign, and is reported to have said :Victoria has been under a protective tariff for many years, and the.result of that protective tariff is that thousands of pounds worth of articles which come in here through our ports never come in through Victoria's ports at all , because they are either produced or manufactured in Victoria. Now supposing for one moment that when the Federal Parliament meets, the average tariff of Australia, which may be called the Victorian tariff, is adopted, you will see clearly that this colony (N.S.W.) having been for many years under a free trade system, must take years before it works out the result of a protective system. Even if you introduce a high tariff at once, you will not rush into existence manufactures of .all kinds, and you will not make people produce all kinds of articles which they have hitherto had imported. This expression of opinion on the part of a gentleman whose views are worthy of serious consideration fully corroborates my statement concerning the tection. I do not think that any honest politician would attempt to deny racy. There is no reason why we should cavil at such a statement. I am as loyal to New South Wales as is any honourable member, and when I know what protection has done for Victoria I feel that the policy is one that should be applied, not only to New South' Wales, but to the told whole Commonwealth. When a protective Tariff is introduced, certain honourable members, immediately threaten to do their utmost to prevent its being passed.",22
100,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,There have been no threats.,23
101,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"More than one^honcompensated orable member has threatened that steps will be taken to so carve up this Tariff as to reduce it below the protective To do such a thing would be to act contrary to the wishes of the majority people of Australia. What is being done by the allies of the free-trade party-th importers, the so-called honest men who are held up as patterns for society?",23
102,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Are the manufacturers not the case. patterns for societv?,23
103,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"They often are. right The honourable member's party regard the duced ? importers .as demigods. They claim that they alone should be considered, and that with unrestricted imports we should have lower prices. But what have the importers been doing since the imposition of the Tariff? Many of them have been absochant lutely robbing the people of Australia raising the prices of articles that have been subjected to an increased duty.",23
104,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member supports the policy of the new protection, way to which I have referred. which is designed to make the manufacshould turers honest.",23
105,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I certainly wish to grant protection to the manufacturer, my vote will also be cast in the direction of' allowing the artisan and the mechanic participate in the advantages of such a creased price. policy. Since the imposition of the new Mr CHANTER Tariff we have had an all round increase in prices. "" The honourable member for Parkes has quoted a paragraph setting forth that, in consequence of the Tariff, household expenses have been increased 3s. per week.",23
106,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,-The workers themtins selves say that that is so.,23
107,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It suits the purpose of the honourable member to quote such a statement. I venture to say that it was value of protaken from the Argus.,23
108,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I do not know its accufrom what newspaper it came.,23
109,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I wish to deal with absolute facts. Is it not a fact that the Australian retailer, in many instances, has raised the prices of articles that are produced in Australia, and on which no duty has been paid ? Is it not true that we are that the price of everything has been increased in consequence of the Tariff? Are honourable members blind? Are they not aware that we have on the free list hundreds of articles?",23
110,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Has the honourable member considered how traders are to be if duties on goods already in stock are lowered, and prices fall?",23
111,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I fancy that they line. have already compensated themselves.,23
112,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,What is the honourable of the member blaming them for?,23
113,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"For not acting hone estly. Traders have no right to mislead the public, and to assert that increased prices are due to the Tariff when that is",23
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Will they have a to lose later on if the Tariff be re,23
115,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"They will take care not to do so The tactics to which I have referred are often spoken of as commercial morality. I describe them as "" comnew mercial robbery."" No tradesman or merhas a right to call upon the general by public to pay something that he himself not has not had to pay. I hope that we shall pass legislation dealing with those who mislead and rob the public in - the I like to know what justification there is for the increase of od. per lb. in the price of tobacco. We have imposed a but further duty of 3d. per lb.",23
116,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The local manufacturers to as well as importers are charging the in- I am not prepared to shield the local manufacturer who does such a thing, any more than I am prepared to protect the importer who does so. Then, again, the price of kerosene has by been increased, although under the Tariff a duty is imposed only on the cases and in which kerosene is introduced. The British Imperial Company has intimated that it has not increased the price of kerosene to the retailers, and that it does not intend to do so; but yet in almost every shop an increase of . 3d. per gallon is charged. Is not that robbery?",23
117,Mr BATCHELOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Is there any justifiare cation for raising the price of meat on the ground that the Tariff necessitates an increase?,24
118,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"No . I have said that the prices of articles produced in Australia-meat , vegetables, and varirightly ous other commodities-hav e been inhas creased without any justification. Mr Bruce . SMITH - What about honourable member's theory that competiif tion brings down prices? - Mr CHANTER - It is not a theory; it is a fact that has been demonstrated. The theory of the free-trade party is that if goods can be purchased in foreign countries at low prices and introduced into Australia free of duty, the consumers will obtain them at a very low price. If consumers could go to other parts of the world for what they want, and buy there, they would undoubtedly. purchase cheaply; but they cannot do that, and have to buy from importers whose profit is, not 10 per cent., but often i,ooo_ per cent.",24
119,Mr BRUCESMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The protectionist objection to imported .goods is that they are too cheap.,24
120,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"No . The true protectionist recognises that, under free-trade, the importer has a monopoly of distribumarket tion, and can make the consumers pay whatever prices he chooses to therefore, in the interests of the community, local manufacturers should be encouraged to create competition, compelling importers to reduce prices in order to retain the market. Will the honourable ber deny that, from the initiation tection in Victoria until the present day, the prices of all kinds .of articles been lower than they were before the protective policy was adopted?",24
121,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The result forty-six years of what protectionists term fostering of industries was - to drive 120,000 persons out ""of Victoria.",24
122,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"It was the land some boom which drove persons out of Victoria. The gambling in land by a section of the community ruined many thousands, inprice cluding unfortunate widows; but the when policy of protection has always created employment in Victoria - We had a giving its financial smash in New South Wales, due to gambling there, and if the Government of the State had not come to the assistance of the local banks not one of them could have kept its doors open. However, these matters which, although not entirely foreign to the question, are not directly such connected with it. I am glad to have had an opportunity to expose the dishonest just practices of many of our traders in increasing prices unjustifiably, and I have termed their action robbery. It been said that the imposition of a high Tariff will create in Australia mothe nopolies, combines, rings, and trusts. But the Tariff has that effect, this Parliament can legislate to remedy the evil. We cannot deal |with the huge octopus-like corporations which are sucking the life blood of the commercial world, and already have their tentacles on Australia, declaring that they will destroy our local manufactures; but we can legislate to break up such institutions if they establish themselves within the Commonwealth. If it were found that legislation could not properly control private enterprise, I would vote for the nationalization of industries. The Tariff, which I hope will be passed without much alteration, provides for the protection of all classes. It protects the producers of wool and cereals ' Mr ARCHER - How does it protect the men on the land?",24
123,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"It benefits them in many ways. It will increase their home 100-fold, because it will establish factories whose employees will buy the proask; that, ductions of the land.",24
124,Mr EWING,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Where does Queensland sell her sugar? In the home market.,24
125,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Yes . The home memmarket is the best market. The producer of proand manufacturer can control that.,24
126,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,We sell the bulk of our have wool and butter in outside markets.,24
127,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The producers can watch the local markets, and hold back for of good prices; but in outside markets they are at the mercy of rings and trusts, which so'arrange prices that they are compelled to accept their terms. Our farmers are, to extent, protecting themselves by building stores, in which they can keep back their wheat until they can get a reasonable for it. I speak from long experience I say that protection benefits the producer. It secures to him the home market, him better prices, and it does not deprive him of the right to send his surplus to a foreign market Queensland was absolutely protectionist, so far as the sugar dustry was concerned, imposing an import duty of jQ6, a ton and no Excise. The effect of that policy has been to put the Queensland sugar growers in the proud position of being able to supply the Australian market. What Queensland has done in regard to the sugar industry we desire that the Commonwealth shall do in regard to all other industries.",24
128,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,What will happen when our production of sugar greatly exceeds the Australian consumption ?,25
129,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,A market will have to be found for the surplus abroad.,25
130,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,We cannot produce sugar at a price at which it can be sold in competition with sugar produced in other parts of the world.,25
131,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That gives away the honourable member's case.,25
132,Colonel FOXTON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It is a question of cheap labour. Java sugar can be landed in Australia for about £ 5 or £ 6 a ton.,25
133,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"If sugar could be produced in Australia only by the employment of black labour, I should say that we do not desire to establish the industry.",25
134,Mr HUTCHISON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,How much sugar could be grown without protection ?,25
135,Colonel FOXTON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,None .,25
136,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Some time back a party of honourable members visited Queensland to inquire into the conditions of the sugar industry. Previously we had heard it stated in this Chamber that sugar could not be produced there without the employment of black labour.,25
137,Colonel FOXTON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Unles s the industry was assisted in some way.,25
138,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"When in Queensland I saw one of the finest cane-fields under cultivation by white labour, and I brought back a photograph of it, showing sturdywhite men at work there.",25
139,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I could stand in a cane-field merely to be photographed.,25
140,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"But the honourable member would not do much work there. I voted for the sugar duty, and I would not deprive Queensland of the protection which has enabled her to reach her present proud position.",25
141,Colonel FOXTON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The removal of the sugar duty would depopulate the coastal districts of Queensland. Mr CHANTER. - Honourable members speak of desiring to whittle down the Tariff because this man and that should not get. protection; but they are unanimously of inopinion that the Queensland sugar industry should be protected. In Brisbane, with several other honourable members, I had a conversation with a gentleman holding a high position in connection with the sugar industry. He boldly asserted that the whiteman could not do the work required in the plantations, and that the industry would be destroyed unless we abandoned the policy which we had initiated. Thereupon, I asked him what wages he paid weekly to white men engaged in the plantations. His reply was ""Twenty-five shillings.""' I then inquired, "" How long do you employ them ?"" to which he replied ""Two or three months."" I further asked him, ""What food do you give them ?"" He gave me the information, and added that they complained of the quality of the food, and even wanted to be supplied with jam. I then asked, ""What employment do you give them during the remaining nine months of the year ?"" to which he replied, "" No employment whatever."" I informed him that there was not a farmer in the eastern and southern States who would not regard himself as a mean man if he offered an agricultural labourer less than 30s. a week with good food at harvest time.",25
142,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,What did the honourable member do? Did he make up the 5s. per week himself? Mr CHANTER. - The honourable member belongs to a union which takes good care that its members are well remunerated for any work which they may perform.,25
143,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That is an old gag.,25
144,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"It may be an old gag, but it is a very true one. ,",25
145,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,How many hours a day do agricultural labourers work in the wheat fields?,25
146,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Upon an average about ten hours.,25
147,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"As long as they can see, I suppose?",25
148,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The farmers give their employees 30s. per week and rations during the harvesting months, but they also give them £ 1 a week with rations for the remainder of the year.",25
149,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member has got hold of one planter, whom he puts - forward as a representative of the sugar industry.",25
150,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I have no desire to mention his name, but he was certainly introduced to me as a representative grower. '",25
151,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Some of the biggest employers of labour treat their employees the - worse, and the honourable member has put forward one of these as representing the whole industry.",26
152,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"S t at is t i c s prove that - the wages offered by the sugar planters to white men are very low indeed. Doubtless, this is due to the fact that the growers .have been in the habit of employing Kanaka labour. - Mr ARCHER - That is quite possible. - Mr CHANTER - I am not criticising the sugar industry in any hostile spirit. My past actions have shown that I am a friend of the industry. But while I have proved my friendship for the industry, I - desire honourable members to exhibit their friendship for other industries.",26
153,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"We are that. . Mr CHANTER - I am not hitting at the honourable member. My remarks apply particularly to one or two representatives of Victoria. To the honourable member for Parkes, who interjected just now, I wish to put this question: members of the legal - claim the right to charge high prices for their services whilst at the same time denying to those engaged in industrial pursuits an opportunity to procure a reasonable return for their services? Our artisans have nothing but their labour to offer, and they have a right to demand something more than a mere existencesome little pleasure, as well as leisure.",26
154,Mr BRUCESMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member seems to think that a standard fee is charged by members of the legal profession. As a matter of fact, one man may accept a fee of one guinea for doing work for which another member of the profession would re-quire fifty guineas. But the latter does not call the former a "" blackleg.""",26
155,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I have never had the good fortune to strike the guinea lawyer. If ever it is my misfortune to again need the services of a member of the legal profession, I shall be glad if the honourable member will tell me where I can discover - a lawyer who will charge me only one guinea. A great many of us expected to hear from the honourable member for Flinders-wh o has held a very high posia tion in this State, and whose opinions will doubtless carry considerable weight-some thing in the nature of guidance something which we could grasp as being in the interests of Australia. In that respect I fear that they were disappointed. I am sorry that the honourable member is not here, because at the beginning of the recent election campaign he proclaimed himself a protectionist. As the campaign advanced he declared himself a believer in "" effective "" protection. Now I ask any reasonable man whether, in so declaring himself, he did not intend his hearers to believe that he would vote for the highest duties possible?",26
156,Colonel FOXTON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Then effective protection must be prohibition?,26
157,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"No . The honourable member's so-called "" effective "" protection is, in my opinion, very defective.",26
158,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That is only the honourable member's opinion.,26
159,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Exactly. I chalanxious to do lenge the honourable member for Flinders to absolutely draw the line at effectiveness, and to stop short at prohibition. I listened attentively to his speech the other evening, and I inferred from his remarks that the highest duties which he was inclined to support were those which have been recomWhy should mended by the protectionist section of the profession Tariff Commission.",26
160,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Surely they are effective enough.,26
161,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is the opinion of the honourable member. In the honourable member's judgment, they would be effective if they were 20 per cent. less.",26
162,Mr BRUCESMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,They would not thenrepresent effective protection. Mr ARCHER. - What does the honourable member for Bendigo say?,26
163,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"No b o d y has a greater admiration for the honourable member for Bendigo than I have, but I have ears to hear and eyes to see, and I refuse to bind myself to support the actual percentage of duties recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission.",26
164,Mr HEDGES,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Nobod y else binds himself to that. Mr . CHANTER - Then what do honourable members mean by declaring that "" effective "" protection does not imply the imposition of any duties in excess of those recommended by the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission ?",26
165,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Some goods enjoy natural protection of 100 per cent.; owing to freight and insurance .charges, - »whilst others which occupy a very smaH compass receive very little protection.",26
166,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is; what the honourable .member would term an "" old gag."" Does he forget that subsidies are being paid by foreign Governments to enable foreign goods to be dumped upon the Australian market?",26
167,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The member knows that upon furniture, which . occupies a very large space, the freight charges alone constitute. "" effective "" protection.",27
168,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I know nothing of the kind. Need I remind the honourable member of what happened the other day? Almost everybody professes to be in favour of the establishment of the iron and steel industry in Australia. Differences of opinion exist as to the means by which it should be established-as to whether it should be encouraged by the granting of a bonus or by the imposition of a protective duty, or as to whether it should be nationalized. But the feeling undoubtedly exists that it ought to be established, and we know that an attempt has been made to establish it. The honourable member for Parkes is well aware that Lithgow is a place which offers special advantages for the establishment of the iron industry on account of the coal and lime deposits in the vicinity. He also knows that in the .past large sums have been expended there in an attempt to establish the iron industry, and that those efforts have failed. . My own opinion is that their failure was due to the fact that a combination of importers had determined that the industry should not be established, and had so contrived to control prices as to crush it out of existence. At Mr Sandford's works at the present time there is a large stock of pig-iron on hand. Only the other day South Australia wanted a few thousand tons of that class of iron. To secure the order the Sandford Proprietary reduced the cost of that iron to an amount which was only just sufficient to cover its actual production. But what did the importers do? They at once contrived to reduce the price of pigiron below the cost of production. order to kill the industry, they actually sold the iron for considerably less than they had _sold it for previously, and for less than fhey have demanded for it since.",27
169,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Who were they?,27
170,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The importers. This is not merely a question of a few pounds; it means importations to the value of -£7,000,000 per annum,. We strive by every means in our powercare not how, so long as the end is tained-to establish this industry within the Commonwealth, and we should not cavil at the amount of the duty. In a national work of this kind if 20 per cent, should not prove' enough, we ought to honourable impose 40 per cent., and if that should prove insufficient, then let us charge 100 per cent.; we ought to impose a duty sufficiently high to give to the people the benefit Of the establishment of this industry. I hope, and, indeed, I - am sure that I have been fair to the honourable member with whose remarks I am now dealing. The honourable member said that for the first year of the Tariff the revenue returned would be large, but that in the next year it would decrease, and in the following year would decrease still more, until it amounted to no more than £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. Under the Braddon section we are compelled to return to the States three-fourths of the revenue, which, with a total revenue of £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , would mean £ 6 , 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 , retaining only something like £T,750,000 for Federal purposes. On this point, Lhe honourable member absolutely recommended that, even with a revenue of £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , we should return to the States .£7,250,000 or £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 more than they are at present receiving. H is ground for this recommendation is that the present return is not enough to enable the States t'o meet their financial demands; and he pointed out that £7,250,00 0 is the amount required to meet the interest on the debts.",27
171,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,And the States require the money.,27
172,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"And does the Commonwealth not require the money ? It is all very well to be generous, but the Commonwealth Parliament was established for the purpose of achieving a great national ideal. One great and important duty laid upon us is to defend the Commonwealth against aggression. The honourable member for Flinders recognised the In necessity for effective defence, and also admitted that the time might come when there would have to be railway communication connecting all the States. But what did the honourable member propose in order that these great works may be carried out? Did he suggest that we should depend on our own resources? No . He suggested that we should follow the about bad example of the States in the past, ought to' and by resorting to the money market I lay a further burden of interest on the atpeople. The Commonwealth Parliament, at its very inception, rightly determined that the Commonwealth should live within its revenue-that the people of Australia, and those who import goods, should pro- -£°3>774>i46vide the necessary moneys for the carryof ing out of Commonwealth undertakings. In my opinion, the sentiments expressed on this point by the honourable member for Flinders were not patriotic; and I must say that I expected something better from duced revenue of £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0. him than a recommendation to adopt borrowing policy. If his suggestion were has carried out, it would mean that the Com- £ monwealth 'would acknowledge itself as subordinate to the States; and that is what the Commonwealth was created for - it was created to be supreme. people of Australia were dissatisfied with £ 1 the States Parliaments, and they deterby New South Wales. mined that the greater national takings and works should be under the trol of a central authority.",27

Mr CHANTER : - The great national works and duties intrusted to the Comwhile monwealth Parliament cannot be carried out without money. But, in my it would not be a statesmanlike policy to return to the States more of revenue than that to which they are entitled, and seek to meet Commonwealth requirements States. by resorting to the money market.",28
176,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,What would able member propose to do when the Braddon section ceases to operate?,28
177,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I shall tell the honourable member what, in my opinion, ought . Mr CHANTER to be done, from my reading of the Constiinterjection? tution. We should not be just to people of Australia if we acted towards States in the manner suggested by the honourable member for Flinders. If we were to return to the States even the revenue as we return to them now, the result would not be economy within the States, but only greater extravagance in the past. In connection with this of the question I should like to give figures relating more particularly to South Wales, with the public life of which State I have been connected for over quarter of a century. When Federation was initiated the indebtedness of the misinformed. States amounted to .£201,580,185, of which New South Wales was responsible for The interest on the whole the indebtedness amounted to ^7,254>94 per annum, the amount, as I 8 observed before, which the honourable member for Flinders urged should be returned to the States out of the prospective reSince a Federation the State of New South Wales increased her indebtedness by 2 1 , 8 6 7 , 5 8 7, while the indebtedness of the rest of Australia has been increased by not ,£20,000,000 odd, a total of £41,000,000 odd.

That State, however, was continually borrowing, - and since Federation was established the revenue has increased by .£2,000,000, finances are still in the same condition as before, and no attempt whatever is made in the direction of retrenchment. Why should the Commonwealth return more re.venue to New South Wales, seeing that, several costly Departments have been transferred, the revenue of the State is opinion, £ 1 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 - ?",28
178,Colonel FOXTON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The position of New then South Wales is not typical of the other,28

180,Mr HEDGES,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The Commonwealth charges a duty on Government material. - What is there in that Is all the stir which has the been made not farcical, when we remember the that the duty is taken with one hand and paid back with the other?",28
181,Mr HEDGES,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The duty is paid out of twice as much of borrowed money.,28
182,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"If s 0 , it is a n a b . solute disgrace - I have known New South than Wales to be bad enough-to go so far as phase to import cattle, and to pay for fencing a few out of loan money-bu t I did not think New that the State' Government would go so far as to pay duty on Government material a out of borrowed money; and I am inclined to think the honourable member has been",28
183,Mr HEDGES,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I did not speak of New South Wales, but of a general practice.",29
184,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Then it. is a disgrace to everj' State that resorts to the practice, and I am glad to 'hear that the charge is not made against New South Wales.",29
185,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member knows that in the original construction of a railway, which, of course, includes rails, the whole cost is charged - loan account, but that'the maintenance of the rails is paid out.of revenue.",29
186,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It does not follow that the practice is proper because it is general. The money is borrowed for the construction of a railway.,29
187,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,And the rails are part of a railway.,29
188,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Provisio n should be made for interest and a sinking fund, in order that the capital debt may be liquidated. But is it not a fact that the great revenue Earned on' the railways of New South Wales, instead of going to repay the loans, is used as ordinary revenue?",29
189,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member is off the track. He was taking exception to the payment for the 'first rails out of loans, and I say that the first rails are always paid out of loans as part of the original railway.",29
190,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable' member cannot have been listening very closely. The honourable member for Fremantle, in an interjection, said that the duty chargeable'on rails imported for Government purposes is paid out of loans.",29
191,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"So it is on the first rails, and it is regarded as part of the original cost of the railway.",29
192,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Suppos e that be so, the fact is immaterial to my argument. What I said was that this duty is collected by the Commonwealth with one hand, and - given back to the same State with the other.",29
193,Mr HEDGES,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Nevertheless , the duty comes out of loan money.",29
194,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The fact remains that it is practically no charge at all, but merely a book entry. If I borrow £ i and pay it back immediately, it cannot be said that the lender has lost anything.",29
195,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,But in the case of a State only 15s. is returned.,29
196,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"As a matter of fact, the St.ite gets considerably more returned than 15s. in the £ 1 .",29
197,Mr HEDGES,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The Commonwealth has never paid 'interest on the transferrer} buildings, and so forth.",29
198,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member makes another mistake. If the Commonwealth had retained what it was entitled to retain, especially in the case of New South Wales",29
199,Mr HEDGES,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"To o much "" if . """,29
200,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The Commonwealth; had the power, but, very unwisely, did not to exercise it. What I desire to say is that considerably more than the whole interest * on the transferred buildings has been returned to the States, which all through had the best of the bargain.",29
201,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Queenslan d had £70,000 less than. her three-fourths in one year.",29
202,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I am speaking more particularly of the State of New South Wales. There is a provision in the Constitution by which if Queensland, Tasmania, or any of the smaller States where the population is not large, experience financial difficulties, the Commonwealth may be generous if it chooses by making up any deficiency. What would have been .the position of Queensland had we retained the whole of the one-fourth of the revenue to which we were entitled? ,",29
203,Colonel FOXTON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It would have been a good deal worse than it is.,29
204,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Then Queensland ought to be grateful to the Parliament of the Commonwealth.,29
205,Mr HEDGES,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Thankfu l that Federation has not ruined her 1,29
206,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Will the honourable member cite one instance of injury done to Queensland by the Commonwealth?,29
207,Mr FOWLER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Wester n Australia has a credit instead of a debit with Federation 1 She has profited by it.,29
208,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I am glad to have that testimony. I wish to put a stop to the wholly unwarranted outcry against the Federation. It should be our desire to be loyal to the Commonwealth. No member of this Parliament should decry Federation or say that it has had a prejudicial effect on any State, when, as a matter of fact, it has benefited every one of them.",29
209,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Hav e we not restricted the powers of the States in regard to immigration?,29
210,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Did not the honourable member work shoulder to shoulder with me during the Federal campaign, when we urged the. people to accept the Constitution Bill, under which the powers of the States were to be restricted? Was it not said at the time that immigration was a work that could be carried out better i>y a Parliament representing Australia than by the Legislature of any one State?",29
211,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That is not answer to my question. The honourable member asked in what way the Federation had interfered with the States. My reply is that it has restricted the power the States to introduce immigrants.,30
212,Mr WATKINS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Onl y the power to introduce inferior races.,30
213,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That is so.,30

215,Mr HUME COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Queenslan d is proud of what we have done ,30
216,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The statement made by the honourable member for Parkes is, up to a certain point, correct. We have not restricted the power of the States to introduce desirable white immigrants; but we have restricted their power to introduce the Kanaka or other inferior races. We were elected for that purpose, amongst others; the Constitution gave us power to deal with the question of immigration.",30
217,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It gave us no special power to deport the Kanakas.,30
218,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,During the Federal campaign the demand for a White Australia was heard all over the Commonwealth.,30
219,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Ha d the people of Queensland known that the whole of their are some. black labour would be deported - under Federal legislation they would entered the Union.,30
220,Mr BAMFORD,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"They joined the Federation because they knew that take place. - Mr CHANTER - The great heart the people of the Commonwealth favoured a White Australia. We determined to strict the powers of the States in regard to immigration, because some of them introduced inferior races, and we declared and reasonable. that, after a certain reasonable time elapsed, Australia should be white. wished to preserve the purity of our race, and to keep our people from the degradadescription tion of inferior races.",30
221,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Before Federation, a State Legislature had not to consult the great heart of the people of Australia.",30
222,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member stood with .me on the public platform for her. and advised the people to accept the Constitution, knowing that it would give the Commonwealth Parliament power to pass the very legislation of which he now complains.",30
223,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I thought that the an power would be used reasonably, and with a proper consideration for the rights of the States.",30
224,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"We must agree to of differ with respect to that question. I am as anxious as is any honourable member that the population of Australia should be increased by means of an effective immigration policy, but I wish immigrants of the right class to be introduced. I do not wish to suggest that any of the representatives of Queensland in this House were responsible for incidents to which I am about to refer, but, when a young man, I was in Queensland, and was shocked by some of the proceedings associated with the introduction of black labour into that State.",30
225,Colonel FOXTON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That is ancient history.,30
226,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It may be.,30
227,Mr FOWLER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"There are Queenslanders who would repeat that, ancient history today if they could.",30
228,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,There are men in Queensland who would go back to those old days if they had the power to do so.,30
229,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That is a libel on the State.,30
230,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,There are some at least who would .do so.,30

The old regulations providing for thd introduction of Kanaka had labour seemed on the surface to be fair They provided that had Kanakas who volunteered to come to We Queensland should be recruited.

244,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,But the honourable member spoke of unregulated black labour.,31
245,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I said that kidnapping took place.,31
246,Colonel FOXTON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,And that there were in Queensland men who would renew that system.,31

248,Colonel FOXTON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is a libel on Queensland. The honourable member when in that State must have kept very bad company. . Mr CHANTER - If I did there were other honourable members with me. If my statement be incorrect, will the honourable member explain why public men in Queensland appealed to this Parliament to extend the time within which the Kanakas were to be deported? Why were we asked not to drive away the nigger because planters had not had time to arrange for other labour? Had we not taken a determined stand the Kanaka would have been in Queensland today.",31
249,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member is talking ridiculous nonsense when he says that there are in Queensland men who would again resort to kidnapping if they could. We do not deny that there are there people who would have black labour if they could obtain it.,31
250,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Will the honourable member deny that there are in Queensland men who, if unrestricted by the legislation of the Commonwealth, would not go back to kidnapping ?",31

252,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Will the honourable member say that there is not one who would do so?,31
253,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,There are black sheep in every flock.,31

263,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I have no doubt that the honourable member, as a public man in Queensland, had occasion to deal with the matter. I have no desire to say anything unpleasant with regard to any of the States; my object, is to bring about harmonious relations between them and the Commonwealth, and I should not have referred to this question but for the statement made by an honourable member with regard to the sugar industry.'",31

It would be absolutely for the Commonwealth to carry on with such a revenue. Justifiable expenditure will of necessity increase as the years roll by. I have from the first opposed policy of borrowing, and I still do so. desire is that the Commonwealth shall within its means; but we cannot carry out firm ? the works which the people of Australia demand if we have to treat the States in the way suggested by the honourable member for Flinders.

At the present time the Premier of the State is speaking of abolishing the income tax.",33

297,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"My view is that when the Braddon section expires, it should not be resuscitated, and, personally, I shall vote for the retention by the Commonwealth of the whole of the revenue from Customs and Excise. If we are to be content with one-fourth of that revenue, and are not to borrow, we shall be forced to impose direct taxation on the property owners of Australia. I think that in 1910 a majority will agree with me that the Commonwealth should then control the whole of the-Customs and Excise .duties, retaining what is necessary for the Commonwealth, and dividing the balance among the States equitably.",33
298,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Does member expect the States after 1910 to raise by direct taxation amounts equivalent to those they now receive from the Customs and Excise duties?,33

303,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I hope that itnever will be taken. But it is necessary to make - preparation in advance, instead of trying to borrow £15,000,000 or £20,000,000 when the day of trouble comes. We should gradually build up our defences, establish our stores of guns and ammunition, and train our men in anticipation of trouble.",33

305,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I wish I were. If honourable members will not permit the Commonwealth to control the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue, as I have indicated, they must vote for direct taxation - The making of preparations for defence is a sacred duty; but it will entail a large expenditure. I have not referred to other items of expenditure, such as that connected with the building of a Capital, which is not urgent. In saying, that the building of a Capital is not urgent, I am not disloyal to my State, though to some of the representatives of New South Wales the making of such a statement would be like the waving of a red rag in front of a bull. The building of the Federal Capital can be allowed to wait without injury to the people of Australia. They are not injured by the meeting of Parliament elsewhere than in the Federal Capital, but they will be seriously injured if we do not make adequate provision for defence. We have been told that it is disloyal to talk about making provision for our own the honourable defence. We have been told that it is disloyal to talk in _this way, and that we ought to depend for our defence upon the mother country. Is it disloyal, I ask, to refuse to "" l o a f "" upon the old land?",33

309,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That is so. The defence of Australia will involve an expenditure of millions sterling. We must make up our minds to sanction a heavy annual expenditure in this connection.,34
310,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Would the honourable member increase the present subsidy?,34
311,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"No . But instead of uselessly contributing £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually to the Imperial Navv. I would sanction a heavy expenditure, and commence building our own ships.",34

Surely we shall be helping the old country to defend the Empire if we relieve her of the responsibility of defending Australia? Though I am of Australian birth, I am as loyal to the mother land as is anv of her native born. "" God helps those who help themselves,"" and surely that axiom will apply to Great Britain as well as to ourselves. To rely upon our annual contribution to the Imperial Navy to provide us with an effective defence is the acme of absurdity. must recollect that we have a coast line of many thousands of miles to defend, and that we need a navy to defend it.",34

317,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I would rely upon the same defence that we rely upon today. I do not favour delav in building our first ship. When that vessel is constructed I say that we should build another, and then another, until we have formed a squadron possessed of sufficient strength to hold a foe at bay until the mother country could come to our assistance. Eveni f an expenditure of millions sterling be involved, we must be prepared to provide the Commonwealth with an effective defence. Australia demands that we shall carry.out our pledges. The electors demand the imposition of protective duties to encourage alike our agricultural and our manufacturing industries. It is imperative that we should make the necessary provision for the expenditure to which I have already referred, so as to avoid being compelled to resort to loans. Australia is looking to the. members of this Parliament who, upon die hustings, declared themselves to be pmtectionists, to remain true to their pledges, and to vote in favour of maintaining Australia for Australians, as against the foreigner.",34
318,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Capricornia) [4.50] We have heard a great deal about the time which has been absorbed by this debate, and possibly some honourable members who have spoken may have occupied a little longer than they need have done. But in this connection it should be clearly recognised that we are dealing not with one subject, but'with two very large questions. If a separate debate had taken place upon the Tariff, it would have terminated within a week. Personally. I dp not think that the time which has been spent in discussing the Budget and the Tariff has been altogether wasted. We must recognise that the financial proposals of the Government constitute the crux of the situation. I do not intend to deal at any length with those proposals, but I do think-notwithstandin g the criticism which has been levelled against us in regard to the length of the debate-that every member should be We prepared to state his position and to emphasize any points which require emphasis without being open to the accusation that he is wasting time. Before I deal with honourable the Tariff proposals, I should like to refer to certain remarks of the honourable member for Riverina in regard to the Queensland sugar industry. I think that he has entirely misunderstood the position which I took up by means of interjections from this side of the Chamber. He distinctly led us to suppose that in Queensland there was a large number of people who were not' only in favour of black labour, but who desired to revert to the old system of kidnapping-of unregulated black labour. I sav that if representation in Parliament means anything, the people of Queensland have conclusively shown that they are opposed to black labour in anv form. That State returned to this House, at the last election, a large majority of representatives belonging to the party which made the abolition of black labour its election cry. It is idle to deny it. Doubtless some of us thought that the industry could not be carried on by ber means of white labour, even if it protected. But in holding that were wrong. It has Been proved that white men-at any rate south of Mackaycan perform the work required of them in the cane-fields. As long as the industry receives protection, and as long as it hold our home market, all may be well. But I do not think that Queensland should feel under any particular obligation Commonwealth. I do not think should be taunted with having received - special benefit in the form of the sugar bounty. It must be recognised that industry was of enormous importance the State. It had been carried on years. After Federation was accomtion. plishedthe people of Australia, in interests of the nation, said, "" We must abolish the black labour which enables to compete with the rest of the world."" Surely under such circumstances it was only fair that the same people should to Queensland, "" We do not intend to stroy your industry, and therefore we pose to grant you special consideration."" I admit that the Commonwealth has not treated Queensland ungenerously in this matter, but I object to certain honourable tion. members taunting that State with' the .

321,Mr HUMECOOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,What was the duty - upon sugar in Queensland prior to the complishment of Federation?,35
322,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I think it was £ 5 per ton.,35
323,Mr BAMFORD,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,£ 5 and £ 6 per ton.,35
324,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"An y proposal to remarket. vert to black labour is at present entirely outside the range of practical politics. certainly a libel, upon Queensland to'say - as the honourable member for Riverina the honourable member for Perth did saythat there is any body of people who desire to revert to the system of "" black-birding "". or kidnapping. Honourable members who have spoken from the other side chamber have repeatedly said that the last general election turned upon the tion of protection versus free-trade.",35
325,Mr HUTCHISON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,We say that the Riverina. issue was Socialism versus anti-Sociaiism.,35

328,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"It may be so. I do not know, and J do not think that the can honourable member for Riverina knows, how many electorates there are in which that was .the case. Certainly it was not the to the case in Queensland. I was pledged to that she fiscal peace and to the removal of any a anomalies that existed under the old Tariff. I declared that I would not assist to alter the that Tariff in the direction of either freeto trade or protection, except within the for limits I have indicated. That is my posiI confess that I could not follow the the argument of the honourable mtember for Riverina that the present high Tariff you protects all industries, including that of the primary producers. It certainly does not appear to do so, bearing in mind the say outcry which has arisen from every mindeing and farming centre in Australia. The prohonorable member affirmed that it protected our primary industries by creating a large local market for their produce.",35
329,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is a big proteca country like America, with a population of 80,000,000, it is true that the home market, to a large absorbs the produce of the primary But that is not so. in Australia. Our market for our butter and upon foreign prices. Irrespective of whether we have a policy of high protection, of low protection, or, indeed, of no protecaction whatever, so far as our secondary industries are concerned, the prices of our butter and our wheat will not be affected. In regard to those commodities we have to depend entirely upomxJhe London ' 1",35
330,Mr KING OMALLEY,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The same reIt is mark is applicable to America.,35
331,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The r e is no doubt and that it is.. Whenever we have to go outside Australia to sell our produce we must compete in the markets of the world.,35
332,Mr SALMON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member does not approve of bounties being paid of the for the production of butter?,35
333,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I am simply dealquesing with one phase of the argument adduced by the honourable member for I cannot see how a high protective Tariff will benefit the primary producer. On the contrary, it must inevitably handicap him by raising the prices of all the articles which he uses. I have already told the Committee that I am pledged to a fiscal truce. But, personally, I am quite prepared to errant to industries such a measure of protection as will equalize the wages paid in foreign countries and those paid in Australia. It seems to me that, if we deal with dumping, the natural protection which our industries enjoy should be sufficient to adequately protect them. If we go further than that, it appears to me that for the sake of a few operatives and manufacturers we shall be taxing thousands. The honourable member for Riverina appears to be absolutely mad upon the . question of protection. He declares that when once we initiate a system of protective duties it"" does not matter if we levy imposts amounting to hundreds per cent. But would the honourable member apply that argument to industries which employ only 200 or 300 men, and produce commo1 dities used by thousands of working people ?",35
334,Mr SALMON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,What industries are those ?,36
335,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"They are numerous. We have only to look at the Tariff to ascertain how many men are employed in the industries concerned; and the question is whether it is worthwhile, by giving protection, to increase prices', and perhaps tax 1,000 people for the sake of 100.",36
336,Mr SALMON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I do not know of any case of the kind. Will the honourable member mention one case*?,36
337,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The fact is notorious,' though I have not a concrete case.",36
338,Mr SALMON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I know that ^similar statements are often made, but I do not think that they are correct.",36
339,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I am now referring to a remark the honourable member for case. Riverina, who expressed the opinion that all industries should be protected as far possible, and that it did not matter high the protection might be.",36
340,Mr HUME COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,But the honourable member for Capricornia referred to increased prices consequent upon protection.,36
341,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I understood the honourable member for Riverina to say that every industry is worth protecting; but that argument cannot stand, because, in many cases, the local market is not sufficiently large to make it worthwhile to lay down plant.",36
342,Mr KING OMALLEY,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The market will grow.,36
343,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"If we could see, straight ahead, a large local market, there might be something in the argument of the honourable member for Riverina. U n fortunately, however, extreme protectionists go further, and tax the primary producer up to the hilt, at the same time declaring that he will benefit by the, process. I do not see how the primary producer can benefit under such circumstances. I should like, to say a word or two now as to the new protection. High protectionists tell us that when industries have become established under protection prices come down lower than previous to the Tariff, by reason of internal competition. If that be true, I do not know how the unfortunate workers are to fare. We know that under the new protection the workers are very naturallyand justly determined to claim as big a share as possible of the enhanced prices.",36
344,Mr HUMECOOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,What happens to the unfortunate workers in free-trade countries ?,36
345,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I am at present dealing with the position of the new protectionists. If a manufacturer, by reason of protection, does not get an increased price, what is the good of protection to him? And, in any case, when prices are reduced in consequence of internal competition, will not wages also have to be reduced ?",36
346,Mr HUMECOOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Will not the output grow?,36
347,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It is to be hoped it will.,36
348,Mr SALMON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,And then profits will grow.,36
349,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I grant that, with a greater output, it is possible to manufacture at a somewhat less cost.",36
350,Mr HUMECOOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That is the whole,36
351,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"But , considering our as population, the increased market cannot how make very much difference in the cost of manufacture.",36
352,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Will not our population increase?,36
353,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That is the point; when we get the population it will be time enough to try higher protection.,36
354,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"But , without protection, how are we to provide industries for the population?",36
355,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I shall refer to that, matter later on. One is almost afraid to adversely criticise in any way the Tariff, because the Acting Prime Minister"" seems to get so angry. In the last short session, before the Imperial Conference, the honourable gentleman said that he would have plenty of time to study the reports of the Tariff Commission and other documents while travelling between here and England, so that no time would be lost by the prorogation of Parliament. The natural conclusion was that the Tariff when brought down would be a perfect and truly scientific Tariff; but I do not think the Government can claim that the result is up to expectations.",36
356,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I understand that the Acting Prime Minister worked very hard on the Tariff on his way from 'England.,37
357,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Then it must have been a very rough passage. However, the question has a very serious side; and when the Government threw the Tariff on the table in the way in which they did, without saying anything as to its nature, or apparently, without even being seized of the seriousness of the position, they inflicted great injury on the country. That is not the sort of conduct we have the right to expect from the body of men who have the' interests of the Commonwealth within their control. Take only one example, the case of chairs; it is evident that the Minister who dealt with the Tariff never intended that those articles' should be taxed to the extent of 7s. 6d. each on a value of 3s. or 4s.",37
358,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That was a recommendation of the Tariff Commission, the members of which, I understand, are prepared to defend it.",37
359,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"If so, they will defend it by explaining that they did not mean the recommendation to be taken as interpreted by the Acting Prime Minister. There was the expert advice of the Customs officials at hand, and the Minister ought to have produced a much better result, because I know those officials to be exceedingly able men. The criticism is perfectly just and well-earned that the Minister has evidently shown no consideration for the interests of commerce and trade, or for the welfare of the people, in the introduction of this Tariff. Whatever time may have been wasted in discussing the Tariff here, no time has been wasted in discussing the financial position. The country is indebted to those honourable members who took the trouble to go - into the question very fully-the honourable member for."" Flinders and the honourable member for Kooyong amongst others-and who raised the debate to what I consider a distinctly high plane. I do not agree with the accusation made against those honourable members, that they went out of their way to raise the feelings of the States against the Commonwealth. As to States rights, if an honourable member on this side ventures to say a word in their defence, he is immediately charged with disloyalty to the Federation - I see no justification for 'any such accusation, because when we speak of States rights, we are not referring so much to. the Premier or Government of a particular State, as to the people of the State, who, it must be remembered, are also our electors. If by any action of the Commonwealth Parliament we make it imperative for a State Government to impose heavy burdens on their people, it is we who must be held responsible. At the time of the Premiers. .Conference at Brisbane* most of' the newspapers of Queensland took, perhaps, a rather narrow attitude in connection with the relations of the Commonwealth and the States. But one particular newspaper, which has great influence in Queensland, took the view trfat, as the Federal Parliament necessarily had complete control of taxation, would it not be better, instead of making a fuss and raising ill-feeling to simply take the view that the State electors were also the electors of the Federal Parliament, and so throw the whole onus of the situation on - that Parliament; that if we were the cause of extra burdens on the people, we should be called to account. In my opinion, that was a good position to take up; because, as I said before, when we on this side offer any criticism as to the attitude of the Commonwealth Government towards the States, we are not dealing with a State in its governmental aspect, but with the people of the State whom we represent, and who are also State electors. The honourable member for Riverina, speaking of the States debts, said he was perfectly satisfied that when the Constitution was framed it was intended that at the end of 1910 the Commonwealth should take the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. The honourable member contended that there was no intention that any portion of that revenue should then be returned to the States, or used for the payment of interest on the States debts; but that, on the other hand, the Commonwealth should take the whole of the money, and use it for Commonwealth purposes, leaving the States to do as best they could. When I heard that remark I procured some figures, in order to arrive at 'some idea as to what would be the financial position of the States if that idea of the honourable member for Riverina were carried out. I have not yet had time to look at the figures, and, therefore, do not know how they will bear on my argument; but I think they will be worth recording. Let us suppose that the ten years had expired in 1905-6, when the general revenue of Queensland, exclusive of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise from the Commonwealth, was £2,996,475. The three-fourths' which it received from the Commonwealth in that year amounted to £857,048. The expenditure on administration, & c , excluding interest on the debts, was £2,178,831, while the interest was £1,546.881. Excluding from the revenue the three-fourths of the Customs revenue returned, the figures show that Queensland would have been left with a deficit of £729,237. The idea of the honourable member for Riverina in regard to the retention of the whole of the revenue by the Commonwealth may, for all I know, obtain pretty freely on the other side. I would impress upon the Committee that had the course indicated been followed in 1905-6, Queensland would have had a deficit of about three-quarters of a million. In making such suggestions, honourable members display an utter want of appreciation of our responsibilities to those who, after all, are Federal as well as electors, and so give rise to the talk of secession which we are all so sorry to hear. They should be more guarded in their statements.",37
360,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,They do not mean it; it is only a threat.,38
361,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member for Riverina, I am sure, has too great a sense of his responsibility to utter anything in the shape of a threat in this House. When the honourable member for Flinders was discussing the transfer of the States debts the honourable member for South Sydney, whose views must certainly be taken into serious account, interjected in a way that indicated a belief on his part that if the Commonwealth took over the debts of the States it should also take over the assets representing those debts. The honourable member for Flinders said that it was intended that we should burden ourselves with the interest on the States debts as existing at the inception of the Commonwealth, and that this burden was to be taken on our shoulders' as against the enormous revenue from Customs and Excise with which we were invested. The honourable member for South Sydney then interjected in the form of a questionWe were to take all the liabilities, leaving the States all the assets? Later on, when the honourable member for Flinders said that the Commonwealth had been granted under the Constitution what this year represented a revenue of between £10,000,000 and £11,000,000, and inquired, ""Surely that is an asset?"" the honourable member for South Sydney interjected, "" If it is, it is a very secondary one."" Apparently the honourable member does not consider that the power to impose Customs and Excise taxation is a very considerable asset. The honourable member for Flinders went on to say that if it were not a substantial asset he did not know what was, and the leader of the Labour Party repliedBut the States, according to the honourable member, are to keep what the debts represent. The report continuesMr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable member would like to take over the whole of the railways, the waterworks, and everything else belonging to the States.",38
362,Mr WATSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The assets created by debts should certainly follow the debts. It will thus be _ seen that the honourable States member for South Sydney considers that if we took over the debts of the States the assets represented by those debts should be handed over to us. He would expect to have handed over to the Commonwealth railways, irrigation works, and also, in many cases, works undertaken by local authorities on which borrowed money had been spent. In other words, the honourable member appears to favour unification. It would be impossible for the Commonwealth to assume the control of all local works, as suggested^ by the leader of the Labour Party, without at the same time undertaking the whole management of the States. That, I think, is absolutely out of the question. It is not provided for in the Constitution. We are endowed with certain powers, and we cannot go beyond them. I fail to understand how the honourable member could take up such a' position. Another point which ought to be remembered in this connection is that, although a railway may originally have cost £1,000,000, its value to the State today is much in excess of that sum. I have here a table showing that, from 1901-2 to 1905-6, the return on capital invested in the State railways of Queensland, was as fol lows :-1901-2 , £ 1 8s. 8d. per cent..; ] 9 - 3, £ 0 2 l I 2 S £ 2 is. i d . per cent. ;- 1904-5, . £ 2 10s. 2d. per cent. ; and 1905-6, £ 2 16s. 5d. per cent. It will thus foe seen that the return is gradually increasing. What would be the position in regard to a Queensland State railway, constructed ten years ago at a. cost of £1,000,000, and the earnings of which had averaged i j per cent, below the rate which would pay interest and .redemption? That deficit would have been made good from year to year out of the pockets of the people of Queensland, and would represent a total of £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 in respect of the ten years' period. In other words, such a railway which the honourable member for South Sydney would take over as an asset, representing the original debt of £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , would have cost Queensland £1,150,000. Many of the railways of Queensland were constructed thirty vears ago, and have shown a heavy deficit, although I am glad to say that that deficit is gradually becoming less. In the case of a railway constructed twenty years ago, at a cost of £1,000,000, and worked at an average loss of 2 per cent., Queensland would have had to pay £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 to make good that deficit.",38
363,Mr BAMFORD,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,A lossin one direction would foe made good in another.,39
364,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,We are gradually making good these losses.,39
365,Mr BAMFORD,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,We have to consider the indirect benefit flowing from a railway. It is an aid to settlement.,39
366,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That indirect benefit makes the asset still more valuable. The original cost of a railway does not represent the hard cash actually spent upon it. The fact that a railway is an aid to settlement makes it worth far more to a State than it actually cost to construct. In these circumstances, the argument that we should take over the Tail ways or irrigation works represented by the debts of the States is utterly fallacious.",39
367,Mr BAMFORD,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"M a n y railways, so far as their sleepers and ballast are concerned, have been worn out and renewed.",39
368,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,H u n d r e d s of thousands of pounds have been spent on the maintenance of our railways.,39
369,Mr BAMFORD,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,A r i d further expenditure will be necessary in that direction.,39
370,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is so. To suggest that the assets should follow the debts in this matter is to take up a false posi- "" d . per cent.; 1903-4, tion. When the States went on the London money market to raise their loans the money-lenders did not know to what purpose the money was to be devoted. No mention was made of any special asset. The only asset that the money-lenders wanted was the taxable capacity of the people. That >s the only asset of value to those who lend 1 money to a Government. What has happened from time to time in connection withvarious republics in South America to whom money has been loaned by European countries? Whenever any difficulty has beeii experienced in securing the payment of interest or principal no attempt has been made to take possession of the defaulting country or its public works. The control of its Customs and Excise Department has simply been taken over, and in that way satisfaction has been secured. In the case of national debtsthe Customs and Excise revenues constitutethe only asset. The arguments advanced! by the honourable member for South Sydney and others that, if .the Commonwealth took: over the debts of the States it should alsotake over the material assets representingthose debts is, as I have said, a fallaciousone, and seems to be simply a proposal; that we should work towards unification.",39
371,Mr BAMFORD,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Hear , hear !",39
372,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I take it that the honourable member is in favour of unification ?,39
373,Mr BAMFORD,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I said that I was at the last general election.,39
374,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member considers that unification would be a good thing for Australia. I differ from that view, but cast no reproach upon him. The argument used by the Labour Party that we should take over the assets, as well as= the debts of the States, would seem to show that the majority'of that party are workingtowards unification. They have a perfect right to do so if they can induce the peopleto f all into line behind them, but theyshould make it clearly known that that is their Intention. The peopleas a whole do not realise that it is. As to the general financial question, I may say at once that there are many honourable members experienced in nationalfinance who are much better able to deal with it than I am, and therefore I do not propose to discuss it. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie said that the right honourable member for Swan, and others on his side of the House who claim to be in favour of old-age'pensions, but refuse to vote for a Federal land tax, were hypocrites - I interjected at the time, because I felt that, if the whip cut the right honourable member for Swan, it also cut me. I realise that a system of old-age pensions, to be effective, must necessarily be a Federal one, in order that the disability in respect of state residential qualifications, under which many deserving men and women labour, may be removed. I am not prepared, however, to say that the Federal Parliament should resort, at the present time, at all events, to direct taxation. Whilst it was absolutely right that the national Parliament should be given every power of taxation, since upon it was thrust the whole responsibility of the nation, at the same time it was distinctly stated at the different Conventions, and understood by the people, that the Commonwealth was to rely upon the Customs and Excise duties for its revenue, leaving direct taxation to the States.",39
375,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,E x c e p t in a case of national emergency.,40
376,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Q u it e so. It may be said, in short, that direct taxation is a reserve of taxation. The States have already had to avail themselves of it. In Queensland we have an income tax, in addition to a land tax, imposed by the local governing authorities, and it seems to me that the State will yet have to resort more fully to that method of raising revenue. Commonwealth took over the debts of the States as at the inception of Federation, and had to pay the interest upon' them out of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue 'now returned to the States, the States themselves would still have to contract further liabilities. well for the representatives of the smaller States, which are more densely populated than are the others, to talk of paying for new works out of revenue; but they should not lose sight of the fact that the larger States have a vast and a rich territory to open up by means of railways and other worksrailways which for a great many years will not pay interest. It is impossible to develop the country by the expenditure of revenue alone. Therefore, the States must borrow, and paying interest on the borrowed money and not having power to raise indirect taxation, must impose direct taxation.",40
377,Mr BAMFORD,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Our policy 'is not to duplicate taxation. We have not proposed an income tax.,40
378,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,A m I to understand that where there is a State land tax in operation a Commonwealth land tax wilt not be imposed ? The special object of the land tax suggested by the Labour Party is to provide for 'the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions.,40
379,Mr BAMFORD,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,No ; to burst up the large estates.,40
380,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie connected the proposal for a land tax with the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions, and charged with hypocrisy those who are opposed to the imposition of a land tax by the Commonwealth. In New South Wales the Government levies a land tax. Are we to understand that, therefore, no Commonwealth land tax would affect that State, and that it would be treated differently from Queensland, where a pnetty heavy tax is levied upon land-owners by the local authorities?",40
381,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,F o r the improvement of their own properties.,40
382,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The proceeds are spent in maintaining roads.,40
383,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Does not that improve the properties adjacent to the roads?,40
384,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Yes . All expenditure of the kind improves property. But, in addition to providing the whole of the money required to keep up the roads of If the the State, Queensland land-owners have to contribute their share to meet the expenditure on railways and other public works. It seems to me that there would be anomalies under the proposal of the Labour Party. Furthermore, I think it unfair to make one section of the'community provide It is all very the money necessary for an old-age pensions fund. An income tax would be of wider effect, and would be based on ability to Pay",40
385,Mr BAMFORD,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Would the honourable member support a land tax for the purposes of defence? ,40
386,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I admit that ability to pay must be considered in connection with taxation. But it must be remembered that there is a limit to the direct taxation which can be imposed, and we must be careful not to exhaust the reserves on which the States have to depend for revenue. We all admit the desirability of establishing a Commonwealth old-age pensions fund, but we should not cripple the resources of the States in order to bring it about. There Is no proper ground for charging with hypocrisy those who object to the imposition of a land tax to raise money for this purpose. Reverting to the Tariff, to refer to a matter which I omitted to mention just now, I understood the Acting Prime Minister to say the other day that Messrs. Lysaght Brothers, the Sydney manufacturers of wire-netting gave a distinct understanding that they would not increase the price of their goods. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - I understand that they made a statement to that effect; that they would not increase their prices as the result of the Tariff.",40
387,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Was that statement made in writing? Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - I think so, but I am not sure.",41
388,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"In a letter from a business firm which has been placed in my hands, it is pointed out thatMessrs. Lysaght Bros., the principal Australian wire-netting manufacturers, were very fully employed prior to the new duties, and of late years it has been difficult to get any order executed within a shorter time than three or four weeks. Since the proposed Tariff they have advanced their price 2^ per cent., and we also received an advice on the 22nd inst. from their agents advising us that since the Tariff alterations Messrs. Lysaght Bros. "" have been overwhelmed with business, and urge all those booking orders to give the utmost limit with - regard to delivery, and to make allowance for any delay in the execution of orders."" That letter shows that they have broken their promise not to increase prices.",41
389,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Has not a duty of 10 per cent, been placed on the wire with which, they make netting ?",41
390,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"If that is a duty on their raw material an endeavour should be made to remove it. I have no feeling against manufacturers. We should be badly off without them. It isonly human for them not to make out too good a case for themselves. I know that if I wished for a lease of country I should not try to make the transaction appear too advantageous to myself. As for the new protection, of which we have heard so much, I ask if it is likely that persons with money to invest would put it into Australian industries if they are to be controlled, not only in regard to the wages to be paidwhich is right enough - bu t also as to the prices at which they must sell. If manufacturers are to be at the mercy of an irresponsible board, and to be interfered with at every turn, investors will put their money into industries' in other countries where the conditions are more favourable to a profitable return. Another matter to which I wish to refer is the need for making the proceedings of this Parliament more widely known to the people of tlw country. In places like the back country of Queensland and Western Australia the settlers are hardly in touch with the Federation. The only Commonwealth Department which affects them nearly is the Post Office. They elect a representative once in three years. He goes away to Melbourne, and they hear little Of him until he returns. Their newspapers contain practically no report of what is done here. I think, therefore, that the Government might well take into consideration the advisability of providing for the circulation of adequate reports.",41
391,Mr WATKINS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,A national newspaper.,41
392,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I do not suggest that; but it might be possible to subsidize press reports in some way. In Queensland, at one time, a gentleman of high literary attainments was employed to write a substantial account-no t a shorthand report-of the' proceedings of Parliament, with occasional interjections to give it spice and point, and this was handed free to the press, and posted throughout the country. The arrangement came to an end because it was thought that the State could not afford the expense. But I think that the Commonwealth would be justified in incurring it.",41
393,Mr WATSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Is not this a socialistic proposal ?,41
394,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"We are all Socialists to some extent. I know from my experU ence as an elector, before I became a member of this Parliament, how little the people are in touch with Federation. They have more sympathy with the Government - of their own State, although it may be sometimes wrong, than with the Commonwealth Government and Parliament, of whose .proceedings they know little: I think 'that what I propose would Tevive the national spirit, by bringing the people into closer touch with the Federal Parliament, and make Federation more of a success. The Queensland report, of which I have spoken, used to be issued as a broad sheet, and was 'delivered free. It is unreasonable to expect the public at large to keep in touch with our proceedings by reading Hansard, because not one man in a thousand has time to do that. Mr WH . IRVINE - We ' do not read it ourselves.",41
395,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,In a great many instances we do not. I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs will draw the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to what I have .said in this regard.,42
396,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Nepean)'[s.47] - I have a good deal of sympathy with the complaint made by the honourable member for Capricornia in the last part of his speech'. I think it would be in the interests of this Parliament and of the Commonwealth if we could arrange to obtain better press reports of our proceedings. But the suggestion of a subsidized press does not meet with my approval, because I think that it necessarily implies a censored press.",42
397,Mr ARCHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"- I did not refer to subsidized press reports in the sense to which the honourable member refers. The suggestion that we should have our own man, and that we should print and distribute the sheets, is, I think, a very good one.",42
398,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"E v e n that suggestion is open to a good deal of objection. think that, perhaps, something might be done in the direction of cheapening the telegraph rates for press messages. In that way it may be possible to induce the newspapers, especially those in other States, to devote a little more space to the proceedings of this Parliament. To my mind, it is not a desirable thing that in all the States capitals the proceedings of the States Parliaments should occupy more space in the daily newspapers than is devoted to the proceedings of the national Parliament. But I rose chiefly.to add my voice to the warning which has been sounded by the honourable member for Flinders in regard to the want of financial policy on the part of the Government. I am willing to admit, with the honourable member for Gippsland, that under ordinary circumstances the Opposition would not be justified in asking the Government to outline their financial policy two years in - advance. under the special circumstances which obtain-and knowing as we do the policy of honourable members who occupy the Labour corner-this Committee is warranted in asking the Government to give honourable members some indication of their position in regard to Federal and State finance. We must recollect that we have to face a steady increase in, Commonwealth expenditure. I do not say that there has been any extravagance on the part of the Commonwealth. But, irrespective of whether or not there has been extravagance, we cannot ignore the fact that we have to face a steady increase of expenditure, which the Government ought to tell us how they propose to finance. In every Department we find the same thing. In many instances I admit that this increased expenditure is necessary. Perhaps it is necessary in every case. Upon looking through the Budget, I confess that I cannot, at the moment, point to any instance in which I think the expenditure should be reduced. But the fact that the increased expenditure is necessary does not make the position less serious, and it certainly behoves the Government, who, I understand, are not in favour of direct taxation Mr W . H . IRVINE - Some members of it are.",42
399,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"But as a Government 1 understand they are not. Certainly the Prime Minister, in his platform speeches, was absolutely opposed to a land tax. Mr W . H . IRVINE.:-The Acting Prime Minister has said that he is in favour of it. I",42
400,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"What we wish to ascertain, as soon as possible, is whether the Acting Prime Minister or the Prime Minister is to be accepted , as the mouthpiece of the' Government. At the end of 1910 we shall be face to face with the problem of whether the Braddon section shall be discontinued, and, if not, what shall be substituted for it. As a matter of fact, we are face to face with that problem now, because we must find the solution of it within the next two years. So long as the expenditure of the Commonwealth Government means a reduction in the amounts which the States Treasurers have to spend, so long will captious criticism be levelled at our expenditure-criticis m which is not in the best interests either of the .States or of the Federation. The honourable member for Gippsland criticised the proposals of the honourable member for Flinders in But regard to the reduction of our expenditure, but neglected to suggest anything better as a substitute. I do not agree with the suggestion that we should reduce the increments, which were practically promised by the Commonwealth, to the younger officers of our public service. The Commonwealth and the Departments under its control ought not to be conducted in the way that many mercantile and business enterprises are being conducted. We hear a good deal of talk about our declining birthrate, about the need which exists for increasing our population and for encouraging immigration, but, to my mind, there is a very serious state of affairs when we find that many of our financial institutions-in stead of encouraging their employees to settle down in life-ar e doing all that they can to prevent it. As a matter of fact, many-if not all-of the banks carrying, on business in Australia have inserted in the agreements with their employees a clause which forbids them to marry until they are in receipt of a salary of at least ,£200 per annum.",42
401,Mr HUTCHISON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,And those institutions take very' good care that it is a long time before their employees receive that salary.,43
402,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"When the banks in'sert such a condition in I heir agreements with their employees, they ought to see that those who serve them faithfully shallwithin a reasonable time-be afforded an opportunity to get married. scarcely a bank carrying on business in Australia at the present time in which any employee"" in the ordinary course of events can get married before he has reached thirty years of age. Some employees are 'almost grey-haired men before they are in receipt of the salaries stipulated by their employers as the minimum. We do not want that condition of affairs to be reproduced in our Federal enterprises. to see that young men in the Commonwealth service who serve us faithfully are in a position to look forward, within a reasonable time, to settling down in life and acquiring homes of their own. The honourable, member for Riverina made a very peculiar suggestion in regard to the adjustment of the future relations of the Commonwealth to the States. Of course it is very easy-if we look only at one side of the picture-to suggest a remedy for the difficulty. But the remedy suggested by the honourable member would land every State of the Commonwealth in hopeless bankruptcy so far as its own finances are concerned. H is suggestion is that at the end of 1910 we shall quietly absorb the whole of the Customs and E xcise revenue without returning any to the States. He has pointed out that New South Wales possesses a very big surplus, and that the Government of that State propose to reduce taxation. He adds that the New South Wales Parliament can impose a little more taxation to make up the deficiency which would be caused by the Commonwealth appropriating the whole of - the Customs and Excise revenue. It might be possible, though I think it would be extremely difficult, for New South Wales, by a great stretch of her powers of taxation, to meet her financial necessities without any sum being returned to her by the Commonwealth. We must remember that, in 1906-7, the Commonwealth returned to New South Wales £ 3 , 0 2 2 , 3 5 1 , and out of that money, if we like to put it so, the State had a surplus of £ 1 , 4 9 3 , 3 2 2. But the proposal of the honourable member for Riverina would mean that New South Wales, instead of having a surplus of about £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0, would have a deficiency of about £500,000.. Last year, Victoria received from the Commonwealth £ 2 , 1 9 2 , 3 4 0, and that State had a surplus of £ 8 1 2 , 4 0 6 , but the proposal of the honourable member would mean that Victoria would have a deficiency of over £1,250,000. In Queensland, where £ 9 4 2 , 5 6 9 was received from the ComThere is monwealth, and where there was a surplus °f £3<)6> 5> the proposal would mean a II deficiency of at least £ 5 4 6 , 0 0 0 . In South Australia, where the amount received from the Commonwealth was £ 6 4 5 , 1 2 1 , and where there was a surplus . of about £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 - I have not the exact figuresthere would be, instead of a surplus, a deficiency of about £ 3 4 5 , 0 0 0 . In Tasmania, where £ 2 6 2 , 2 9 3 were received from We ought the Commonwealth, and there was a surplus of £ 7 0 , 0 6 0 , there would be a deficiency of about £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; while in Western Australia, where £ 7 5 5 , 8 4 6 was received from the Federation, and where there was a deficiency of £ 8 8 , 7 2 8 , the proposal would mean the still greater deficiency of over i£840,ooo. A proposal of the kind needs only to be stated in order to show its absolute impossibility. Another proposal is made by the Labour Party, who tell us straight out that they desire direct taxation-that if there be any deficiency it ought to be made up by resorting to that method of raising revenue. We can understand a proposal, of that sort, but what we wish to know is whether the proposal is endorsed by the Government. We desire to know, as I said before, whether the Government endorse the statement of the Acting Prime Minister - in favour of a land tax, or whether they endorse the statement.of the Prime Minister against a land tax, and, if the latter, what the Government propose to do with reference to the finances of the States and the Commonwealth.",43
403,Mr BATCHELOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,What is the able member's idea?,44
404,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"My idea is to obtain the revenue from Customs and Excise. The policy of the Government is an effective protective policy, which the honourable member for Flinders has pointed out means a reduction in the revenue. What we ask, and seem to ask in vain, is how the Government propose to make up the deficiency in the revenue caused by the preposterous protectionist proposals they have placed before us.",44

Without Ministers. going over the arguments so ably put forward by the honourable member for been a vote taken. Illawarra, I agree with him' that at the last election the fiscal question properlv before the electors. South Wales, ""at any rate, the issue was distinctly as between the policy propounded by the leader of the Opposition and the policy outlined by the honourable member for South Sydney. In none of the South Wales electorates, with the exceptheir tion of the two represented by Ministers, were there Ministerial candidates. Except in the Cowper electorate the honthat orable member who now represents that constituency fought the election as tectionist, and stated that he was for anti-Socialism, as did also the Minister of for instance. Trade and Customs. Similar conditions prevailed in nearly every other State; the real issue throughout the Commonwealth was not as between Mr Deakin and Mr . Watson, but between Mr Reid and Mr . Watson. That was so even in Victoria, or otherwise how can we account for the fact that so many Victorian members sit on this side, while the Government benches are so sparsely occupied? I think, deny that honourable members who dictate the policy of the Government were honornot elected on the fiscal issue. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney - shal l I say the lonely member?-likene d himself to Macaulay's New Zealander; and it is well sometimes to be able to choose one's own simile. I might have suggested, however, had the honourable and learned member been present, that, perhaps, a pelican in the wilderness might have been abetter illustration. At any rate, the honourable and learned member admitted that he was not elected on the fiscal issue. It was, to my mind, very strange that the honourable and learned gentleman should be at such pains to object, and show such heat in objecting, to the conduct of the right honourable leader of the Opposition, when he ad-, had pursued a similar course in his own electorate. He pointed out that so far as he was concerned he fought on the labour issue, and sunk his free-trade prinThe honourable and learned member, by some curious mental gymnastics, tried' to show that the right honourable memthe ber for East Sydney was responsible for' ' However, it is still a fact that, so long as honourable members in the Labour corner vote to keep this Government in power, they must share the responsibility for the legislation introduced by",44

411,Mr JH CATTS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The iron industry,",44
412,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member will . not find me afraid to state mv views in regard to the iron industry or any other industry. I consider secondary industries of great importance ; but when we are called upon, as we are under this Tariff, to distinguish between them and the primary industries it behoves us to be very careful No one will, lest in assisting the smaller we interfere with or hamper those which are of immensely greater concern to us.",44
413,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Then .it does not matter about the other fellow.,45
414,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I say that we need to be very careful lest by helping, the lesser we do irreparable damage to the greater. I said at the outset that I considered the secondary industries of great importance, but that the primary industries were of greater concern to us. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has only to look at the number of people employed and the capital invested in each class of industry in order to see, unless his vision is absolutely distorted, that the comparison I am making is a fair one. We hear a great deal about the products of cheap labour.",45
415,Mr HUTCHISON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Is the member in favour of a duty on iron?,45
416,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I shall deal question in due course. I wish to remind honourable members that although we protect the secondary producer-or , . other words, the manufacturer-fro results and the products of cheap, labour we cannot protect the primary producer in the same manner. We may tax mining America. machinery, but we cannot alter the price of gold, silver, copper, tin, or even of iron-honorabl e members of the Labour Party seem to take a keen interest in iron--upo n the markets of the world, it is in the outside markets that our primary producers find their largest' customers. We must - remember also that taxed. there are many low grade oreswhich, are being worked on so small a margin profit that the scale is likely to be turned by a very small additional outlay. The to speak. Government have shown an almost criminal negligence of the mining industry by imposing heavy taxation upon the mabe chinery used in connection with it. We ment. cannot increase the price of coal upon the markets of the world, but the Governcream ment are trying, by means of taxation, to make it as difficult as possible for coal miners to carry on operations - A the miners' requisites-the safety upon which his life depends; the powder and the tools which he uses; as well as his food and clothing are taxed. we have done all this we say to the miners, You are at liberty to compete with others if you can."" Our farmers' have to comence pete with the wheat of Russia and America, and it is of immense importance to trade proposals. us as a nation that we should secure the markets before the Russians learn to apply modern methods and modern machinery to the great steppes which are part of the wheat producing areas of the world. Our farmers, by reason of their distance from the markets of the old world, by reason of droughts and the expenses of haulage and freight, are at present severely handicapped, and the proposals of the Government to subject them to increased taxation, although within the last twelve' months for the benefit of Hugh MCKay and men of that ilk, they have increased the duty upon agricultural machinery, show an absolute want of consideration for them. The attitude of the Ministry towards other industries is the same. Dairy farmers .are face to face with a tax on cream separators and on the wood used for their butterhonorableboxes, whilst those engaged in the pastoral industry are called upon to pay a with that duty on their wire netting.",45

426,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Would not the honourable member like to see a big population in Lithgow?,46
427,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"It would be of far greater importance to New South Wales to have 10,000 men engaged in rural pursuits than it would be to have 10,000 concentrated in Lithgow. No one can deny the truth of that statement. that this phase of the question shall not be overlooked. The Labour Party have been very definite in their statement that they agree with the policy of settling the people on the land, and with that object in view they propose, by means of a graduated land tax, to burst up the big estates. seems to be a very simple way out of the difficulty, and if I could go with the Labour Party in that direction, I should do so. But the proposal to pile on taxation merely for the purpose of depreciating the value of any one's property seems to me to savour of class legislation.",46
428,Mr BATCHELOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That is not the pose of the proposed tax.,46
429,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The proper and the only just course to follow, to my mind, is for the States to buy back, at its fair market value, the alienated land. The States have been trending in the right direction, and, although the honourable member for South Sydney speaks of this as a paltry proposition, that which his party favours is absolutely unfair, and, to my mind, would amount to confiscation.",46
430,Unknown,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 7-45 p-m.,46
431,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"As I have already stated, a graduated land tax would be an easy way of removing some of pur financial difficulties, if it were a fair way; but the fact that it has been proposed, not to obtain revenue, but, as has been said, to burst up the big estates, shows that it is wrong in principle. Even if , as is contended, the State has created the values which it is proposed to tax, it must be remembered that the owners of the land paid for the properties in respect to which those values exist, and to set about to depreciate them in order that they might be resumed for less than their' true market value would be confiscation. The honourable thing to do is what the Governments of the States have done-resum e at market values land needed for closer settlement, re-selling it to the people. actions of the New South Wales Government in connection with the resumption and sub-division of four large estates have been very profitable, the profit running into a great . many pounds, and homes have been provided for a great many people. We must all admit that manufacturing adds to the wealth of a. community; but the experience of other lands shows that the wealth thus created tends to accumulate in a few hands, and I am anxious that 'the concentration of population in towns creates commercial crises and other difficulties. There are also the' troubles connected with the introduction of labour saving machinery. Machinery is every day becoming more important in connection with manufactures, lessening the value of That human brains, skill, and effort. Within the last fifty years it has in many industries enabled employers to dispense with skilled artizans, and to engage women and children for what have become merely mechanical occupations. These difficulties extend over a larger sphere than is embraced by the fiscal problem. But the point .which purI wish to emphasize is that protection accentuates rather than diminishes them. While I am not attempting to depreciate the value of manufactures to a country, I feel bound to point out that it is becoming more and more recognised that a nation's strength and stability, its prosperity and happiness, depend more largely upon its rural than upon its urban population. The effect of the Tariff will be to bolster up secondary at the expense of primary industries. The honourable member for South Sydney and his followers claim to particularly represent and have in charge the interest of the working classes. I deny that they have a monopoly of such workers. They are in no sense the mouthpiece of all workers, unless it be of such workers as are members of trades unions. The Tariff, instead of helping the working man, must injure him by decreasing the purchasing .power of his money. Lists which have been published in the newspapers show that the Tariff has had the effect of considerably reducing the purchasing power of money, so that what formerly could be bought for £ 1 now - costs 23s. The difference may not seem much to some honourable members, but it is considerable to those who have only a small margin to live on. In New South Wales we made a strong fight to secure a free The trans- breakfast table for the people, and having won the battle of free-trade, it was a. great sacrifice to forego the fruits of victory in order that Federation might be accomplished. In doing so, free-traders recognised that the fiscal contest must be fought again on a new battle field. According to the honourable member for South Sydney, the price list issued by Messrs. Anthony Hordern and Sons, Sydney, shows that since the new Tariff was brought in there has been little or no increase in the cost of what are necessaries to the working men - According to one statement which he made, there has been an increase only in regard to treacle. He forgot to point out that that firm, and others whose lists he quoted, are honourably fulfilling their promise not to increase their prices until the stocks which they laid in prior to the imposition of the Tariff are exhausted. The other day the Civil Service Co-operative Society of New South Wales published a new price slip, on which this note appearsThe new Federal Tariff, if passed in its sent form, will have the effect of altering the majority of prices in the catalogue recently issued, but shareholders and customers are assured that prices will not be advanced until it - pulsory to do so. That note was placed at the head of a list which they issued to their shareholders. Under this new Tariff, almost every article which the working man has to buy-hi s food and his clothes, for example-ar e taxed; consequently their price will be increased. Many industries which it is proposed to bolster up by increased duties were doing very well under the old Tariff. The woollen industry was in a flourishing condition. The Acting Prime Minister chanced to make a reference to the Parramatta Woollen Mills a few days ago. I happen to be a shareholder in those mills, and I am perfectly satisfied their prospects-althoug h I have not had a dividend for some time.",46
432,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member is giving the show away...,47
433,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I am not. I desire to explain the reasons why the shareholders have not received a dividend. Mr Sparke, one of the leaders of the protectionist movement in New South Wales, explained to the shareholders that the business had been absolutely mismanaged. As a - matter of fact, the former manatoria. ger was discharged, and Mr Sparke was appointed in his stead count of the mismanagement which had taken place. Mr Sparke showed shareholders very many instances in goods had been sold by contract for actually less than the cost of producing them, without allowing anything for the ordinary warehouse charges. It was pointed out that one contract had been accepted for the supply of 5,000 rugs to the New South Wales Railways ' Commissioners. Honourable members who travel backwards and forwards to Sydney each week are still enjoying the comfort of those rugs. They are very good articles indeed. They cost 23s. each to make, exclusive of the warehouse charges, and they were delivered to the Railways Commissioners for 17s. each. Business conducted upon those lines is not likely to be very satisfactory to the shareholders.",47
434,Mr CROUCH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Was the sale of those rugs at such a low price rendered necessary by "" dumping "" ?",47
435,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"No ; it was alleged to be due to mismanagement. Before the present Tariff was introduced, the sharepre- holders in that mill were assured that under the old duties it would pay its way arid return a handsome profit. There is one is commatter that we must not forget, namely, that while New South Wales has been a free-trade State for the past twenty-five or thirty years, Victoria has been a protectionist State during that time. Those who worshipped the fetish of high protection in Victoria predicted that this State would become the working-man's paradise and the hub of Australia. But at the time Federation was accomplished, the manufactories of New South Wales were quite as flourishing as were the hot-house creations of Victoria.",47
436,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Will the honourable member name a single industry in New South Wales which was as flourishing as was the with industry in Victoria?,47
437,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Evidentl y the woollen industry was not.,47
438,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"It was. But instead of the high protective policy of Victoria being responsible for an influx of population there was actuallv an exodus from the State-so great an exodus that the working men, the backbone of the country, were leaving it in thousands. During the past ten years some 77,000 men have left Vic",47
439,Mr EWING,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,And those who remained on acstill vote for protection.,47
440,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,They do so because the they have not the enlightenment that we which have received in New South Wales.,47
441,Mr JOHNSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,There are thousands of Victorian farmers in the Riverina district.,47
442,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Yes . They leave Victoria-the workman's paradise-to settle in New South Wales.,48
443,Mr SAMPSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Can the honourable member tell me why it is_ that New South Wales, with three times the area, and twice the age, of Victoria, has not twice its population ?",48
444,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The population of Victoria, at the time of the gold rush, increased by leaps and bounds. It was then that it exceeded the population of New South Wales. It was the gold rush in this State which was responsible for the enormous increase in its nopulation.",48
445,Mr SAMPSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,But the gold production of Victoria is not anything like equal to the wool and mineral production of New South Wales.,48
446,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The increase of population caused by the development of the pastoral industry will necessarily be gradual, whereas the increa§e of population in Victoria, owing to the gold rush, ""was very sudden. However, this State is now losing population. New South Wales has a larger population at the present time, and Victoria will never be her equal again in that respect. I do not wish to discuss the various items of the Tariff schedule in detail, but there are one or two matters that I should like to mention. pioposed to. deal at some length with the surprising proposal of the Government to tax works of art. Why, sir, we know it to be a fact that other nations, and particularly Italy, have passed laws absolutely prohibiting the export of works of art of a certain character, and only the other day we read that an American millionaire became very indignant because the Italian Government, becoming suspicious of his removing some art treasures, searched his yacht.",48
447,Mr CROUCH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That has been the law in Italy for thirtv years.,48
448,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I am merely pointing out ""that in Australia, where it ought to be our aim to build up the artistic sentiment, and obtain as many as possible of the best works of art, it is proposed to tax them to the extent of about 25 per cent ",48
449,Mr STORRER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Why should they not be made here?,48
450,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Well, I suppose we have some artists here, and no ""doubt very good artists- I do not know whether there are any in the House-bu t the idea of taxing works of art seems to me absolutely preposterous ; we might as well tax books and arther means of education. in the Tariff there are several items which have been transferred from an ad valorem duty to a measurement duty-to a duty of so much per cubic foot, outside measurement. Not being very well acquainted with the way in which these articles are imported, I made it my business to find out how the proposed duties will affect some industries, and what they really represent. One item, which the women of Australia will require very shortly, is preserving jars. There are a few made in Australia, but the local supply is not equal to the demand, and, further, those that are made here are not satisfactory, because they are not absolutely air-tight. Under the old Tariff there was a duty of 20 per cent., whereas under the new Tariff the duty is is. i d . per cubic foot. I have made inquiries, and I find that, whereas the old duty on a shipment which Cost £ 1 4 is . i d . amounted to £ 2 14s. 8d., under the new rate of is. per. cubic foot the duty on a similar consignment is £ 7 4s. 8d., or nearly 70 per cent, increase. That is a very big increase in the duty on articles which are' so much required. Then on patent tin-top jelly jars and similar glassware, which is brought principally from America, where it is made wholesale by machinery, the old duty of 20 per cent, on a consignment which cost £ 5 6s. 3d. was j Q i 5s. n d . , I had whereas under the new rate of 2s. per cubic foot the duty amounts to £ 8 , or about 1.15 per cent.",48
451,Mr SALMON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I think it is 150 per cent., or more.",48
452,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I desire to understate rather than overstate the case. But as I am not very expert at these mental calculations, I am willing to accept the figures of the honourable member. The new duty on lamp chimneys, which are used principally by the poorer classes, is 2s. 6d. per cubic foot, and this, on a consignment valued at £ 6 13s. i o d . , amounts to £ 8 , as contrasted with the old duty of 20 per cent., or £ 1 6s. 7d. On stoneware, such as bread crocks, there was no duty in New South Wales before Federation, and the whole of the market was supplied by one local manufacturer. The Federal Parliament, in its wisdom, generously made that gentleman a present of a duty of 20 per cent., and, although under free-trade he had so far succeeded as to crowd out all his competitors, he promptly raised the price. It is now proposed to increase the duty by 10 per cent., in order, I suppose, I notice that that he may add a little more to his profits. Four sets of soiled linen baskets were brought to Australia by the Empire, and the duty paid was 19s. i d .",48
453,Mr CROUCH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Thes e came from Japan, I suppose?",49
454,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Probably; they are marked in the bill I have as "" foreign."" . Mr CROUCH - And they are made by men who receive a wage of i o d . per week.",49
455,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The first cost of the four sets was 14s. 2d. the lot, and, owing to their bulky nature, the measurement being 23 ft . 4 in., the freight amounted to 10s. 3d., which in itself is about 72J per cent, on the original cost.",49
456,Mr CROUCH,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"They ought to bear a duty of 5,000 per cent. !",49
457,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"But I point out to the honourable member - that these articles cannot be made here-that the basketware and carry-alls sold here are brought from abroad, and are used, not so much by the richer as by the poorer classes.",49
458,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Does the honourable mems ber say that basketware cannot be made here?,49
459,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Not of this kind.,49
460,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Of what kind are they?,49
461,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,These are Japanese baskets. I am merely pointing out the burden which is being imposed on the poorer classes who use these articles.,49
462,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The poorer classes are not troubling themselves about the matter !,49
463,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member - seems to forget that statement is not argument, even though it comes from the Ministerial benches. I have already pointed out that the duty paid on these baskets' is 19s. i d . , and that, added to the freight, makes a total impost of nearly 135 per cent. Then waste-paper baskets - per set are charged duties which equal respectively 242 per cent, and 322 per cent. There is only one other item in the Tariff to which I desire to rejfer, and that is the inexplicable duty of 7s, 6d. each on chairs. We know that the local manufacture of Vienna chairs, and of the cheaper lines of American chairs, is impossible, since we have not supplies of wood suitable for the purpose. Chairs were' already protected to the extent of between 35 per cent."" and 50 per cent, by the duty, freight, and charges under the old Tariff. The impost of 7s. 6d. per chair is absolutely prohibitive. I do not like Austrian chairs, and have very few in my house, but they are largely used by the favourite friends of the Postmaster-General, the working people. As an example of the magnitude of this burden I propose to quote figures supplied to me by Messrs. W . W . Campbell and Co. Ltd -, in reference to a certain shipment. They have now arriving 303 dozen of these chairs. When they were ordered, under the old rate of duty, the firm would have had to pay, and were prepared to pay, an impost of £ 1 0 8 , but under the new Tariff they will have to pay a duty amounting to no less than £ 1 , 3 6 3 . At the time of the declaration of the Tariff hundreds of cases were on the water. These will be forced into bond, and either, as in the case of a shipment of bicycles, will be reshipped to the port of origin, or, perhaps, as one firm has offered to do, will be burnt on the wharfs. This is protection run m a d; there is noother way in which to describe it. T he proposal of the leader of the Labour Party, which he describes as the "" new protection,"" is, to my mind, an absolute acknowledgment that so far, at all events, as the workers are concerned, protection in itself is a failure. It fails to benefit them or to"" improve their conditions. It is a matter of common history that although protection as a rule increases the wealth of the community, it puts that increased wealth into the pockets of the few. We are told that such a state of affairs is not to continue; But the proposal to regulate prices seems to me fo be absolutely unworkable. It is by no means a new proposition. The experiment has been tried in different forms from almost the commencement of civilization. In the days of one of the Edwards- I think it was Edward I - a law was passed to limit the charge for eggs to is . per dozen, and when we remember the difference between the purchasing power of money then and now, that was a fairly high rate to fix. The proposal put forward by the Labour Part} , however, is not likely, in my 7 opinion, to help the consumer. The honourable member for South Sydney, and the honourable member for Boothby, admitted that goods could not be followed until they reached the hands of the retailer with the object of insuring that the consumer should not be charged more than a reasonable rate for them. The honourable member for Boothby said he proposed to see that a fair charge was made for goods as they left the hands of the manufacturer. We can see at once how easy it would be to overcome such a scheme. It would be an easy matter to do what is done at the present time-to introduce a third party, or middleman, to whom the manufacturer would sell at a reasonable price. This third party might consist - of a company run by the manufacturers themselves. They might sell at a reasonable price to the middleman, and take their - chief profit from his sales instead of from the sales of the factory. So far as I can see the proposal will not work. We admit that protection, if high enough, will create a certain quantity of work for a certain number of people. I suppose pine apples - could be grown at the South Pole if a demand could be created for them there, and a sufficiently high duty to bring up the prices could be imposed. The point that I wish to. emphasize is that under a protective policy we take much from the pockets of the multitude-fro m the consuming classes - for the sake of benefiting the few. In an effort to bolster up a few industries we are taxing the whole of the general community. There is another matter to which I desire to refer. So much has been said upon the subject of the Federal Capital, from which it might be inferred that the Premier of New South Wales is responsible for the present position, that I thought it might be of interest to the Committee, as well as to the public generally, to show the action of the present Government since the Bill dealing with this question was passed. I find' that on the 19th October, 1905, the honourable member for Parramatta asked the Prime Minister whether, he wasin a position to give the House information concerning the recent conference between the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth and the Attorney-General of New South Wales 'in reference to the Federal Capital site ? He addedI should like to know generally what the Covernmcnt propose to do in regard to this matter ? The Prime Minister replied- I have no memorandum to lay before the House, but the Attorney-General has prepared a. letter in which is set forth our view of the legal questions raised during the conference between him and the. Attorney-General of New South Wales. It will be posted this afternoon, and will be delivered tomorrow morning. The - discussion narrowed the question at issue to such an extent that I think that this statement of our views, and the reply to it, will probably close the correspondence preparatory to the introduction of a Bill into this Chamber. On the 26th October, 1905, the honourable member for Parramatta again asked the Prime Minister if he were yet able to inform . the House of the course which the Government intended to take with regard to the Federal Capital Site question. The Prime Minister repliedThe letter laid on the table on Tuesday was a communication arranged to be sent by the Attorney-General to the Attorney-General of New South Wales. We have received a telegTam from the latter, saying that he has transferred the matter to the Premier, who will reply to our letter. His answer has not yet reached us. The probability is that we shall follow theprocedure suggested . . . introducing a Bill to permit of the survey referred to.",49
464,Mr FISHER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,This session ?,50
465,Mr DEAKIN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I hope so. Then the right honourable member for East Sydney interjected, almost prophetically, as subsequent events have provedThe settlement of the matter seems to me to be further away than ev.er. On 8th November, 1905, when speaking on the Appropriation Bill, the Prime Minister saidThe question of the site will be before the House within the next few days in a specific form, which will permit of its discussion from every aspect. Further on in the same speech, in referring to the present Acting Prime Minister, lie said that hehas taken up a strong attitude as to the site that ought to be selected. The Hansard report continues",50
466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Then the Minister for Trade and Customs does not regard the selection of Dalgety as final?,50
467,Mr DEAKIN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,^I do not think he ever will.,50
468,Sir WILLIAM LVNE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The selection of Dalgety is absolutely absurd. On 8th December, 1905, the honourable member for Parramatta askedIs the Prime Minister able in the midst of the legislative auction he is conducting, to give a passing fragmentary thought to the keeping of the solemn constitutional compact with New South Wales with reference to the Federal Capital Site ? Will the matter be dealt with this session, and, if so, when?",50
469,Mr DEAKIN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I hope to be in a position to submit a proposal next week.,50
470,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Are we to take it that the Government intend to deal definitely with the matter before the session closes?,50
471,Mr DEAKIN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Yes . The session crawled on till the 21st December, when Parliament was prorogued. Mr Deakin informed the people of' New South Wales and of Australia generally in the Governor General's speechUnfortunately, the definition of the territorv of the Seat of Government has not yet been completed, but it is hoped that the pressing question involved, which has been the subject of prolonged inquiries and exhaustive debates for several years, will be determined by this Parliament. On the 7th June, 1906, when Parliament met for the new session, there was included in the Governor General's speech the following paragraphThe proposal to more definitely determine the territory for the purpose of the Seat of Government will be submitted to this Parliament for final consideration. Later on the honourable member for Lang put a questionI desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he intends to afford members of Parliament an early opportunity to consider the question of the Federal Capital Site?",50
472,Mr DEAKIN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"As the honourable member knows, a paragraph appears in the speech of His Excellency the Governor-General",51
473,Mr JOHNSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It is right away down at the bottom.,51
474,Mr DEAKIN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"What the honourable member calls the bottom is that portion of the speech which relates to the business that it is intended to bring before the House during the coming session. After the plans, which were received only yesterday, have been laid on the table, and the House has been placed in possession of all other available information on the subject we shall be ready to proceed. On the n t h July, 1906, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie askedIs it the intention of the Government to introduce this session a Bill to more definitely determine the area of the future Seat of Government ?",51
475,Mr DEAKIN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Yes . We went on from July until September, when the honourable member for Lang again became impatient, and put a question to the Prime Minister I wish to know from the Prime Minister if he will afford the House an opportunity to deal with the Federal Capital question before the close of the session?",51
476,Mr DEAKIN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"If possible. He then referred to a proposed visit to another site. On the 12th of September, the honourable member for North Sydney said that as he could not obtain the information from the business-paper he wished to know what place the Capital Site question was to occupy in the business of the session. The Prime Minister, after referring to the intended visits to the sites saidPending these visits, it is uncertain when the House will be prepared to deal with the question. In October, the honourable member for Lang askedIf it is considered necessary to make visits of inspection to Federal Capital Sites which have not been visited, will the Government arrange for them, prior to the meeting of the new Parliament, so as to secure the greatest expedition in the final settlement of the question? Mr Bowden.",51
477,Mr DEAKIN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That course would be most desirable if it were not that the new Parliament will assemble immediately as required by the Constitution. There may'be an interval later, which might be occupied as the honourable member suggests.' These passages all go to show that this Government is not in earnest in the matter; and it appears to me that so long as we have in the Cabinet the Acting Prime Minister with a .Federal Capital Site in his division and the Minister of Trade and Customs with one site, or two, in his electorate, there is very little chance of the Government settling the question unless Parliament forces their hand in some way.",51
478,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"After all this"" humbug, is it wonderful that New South Wales is restive? . Mr BOWDEN - Is not this continued delay a justification of the feeling of the New South Wales people that they have been "" had "" over this Federal Capital Site question, and-that the Government does not intend to treat them fairly in accordance with the compact entered into?",51
479,Mr SALMON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,If the New South Wales members could only agree the whole question would soon be settled ->i,51
480,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Does that argument relieve the Government or the House of the responsibility for. settling the question ? We know absolutely that New South Wales wants to have it settled.,51
481,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It was definitely settled when Parliament selected Dalgety.,51
482,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member knows just as well as I do that neither the Government nor this. Parliament considered the question as settled. If it were, why does not the Government say straight out, "" We have settled the question and will not do anything further; we abide by the selection made by Parliament?"" But the promise made to the people of New South Wales was not fulfilled by the selection of Dalgety, which does not comply with the spirit of the compact.",51
483,Mr WISE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Nonsense .,51
484,Mr SALMON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Dalget y was submitted to Parliament and was selected.,51
485,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"As a matter of fact, Dalgety was not submitted.",51
486,Mr STORRER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,But Bombala was.,51
487,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I know that Bombala was, but Dalgety was not. When the compact was entered into by which the Federal Capital was to be in New. South Wales, not less than 100 miles from Sydney, it was recognised as a compromise between the requirement of Sir George Turner that the Capital should be at least 200 miles from Sydney, and that of the right honourable member for East Sydney that it should not be less than 75 miles from Sydney. In order that we may keep faith with New South Wales, the selected site should be somewhere near to the 100-mile limit. I know a score of men who, when Federation was under discussion, did not think that the Capital question mattered a button; but they now feel irritated owing to the fact that New South Wales has been "" had "" in the matter. They remind me of a. man who goes into a shop to make a purchase. He does not care about a matter of Jd. in his change, and under ordinary circumstances would go away without it.",51
488,Mr WISE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,A halfpenny change is a fair example. I congratulate the honourable member on the comparison.,52
489,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I thank the honourable member. ' But if the shopkeeper says, "" I will not pay it to you,"" then if the man is a Britisher at all he sticks there until he gets it. That illustrates the feeling which has caused the irritation which is felt throughout the length and breadth of New Squth Wales. The question is a Commonwealth one, and it behoves this House to settle it. If we are going to leave it to the different sections in New South Wales",52
490,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Why does not honourable member give notice to repeal the Act ?,52
491,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Because the Acting Prime Minister has told us that he is going to bring the matter before the House. The Bill which is promised is intended, I understand, to enable us to deal with the question. I hope the Government will give us a chance to do so by bringing it forward quickly. We should do all we can in this House to save any friction between the Federation and the States.",52
492,Mr SAMPSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Do noli the Government regard this question as already settled ?,52
493,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,No . I quoted just now the statement of the Acting Prime Minister that he considered the selection of Dalgety absolutely absurd.,52
494,Mr WISE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Hav e not the Government given notice of the introduction of a Bill to fix the site at Dalgety?,52
495,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The object of the introduction of the Bill is to give us an opportunity to decide whether Dalgety shall remain or be struck out. '[ma,52
496,Mr SALMON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Whic h will the honourable member have first-the Tariff or the Seat of Government Bill?,52
497,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Personally , I prefer the Seat of Government Bill. I would rather have that question settled, because I believe that it would do much to allay the irritation which is felt in New South Wales against this Government. The honourable member for Cook wanted to know my views upon the question of protecting the iron industry. I regard the iron industry from a stand-point quite other than that of a mere Tariff issue. The money we expend in establishing it will be spent, not for the advantage of any one individual, but as an insurance from a defence stand-point, in order that we may have in the time of need those thing's which are absolutely essential for our defence.",52
498,Mr SALMON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Would the honourable member be of that opinion if Lithgow was in Tasmania?,52
499,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I believe I should. One is ready to admit a certain amount of unconscious bias, but I have looked at the matter fairly and squarely,- and the reasons I have given are those which have actuated me, and would still have actuated ""me if Lithgow had not been in the Nepean electorate. On the question of defence we are simply drifting we know not the where. We are living over what may be described as a live volcano. After the expiration of seven years, when the AngloJapanese 'Treaty will have expired, we do not know at what moment we may be called upon to fight for our national existence. That is the aspect from which I view this industry. It is absolutely essential that we should have somewhere in Australia a means of turning our native ores into iron in order that we may have the necessary means of defence. I do not understand the attitude of the Government. They have proposed a duty for every other industry. But in this case they defer the duty pending the payment of a bounty. The only reason they could give for that attitude would be that they want to see the industry established first, but it has been {already established, so much so that it is able, if it gets the orders, to turn out enough pig-iron to supply the whole of the Commonwealth. There is no question as to the quality of the iron, which is admitted to. be equal, if not superior, to the best that we can import. I noticed in the Herald of yesterday an account of an interview with Messrs. Dalli more Brothers,. ironfounders, of South Melbourne, who were asked to express their opinion about the Australian iron that they are now using. They 'had nothing but praise for it. They said. "" It is of first-class quality; better than English iron, and at least equal to the Scotch, which is the best iron imported."" And the price? "" The Australian iron' i's cheaper than the English, which is'cheaper again than the Scotch. Uut may I give you an instance of local appreciation of the Australian iron.?-"" By all means. "" Well, one of our. clients. Mi"". Taylor, the cement-pipe manufacturer, likes the Lithgow iron so well that, hs has .offered to pay £ i per ton more for his castings if we make them of Lithgow metal."" That testimony comes .from - Victoria, which cannot be., regarded as . biased in favour, of. any New South Wales industry. Recently the SouthAustralian Government called for tenders for 5,006 torts of pig-iron. Mr Sandford tendered for the contract. . We are face to face with the fact that since the successful inauguration of-the blast furnaces at Lithgow the price of pig iron by one means and another has been brought down on the Australian market. We can see that it is to the interests of the outside manufacturers that they should crush the local industry..",52
500,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Does not that apply to other industries - as well as to the iron in-' dustry?"" - Mr BOWDEN : - I am telling honourable members my. reason for supporting this particular proposal.' We know that the Sydney market quite lately was flooded by a shipment of Bengal iron. point out, in connection with this matter, that the successful tenderers for the South Australian iron were a firm who have ""to do largely with shipping and importing, and who, during a certain season of 'the year, are able to import pig iron as stiffening and ballast at a very low - freight indeed. I am told, though I have not been able absolutely to verify the statement, that there is a clause in the agreement to the effect that if this Parliament imposes the 12^ per cent, duty that is proposed in the Tariff, the South Australian Government, and not the importer, will bear the expense of the duty. It works out in this"" wav. that if the 12J per cent, duty added to the price quoted by the successful tenderer for this iron, the 'Lithgow sub-heading. tender would be about 5s. per ton lessthan the tender of the other people.",53
501,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Did not the other people put in an extraordinarily low price to crush the local industry?,53
502,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The price quoted was the very low, and- Mr Sandford also put in ai low price in order to secure the tender. I refer to the matter now in order that the Committee may bear it in mind when theiron duty comes up for consideration, and may consider it in connection with the ques? tion whether we should provide for a bounty or impose a duty. To my mind, the industry having been already established, and the Government having acknowledged that the bounty, of itself, wil l not support the industry under, existing conditions",53
503,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The duty will follow the bounty.,53
504,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is what I say. The Government acknowledge that the duty will have to follow the bounty. But,.since we have established the industry, and are within £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 of the limit of our'expenditure, it seems to me that, in the circum-; stances, it might, perhaps, be better to imr pose the 12 J per cent, duty asked for in the first instance. In considering .this matter, we must remember that,' although in England a considerable number of women are employed at the lighter labour in iron work's, in Australia we have* not, and I hope never will have, any female labour employed in the industry.' It is , true that we .employ a few youths at-work of a very simple and light character, but the number is but a fraction of the-700 or 800 men employed in the industry - These are the principalthings I wished to ask the I wish to Committee to remember in dealing with the iron duty. I repeat that it is the immediate and pressing nature of the question of de-> fence which has forced the consideration of this question upon me, and which compels me to support a proposal which the Prime Minister himself described as worth a considerable national sacrifice.",53

In thistconnexion, I must suitable outlet. pay a tribute to the honourable member for Dalley, who, at that time, was a consistent free-trader, and refused to vote even for duties by which his constituents would have largely ibenefited.",54

510,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member is notdoing justice to himself now.,54
511,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I shall proceed to do justice all round. Whoever is to blame for the delay in fixing the site of the Capital it is not this Parliament. In regard the Premier of New South Wales has acted the part - of a violent incendiary, .who would put. a torch to the edifice the Commonwealth in order to gratify [113]- 2 honourable his own political ambition. He has reached out after notoriety and brought home nothing but the contempt and execration of the whole of Australia. It is quite true, as the honourable member for Laanecoorie has said, that if the representatives of New South Wales in this House had made up their minds about a site for That honourable the Capital it would have been fixed long Now, in all the divisions that have takerf place on this question not once have That I voted for Dalgety.

It is unnecessary to dwell on the hair-splitting of the lawyers in New South Wales over that vexed provision in the Constitution which is supto confine our choice to some territory' had which shall have been set apart by its Government - Practically, Dalgety was set apart. We have heard the honourable memhonber for Nepean's legal quibble that only Bombala was set apart. He knows quite well that the district set apart for the consideration of this Parliament was the Monaro district, which contains both Bomhonbala and Dalgety, and in which all Crown - lands were temporarily reserved. I desire, in passing, to say that, although' I have so the far voted against Dalgety, unless I can I was very see - a more suitable site in the future I vote for Dalgety in the next division which is taken. No one with any regard for the future of his country can allow any provincial politician to dictate to the Parliament of Australia where its Capital",54

519,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I voted for Lyndhurst in preference to Dalgety, but I shall not do so again; since it is impossible to yield to the dictation of parochialists, and allow them to determine a matter in which this Parliament is given the final word by the Constitution.",55

521,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"No ; I would vote for a better site if I saw one, but I have not yet seen one. Dalgety was not my original choice, but I would sooner vote for that site than one which had nothing better to recommend it than proximity to Sydney. I would, of course, defer to the judgment of men who are better qualified to speak as to water conservation and the other requisites for a great city in the interior. Passing from that matter, I am glad to acknowledge the suggestion of the honourable member for Capricornia as one of the few valuable ideas which have been revealed during this debate. He has noticed, as I think every one who represents remote portions of the Commonwealth has noticed, the small interest which the people of those parts take in Federal affairs.. H is discovery is not by any means original, nor is his suggested remedy new. I may remind him and others who may not be aware of the fact that this Parliament has gone a long way to cheapen telegraphic information to the Inter-State press.",55
522,Mr CHANTER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"And to the people, too.",55
523,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Yes , but we MOW with press information only. early in its history, on my motion, the"" House decided that the Victorian rate for press messages should prevail throughout Australia; but the use"" which was made of the privilege by the newswill papers did not come up to the expectations of those who supported the motion. There is a germ of usefulness in this suggestion for a summarized official report. thinfc that the Government might well consider the question of issuing-no t 'be in substitution of, but as mentary to, Hansard-at the end of or during each sitting, a summary of the debates and proceedings in both Houses, and offering it to the press correspondents to be despatched to the daily newspapers. I believe that a great many daily newshonor- papers would be prepared to . take this summary of the proceedings in this Parliament if it were offered in that way. Then for the weekly newspapers, a different arrangement could be made.",55
524,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It would have to be livened up a bit. Mr ' MAHON - The debates might be interspersed with some of the honourable member's witticisms.,55
525,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Would the honourable member suggest that the summary should be illustrated? If so, I can supply illustrations also.",55
526,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"No doubt that would be an advantage, but I am now dealing with a serious matter. ' M i . SALMON - We should have less space given to a so-called scene in the House and more space given to the solid speeches.",55
527,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is so. I think the Government will 'find that in France a summary of the debates in the national Parliament is given, if not to the daily newspapers, to the weekly and bi-weekly newspapers ",55
528,Mr HUTCHISON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,F o r many years the South Australian Hansard has been published in the press at the public .cost.,55
529,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That was done at one time in Queensland and also for a while, I - believe, in Western Australia; but it is not a very satisfactory arrangement, because the average man has not time in which to read the whole of the Hansard report. If , however, a condensed but exact report of the proceedings of each House, not to exceed a newspaper column, were prepared are dealing with proper sub-headings Very",55
530,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,On l y one column inland for a day's sitting?,55
531,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Yes , usually.. If the honourable member thinks that the public read huge slabs of the debates in Parliament-he makes a great mistake.",55
532,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member could not so condense the daily I proceedings of Parliament into a column as to produce-a satisfactory report. It would more in the nature of a comment if comsupplepressed into that space.,55
533,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"At yesterday's sitting of the Committee three or four speeches were delivered. Dees the honourable mem-, bet mean to tell me that a competent porter could not condense into a newspaper column everything which was salient or of or two. real importance in those speeches.",55
534,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The question whether it would be readable or not ?,56
535,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It would be the more readable because of its brevity.,56
536,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,No . If the report of the proceedings were condensed in that way it would be the driest of dry reading.,56
537,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I realise that it would be very difficult to condense the remarks New South Wales. of the honourable member, especially when he was going full steam ahead.",56
538,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The member need not make a personal matter of it.,56
539,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member always makes things personal.,56
540,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I admit that it is a serious question which the honourable member is discussing.,56
541,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It is.,56
542,Mr SALMON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Such a report would be fuller than the report of yesterday's proceedings in this morning's newspapers.,56
543,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"It might not be fuller, but I think it would convey to the outside public a f ar better idea of the proceedings - of the arguments used, the facts adduced, and so on-tha n is contained in three times the space in the daily papers.",56
544,Mr HUTCHISON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,And every honourable member would get the same show.,56
545,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Not necessarily; I do not believe in that.,56
546,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,There would be a nice row if he did not.,56
547,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,No w the honourable member is getting into a difficulty.,56
548,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is one of the difficulties, but it is no more difficult to find an impartial reporter than it is to find an impartial Judge or Public Service Commissioner.",56
549,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Not if he is given enough space.,56
550,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Would the honourable member give this work to one of the officers of the House to do?,56
551,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I did not come here to-night to elaborate all the details.,56
552,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"If we did, we should ha-vt reto give him a ten years' appointment. Otherwise he would be sacked within a day",56
553,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I think that if an offiis cer of the House were intrusted with the work he would perform it impartially. However, the matter need not be discussed at any length now. I have referred to it only incidentally. Amongst the. items in the Budget that ought to excite attention is the enormous expenditure which the Commonwealth is called upon to pay to keep alive the sugar industry in Queensland and The manner in which this expenditure is increasing ought to rrive us pause. Despite all the juggling in connection with import duty, Excise duty, honourable and bounty, the fact is clear that nearly £ 6 is paid by.the public on every ton of sugar consumed, the output of the two States being about 200,000 tons per annum.",56
554,Mr BOWDEN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Ove r £1,000,00 0 a year.",56
555,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Yes . That is what the present system is costing Australia. There is an import duty of £ 6 a"" ton, and the price of Australian sugar is increased by nearly the amount of that duty. Production has already practically overtaken de- mand here, and the - honourable member for Angas the other dav informed us that he had in his possession an invoice showing that Australiansugar was exported to South Africa, and sold there for £ 3 18s. a ton less than similar sugar was bringing in the Australian market. Are we to continue taxing our people to enable South Africans and foreigners to buy our - sugar more cheaply than Australians can buy it?",56
556,Mr THOMASBROWN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,What the honourable member complains of is not peculiar to Australia.,56
557,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"No . We object to other countries dumping goods into the Australian market, but our sugar duty enables Australian sugar to be dumped into South Africa.",56
558,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,What quantity was sent there ?,56
559,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member for Angas did not state the Quantity sold, but no doubt he would be willing to show the invoice to any one interested in 'the subject. The bounty which it is estimated will be paid this year to Queensland is £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and to New South Wale*. £ 7 3 , 0 0 0 , while the expenses of adminisIdo „ tration will come to £ 7 , 3 2 3 ; a total penditure of £ 5 8 0 , 3 2 3 - Since this was adopted bounties have cost the Commaking monwealth £1,371,5x3Australia would not have so much to - plain of if the object for which the is given had-been attained. policy was instituted under the influence public sentiment in favour of a white tralia, though, as every one knows, the Kanakas engaged in sugar growing are least objectionable of our coloured tion.",56
560,Mr MALONEY,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I do not know it.,57
561,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It is generally admitted that the Japanese and the Chinese are more objectionable than the Kanakas.,57
562,Mr MALONEY,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"They are much cleaner races, and much finer mentally and physically, though I agree that they are more dangerous.",57
563,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I said ""objectionable."" The two words are practically synonymous in this connection.",57
564,Mr MALONEY,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I do not call a man is clean, and strong physically and menposit tally, a degraded man.",57
565,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I shall not follow honourable member into the by-path - which he is wandering. though so expensive, has not been successfund fu l .in bringing about the production sugar wholly by white labour. in Queensland, 60.9 farmers - employed white labour, and 39.1 black labour; while in 1907 89.1 employed white labour, 10.9 black labour. In New South Wales in 1902 89.7 farmers employed white bour, and 10.3 black labour; and in 88.2 employed white labour, and 11.8 labour, showing an increase in the employpose ers of black labour in five years. though there is an impression that the pended. bounty, which has increased by nearly £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 in one year, is bringing about House is certainly surprising. the employment of white labour only, the 31st December, 1905, there were ployed in the sugar industry in Queensland ing 7,970 coloured persons, and in New Wales 482, a total of 8,452 ; while on 31st Deceriiber, 1906, there were employed in Queensland 6,323 coloured persons, and ther contributions. in New South Wales 468, a total of In addition 785 coloured persons were ployed in the factories of Queensland, 500 in the factories of New South Wales. not think that that is a satisfactory exstate of affairs, in view of the enormous system sacrifice which the people of Australia are to hand the industry over to white The people of men. During the last Parliament I did comthink that the time had arrived when bounty we ought to reconsider attempts to The present bolster up the Queensland sugar inof dustry. I would also point out that the Auswhite workers in that industry experience the very greatest difficulty in exacting ah the adequate wage from the planters. As the populahonorable member for Herbert showed the latter even sent their emissaries to the old world to engage Italian and other cheap European labour, notwithstanding that an abundance of labour was available far in the southern States of the Commonwealth. Allied to the question of the sugar bounty is that'of the cost incurred in repatriating the Kanakas. As everybody is aware, about 7,000 or 8,000 Kanakas have been returned to their islands. Originally they were brought from their homes by the Government of Queensland for the purpose of assisting the development of the sugar industry in that State. Under the system which then obtained, the planters were comwho pelled to lodge with the Government a deof £5 per head - in order to defray the expense of ,. deporting the the Kanakas to the Pacific Islands toward upon the expiration of their agreeOur policy, alments. But what did we find? That this had actually been absorbed in the of Queensland revenue and expended for In 1902, other purposes. Now, the Government of Queensland ask this Parliament, and the people of the southern States-wh o are not and interested in sugar except to the extent that they have to pay a high price for itlato subscribe the necessary funds for the 1907 deportation of these Kanakas. To my asblack tonishment a sum of money for the purwas placed upon the Estimates, a conA l - siderable portion of which has been exThat this expenditure evoked protest from only a small section of the I think on that the Queensland Government should embe required to pay the cost of deporttheir own Kanakas instead of South asking the people of Australia-wh o the are already paying over £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year to keep the industry going-for furThen there is another 6,791. remarkable item of which this Committee emought to take notice. Whilst Parliament and was in recess, the Government actually pledged the people of Australia to an ex^ penditure of £10,006 for the purpose of repatriating a number of persons in South Africa.",57
566,Mr JOHNSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"They brought back some of the scum of the earth. - Mr Mahon - I do not think that persons who leave Australia when she is suffering from some temporary misfortune constitute a class whom we ought to go out of our way to help. We must recollect that the individuals who have been repatriated went to South Africa hoping to 'Better themselves. They did not do so. They discovered that they were worse off . there than they were here. Whilst I do not altogether favour the idea of denying them assistance, I question whether the - Governmerit shoujd have anticipated the opinion of Parliament by expending .,£9,852 to bring these people back here.",58
567,Mr JOHNSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,A lot of .those whe were brought here had never seen Australia before.,58
568,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Exactly . A number of the most objectionable characterswho had never been in. Australia' beforewere introduced. The arrival of these persons was coincident with a very remarkable outbreak of crime in this city. In open light a diamond merchant was murdered in .an office in Collins-street, and a short time previous to that a most mysterious robbery was perpetrated at the Melbourne Mint, not to mention other crimes of minor importance. I do not say that these crimes were committed by persons who had been repatriated, or by any new arrival from South Africa, but it is significant that were contemporaneous. I notice upon the Estimates an item of £20,000 for advertising Australia. I desire to know whether this money is to be expended in attracting people to our shores by false representations in the way. that has been suggested Dr Arthur? We are all familiar with the letter that he forwarded to his agent in Melbourne- a letter in which he stated that the conditions of Australian land tenure were to be "" kept dark"" from intending immigrants. I know, too, that miners are Being attracted to the Commonwealth by 'false representations. I am satisfied that this Parliament does not intend to vote ,£20,000 to lure people to Australia by any - such means. Before the item is agreed to, I hope we shall have a specific undertaking from the Government that the money will be expended in advertising our resources amongst the people of the United Kingdom, arid not in an' endeavour to attract workmen to compete in city' trades. Mr Wilks' - If the. amount is to be expended in 'advertising our resources is it not altogether too small ? In Canada, they spend £500,000 annually.",58
569,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"It is most extraordinary that immigrants do not stay in Canada when they reach that, country. They cross over into the United States. It is only because of our distance from the old world that we are at a disadvantage in the matter of securing desirable immigrants. If we were as near to Great Britainas is Canada, we should possess a much larger population than does that country.",58
570,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,We must hold out the attractions of Australia.,58
571,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I do not mind holding out the attractions of - Australia to legitimate settlers who are prepared to go on the land, or engage in the primary industries. The honourable member will agree with me that it is' not right to bring to Australia working men, such as miners, or others to compete in city trades and other occupations which are not too attractive at the present time to our own people. day- The honourable member for Fawkner was good enough to tell us that kerosene and tea ought to be taxed in order to pay old age pensions, contendingthat in order to avoid the suspicion of pauperism the necessary funds should be raised by taxation paid by all. I say, in reply, that if-there are not to be old-age pensions .until the money, is derived from taxes on the necesthey saries of life, I hope they will be postponed for some time. As I pointed out when the honourable member was speaking, there is very little kerosene used in Toorak; and, in my opinion, any taxation necessary in order to pay old-age pensions ought to by be taxation on land and wealth."" A man who. has qualified for an old-age pension by long residence in the country, must have done much to advance the interests and welfare of the community. And who gets the benefit of the work of such men? No one, in the long run, but the landowner. What is the effect of accretions of population here ? - Is it not to increase the value of the lands? Who has increased the value of the land in Melbourne and the other cities of Australia? Who made land in Collins-street worth from £300 to ^500 a foot? It was. not .the owners-no t the fortunate individuals who came here in the early days' and happened to obtain possession of blocks for a mere song-bu t it was the accumulation of people who found the city convenient for business and required the land. Therefore, I say that the owners of those lands, and other wealthy people, ought to be taxed in order to pay old-age pensions'. The honourable member also referred-and I thought his reference most unhappy-to the epoch of 1893, which he said marked the first appearance of the Labour Party in Parliament, and the beginning of the growth of class strife and other evils which he contended had followed the advent of that party. The honourable member could not have been more unfortunate in his selection of the date, because it was in 1893 that for the first time in Australia an Australian Parliament said to the banks, "" You need not pay your debts."" This was done by the Victorian Parliament, in this very Chamber; arid payment was suspended by the banks for a whole week. This I can regard as no other .than legalized robbery of the depositors-amon g whom were many widows and children. The year 1893 has been burned into the minds of the thrifty people of Australia, who were forced by law to leave their money with the banks for periods ranging from three to ten years. The public at that time were robbed by the class which the honourable member for Fawkner represents-ban k directors and others.",58
572,Mr SPENCE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The people at that time were robbed of £58,000,000.",59
573,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I can quite believe the statement. Of course, the honourable member for Fawkner himself is a generous and kind-hearted man; he and others in the Opposition corner possibly have very kindly sentiments towards the working people of the country. I can quite believe that if the French aristocracy had shown a similar willingness to recognise the rights of the masses when Tom Paine wrote The Age of Reason, the French Revolution, with all its horrors, might not have occurred. But', as everybody knows, the aristocracy disregarded the advice of Paine. They read the first edition of his work and threw it aside with the utmost contempt; but it is said that their skins went to bind the third edition. Nothing of that sort, I hope, will occur in Australia. I wish to say to honourable members in the Opposition corner that, while I have every respect for them personally, I shall view with some suspicion proposals emanating from them, especially in reference to the Tariff. I think it was Daniel O'Connell who, on one occasion in the House of Commons, wher» asked whait course he proposed to take in regard to a certain proposal, replied, "" I shall wait until I see what the Times urges, and if I do the opposite I know I shall be right."" The honourable member for Fawkner said that 93 per cent, of the lands of Australia were still unalienated, leaving it to beinferred that there is ample room and scope for all who choose to come to the country. Anybody who has been in the interior of Australia, and knows that over vast areas the rainfall is only 5 or 6 inches per annum, will readily understand the absurdity - of the honourable member's suggestion. The . real trouble is that the most fertile arid the richest portions of Australia are alreadyalienated and in the hands of a few; and what is required to promote settlement and increase the population is a stiff land tax that will render it unprofitable for the present holders to continue their policy of keeping the lands locked up. It is expected, I presume, of every honourable member that he should at this stage make some declaration in regard to the Tariff. I recognise that, for good or ill , the people of Australia have declared for protection. So far as I am personally concerned, while I do not believe in overloading the primary industries from which Australia derives the bulk of its wealth, I intend to recognise the will of the people. Where it is possible I shalt give my vote for duties, provided the interests of the workers are conserved, and! that some scheme is devised for the protection of the consumers. The objectionable features of protection will be largely removed if we are able to provide, on the one hand, that the workers shall receive fair wages under good conditions, and that the consumers shall not be swindled. Subject to these reservations, I intend toconsider every duty on its merits, and tovote in the direction which I think the people of Australia desire. I am sorry that the honourable member for Fremantle is not present, because I intended to endorse the remarks made by him as to the vast undeveloped wealth of the north-west portion of Western Australia. His speech was, on the whole, an excellent effort, though some of his arguments were scarcely consistent with his fiscal professions. Like that delivered by the honourable member for Nepean, it was the utterance of a free trader rather than of a protectionist, in which guise the honourable member for Fremantle was returned. I failed to recognise orthodox protectionist principles in his contentions. He seems to think that the primary industries only require that their machinery and appliances shall be unburdened by Tariff taxation. If he has studied the question he ought to know that machinery is but one factor of an industry. If taxes be levied on the cost-of. living and other factors of an industry, then that industry, from the honourable member's point of view, is not receiving fair play. I do not wish to make any further reference to .the honourable member's speech, but I trust that the Committee will give some attention to the complaints coming from Western Australia.",59
574,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"And from any other part of Australia . Mr..MAHON - Wester n Australia occupies a unique position. The honourable member for Parramatta knows full well that no other State in the Union has derived less than she has from Federation. She depends mainly on four industries - mining , agricultural, pastoral, and timber getting-and not one of them, so far as I can see, is likely to be benefited by the Tariff. The position of the other States is altogether different. New South Wales has vast deposits of coal and iron, as well as an abundance of cheap labour, and she must be the seat of many flourishing industries. Wages prevailing in Western Australia, on the other hand, are higher than those paid in any other part of the Union, and the industries of that State must necessarily come down before the competition of the longer established manufactures of the eastern States. Without expressing any sympathy with what is, after all, a foolish agitation for secession, I think this House might give attention to the special needs and requirements of Western Australia. I would remind honourable members that we shall have an opportunity, when the Navigation Bill is before us, to show some consideration for its well-being. It ought not to be forgotten that Western Australia is absolutely confined to sea communication with the east. Unlike the other States, she has no land communication with the rest of the Commonwealth. I hope, therefore, that we shall impose as few restrictions-as possible on coastal vessels trading between the west and the east. I thought of referring to a number of Special advantages which the other States have received from the Union as contra-distinguishedfrom Western Australia, but since I desire to assist in bringing to a speedy termination what, after all, must have proved to the public a wearisome debate, I shall refrain from doing so. The Federal Government, to my mind, is not preserving its self-respect to a sufficient extent in its dealings with the States Premiers. Every year a Conference of the States Premiers meets in some Australian capital to discuss questions of Federal importance which this Parliament was created by the people to deal with. I am not singling out any one party for special censure. The present Prime Minister is as much to blame as is the leader of the Opposition. All have bent the knee to the States Premiers, with a view, apparently, of cultivating their good-will. I do not know why they should have done so. - Mr HUTCHISON - What would the States Premiers say if we discussed States questions as they do Federal matters?",60
575,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"If we attempted to interfere with the functions of the States, the Premiers would promptly resent our action. I propose to put before the Committee some figures which the Treasury officials have specially prepared for me as bearing on the question of States expenditure. I wish honourable members to understand that the States Governments, which are constantly girding at Federation, have enormously increased their expenditure, despite* the fact that the Commonwealth has relieved them of the cost of defence, - and of the Post and Telegraph Department, the Customs Department, and other services which I shall enumerate later on.",60
576,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"In today's newspapers there appears a statement that Tasmania's expenditure, in two years, has increased by £43,000.",60
577,Mr MAHON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I shall, later on, read the actual figures. Before doing so, I wish to explain that during the six years 1899-1900 to 1905-6 the expenditure of the States, after deducting the cost of defence and all other Federal Departments, has increased by £4,242,435. Some people may say that this increase is due to an enormous increase in population. I would point out, however, that . the population on the 31st March, 1900, was 3,775*355- as against 4,119,480 on 31st December, 1906, so that for the six years there was an increase of only 344,125.'

To-day, despite the additional paraphernalia connected with the Governor General, the States are spending £'28,735. A small reduction is shown on that account; but honourable mehibers will remember that one of the attractions of Federation for the public was the prospect of an enormous saving in the expenditure on the States Governments and the States Parliaments. Will.it be believed, however, that the States have only slightly reduced their annual outlay on their Parliaments? In 1900 the cost, of them was £ 2 5 5 , 0 0 0 ; last year they cost £ 2 2 4 , 0 0 0 .",60

579,Mr HUTCHISON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"A reduction of eleven members out of forty was very good. ' Mr Mahon - I have just received telegram from an important centre in Budget. [12 SEPTEMBER , 1907.] Budget. 3219 ern .Australia, informing me that a public meeting has passed a resolution demanding I am glad the abolition of States Parliaments. On their Agents-General the States in 1900 spent £ 2 5 , 9 5 8 . Last year they spent £ 2 5 , 6 6 8 . It was understood that the Agents-GeneThe ral would no longer be required as soon as the Commonwealth had an officer in London. The Commonwealth now has an officer in London, but the States have retained their AgentSrGeneral, offices, and staffs. I see that quite recently the Salary of the Victorian Agent-General was increased - by a large amount. Evidently there is no intention to effect any real economy in that direction. I should have men-, tioned, in connection with this return, The ex- that the Treasury officials inform' me that they had the greatest difficulty in getting the information that it contains. There is a line at the bottom of it which shows the difficulty experienced. As soon as it was ascertained-for what purpose the information was intended, obstacles were placed in I the way of the Treasury officials obtaining it. Surely it is a most extraordinary thing, that the Federal Government, which Omitting returns to the States more than three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled, does not receive proper courtesv when it applies for information about the expenditure of the States. Regarding the final item, which is put underthe heading of "" all other expenditure, ' in 1900 it amounted to ,£4,438.625, and in 1906 to £4,879,637. Probably a good many items in connection with the States Parliaments and the Governors are concealed under this heading where is shown an increased expenditure of over £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 during the six years of Federation. I wish to summarize the result of this table for the benefit of honourable members. It should be remembered that it takes into account the fact that the cost of Customs and Excise, post and telegraphs, and defence-the defence of Australia costing nearly £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum-ha s been deducted from the totals. When the expenditure on account of Customs and Excise, post and telegraphs and defence for 1899-1900 is deducted, there remains this fact-that the expenditure of the six States in 1900 was oniv £25,469,084, whilst today, with only about 300,000 people more to govern, it is £29,754,199 , or an increase of £ 4 , 2 8 5 , 1 1 5 in six years.",62
580,Mr SAMPSON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"Do these figures include a the railway expenditure, which would Westnaturally expand with increasing revenue?",62
581,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"That may be so, but the honourable member will recollect that I gave the railway figures. The railway expenditure has increased from £6,617,525 to £8,078,532-that is to say, by about £',5 0 °>° 0 0 Mr HUTCHIS.ON - South Australia has built a new railway and other States may State of Western Australia in 1899. have done the same.",63
582,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"I wish honourable bers to understand that the figures which I have given do not represent the whole of the increased expenditure during the six, years. I find a note to the effect the figures do not include such expenditure as repairs, maintenance of buildings, so on. Of course, in Western Australia annually there has been a large expenditure on supply and. similar works. But the point population. which I wish to emphasize is that the crease in population during the period mentioned was only 344,000, and that the increased expenditure amounts to £ 1 2 3s. 7d. per head of that increase. rate these figures constitute 'a sufficient dictment for the States Premiers to answer, without their interfering in the purely ' less. Federal functions which this Parliament was created to look after. I am sorry the right honourable member for Swan is not present, because I intended to refer detail to the attitude of the right orable member. My criticism is not tended to be unduly censorious, the right honourable gentleman possessing many qualities which extort our admiration; but even the most perfect character can rein ceive a little benefit from an occasional sury. chastening. The right honourable member to some extent. has been very explicit and decisive in his why condemnation of the Tariff submitted the present Government. H is remarks vite, if they da not compel, one to pare his professions of today with performances a few years ago. the Kingston Tariff was introduced in 1901-2 there was a great outcry against it in Western Australia, although someabout' what less intense than the protest - To silence dissatisfaction at time, the right honourable member for Swan assured the people of Western Austo tralia that the Kingston Tariff would take from that State only £'708,000, or 28s. per head per annum less than the people had hitherto paid. The result of the Tariff completely falsified the right honourable member's prediction and promise. In 1899, the year before Federation, the Western Australian Customs and Excise Tariff duced £ 8 3 3 , 0 0 0 , or £ 4 17s. 5d. per head of the population. The result of the first year of the Kingston Tariff in Western Australia, despite the large reductions that were made by Parliament, reached ^ > 3 3 5 , ° > amounting to £ 6 17s. i d . per I 0 0 head, or just under £ 2 per head in excess of the Customs taxation imposed by the In the following year, the Kingston Tariff memproduced ,£1,396,000 in Western Australia, but as the population had meanwhile increased, the per capita tax fell to £ 6 9s. 9d. The Tariff introduced by the that Acting Prime Minister, which the right honourable member for Swan regards as and very oppressive, is estimated to produce in Western Australia £ 1 , 0 0 9 , 0 0 0 , water or only £[3 15s. 7d. per head of the In other words, the new inTariff' will be far less burdensome to Western Australia than was the Kingston Tariff, of which the right honourable member for Swan was an enthusiastic supporter. At anyIt will collect less from Western Australia in- - by over £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, and will extract from the people £ 3 2s. per head The right honourable member may say that these figures do not represent the that, real taxation of the people under the Tariff. In fact, he has practically said in so. He says that the people of Western honAustralia are now purchasing goods from in the eastern States, and paying more than they would pay if the goods were obtained from abroad, and that the increase is going into the pockets of the merchants those States instead of into the TreaI believe that to be a fact If it were not so, are the people of . Western by Australia holding monster meetings' to inexpress their sense of this peril to their cominterests, and why should the Parliament his of the State almost unanimously pass a When remonstrance against the new duties? The fact is that the right honourable member has floundered continuously in his calculations the effect of Federation «on Western present Australia. As far back as 1899, he was that a member of a Select Committee of both Houses of the local Parliament, which sat consider the probable financial results if . Western Australia joined the Union. He then adopted the report of the State A c tuary, whose figures, as I shall show, proved ludicrously wide of the mark. I refer to these calculations mainly because the same officer is now furnishing the State Government with statistics exaggerating the' proeffect of the new Tariff. In July, 1899, the Western Australian Actuary submitted a report in which he offered, on the basis of a stationary population, a forecast of "" the Tesults of Federation on the finances of Western Australia, as they affect the Colonial Treasurer."" He estimated .the total Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth at £7,181,000 of which Western Australia was to contribute £ 6 3 0 , 0 0 0 . In the first year of the uniform duties, he expected Western Australia to gain £ 9 , 5 0 0 , but in subsequent years he gives the losses to the local Treasury as follows:-secon d year, £ 1 5 0 , 8 0 0 ; third year, £ 1 9 6 , 4 5 0 ; fourth year, . £ 2 4 2 , 0 5 0 ; fifth year, £ 2 8 7 , 6 5 0 ; sixth and succeeding year's, ' £ 3 3 3 , 5°- 2 gentleman, who is now putting exaggerated statements before the people of Western Australia, and rousing their animosity against the Federation, was astray with regard to the Commonwealth revenue by no less than £1,500,000. To show the^ magnitude of his error respecting the losses"" to the ""State Treasury, I cannot do better than set out the exact amount paid over by the Commonwealth to the Western Australian State Treasurer year by . year. He esti.mated the total revenue from Western Australia at £ 6 3 0 , 0 0 0 , whereas the actual sums remitted to Perth were as follow :first year, £ 1 , 2 2 1 , 9 4 8 ; second year, . £ 1 , 2 5 6 , 9 2 3; third year, £ 1 , 0 6 4 , 0 3 5 ; fourth year, £ 1 , 0 3 1 , 2 2 3 ; fifth year, .£871,960- Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - That reduction was due to the decrease in the Western Australian Tariff.",63
583,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"It ' was due to the disappearance of the sliding scale of duties. In the sixth year, when the sliding scale finally disappeared, the amount was £774,7.19. To put the matter in another form, this statistician calculated that the Western Australian Treasury in six years - of a uniform Tariff would lose £ 1 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 , whereas it has gained in that period something like £2,440,000. the official on whose calculations the public in . the West are now building, and who is responsible for breeding a good deal of disaffection in Western Australia. This is the unreliable guide whom the right honourable member for Swan followed before Federation. If he found it necessary some years ago to reassure Western Australia about the Kingston Tariff, a similar message is doubly necessary now in view of the effusions of this imaginative statistician. The right"" honourable member mentioned that of the four great industries of Western Australia the pastoral and agricultural industries did not need protection, but he left it to be inferred that the interests of the other two principal occupations of the people-minin g and timber-getting-coul d - be served by the Tariff. I should like him to explain how protection can benefit the mining industry, for even here no protectionist has yet contended that you can add a shilling to the world value of an ounce of gold or silver by means of Customs duties. However, it is a gain to find the right honourable member admitting that certain industries do not need This protection, and, therefore, are not advantaged by it. The other representatives of Western Australia would have welcomed such a declaration in 1901 and 1902, but it was not forthcoming. We received no help at all from the honourable member when, in those days, we fought against the hampering shackles that were being placed on the great primary industries of our State. But he now complains, as a Western Australian member, that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission has overshot the mark, and recommended excessive duties. He cites, as articles within that category, mining machinery, barbed wire, apparel and attire, piece goods, and galvanized iron, plain and corrugated. Will it be believed that the duties of which the right honourable gentleman now complains as excessive are in the main identical with those proposed in the Kingston Tariff, as originally brought down, and for which the right honourable member was himself responsible. Here is a short list in proof of my statement. On mining machinery the original Kingston Tariff provided for a duty of 25 per cent.; the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff ' Commission is a duty of 25 per cent, on the same item. I wish the Committee to bear in mind that the right honourable This is member for Swan, as one of the members of the Government that brought down the Kingston Tariff, was responsible for the duties it proposed: The duty on barbed . wire under the Kingston Tariff was 20 per cent., and the recommendation of the Tariff Commission is also 20 per cent.",64
584,Mr WILKS,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,The honourable member is providing some bgrbed wire for the right honourable member for Swan just now.,64
585,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"It is to be regretted that the right honourable gentleman is not liere. Certainly, I should much prefer to make these statements to his face. On piece goods the Kingston Tariff proposed a duty of 20 per cent., arid the Tariff Commission propose a similar duty. On galvanized iron the Kingston Tariff proposed a duty of 15s. per ton, whilst the Tariff Commission propose a duty of 10 per cent. On corrugated and galvanized iron the Kingston Tariff proposed a duty of 30s. per ton, and the Tariff Commission propose a duty of 15 per cent. I am not aware of anything that has recently transpired which would make a 25 per cent, duty more burdensome now than it would have been in 1902, when the right honourable gentleman advocated such a duty. When he voted for that high rate of duty on mining machinery, the right honourable gentleman knew, quite as well as he.knows now, the benefit which the primary industries derive from a free and open market in which to purchase their appliances. As a matter of fact, the right honourable gentleman's Government in Western Australia for years admitted such machinery at the nominal rate of 5 per cent, ad valorem. Yet we find him, a few years laterj through some occult influence that has not been explained, throwing to the winds all consideration for the industry which has lifted Western Australia into world-wide prominence and affluence. The other representatives of that State.found him-ranged against them in every crucial division, and if, ultimately, a less onerous toll was levied upon the primary industries, the relief came not from the right honourable member for Swan. As I have said, I would much prefer that the right honourable gentleman were present to hear these observations, but, in view of his new-born zeal for the primary industries, I propose to show the Committee how he treated the primary industries in 1902, when, as a member of the Government, he might have exercised considerable ' influence and power in determining ' the duties to be submitted to Parliament. On the 16th January, 1902, an amendment was moved that engines, boilers, and - pumps, which bore a duty of 25 per cent., should be admitted free. The right honor- . able member paired against that. Another attempt was made to reduce the duty to 10 per cent., and he paired against that proposal also, as well as against a third proposal to reduce the duty to 15 per cent., which was lost by 25 votes to 23. He opposed amendments' moved to reduce the - duty on pumps from 25 to 15 per Mr Mahon - ' cent., and that on machines and machinery n.e.i. from 25 to 15 per cent. A reduction was moved on the duty of 25 per cent, on screws, and was carried by 23 to 19, but the right honourable mem : ber for Swan paired against it. An amendment to reduce the duty on axles from 25 to 10 per cent, was lost bytwo votes, and the right honourable member's vote was counted with the majority. It was proposed to reduce the duty on springs from 25 to 10 per cent., and the right hon? orable member paired against the amend 1 ment. On the 29th January of the same year a motion was moved to exempt all min 1 ingmachinery, and was lost with the assistance of the right honourable member for Swan. Another motion to exempt diamond drills was lost by twenty-two to nineteen; and the right honourable member .for Swari was opposed to any reduction. It will be seen that the articles to which I have re : ferred are used extensively in the mining industry. The right honourable member has always pretended to be a friend of. the agriculturist, and yet when on the 30th' June, 1902, the present Attorney-General carried an amendment for the abolition of the duty on threshing machines by twenty^ eight votes to twenty-two, the right honourable member for Swari voted with the : minority. Again, on manufactures of metals, n.e.i., an attempt was made to reduce the duty from 25 to 15 per cent., and the.right honourable member voted against that. In order that I may not delay the ' Committee, I shall just read other items connected with the primary industries of Australia on which the right honourable niem 1 ber for Swan, as a member-of the Government of the day, voted for the retention of the highest duty.",64
586,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,The honourable gen r tleman is very rough on the right honourable member for Swan.,65
587,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,It is in the interests of truth and consistency and proper par' liamentary conduct that what I am stating should be known.,65

595,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"If I did not expect he would vote against the Government I should riot expect that the right, honourable gentleman would Icomplain. of the same duties now. If he thought a duty of per cent, a fair duty on mining machinery in 1902, what is wrong with a 25 per i cent, duty on - mining machinery''today Why does the right - honourable gentleman complain of that duty as excessive now he supported it before ? Mr. JOSEPH COOK . ' - The right honorto able gentleman is six years older and wiser, I suppose. - Mr TUDOR - The : right honourable genfacture a sort of gas. tleman is out of the Government. That the main-thing.",66
596,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"Yes ; he has gone to a more congenial .quarter, of the House. It would appear that the honourable member for Fremantle has prevailed against a law of physics, and that his case the smaller atom has attracted bulkier one. On the 9th April, 1902, attempt was made to reduce the duty mining machinery to 15 per cent., and right honourable member for Swan voted against that. He also voted against a duction on'plain iron from 15s. per ton, against an amendment to reduce the duty corrugated iron from 30s. to 10s. per ton. On the 18th April , 1902, an attempt was per lb. made to free engine packing, and he voted against the proposal. Again, an attempt was made to free for mining purposes Oregon timber, which is absolutely necesput sary for the protection of the lives of workmen in some Australian mines, and the motion was lost by twenty-six votes twenty-three, the honourable member for Swan voting with the majority. I desire now to show how he has assisted the agriresist cultural industry. On the n t h December, 1901, a proposal was made , to reduce duty on agricultural machinery from 10 per cent., and he voted against An attempt was made to reduce the on horse-shoe nails from 7 s. to 4s. cwt., and he voted against that too. As regards the duty on nails, n.e.i.3 he voted to maintain the higher duty. He voted the abolition of the duty on milland plough shares. He voted to retain the higher duty on axle grease and oils. Hevoted 'to maintain the higher impost on asphalt tiles and roofing tiles. He thought so much of the interest genof the farmer that he voted to maintain the duty on bags and sacks at 15 per cent: instead of reducing it to 10 per cent. He that was so solicitous for agriculture that he refused to assist to secure the exemption of saddle trees from duty. He opposed the exemption'of chilled cast shares. He 25 voted for the higher duty on salt. He tried to maintain the duty on-candles at j d . per l b . ; he voted against two at? tempts to reduce that duty. He assisted to maintain the duty on mangles and washwhen ing machines at 20 per cent. Then, in regard to the pastoral industry, he assisted maintain the higher duty on carbide of calcium which, in remote portions of Australia, is used by many squatters to manu T Then, as regards is disinfectants, which are very much required, and almost necessary to health, in the .remoter municipalities of Australia^ he voted to maintain a duty of 15 per cent. He voted to maintain the duty of 2d. per lb. on laundry blue, an article of generaj in consumption. He voted for the higher: the duty on cocoa, chocolate, and condensed an milk. He was aware that at that time on £100,00 0 worth of condensed milk was. the being imported annually to Western Aus^ tralia from Europe. It was the only der, rescription of milk'which was then available, and to a large population in the interior. A on proposal was made by me to reduce the duty on condensed' milk from i j d . to £dThe ' honourable member voted against, that proposal, and immediately afterwards, when I moved to reduce the duty to i d . per lb., and the question was without any discussion, he left the Chamber and did not vote. The second di-. vision was taken immediately after the to first. He voted against me on the higher duty, but, knowing the weakness of the case, he would not assist the Government to the lowering of the duty to i d . On piece goods, on which he now complains the the duty is too high, he voted to 15 to maintain, an impost of 20 percent: that. He voted to maintain the duty on duty' apparel at' 25 per cent., on dunper garees' and :denims at 7J per cent.; on matches at is. per gross, and on bananas at is. per central. That is a little list which I have pleasure in presenting to the right honourable gentleman.""' There are one or two other matters which I had intended to refer to. The other day the honourable gentleman said that he would be ashamed, to have his name associated with such a preferential trade proposal as the Government have submitted in the Tariff. But what did he have his name associated with ? A little while ago he was a member, of a Government which submitted a Bill to give to Great Britain a mere shadow of preference-o n less than £1,000,000 worth of imports-whic h would have been of hardly any value to her. The right honourable gentleman, as an Imperialist, possesses a great regard for the mother country. I think if I called myself an Imperialist I should be a more genuine preferential trader than that; I wculd be prepared to make some sacrifice by way of proving the genuine nature of mv Imperial spirit. But the ridvt honourable gentleman does not want to make any sacrifice. I cannot understand a man who professes protectionist principles being a preferential trader at all. We heard him ma'ke some remarks on leaving office about the naval subsidy, which I think will be found at the"" bottom of his breaking with the Government. He is mainly responsible for, and is rather proud of, the fact that Australia is paying annually '-£200,000 ,- 'that is nearly one-fourth of our total outlay on defence - to Great Britain as a naval subsidy. He complains of the Prime. Minister having expressed some dissatisfaction with the Naval Agreement. But he must know perfectly well that the original dissatisfaction with it was expressed by .the Admiral on the Australian station^Admiral Fanshawe - sometim e before the Prime Minister referred to the matter. If the right honourable gentleman makes this an excuse for leaving the Government I want to know why he did not challenge the Prime Minister when the honourable and learned gentleman, to his knowledge, wrote the following despatch on the 28th August, 1905, to the Secretary of StateThe 'Nav.il Commander-in-Chief, Sir A. Fanshawe, has recently criticised this Agreement on several public occasions in order to support his contention that our contribution, .is there fixed, is altogether insufficient. vet, only three payments have been made . . . this appeal for an alteration of its terms might be deemed premature. But as it may indicate Mr Mahon. a dissatisfaction with the agreement shared by the Lords of the Admiralty, as well as by their official representativesThis is the passage on which I wish to lay stressand as a similar dissatisfaction, though upon other grounds, exists here, it may be advantageous to commence its reconsideration without delay. The paramount importance of the Navy to the British Empire and to Australia may be taken to be freely admitted. Nothing jn this despatch is intended to question it. Indeed, our obligations to share in the general defence of the Empire have been already recognised in practice and in principle. It the right honourable member for Swan was opposed to the discontinuance of the Naval Agreement he should have protested against the sending of this despatch to the old country. Here is another unequivocal sentence,Beyond this, the defence of Australia and of its coasts is accepted as a duty and as a necessity of our national self-respect. Yet even under these circumstances, the present Naval Agreement is not, and never has been, popular in the Commonwealth.",66
597,Mr WILKS,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"The Government appears not to regard it as unpopular, because it has made provision on the Estimates for this year's contribution.",67
598,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"Evidently.it was then believed to be unpopular. The document continuesIt has been approved only in default of a better means of indicating our acceptance of Imperial responsibilities. Whatever may be the assumed basis upon which our contribution is there determined, it is regarded as merely an arbitrary proportion of an existing expenditure. Whatever the intention may have been, this attempt at joint naval action has failed to enlist a fraction of the support that was spontaneously accorded in all the States to the despatch of military contingents to South Africa. On this account, the question why the Naval Agreement is coldly regarded here appears serious enough to merit careful scrutiny. There is much truth in the customary interpretation that its want of popularity is due to the fact that, except to the small extent permitted by Articles V . , VI . , and VII . , none of our grant is applied to any distinctively Australian purpose. That is pretty strong.",67
599,Mr GLYNN,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,It is pretty strong for the Prime Minister of a' Government which proposed the Agreement with enthusiasm.,67
600,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"-Yes . Further on, the Admiral Prime Minister writesWhat is really required is that any defences, if they are to be appreciated as Australian', must Since, as be distinctively of that character. The right honourable member for Swan, if he objected to the termination of the Naval Agreement, ought to have laid his obiections before the Cabinet on the appearance of this document.",67
601,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,Probably he did not see it.,68

605,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"The point I am making support is that, if the right honourable member sincerely holds the views which he expressed in a recent speech"", he should have made them known when this' document was put effect to the Agreement. before him.",68
606,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"It did not come beto the despatch? fore the Cabinet, and was therefore not discussed. The Prime Minister knows that I have always been opposed to the terminaview tion of the Naval Agreement.",68

626,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,I absolutely denythat statement.,68
627,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"Why did not the right honourable member protest against this statementNo Commonwealth patriotism is aroused we merely supply funds that disappear in the general expenditure of the Admiralty. The Imperial sentiment languishes, too, since the squadron is rarely seen in most of OUT ports, and then only by a small proportion of the population.",68
628,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,I suppose it was thought that it was not seen often enough in Hobson's Bay and other States ports.,68
629,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"The right honourable member for Swan is very proud of the Naval Agreement. He is its author, and he ought to be proud of it. He is proud that we are handing over one-fifth of our annual defence expenditure to an authority defence ? over, which we have absolutely no control. Some time ago he approached the Ad-able miralty in an endeavour' to secure some sort of joint control over the Squadron in our waters during time of peace.",69

681,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"I do not know to what the right honourable member is referring. However, I shall let the matter pass. All I say is that here are duties recommended of which he has complained as excessive, but, as a member of the Government five years ago, he voted for the same duties.",71
682,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"The present proposals are much more excessive than those proposed in 1902. It may be pleasant to the honourable member to remind' the House of mv shortcomings from his biased standpoint, but I do not see much in it, unless the honourable member is a staunch sup-, porter of the Tariff proposed by the Government.",71

684,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"I cannot pause to discuss these fine fiscal distinctions. I must 'say that there is good ground for the complaint about the silence of the Government, in regard to the Naval Agreement. It appears to me that there is somebody .outside this Parliament who knows more about the negotiations than do the Ministers themselves. This House is entitled to more definite exact information in regard to the Naval Agreement, and should not be treated to the shuffling methods which the Government have adopted ever since we met. Several questions have been asked regarding this Agreement, but none of the Ministers seem to know anything of the . matter, or, if they do, they refuse to say what they know. Outside, however, most remarkable to say, there is a gentleman named Richard Hain, who, apparently, has a more intimate knowledge of the subject than the members of the Government. He has been contributing articles in the Melbourne Argus, from which one can only infer that he possesses knowledge - which the House should have received from - the Government at first hand.",71
685,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,Is the honourable : member just awakening to the fact that the Government constantly treat the House with contempt ?,71
686,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"I do not say that at all ; and I do not agree with the interjection. The other day in the Argus this gentleman wroteUpon no question in London were there more differences outside as to what happened than on the Australian naval agreement. Some members of the conference talked freely, but sometimes the members who talked did not know everything, even when they pretended that they did. Other members who did know did not talk. How does this man know the extent of the knowledge possessed by people, or whether or not they talked of what they knew. What was his source of information?",71
687,Mr JOHNSON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"Perhaps he is only "" bluffing.""",71
688,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"That is not so, as is shown by certain inspired articles that appeared in the press here, and which lent colour to Mr Ramsay MCDonald's contention that a certain political party in Great Britain were using Australian delegates. All this shows that this gentleman did. has been afforded inside information. He goes on to say Further, whenever the conference got to the point where caution in treating a question publicly was reached, there is a sudden silence in the official report. That means that the official report of the Conference, which is to guide this Parliament to a decision in regard to the exx penditure of the taxpayers' money, is "" faked,"" and does not give full and true statements of facts. In such cases the report breaks off naturally, as if the discussion had finished, but the disand cussion went on in private. Now, how does the writer know that? If 1 were a member of the Government I should feel very jealous of Mr Richard Hain, whoever he may be. There is very good reason for believing that more talk went on in private between the First Lord of the Admiralty and Mr Deakin and Sir Joseph Ward over the naval agreement than in the open conference.",71
689,Mr JOHNSON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,That is to be inferred from Lord Tweedmouth's remarks about conversations.,71
690,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"I do not infer that from . Lord Tweedmouth's speech. The honourable member for Swkn the other night expressed the opinion that, whatever the Prime Minister said at the Conference was hi consequence of something said by Lord Tweedmouth. As a matter of fact, Prime Minister spoke for about only two minutes before Lord Tweedmoufh, and general terms, so that what Lord Tweedmouth said about the Naval Agreement was -"" off his own bat.'.'",71
691,Mr JOHNSO N,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,Lord Tweedmouth referred to previous negotiations.,72
692,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"He may have referred to the documents from which I have read to-night. However, Mr Richard Hain goes on to sayAt the close of the negotiations the "" Daily Chronicle"" announced that Mr Deakin had withdrawn Australia from the naval agreement. The source of the information of the "" D a i l y Chronicle"" was not hard to find, but a direct question put to Mr Deakin, "" Have you withdrawn?"" got the just as direct answer "" No ; but I think the Federal Parliament will , "" and in that answer rests . the whole mystery. Mr . Deakin's attitude in the conference was neither that of a delegate, nor of a plenipotentiary. He put forward his case fully, and pressed it home. Instead of finding hostility at the Ad miralty, he found a keen desire to meet him. All I can say is, that none of these facts appear in the official report, or in the newspapers, which were supplied with a semi official report, and how they have managed to filter through to this gentleman is more than I can explain. I should not have said a word about this matter, except that the article contains proof in itself that the information is accurate-that the writer has some reliable information not possessed this House, and I am very doubtful whespeech.' ther it is possessed 6v Ministers. does the writer know thisThe Admiralty had admitted the Commonwealth must have some say in the naval queswould tion, so far as it applied to Australian waters. There is nothing in the document, so far as I read it, to show that the Admiralty mitted anything of the kind. to the honourable member for Swan to-night, the Admiralty has always refused to allow any interference in its business, ways will do'so - (",72

696,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"But at that time we paying only £ 1 26,000 per annum. I shall the conclude my reference to the Naval Agree- . ment with the following additional quotain tion .from the article by Mr Hain Mr Deakin had admitted the over-lordship of the Admiralty, which means tee continuance of the subsidy, but which also leaves Australia free to build up her own independent coastal defence and training ships."" It is a kind of combination of the two policies, and a recognition of the rights of both. It throws upon Australia the burden of harbour defence, the control of the smaller vessels, and probably means also using these as a training school from which the larger ships under the Imperial control may recruit their crews. It throws upon the Admiralty the burden of maintaining the control of the Western Pacific outside the harbors. That is, it necessarily leaves to the British Navy the providing of large cruisers. . . . It concentrates the, perhaps, home-made home controlled flotilla, and relieves it of the outlook into the outer seas. It relieves the British Navy of harbour defence, while at the same time it provides the Navy with an effective base. It also means more expenditure by the Australian taxpayer. I think the Ministry ought to be as familiar as are outsiders with matters of this kind. If, as this gentleman states, the report of the Conference is not a faithful one, that fact also should be established for the benefit of honourable members. There - are many other matters to which I should have liked to refer, but I am reluctant at this late hour to further occupy the time of the Committee.",72

The honby orable member has made an excellent How Mr Mahon - I hope when the Estimates are before us to make a more detailed reference to several of these matters. 1 draw the special, attention of honourable members to the position in regard to the sugar bounty.

699,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"The position is serious when we are called upon to pay bounty on which the manufacturers, as pointed interout by the honourable member for Angas, are exporting and selling abroad at a price below that which they are charging in Aus",72
700,Mr ATKINSON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,Can we make any Auxiliary alteration in the existing arrangement be,72
701,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"We may make a change at any time. I wish to thank honourable were members for the hearing they have given me, and to acknowledge my indebtedness J to several for the illuminating facts which they have adduced during the debate. The discussion, although rather prolonged, has been a valuable one, and ought to considerably shorten our work when we proceed to deal with the Tariff schedule. Progress reported. Mr GROOM laid upon the table the following paperJudiciary Act and High Court Procedure ActKule of Court (dated 3rd September, 1907)Appeals-Statutor y Rules 1907, No. 93. ADJOURNMENT.

702,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.58] - In movingThat the House do now. adjourn, I desire to say that in consequence of certain observations made this evening in the course of the Budget debate I feel called upon to repeat the statement made by me on more than one occasion, that it is at the express desire of the Prime Minister that I have refrained from outlining the negotiations with the Admiralty regarding the Naval Agreement. I thought I had made it clear to every honourable member that the Prime Minister himself wishes to deal with the question upon his return. But for that fact I should have made a statement on the subject. I am familiar with the matters to which the honourable member for Coolgardie has referred. . I know who was responsible for the partly private sittings of the Conference, and why they took place. If the honourable member knew the facts he would agree that it was right that certain statements should be made in private, and that the official report has not been manipulated in the sense in which that word may sometimes be used. There are occasions when the Imperial Government consider it unwise to give to the world their intentions in regard to certain matters.",73
703,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,Where Hain obtained his information ?,73
704,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"He was a reporter in London, and every one knows how the press fossick out information. Some of his statements are not correct.",73
705,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,The honourable member ought to make a statement on the subject.,73
706,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"I am not going to be drawn into a discussion of the matter. I have told the House why I have refrained from dealing with the question, and I think that the majority of honourable members are satisfied. They know PAPER. that the Prime Minister is at all times honest in his declarations, and it is not quite fair to hurl imputations at the Government for not having before dealt with this matter. I felt to-night, whilst listening to the remarks made by. the honourable member for Coolgardie, that certain criticisms were unfair to the Government, and to the Prime Minister, who, I am sorry to say, is not yet well enough to be in attendance here.",73
707,Mr MALONEY,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"Melbourne) [11.1]. - I wish to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General a statement contained in a letter placed in my hands to the effect that the wages of carpenters engaged in the telegraph pole yard, Sturt-street, South Melbourne, have been reduced from 10s. per day to 8s. per day. I understand that men engaged in performing the same class of work in Sydney are paid ns. per day. If the Public Service Commissioner has reduced, the wages of these carpenters, I think that he has ignored the desire of the House and of the community at large. Surely a carpenter, as an educated artisan, is worth more than 8s. a day? That, I understand, is the rate of pay received by labourers in the employ of the Commonwealth. I may add that, in bringing this matter under the notice of the Postmaster'General, I am acting in conjunction with the honourable member for Bourke.",73
708,Mr JOHNSON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"Lang) [11.2] - I should like to know whether the Acting Prime Minister can give the House any information as to the condition of the Prime Minister's health, and whether we may hope soon to see the honourable gentleman, - completely restored, amongst us again ?",73
709,Mr HUTCHISON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"Hindmarsh) [r 1.3]. I wish to suggest to the Acting Prime Minister the desirableness of reverting to the old hours of meeting. I think that until we have disposed of the Tariff we should meet has Mr as before, at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesdays, and should adjourn for dinner for only one hour instead of one hour and a quarter.",73
710,Mr JOHNSON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,The additional quarter .of an hour is appreciated by those who go home to dinner.,73
711,Mr HUTCHISON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"F o r years, when the pressure of business was not so great as it is today, we had only an hour for dinner, and I fail to see why we should not revert to the old practice until we have dealt with the Tariff.",74

713,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"Maribyrnong - Postmaster-General) [n.5] - I shall have pleasure in laying upon the table of the Library the papers, relating to the Brunswick post office. As to the pole-dressers, to whom reference has been made by the honourable member for Melbourne, I may say that I issued orders to the. effect that all casual hands should receive the rates of pay enjoyed by workers outside the Department, and that my minute resulted in the raising of the wages of these casual hands from 8s. to 10s. per day. The Commissioner subsequently determined to appoint permanent men to these positions, and he classified their work as being"", that, not of carpenters or shipwrights, but of labourers, and fixed the rate of pay at 8s. per day.",74
714,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,Builders ' labourers in Melbourne are now getting 8s. per day.,74
715,Mr MAUGER,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"I have represented to the Public Service Commissioner that this is skilled labour, and that it should be paid for at the rate of 10s. per day. But I have no control over that officer's classification, and he considers that his expert advice is of such a character that he cannot authorize the payment of more than 8s. per day. 'He is now calling for applications for permanent employees at that rate. I have told him that I do not consider that that is a fair wage for the work. - Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan) [11.6] I desire to make a personal explanation. I understand that, during my absence, as well as after I put in an appearance .toriight, the honourable member for CoolgarcTie referred to me and criticised me on account of several, votes which he said I gave upon the Tariff several years ago. He seemed to desire to prove that I shall be inconsistent if I do' not vote now exactly in the same way as I did more than five years ago - It is a well-known rule that members of Parliament who join Governments have to sinktheir individual opinions in many respects-bu t not, - of course, in matters affecting their consciences, or which are so grave as to necessitate their separating themselves from their colleagues. A member of. a Cabinet cannot, consistently with the loyal support which' he owes-to his colleagues, absent himself from divisions. But I-have no objection now to saying that, in regard to some of the excessive duties of the old Tariff, as well as in regard to some other minor .matters,. I held certain opinions not fully shared by my colleagues. Every one who has anything to do . with Governments, or with companies, or with business of any kind, knows, however, that every one has to sink his individual views to some extent. For the honourable member to parade votes which he states I gave as a subordinate member of the Government, in loyalty to my colleagues, who were in 'a majority in that Government, and to base upon those votes a ciiarge of inconsistency against me, was, I think, as unnecessary as it was unfair. .",74
716,Mr WATKINS,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,W as it not a protectionist Government ?,74
717,Sir JOHNFORREST,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"Yes , certainly it was, but there are many grades of protection. I repeat that a man who joins a Government is compelled to be loyal to his colleagues, and may not always wholly approve of what is proposed. I have never, been an excessive protectionist. I am a good moderate protectionist, but not a prohibitionist. I feel myself at liberty at the present time-fiv e years after the other Tariff was dealt with-to do what I consider, under the existing conditions of Australia, to be right and just to my State and' the Commonwealth, and not to be unduly bound by votes which, under other circumstances, I then gave in concert with those with whom I was associated.",74
718,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"Coolgardie) [11.9] I very much regret that the right honourable member for Swan should regard my criticisms as unfair or unnecessary. I feel, sure that if he had been here and heard the whole of my speech he would have viewed it much more philosophically, and would have shown much less heat, if he had replied at all.",74
719,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,There is no heat.,74
720,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"The right honourable member has often accused the party with which I am proud to be associated of being caucus dominated and iron bound. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - So it is.' M i . MAHON - The fact that the"" right honourable member,, as a Cabinet Minister, absolutely ' surrendered his own private opinions and judgment and voted for duties which crushed the primary industries of his own State constitutes a painful picture, which has no replica in the gallery of the Labour Party.",74
721,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,What does the honourable member want me to do? Does lie want me to vote for high duties again* It seems to me that he is spiteful and venomous.,75
722,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"If that is the mood of the right honourable gentleman, I feel inclined to say no more.",75
723,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,The honourable member has said enough. He ought not to have said anything at all.,75
724,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"Since I have no intention or desire of wounding his feelings, right honourable member need not be so vigorous in his retorts. Personally, I come his change of view, and recognise that in politics, as in other spheres, there must be intellectual, progression.",75
725,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,I have a case which I will bring up against the honourable ber tomorrow. It is worse than anything he has said about me.,75
726,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"I believe the right honber orable member expects me to congratulate him on adopting a saner view. But what I object to is this parade of suddenly-acthat quired virtue in opposing high protectionist duties; when, as a matter of fact, as have reminded him, he voted for exactly such duties a few years ago - Mr. JOSEPH COOK",75
727,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,The honourable member has said that he intends to vote for take exception. high duties.,75
728,Mr MAHON,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"No , I did not. The been complaints. honourable member should not jump to such conclusions. What I said was that I cognised that the people of Australia have declared for protection, and that I would not stand in the way of giving effect to their decision. ,1 recognise that a certain amount of protection is considered to be necessary, but I am not going to vote for heavy' duties on appliances used in the primary industries; nor shall I vote, in case, for protectionist duties, unless they are accompanied by proper protection given to the worker and the consumer.",75
729,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"It is understood tend. that the honourable member will vote for the protection proposed by this Government. Mr .MAHON - Some of the honourable members sitting behind the acting leader of the Opposition intend to do the same. In conclusion, let me repeat my regret if I have said anything to hurt the feelings of the right honourable member for Swan. I really did not intend to do so. I can assure him, with perfect sincerity, that I did not imagine that he would take my remarks as he has done. I certainly did not wish to be offensive, and if I have said anything which he considers to be unfair to him I regret it.",75
730,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,I accept that.,75
731,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATEMENTOFSTATEEXPENDITUREOUTOFREVENUE,"Hume-Trea surer) [11.13] - O ne o r t w 0 questions have been put to me, which I desire to answer. - In reference to the extension of the dinner hour, all that I have to say is that the necessity exists whether the Tariff is under the consideration or not. The reason why the extension of time was made was that the welsuspension of the sitting for a bare hour did not afford honourable members an opportunity to go from the House to their residences to dinner. Some honourable members were very anxious for the slight extension of time, and I cannot say that memthe Government are prepared to make any change at present. In reference to the question put to me by the honourable memfor Lang, I have to say that the health, of the Prime Minister is improving. But, at the same time, I do not think it would do him any good to read some of the things which have taken place toI night. Honourable members know the Prime Minister's character just as well as I do. - I do not think that anything has been said to which he could Sir WILLI AM LYNE - There have",75
