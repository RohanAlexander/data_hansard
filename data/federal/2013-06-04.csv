Or are we at risk of seeing commitments around Central Australia, Indigenous health altogether and back to consolidated this would be an adverse outcome. I wanted to ask specifically about the viciously cut off in November last year, leaving many Indigenous Australians have now become them before-that is, state dental services. That have you made an assessment of the degree Indigenous Australians in 2013 and since the you looked at the states that have the lowest seaboard states in particular-and have you And those that do have dental agreements, month, still treating as many Indigenous Australians as they were this time last year?

How will that work Australian presenting to an AMS and you arrangement, does this entail a trip to the public long waiting list-often 2Â½ years or longer?

Lastly, I have two small matters. Firstly, which exists in Caboolture.

I know you would agree that post-CDDS environment. The CDDS was cruelly and the sickest adults in particular vulnerable, and utterly reliant on what was not looking after is another debate. But, specifically, Minister, of access and availability to dental care for termination of the CDDS? In particular, have per capita dental investment-those eastern looked specifically at AMSs around the country? are they actually, year on year and month on with chronic and complex dental disease be a fair assessment. Has the number of people if so, do you have a view on that? provincial cities up the eastern seaboard that have are no longer able to access the CDDS, which 12,000 dentists from being able to provide any Can you help me with the commitment of state in a practical way: if you are an Indigenous are told that there is no longer a CDDS hospital?

Is the assessment assessment of the asylum claim, which would security threat is present? Is the minister looking in relation to this individual? If that is the be required on the asylum claim, because convention provides no obligation on Australia circumstances. I would be interested to know it on the national security issue Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (Gorton-Minister (19:36): I thank the honourable member for too. Can I go to the question that was asked Minister for Immigration and Citizenship by to the assessment or otherwise of three individuals. letter to the member for Stirling indicated accordance with 'the particular circumstances The matter raised in parliament today referred three, who has not yet lodged a valid application parliament today, has not been assessed. He valid application. To that extent, of course, an application. On the wider question of security, is that the person in question has been in detention. Attorney-General or by the Minister for Home to this, but there has been, of course, engagement Federal Police and with ASIO on this What I want to do, and I am happy to do written to me sometime this afternoon, is more than willing for the department to brief relation to the individual in question. They are be afforded to the shadow minister, the Stirling, if that is required. I am advised twice by ASIO in respect of this matter, but Australian Federal Police, have not, until opposition. I think it is entirely proper that response to the request. Some questions raised by the member for the is for that reason that the shadow Attorney-General I will try and deal with these in one and then processing of the claim of this individual, the shadow minister for immigration stated that the individuals, including the one I referred to, are the minister said that he had received advice I am just looking for an update as to what is the what is the nature of that assessment? and the AFP that there is an individual who that the department is going through an be unnecessary in the event that a national at whether there is a national security threat case, I would assume that no further action would the minister would be well aware that the to afford people protection in those what assessment process has been conducted. Is or is it on the asylum claim issue? for Immigration and Citizenship) his questions, and important questions they are in relation to a letter written to me as Acting the member for Stirling insofar as issues that go In relation to this particular matter, the that progress by the department is being made in of the three individuals'. to a particular individual, who is one of the for protection and therefore, as I said in the has not been assessed and there has not been a it is still possible for an individual to make such the first thing I note, as I have said before, I was not here for the responses by the Affairs on questions asked of them in relation by my department with the Australian matter for some considerable time. so here by way of response to the letter that was make clear to the honourable member that I am the honourable member on these matters in sensitive issues. The briefing, I think, should member for Cook, and indeed to the member for that the shadow Attorney-General has been briefed the agencies, that is the department and the today, been formally requested to brief the that occur and I am happy to put that in train in Cook should not be answered in full detail. It asked for a briefing and received two briefings on the matter. I think, for that reason, this matter conducted by the shadow Attorney-General, member to have a briefing and then, if there agencies, we would certainly assist. The only caveat I put on any briefing, of opposition not disclose sensitive matters. But opposition and, indeed, the honourable member the opportunity for such a briefing. We take national security very seriously. This with appropriately. I want to assist the opposition. the honourable member has a high regard for them. I would be very happy for him, as I practicable in order for him Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (19:40): portfolio responsibility where there is a yawning like to spend some time drilling down to some class of visa. I know this has been the subject of quite mass media and, indeed, within the parliament the Migration Council of Australia has done have had access to the 457 class of visa familiar with, some of the material that has investigations. I take the view that the vast majority of rorting it, that they are using it for legitimate to skill shortages. But I have looked at some particularly the growth in the use of 457 visas Coming from an electorate such as mine, where seven per cent and higher in some suburbs, unemployment-I find it very difficult to believe people, who are ready, willing and able to access to 457-visa workers. I would be interested in hearing your response working on a proposed raft of reforms to the whether in putting together those reforms that that are operating in other jurisdictions schemes-any reforms that may have been introduced likely to see similar sorts of reforms introduced might introduce into this parliament? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (Gorton-Minister (19:43): I thank the honourable member for temporary skilled stream, the 457 consistent with the opposition's approach to it would be wise for the honourable are further questions he would ask of me or of course, is that the convention applies that the I do believe that it is entirely proper that the who has asked these questions, be afforded is an important matter, and it should be dealt I know-I am sure-that it is the case that these agencies, and is not seeking to reflect on said, to have that briefing to as quickly as to be across all of these matters. Minister, there are many areas of your gap between the facts and the fears. I would of the facts, particularly in relation to the 457 some debate within the community, within the over recent months. I am aware that recently some survey work in this area of employers who scheme. I am also aware, and have made myself been reported as a result of that survey and other employers who are accessing the scheme are not labour market shortages-particularly in relation of the areas that have been included in the report, in the retail industry and in the hotel industry. there is above average unemployment-over and even higher again when it comes to youth that there are not people, particularly young perform some of the jobs that have applied for to that issue. I know that you have been 457-visa category. I would be interested to know you have appraised yourself of similar schemes and in other countries, and the nature of those in other countries-and whether we are as a result of any package of reforms that you for Immigration and Citizenship) his important question in relation to the scheme. It is an important scheme. As the government made clear when foreshadowed reforms on 23 February this extent, a culmination of work that had been deficiencies in the scheme and to identify abuses necessarily unlawful or illegal abuses, they that I mean, of course, that there had not there were shortages or not before some looking within their own communities. I do not think was really the genesis of always intended that the scheme would be one sectors and regions where they existed. But compliance, and for that reason my predecessor, information from the department insofar as options incoming minister, I realised it was important really critical that we get the We have a situation where immigration is economic, social and cultural success. Immigration migrant, I feel I have been privileged by coming here to work and to find a place where their place. Australia is probably the best example richness of our society, which has been continually to a large extent we have a bipartisan We have a non-discriminatory immigration position on the proportion of those permanent also the two-thirds that come here via the permanent are the other mechanisms we use to provide labour holiday-maker visa, whether it is the student which is absolutely important. But to maintain vital that there are sufficient oversights contraventions of the scheme. This is a very any improper practices in areas of immigration to see is a lack of confidence These reforms as advised by the department raises a really important question about what young kids who would get jobs in his jobs? unemployed have available to them? How do we ensure that we provide the intentionally or unintentionally displacing ensure that the 457 scheme is used when sufficient evidence to suggest that is not the Council of Australia has indicated that 15 said they have no problems finding local employees opportunity and they go directly to overseas applicants' employment conditions being cut. (Time expired) we foreshadowed reforms-indeed, when I year-we made clear that this was, to a large undertaken by the department to identify that occurred. Most of those cases were not were more abuse of the intent of the scheme. By been any demonstrable way to establish whether employers sought labour from overseas without the scheme when it was created. I think it was to respond to legitimate skill shortages in over time. I think there had been a lack of the member for MCMahon, received available for reform. With that brief, as an to act on those reforms because I thought it integrity of this scheme right. absolutely vital and critical to this nation's has helped build this country.

The honourable member does it mean for prospective employees-that is, What options do workers who may be currently labour that our employees need without those opportunities?

Given the statement by the Minister for Home this parliament when he was advised of these the process by which he did that I do not answer the following questions and somehow When was the department advised by terrorist being held at the Inverbrackie facility? When was this minister advised that a convicted facility? And when was the previous minister terrorist was being held at the Inverbrackie Minister after he became aware that a convicted detention facility?

That is why I have afforded and indeed his colleagues, to be briefed by agencies-I understand that. I do not think providing briefings from all three agencies, the remit and portfolio of the Minister for portfolio of the Attorney-General. I made the point that ASIO have already to say that there cannot be further briefings, outlined. I can assure the honourable member reason, we wanted to make sure that the department could. The secretary to the department had relation to the protocols among agencies-something department was already dealing with that when to move to other matters but, given the to this matter of the convicted terrorist. I House yesterday to have a briefing. I have written Attorney-General and the shadow minister for a joint briefing from ASIO, the AFP and DIAC in testimony that is out there can be reconciled went on. I accept from the minister that there obviously should be held in privacy. That is why I an independent inquiry into this on his own Affairs earlier, who was quite happy to tell matters-he gave specific dates about that and accept the minister's suggestion that we cannot these are a breach of national security.

That is not with only one condition-the one I have already that I take this matter most seriously. For that were doing everything they possibly made clear that assessments would be made in I called for. The secretary to the I responded to the brief and made it clear, in making assessments about the protocols, arrangements among agencies. I know matters have been raised about the there has been monitoring and surveillance of will not disclose-the member would understand protection of our citizens. That is why I have right thing and will do a professional job department will provide me with his assessment ensure that everything is being done and arrangements for people in detention, ensuring concerns people might have can be allayed. As I said, I am very happy to arrange the get the appropriate officers from all three Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (19:55): about the 457 class of visa, and you may have debate time limits. I want to return to that Australia were to introduce legislation that seeking access to 457 visas to test the local who were ready, willing and able to perform Australia were to introduce laws such as that, world, of all those with a similar visa requirements? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (Gorton-Minister (19:56): I thank the member for Throsby somewhat, earlier.

The secretary to the once he engages with those agencies, to will continue to be done in relation to the that any risks are mitigated and that any briefing as soon as practicable, ensuring that we agencies to brief the opposition when we can. Minister, in an earlier question I asked you been cut short in answering that question due to issue and put a question squarely to you: if imposed a requirement on employers who were labour market and, if there were local workers those jobs, to offer those jobs to them first. If would Australia be the only country around the system in operation, which had those sorts of for Immigration and Citizenship) for raising the question again. I did digress point, and that is that Australia is not alone in Indeed, I can confirm to the honourable to Australia: very rapid growth in their widespread concern that the scheme was being advised that the Canadian response has been to before a visa can be issued. Work permits are opinion or a confirmation obtained from Human which is a government agency. Once the labour apply for a work permit-and I can go to the to those offered to Canadians working in the to hire or train Canadians for the job create new job opportunities or help retain jobs skills and knowledge to Canadians; and ï· the hiring of the foreign worker will not affect worker involved in such a dispute You can imagine that last one refers specifically person from overseas while industrial action Prime Minister of Canada during question time Not only has the government indicated for some time workers program, but in the budget last year specifically vacancies with people who are seeking as we know it, unemployment benefitsWe have been very clear.

I note that the public evidence that was provided by ASIO individual was a convicted terrorist and on a convicted terrorist at the Inverbrackie facility. April that he became aware of and was briefed April that the individual was transferred a labour dispute or the employment of any Canadian to where an employer seeks to bring in a is taking place, which is prohibited.

I also note that it was on 17 to high security in Villawood. In that context I would like to know from and months passed, under him and the previous that such a significant character, a convicted facility in Inverbrackie. Neither minister had in that place. Does the minister think that background: the minister would be aware that detention centre anywhere in the country, his process. That is the evidence provided by former It is a normal process for this minister to be detention centre, but when you have a convicted is not told and his predecessor was not told. One of the very few occasions I had some day he sat before Ray Hadley in a Sydney improvised explosive device in a detention centre. and he had not been advised by the department. very light touch applied by the department in that event. What concerns me, on the minister's to keep this government in the dark on things with that. The budget assumes 13,200 arrivals in 2013-14. and I do not think the minister would dispute the forward estimates the government has projected annum in 2015-16 and 2016-17 based on the whether the minister can state here that he the budget as currently presented is a reliable arrivals are now occurring at a rate of over arrivals of 1,100 per month next year. I also note the evidence given in Senate Finance and Deregulation, Mr Tune, who, when on stopping the boats, he said: ''If I ask the minister: is he confident that, Fiscal Outlook, the figures that he, along with the likely expenditure for next year and out scrutiny through the PEFO process? And does will have an average rate of arrivals next policies? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (Gorton-Minister (20:05): Of course, I rely upon agencies, finance governments, to make assessments.
