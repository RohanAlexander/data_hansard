2,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Has the Acting Prime Minister received any communication from the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) approving of the action of the Government in removing Mr Jensen from office?,21
3,Mr WATT,Unknown,I have not yet received a reply to my cable. QUARANTINED TRANSPORTS.,21
4,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"A personal friend freezing who has held a position of some responsihe bility in the Expeditionary Forces has sent me this telegram from Western Australia:Con nothing be done to give men aboard, transports at Fremantle a fighting chance for their lives? They went prepared to fight die in our behalf. Surely Australia cannot leave tbem like dogs menaced with destrucdrawn tion. . What chance have men cooped up as they are on board shipT The present position is monstrous. He suggests that the men should be given their freedom on Garden Island or Rottducts. nest. In view of the information to hand this morning that a desperate and almost sucoessful attempt was made by some men to get ashore at Fremantle from a quarantined transport, does not the Minister for Trade and Customs think it highly advisable, and, indeed, necessary, that the healthy men who are being detained as contacts on board the transports should be allowed some freedom ashore, and at the same time be kept in safety by being confined to one or other of the islands off Fremantle?",21
5,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The men who attempted to land without permission did not come from a vessel carrying influenza cases. They came, not from the-Boonah, as was reported in the press, but from another transport that has been held up for a short period to enable those on hoard to undergo treatment which will insure that, although the vessel is healthy, the men she is bringing, who have come from infected ports, shall not act as carriers' of the disease. All the transports are held up for this treatment... .I shall look into the other matter to which the honourable member referred, to see whether it is possible .to do what he suggests.",21
6,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,And treat the subject as an urgent one ?,21
7,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Yes . NA VESSELS.  Acting Minister for the Navy (Mr. Poynton), I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, seeing that there is now a drought, and stock are realizing only 3d. a lh. in the metropolitan market as against an export price of 6d., and as all space is being quickly taken up, will arrange with the Imperial authorities that as many vessels as possible having refrigerated space shall be sent here to carry our beef and mutton overseas ?",21
8,Mr WATT,NEED FOR REFRIGERATED,"The Government, in the and representations made through the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), has frequently the attention of the' authorities at Home to the need of providing refrigerated space for the carriage of meat, butter, apples, and other perishable proWe are doing all that we can to obtain such accommodation. NA REPORT.",21
9,Mr TUDOR,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"On the 29th November, I asked the Acting Prime Minister a question regarding the premature publication by some newspapers of the Repatriation Department's report. matter had been referred to in the Senate on the previous day by a senator from New South Wales, and it had been said that one newspaper in Sydney- I think it was the Daily Telegraph-ha d not held back the report in accordance with instructions. I ask the Acting Prime Minister if he will inquire why the Adelaide Advertiser did not obey this instruction, which was observed by the Register and the Herald there. The honourable gentleman promised to ascertain the facts, and L shall be glad if he will let me have them before the Estimates come on, as I wish to say something on the matter?",22
10,Mr WATT,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"My recollection is that <I sent to the Department for information on the subject, but I do not remember having received an answer. I shall see that the honourable member' is told what he wants to know. WHEAT GUARANTEES AND SALE.",22
11,Mr SAMPSON,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,Has the Acting Prime Minister any further statement to make regarding the first payments for the incoming wheat crop; and the result of the negotiations overseas for the sale of further wheat?,22
12,Mr WATT,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"The negotiations to which I referred last week, when replying to a question by the honourable member, have not yet been finalized. Correspondence has to take place between Melbourne and Sydney, which means delay, whether letters or telegrams are 'sent. I hope, however, to have the arrangements in such a state that I shall be able to make a statement regarding both the payment of the guarantees on the coming crop, and the sale of further wheat, some time this week. CENSORSHIP.",22
13,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"The following paraorgans graph appears in this morning's Argus, headed ""Hindering Earlier Peace"": Whenever the Allies were winning Great Britain refused to consider "" peace talk,"" and whenever the Germanic Alliance was winning Von Ludendorff refused to consider peace . . . Great Britain always seemed ready to crush Germany, and only President Wilson seemed ready to give her reasonable terms.",22
14,Mr WATT,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,Who wrote that?,22
15,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"I do not know. It The is an ordinary paragraph. ""Ur. WATT - No , it is not.",22
16,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"The question of the honourable .member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) is not in order. I have frequently pointed out, and my predecessors in office have done the same, that a question founded on a newspaper statement is not in order unless the member asking it is prepared to vouch for the accuracy of the statement.",22
17,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister why the capitalistic press is allowed to print paragraphs such as that which I have just read, which a Labour or socialistic organ is prevented from reproducing or punished if publication does take place? Why should the editor of the Argus be allowed to go scotfree for doing things for which the editor of a Labour journal would be sent to gaol?",22
18,Mr WATT,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"Firs t of all, I assume that the honourable member implies that the Argus is an organ of the capitalistic pTess:",22
19,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,Undoubtedly .,22
20,Mr WATT,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"I should like some proof of that. If the journals of this country are to be divided in that sheep-and-goats fashion, as either capitalistic or socialistic, a large number of the brightest and happiest organs in the country will remain unclassified.",22
21,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,There are only two sorts of journals-capitalisti c and Labour.,22
22,Mr WATT,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"That remark only shows the sort of error that presides over the otherwise bright intellect of the honourable member. He assumes that some of the press may print statements which other organs may not print. I believe there was a time when, for certain reasons, the Censor's Department was accused of such differentiation. I do not think it is accused of anything of the kind now.",22
23,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,The position is exactly the same now.,23
24,Mr WATT,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"Has any organ of the socialistic press published on Monday been denied the right to publish Count Czernin's statement? I would advise the honourable member to acquaint himself with the facts before he makes statements, and I suggest that, in future, when he concludes, either inadvertently or otherwise, that a certain article has been written by an Argus writer in Melbourne, he ought to be sure that it mary of a speech made by the Austrian Premier. IRISH INTERNEES .",23
25,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,Will the Acting Prime Minister say whether Cabinet has yet taken into consideration the advisableness of releasing the Irishmen who are interned in the Commonwealth?,23
26,Mr WATT,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"Cabine t has been dealing with that matter today. If the honourable member will give notice of his question, I will answer it tomorrow. CONSTRUCTION OF WORKMEN'S upon Russians in Brisbane? HOUSES.",23
27,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"As it assertions. appears to be the policy of the Governto ment to build houses for workmen, will the Minister for Works and Railways consider the claims of other centres as well as Lithgow, for consideration in that respect?",23
28,Mr GROOM,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"The construction of houses for workmen is undertaken by the Department of Works and Railways only on the requisition of the Department concerned. For instance, the Defence Deinfluenza partment, which has a large factory at Lithgow, made a requisition to*the vernment for the provision of more housregarding ing accommodation. As to whether house construction will be undertaken in centres, that will depend on a requisiWales ? tion coming from some Department for better housing accommodation for its ployees at such centres. TRANSPORT MEDIC.",23
29,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"Has the Acting Prime Minister been made aware of grave statements which have been, circulated concerning the conduct of those in authority on the transport Medic, who are said to have been directly responsible for about thirty deaths. Allegations also have been made as to certain mismanagement of the vessel on the trip to Sydney and at Sydney. Will the Government take steps to have an independent civilian inquiry into these charges, apart altogether from any inquiry by the is not a sum- Defence Department? - Mr Watt - I am totally at a loss to understand to what the honourable member is referring.

30,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLICATIO N OF REPATRIATION,"Has the Acting Prime Minister made any inquiries, following upon a series of questions I asked some time ago, regarding Anatole Melentievitch Mendrin, an ex-police spy of the Czar, who is now being employed by the Commonwealth Police Force in spying",23

Having regard to these facts, in seeking for a suitable site. for a quarantine station South Wales, will he look further south?",24
36,Mr MASSYGREENE,NEW SOUTH WALES,I have already that the whole subject will shortly be investigated.,24
37,Mr KELLY,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Will ' the Acting M in ister for Trade and Customs ascertain if it is not a fact that a number of .buildings erected on. the southern shores of Port Stephens have been absolutely .unused during the last two or. three years, and that they are eminently for the accommodation of persons to quarantined ? Will he also take consideration the fact that since Port Stephens is such an excellent harbour, ""is specially suited' for a quarantine station ?",24

39,Mr FINLAYSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether it is instructions were issued by the Censor that the press was not to publish details of the battalion colours of the Australian Imperial Force. As the Argus has defied that instruction, and published details, what action do the Government propose to take against that journal ?",24

71,Mr MASSYGREENE,REPORTS AS TO CONDITION OF PATIENTS,"On the 10th December, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lynch) asked the following question :Will the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, as administrator of the Quarantine Act, see that urgent telegrams sent by the patients or relatives of patients in quarantine, who are known to be dangerously ill , are attended since much indignation is being expressed throughout the country in regard to what seems to be the ignoring of these very important messages ? I am now in a position to supply the following information:The actual procedure at the present moment is that at 0 a.m. and 3 p.m. each day a report as to the condition of every patient is sent from the Quarantine Station by telephone ta the Sydney office. This notification is available to any inquirer, and is published in the daily press, both morning and afternoon, so that it is immediately available to any person who is interested. Direct inquiries by telegram or letterare answered when received. In connection with military patients, Base Records Office is also advised if inquiries are received through them. On the 10th December, the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked the following questions: Will the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs tell the House the names and positions of any persons who have visited the Quarantine Ground in Sydney and been permitted to leave without having to remain in quarantine for the remaining period? I ' am now in a position to supply the following information:The actual position is as I stated on 10th December-that occasional communication by responsible officers with the Administrative Offices on the station has occurred, but the segregation of patients is complete. On the 11th December, the honourable memberf o r Eden-Monaro (Mr Austi n Chapman) asked the following question : In view of the expressed desire of a large' number of people in and around Sydney for the removal of the Quarantine Station from North Head, will the Minister in Charge of Quarantine have inquiries made regarding the suitability of Broken Bay for a quarantine station ? The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) also asked:In the absence of the honourable member for North Sydney, I ask the Minister in Charge of Quarantine it he will look into the suitability of Jervis Bay as a site for a quarantine station for New South Wales? I now desire to say that, at present, owing to the fact that the Director of Quarantine is so fully occupied with the actually present risk from the introduction of the influenzal epidemic into Australia, it is not possible to make immediate to, inquiries as to suitable alternative sites. Such inquiries may, however, be made at a later date, when there is more favourable opportunity for doing so. TRANSPORTS. ACCOMMODATION FOR INVALIDS.",31
72,Mr WISE,REPORTS AS TO CONDITION OF PATIENTS,"On the 10th December, ""the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked the following question:In viow of the fact that our soldiers have offered the sacrifice of their lives; will the Government cable an instruction to London that the best deck on each transport shall be reserved for the soldiers and officers who are most severely injured, and for those who are physically the weakest? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :The instructions which have been issued to the transport officers and to the medical officers in charge of transports fully meet the suggestions put forward by Dr Maloney. The Director of Medical Services of the Australian Imperial Force, who is now in Australia, fully - confirms this. GALLIPOLI STAR.",32
73,Mr WISE,REPORTS AS TO CONDITION OF PATIENTS,"On the 10th December, the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr. Hector Lamond) asked the following question:Will the Assistant Minister for Defence confer with the Minister for Defence, with a view to making a statement in the House as to the exact position in regard to the proposed Gallipoli decoration? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following informatroops tion :It had been proposed to grant a special Gallitheir poli Star, but serions difficulties arose, owing strong objections taken not only by members Parliament and press in England, but by the Dominion troops themselves, to the issue decorations to the Dominion troops serving in Gallipoli which could not be conferred on their British comrades who shared the dangers and hardships. Extension of this decoration would have involved even more serious' anomalies for demands for issue of an indefinite number of further campaign decorations which would have become - irresistible. . A committee, presided over by General Seely. to whom His Majesty's Government intrusted consideration of the question, made the ing proposal, which has been adopted:1. The 1914 Star, in its present form, granted under conditions now approved as defined in Army Order 35 of 1917. 2. 1914 Star, with the same riband, but bearing 'an altered date, namely,. 191415, to be extended to all those ineligible for the 1914 Star who served in the campaign in a theatre of war prior to 31st December, 1915. To be granted to all those who arrived in such theatre of war on duty and with proper authority prior to that date. 3. "" Theatre of war"" has been defined by the Army Council, in consultation with the Admiralty and Air Board, thus:(a) All Australian, New Zealand, and Newfoundland troops who fought in Gallipoli, as well as all the British and Indian troops who were on the Peninsula, with very few exceptions. (&) The 1st Canadian Division, the Cavalry Brigade, and the early reinforcements, both who fought at the second battle of Ypres and at battle of Festubert. (c) All those who fought in German South-West Africa, and nearly all the Indian troops who fought in East Africa. (d) All British, Dominion, and Indian troops who fought in the defence of Egypt. (e) All troops who took part in the operations in German New Guinea during 1914. {/) All officers and rating of ""the Royal Navy and Royal Marines who served on a ship at sea during the first year of the war. (JF) All members of flying services fulfilling the prescribed conditions. The above solution removes the anomaly of serving in the same theatre of war side by side and not receiving the same reward for services, and gives to nearly all those who to first responded to the call of duty a decoration of which will be extremely highly prized, and which hitherto has been confined only to those of who rendered this service in France. It will also remove the existing anomaly by which the 1914 Star is issued to many thousands of oflicers and men whose duty kept them at a base in France far away from the fighting line, whereas officers and men who offered their services at the beginning of the war, and took part in the fighting on Gallipoli or Festubert are ineligible for any special decoration. The grant by the King himself of one decoration to British, - Dominion, and Indian troops alike will followsymbolize the unity of the Empire. His Majesty's Government are aware that be great importance has been attached in Australia and New .Zealand .to a special decoration for.Gallipoli. In view of the grant of the 1914-15 Star, a special clasp on the war medal will be given for the Gallipoli operations. . RETURNED MUNITION WORKERS. EMPLOYME NT IN AUSTRALIA.",32
74,Mr WISE,REPORTS AS TO CONDITION OF PATIENTS,"On the 11th December, the honourable member for Hunter (M Charlton) asked the following question:Has provision been made for the employment, on their return, of the men go home as munition workers T Failing employment, will they be provided for 'until they can get work ? I am now able to furnis h the honourable member with the following informaI tion :The agreement under which munition workers tion :proceed to Great Britain terminates upon their arrival in Australia. The Government does not undertake to find employment for these men on their return, nor can it see its way to incur any further financial obligations in respect of munition workers. Action is being taken, ever, immediately advice is received of embarkation of the men in England, to furnish to the Chambers of Manufactures and Labour Bureaux in the various States lists of the men returning, together with the occupations they follow, for the information of any firms in search of any particular class of labour.

The following paper was presented: Post and Telegraph Act - Begulations Amended-Statutor y Bules 1918, Nos. 249, 255, 265, 287, 289, 290, 291, 306, 307, 311. BARRACKS. WAR - TI ME PROFITS TA X . ASSESSMENT BILL . In Committee (Consideration resumed r o m 13th December, vide page 9296) : Postponed clause 5Section 12 of the principal Act is amended(a) by omitting from sub-section (1) thereof all words from and including the words "" the greater of the following sums "", and inserting in their stead the words "" the statutory per, centage per annum on the amount by which the capital has been increased.""; and (b) by omitting from sub-section (3) thereof the words "" the greater of the following sums,"" and paragraphs (a) and (b), and inserting in their stead the words "" the statutory percentage per annum on. the amount by which the capital has been decreased :"".",33
77,Sir ROBERT BEST,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Kooyong) [3.35]. - Clause 5 is to amend section 12' of the principal Act, and section 12 provides that as where there is an increase of capital 2; above the pre-war standard of capital senemployed during an accounting period, in order to ascertain the taxable profits certain methods have to be resorted to. It is provided that there shall be deducted either the percentage standard or the pre-war standard of profits, whichever be the greater. Clause 5 proposes to strike out the option provided for by section 12, namely, that it is competent for' the taxpayer to deduct the pre-war standard of profits so far as increased capital is concerned. This is a very serious innovation,, and it is proposed to date it back to the 1st July, 1916, or twelve months before the section was actually enacted. The effect of the proposed alteration is very serious, and will most greviously hurt and penalize those who endeavoured to expand their business by an increase of capital. The Treasurer (Mr Watt) will remember the circumstances under which this option to select the pre-war standard of profits was deliberately inserted by Parliament. In the original Bill introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), who was then Treasurer, it was provided that under circumstances of the kind where increased capital was introduced during an accounting period, the taxpayer should be at liberty to deduct the statutory percentage, and the statutory percentage alone, which was then fixed at 6 per cent., so far as companies are concerned, and 7 per cent, in the case of individuals. When the new Bill was introduced by the late Lord Forrest in August last, there was a new clause inserted providing that the taxpayer should have the option of deducting the statutory percentage, or, if he so desired, the pre-war standard of profits, whichever happened to be the greater.",33
78,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,He could take the alternative.,34
79,Sir ROBERT BEST,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"He could exercise the option-takin g either one or the other. That provision was deliberately introduced, and passed by Parliament, and was a direct amendment of the provisions of the measure introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia. Business men, manufacturers in particular, have since then relied upon getting the benefit of that pre-war standard of percentage, and have invested their money, profits and otherwise, in plant and in other directions, with the aim and object of expanding their establishments; but now they are told that they are to be denied the advantage of what they have done on the. authority of Parliament and in the ordinary course of their business operations. Besides its retrospective effect, the clause seeks to wipe-out the option given* by section 12 of the Act. Huge businesses will not suffer in any way. The clause will penalize the smaller businesses, the new and struggling concerns, which are progressive in character, and find it necessary from time to time to increase their capital with a view to expansion. I have no wish to repeat the illustrations I gave in dealing with this matter on the second reading. One will be suflicient. A small manufacturer, with a capital of £8,000, was called upon to pay £187 last year under the provisions of the Act as it now stands, but if the Committee agrees to_ this clause he will be called upon to pay £887 for that period. This year, under the Act as it stands, on his present figures and estimates, he would have been called upon to pay nothing in the shape of wartime profits taxation; but if this clause is agreed to he will be called upon to pay £1,000. The clause is a deliberate blow at the industries of the country, particularly the new and struggling ones, and, in view' of the fact that manufacturers, relying on the wording of the Act, felt that they were at liberty to exercise the option of selecting either a percentage standard or a pre-war standard of profits, it will be very unjust to them to give a retrospective effect to this legislation. I urge the Treasurer to strike out the' clause, or, at least, amend it so that it will not operate before the 1st January next. I do not doubt the right of Parliament to make any alteration in the law so far as the future operation of it is concerned, but retrospective legislation is vicious and dangerous from every standpoint. It is the retrospective character of the clause against which I particularly protest. It will create many hardships, and will deal a serious blow to industries.",34
80,Mr BRUCE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Flinders) [3.45] - The proposal to delete section 12 aims at collecting a retrospective tax upon a matter which the whole business community imagined was settled, finished, and done with. While no business man would imagine for a moment that a contract with the Government is absolutely binding, and cannot be altered by Parliament, there is an impression among the business community that there was a contract with them embodied in the section, of the_Act which it is now. sought to delete from the Statute. Acting on that contract, many firms have dealt with the profits they have made, and which they believed were legitimately theirs. In some cases they have put them back into the businesses by the installation of new machinery, or by the expansion.of their operations. In other cases, part of the money has been distributed in the shape of dividends, which have increased the value of their shares. If section 12 is leted, totally innocent persons, who have acquired these shares, will suffer an appreciable and severe drop in the value of their stock. If the-provision had placed certain people in the community in the position of being able to rob the public by profiteering, the fact that the business community imagined that the Government had made a bargain with them would be no ground for objecting to the right of Parliament to - remedy what was obviously wrong; but this has not occurred. The only people to whom the provision can apply are those who have established new businesses. It does not apply to old businesses which canshow a satisfactory percentage on the huge volume of capital in their business prior to the war. On the second reading, I endeavoured to demonstrate that young businesses, may perfectly legitimately earn 40 per cent, or 50 per cent, on their capital during the first two or three years, and at the same time be selling to the public at the very minimum of profit. Those honourable members who heard my remarks will recognise that there is nothing vicious in a young business making a large percentage of profit upon its capital. It may not be doing, so on its turn-over. It may possibly be making a very much smaller profit on its turn-over than well-established businesses are making. We are all firmly convinced that it is essential that we should try to help our young, struggling industries; and we Mr Bruce. should be very ill-advised if, through the fear that one or two businesses maybe entitled to retain too much profit, we place such a heavy handicap on what we are seeking to create. ' For these reasons,. I. think it would be a very great mistake to delete the provision in the Act, and make the tax retrospective for two and a-half years. Only one thing could justify what amounts,, practically, to a. breach of faith, and certainly to an absolute restraint upon the creation of new industries; and that is, if the Treasurer could demonstrate absolutely beyond doubt that section 12 is giving opportunities to a large portion of the community to carry on profiteering, and practically rob the people. If the Treai de- surer could demonstrate this, much as I dislike the clause, I would be prepared to vote for it , but if he cannot show that, people, having had the opportunity to carry on flagrant profiteering, have not hesitated to take advantage of it, then it would be a grave mistake to create in the minds of the mercantile community the feeling that they cannot rely on anything that is done by Parliament. That .would certainly be the feeling created if this measure is made retrospective for two and a-half years.. For these reasons I urge the Treasurer to seriously consider whether it is not possible to' avoid the repeal of this section of the existing Act in the manner proposed in the clause under consideration. If he is convinced that an opportunity is afforded to certain people to profiteeralthough the profiteering is not so flagrant as to necessitate retrospective legislation over two and a half years-it might be justifiable to pass this clause, but it should be made to apply from the present time. However, a case must be made out to show that the opportunity for profiteering against which this proposal is directed will lead to a flagrant abuse in that direction before it will be wisdom for this Committee to make this legislation retrospective over a period of two and half years.",34
81,Mr LECKIE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Indi) [3.52] - When the. Government first passed the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act the managers of. the large established businesses and in dustries throughout Australia - were very pleased, but if the Government succeed in passing this clause as it stands, the managers of the big monopolies in Australia will jump for joy, because the effect will be to at once crush out of existence the small men who are their competitors. It will make the position of the large establishments safe for years to come by absolutely crippling those who have recently engaged in similar industries. I am quite sure that that is not the in tention of the Treasurer, but that will be the inevitable result of this proposal. The man of small capital cannot be considered on the same basis as the man of large capital. Every one will agree that in the case of long established firms in a big way of business and big combines a profit of 10 per oent. is a very good retur n on their capital. Their money has been put into these industries as an investment, and 10 per oent. in their cases is a very reasonable profit i o allow. But a man with £5,000, £3,000, or less than that who goes into business takes a very big risk, especially in manufacturing concerns, as he has to buy his machinery and raw material on terms. this clause such men will be placed at a very great disadvantage as compared with their competitors in a big way of business. I can quote a few cases to show how inequitably this proposal for a statutory 10 per cent, profit oh capital will operate in the case of new industries. Under this proposal a man who puts the whole of his profits into the extension of his business-and it may be also money obtained from outside-wil l have to accept a decreased amount of profit, .whilst men who have restricted their business or have taken money out of it will be permitted to make a greater profit than before. I take an actual case of a pany with £5,000, whose pre-war standard of profit was £1,250, or 25 per cent. They added during the years since 1914 to their capital and doubled it. They have now a capital of £10,000. Under the War-time Profits Act as it stands they would be allowed on that £10,000 to make a profit of £2,500, or 25 per cent., before they would become taxable, but under the clause now under consideration they will be allowed to make only 17$ per cent, before they become taxable. If , instead of adding to their capital, they had reduced it by about £1,000, the profit which they would be allowed before they became taxable would be £1,150, .or 2 8 | per cent. That is to say, that a man who increases his capital has his percentage of profit reduced to 17$ per cent., whilst the man who reduces his capital is allowed to make a profit of 2 8 | per cent. Surely the Treasurer could not have anticipated that that would be the effect of the present proposal. Here are particulars of another case. There is a business with a capital of £50,000, and on the pre-war standard their profit was £10,000, or 20 per cent. They increased their capital during the course of the war by £25,000, and under the existing Act they would be allowed to make a profit of £15,000, or 20 per cent., whilst under this proposal they would be allowed to make a profit of only 1 6| per cent. If they had reduced their capital to £40,000, they would have been allowed under the existing Ac t to make a profit of £8,000, whilst under this proposal they will be allowed to make a By profit of £9',000, or 22$ per cent. So that the man who reduces his capital, who takes no ""risks, who even withdraws » capital from a business to invest it in the War Loan or on mortgage without risk, is allowed to escape additional taxation or to make more profit on his reduced capital, whilst the man who puts more capital into his business is h it every time under this proposal. Another aspect of the case is very serious. Under the existing Act the period to determine the pre-war standard is fixed as the accounting period previous to 4th August, 1914. A com- number of companies made their balances on the 30th September,- two months after the war broke out. Under this Bill it will be assumed that they have made up their pre-war standard of profits and their pre-war capital on the 30th September, 1913. That is the date from which their estimate of capital and profits will count. Here is an example of an actual case to show the effect of this proposal: On 30th September, 1913, a proprietary company had a capital of £3,000. They had added £2,000 profits to that capital in A p r i l , 1914, giving them a total capital of £5,000 on the 4th August, 1914. But in making up their pre-war standard of capital they are not allowed to take £5,00 0 as their capital, because they had not that amount of capital at the accounting period, 30th September, 1913. they were allowed to taKe the actual capital that was in their business on 4th August, 1914 into consideration, they f would escape with a tax of £ 7 5 , but under this Bill they will have to pay a tax of £322 10s. on their actual capital. Surely, in the face of a case of that kind the Treasurer will not persist in this amendment of the existing Act . The retrospective effect of this proposal has been emphasized by previous speakers, and, therefore, I will not dwell upon it . But it has always seemed to me that the Parliament put it to the mercantile community that it was intended to tax them under certain circumstances on certain standards, and gave them to understand that beyond that they were safe, and might use any profits they made in extending their business, putting in new machinery, opening new branches, and giving increased employment. therefore, very unfair that when men have disbursed their earnings in extending their businesses the Government should come forward two years later and in for m them that a large proportion of the money, which they told them two years before they might use to extend their industries, must be paid over to the Treasury.",35
82,Sir ROBERT BEST,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,Thes e men have for the most part been working on heavy overdrafts.,37
83,Mr LECKIE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"N e a r l y every one of them have been doing so. Men in a small way of business, such as retail butchers or grocers, will t u rn over their capital twelve or fourteen times a year. A retail butcher can buy meat in the wholesale market every day. I could mention dozens of businesses in which the capital is turned over twenty times in a year. If the Bill taxed a man on the turn-over of his business, there might be some justice in the measure; but to tax profits on capital seems to me the most monstrous proposal that has ever been introduced into this Parliament. There is another phase of the problem which will retard progress. Under the Bill , a company or firm is only allowed a certain amount for management expenses. I know of a number of firms which, during the course of the war, have extended If their businesses by opening branches. I know of three or four Sydney firms that have opened branches in Melbourne, and vice versd. . They have taken in extra partners, but under this Bill they will not be allowed any more for the management of their businesses, although they have to pay more on this account. One Melbourne business firm which opened up a Sydney connection, thus incurring higher management expenses, is not allowed to deduct more than the statutory amount. The Act is prejudicial to the inauguration of new businesses; it is killing in dustry; killing enterprise, and is preventing employment. If this Bil l goes through with the clause under consideration in its present form, it will mean absolute disaster, I believe, to a major it y of those business firms that have grown up within the last eight or twelve years. If it is persisted in - I hope the Treasurer will not persist with it - it will It is, mean absolute r u in , and retard the extension of businesses, damage the industrial lif e of Australia, and injure the prospects of employment for our men coming back from the war.",37
84,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [ 4 . 3 ] - I have listened carefully to the observations of honourable members who have addressed themselves to this clause this afternoon, and I would like to remind them that I was under no illusion, when I introduced it into the Bill , about its being accepted by the commercial community in the spirit in which it was offered. I have been refreshing my memory by a perusal of my second-reading: remarks on the measure, and I find I used these wordsThis provision will be objected to strenuously by a certain class of taxpayer who, in a quite unexpected way, escaped taxation under the original Act. I am quite satisfied, however, that when honourable members come to deal with the matter as a principle, quite apart from the incidental effect of its operation as a tax, they will see that this is a fair provision to make. It is impossible to estimate what revenue this new provision will yield, but I think it will bring to the Treasury a fairly Substantial sum. . Hence, honourable members may expect that it will be resisted by certain individuals. Ib is no improper disclosure of confidence to say that it has been. tired before I introduced this provision, but I ' am ten times more tired now, after having heard so much about the iniquity of imposing retrospective taxation. I was caught by that observation when first it came to me; but I point out that the Bill itself is retrospective. I do not mean the original Aet. That was, in a measure, retrospective: but this Bill , with its gifts and fines, is all retrospective, and I put it to a number of Sydney commercialists, who waited on me, that if I am to ' cut' out the imposts because of their retrospective nature, I must cut out also the concessions and gifts, because they, too, are retrospective. I am quite sure honourable members will realise that if I withdraw this Bill with its impositions, other retrospective clauses must also perish; but if I did that, there would be such a wide area of noise that the cry would ascend to the shivering heavens.",37
85,Sir ROBERT BEST,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,It would be better to wipe them out altogether.,38
86,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,The honourable member would cure the aphis by laying the axe at the root of the tree. He and I have discussed the principle privately. The Government has announced 'its intention of going on with the tax as contemplated in the original measure.  burn the Act itself.,38

I am not exactly an apprentice hand; I am an improver. as many inquiries as I have been able to in the time at my disposal to see, apart altogether from the, complaints made about the principle of retrospection, what the incidence of this phase of the measure would be. It is true that it has h u r t progressive businesses more than busiI was fairly nesses that have stood still. I realise that, because I have had a number of illustrations bearing on this point. It is clear that the business man who has stood still with his capital during the currency of the war period will escape unless he has been doing extraordinary profiteering or increasing the rate on his overturn, while the man who, by the absorption of recurring profits into his business, seeks to progress, finds that his margin of profit on the additional capital is maximized at 10 per cent. The difficulty, however, is not merely the question of unfairness in levying two rates upon the same man, but in respect of the distribution of profits where bond fide distribution has taken place, perhaps, without constitutional warrant, but in good faith . It is difficult, and in some cases impossible, to get that money back. In the case of partnerships which have been dissolved I can invent no means whatever to make sure of getting that money back from the hands into which the dividends or distributions have gone. And I find the same difficulty with respect to trusts which have been wound up, where the beneficiaries have been the recipients of such moneys. I do not know whether such cases can be met. There is, further, the objection to which the honourable member for Caprido not cornia (Mr Higgs) alluded when I was introducing the measure. That is in relation to the operations on the market of purchasers of company shares. The honourable member said, "" What about I those people who purchased shares on the basis of the return of a higher percentage on new capital 1"" As to such cases, I do not think we can write an absolute indemnity to all those who deal with investment stock, or stock relating to speculative enterprises; but there are some people, of course, who have a perThat has been fect right to claim that, having bought on the higher return, and with a reasonI have made able expectation of their shares still returning the higher percentage, this measure will be, to a certain extent, robbing them. Those considerations have led me to review the measure, not from the standpoint of the inequality of the principle, but of seeing whether it will severely in j u r e business. And I have come to the conclusion that it would cause, perhaps, more in j u ry than the revenue would demand if I dated the whole proposition right back to the original period, namely, the 1st July, 1916. longer I live at the Treasury the more I am impressed with the necessity for gathering in a large sum of money for public requirements. And I take it that no Treasurer is worth his salt who does not endeavour to make every tax yield fairly, but full y, that which the Legislature expected of it . I am not prepared to give up this section for this particular financial year. We should operate this 10 per cent, arrangement upon new capital; but I am prepared to submit a clause to the effect that the arrangement suggested shall operate as upon assessments from the 1st July, 1918. If honourable members care to accept that, it can go through without discussion, but I would not be justified in yielding up revenue which can be fairly gathered in for this financial year by accepting the suggestion of the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) that my proposal now should have relation to the average of the three years under consideration.",38
88,Mr BRUCE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,Can the Minister give an assurance that the original section in the Act has provided an opportunity to make very large profits ?,39
89,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,Yes . I am not out with the whip to flog the commercial community for having taken full and fair advantage of the operation of the law as it has stood. But the figures in pos- plain. session of the Treasury and Taxation Departments clearly indicate that it is a proper thing to levy on these excess war profits. That is why the Government are determined to hold on to the principle; and those facts and figures which 1I have just indicated justify the Government in their retention of it .,39
90,Mr LECKIE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"This year, will the 10 per cent, be allowed in addition to the capital existing in 1914, or in addition to the capital added since 30th June, 1918?""",39
91,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"All accretions of capital for the financial year 1916-17 and for 1917-18 are to be treated under the new clause which I am about to propose, on the pre-war basis. And then, coming into this financial year, for assessments dated after 1st July, 1918, there will be the line drawn; and we will allow on that new capital the 10 per cent, conB u t the sideration. I move That paragraphs (o) and (6) be left out with a view of inserting in lieu thereof the following paragraphs :(a) by inserting at the end of sub-section (1.) the following proviso :"" Provided that paragraph (b) of this sub-section shall not apply to assessments made for the financial year beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and eighteen, and any subsequent year "" ; and (b) by inserting at the end of sub-section (3)- the following proviso :"" Provided further that paragraph (b) of this sub-seetion shall not apply to assessments made for the financial year beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine, hundred and eighteen, and any subsequent year."" 1I have moved what is, in effect, a new clause in lieu of clause 5, in the hope that honourable members will accept it unanimously, as a fair compromise, in view of all the facts.",39
92,Mr BRUCE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Is not the effect of that amendment to include the 1916-17 and the 1917-18, additions as new capital, in stead of excluding them-as the Minister has stated ?",39
93,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"I would not like to express any variant from the view which I expounded just now. I will confer with the Commissioner, so that the effect of the clause shall be made perfectly",39

96,Mr SAMPSON,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Wimmera) [4.22] I have been asked by the honourable memfor Wannon (Mr Rodgers) to submit a new clause in reference to partnerships. I therefore move That the following new clause be inserted : A. Section 10 of the principal Act is amended by adding the following sub-section :(4) Notwithstanding anything contained_ in this Act, the 'capital and profits' of any business carried on by a partnership shall be computed in exactly the same way as if it were carried on by a single individual, all capital contributed by any of the partners in money or in kind and used in making the profits being admitted as capital, and all deductions being allowed from the profits of the business which would be allowed if it were carried on by a single individual. It was explained fairly fully by the honourable member for Wannon a few nights ago that, under the existing law, large amounts of capital may be held separately and severally by partners in a partnership. Especially is this so in the case of land which cannot be used by a partnership in estimating the total capital upon which the tax is levied under the principal Act. One case which has come under our joint notice will serve to disclose the injustice of the present law. It is a case in which three persons hold estates separately to the value of £60,000. These .persons, decided to enter into a partnership in order that they might work this. £60,000 worth of landed estate. The new capital' put into the partnership amounted to £20,000. Under the present law the £60,000 worth of land held by the partners in their separate and in dividual estates cannot be calculated as a part of the capital upon which the tax will be based under this Bill . I know that the Commissioner of Taxes has made an attempt to meet, in part, cases arising under this very unjust section of the principal Act. I understand that certain regulations have been framed under which it is permissible to capitalize either the amount of the rental or the grazing value of the land, such capitalization being based on the length of the nartnership or on the lives of the individual partners themselves. The legal members of the Committee will readily' understand how the calculation is made on. the lives of the in dividual partners. Either the rental value is assessed on the basis of the term that each partner is likely to live, or what may he regarded as the total period which will be covered by their joint lives, is divided by the number of partners, and thus an estimate is arrived at of the capital value of each life for the purposes of the partnership. Alternatively, the grazing or rental value of the land is estimated on the basis of the length of the partnership. These regulations indicate that the Commissioner has endeavoured to meet such cases in a way which will .give a certain amount of relief. But.honourable members will admit that if the landed estate of the whole of the individual partners is pooled for the purpose of earning income, the whole of that capital should be allowed in assessing the total amount which must be paid for taxation purposes. The amendment, therefore, aims at insuring that, where property or capital in a landed estate is used by the different partners to earn money under a partnership, the whole of that capital shall be allowed as capital of the partnership upon which an allowance of 10 per cent, shall be made before any tax under the principal Act is demanded. That is the object which the honourable member for Wannon seeks to achieve, and it is one with which I thoroughly agree. Had he not anticipated me, I certainlyshould have submitted a similar proposal. I have merely to add that the honourable member himself would have been present this afternoon to have moved this amendment but that he has been unfortunately detained at a meeting in the country.",39
97,Mr HIGGS,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,Does the honourable member wish to make any difference between' a sleeping partner and an active partner ?,40
98,Mr SAMPSON,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"In cases of the kind I have cited, all the partners will be sleeping partners. At the present time, the tax is assessed only on the amount of the capital actually put into the partnership by partners v",40
99,Mr WAT T,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Balaclava--Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.28]. - This is a. problem to which reference has been made at various stages of the Bill . Consideration has been asked for the man who, instead of putting capital into a business, puts land into it which earns profits-profit s that under this Bill will be liable to excess profits taxation. The suggestion has been made that we should value the land at its real value, however that result might be arrived at, and credit such value as capital in the same way that we credit as capital stock placed by a man upon land. That has been a problem which the Taxation Office has been endeavouring to solve for some time. The danger present has always been that of evasion, as the result of men putting one large estate into severalty, and operating it jointly, thus escaping one tax by means of bogus distribution and getting the benefit of another tax such as this by a pretence of joint holding. But it is perfectly clear that the injustice to bond fide co-operators or partners in these cases ought to be attended to, if we can, without undue leakage of the tax, allow for that kind of partnership. I have consulted the Commissioner of Taxes, with a view to ascertaining whether he can devise a means of meeting the case. He has advised me that we. may safely adopt a new clause-no t upon the lines recommended by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers), because that clause provides no machinery for properly dealing with the matter, but a clause on the following lines: "" 7 A . Section seventeen of the principal Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following sub-section :' (5.)

It is not just that a man whose sole income is from a partnership, and does not exceed £900 a year, should be taxed at the same rate as if he were receiving £1,800 a year. In the case to which I am drawing attention each partner will have to pay £200 in war-time profits taxation, though if treated as partners are treated under the Income Tax Act , they would have nothing to pay. If there were three partners drawing equally from a business having an income of £1,800 a year, that is, each receiving £600 a year, they would be taxed to the amount of £ 1 3 3 each, or if the tax is raised to 75 per cent., to the amount of £200 each.

I think that Treasurer can be relied on to give conwar sideration to the small man, and is enfor deavouring to make the best of a bad job. In my opinion, the Bill should have been kicked out altogether, as i will not touch the real profiteers.

This provision is known as the averagingclause. It is contained in the English and in the Canadian law; it was in the Bill introduced by the honourable member fair. for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), and I think, though I speak subject to correction, it was in the New Zealand Act.",42
106,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"There is a 6 per centmaximum in the English measure. Sir ROBE RT BEST - I mentioned (Eden- that at an earlier stage. The fundamental principle of a War-time Profits Tax Bill should be the taxing of all profits made during the period of the war in excess of the. pre-war standard. Where that principle is recognised, it is - reasonable to apply such rates as 50 and 75 per cent, to the excess profits, but there are many cases in which, while the profits during the first year of the war exceeded those pre-war years, in subsequent years losses were incurred, and persons have been taxed on the profits of the first year without being given any consideration for the the losses of subsequent years. Until the is ended it will be quite impossible a large section of the commercial community to know whether or not they have made any excess profits. They have purt . chased large stocks at very high prices. There has been an artificial prosperity, they have paid this taxation on the the profits they have made. But. their warehouses are filled up with stock purchased at war-time values, and they' must now realise it on a falling market. The result will be that, although they made some profits in the earlier part of the war, they must inevitably make heavy losses in disposing of their war-time purchases. It is surely unfair that the losses, as well as the profits, should not be taken into consideration. If we can agree upon the principle that only those profits in excess of the general average made during the war shall be taxed, there can be no objecaccounting tion to this proposed new clause. The Imperial Act includes a similar give-andtake provision. I urge that this clause is of any fair and reasonable, and should be accepted. Our Act provides for a system proof pre-war profits based on an average of three years. It also allows a man the choice of three pre-war years. The tax provides for a pre-war capital. The mere accidental fact of whether a man makes a profit or a loss should not be taken into consideration during the war period. The average profit extended over the whole period of the war should be taken, and any excess compared with the pre-war profits is all that should be liable to taxation.",42
107,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION," [4.50] - Every representation made to me by those who are stricken by this Act has been of similar purport to the argument of the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), and I have returned the same answer in each case, namely, that the Government might just as well let the Act go as to insert an averaging provision in it now. In every other direction we have remedied it , but I am not prepared to accept the amendment. As the honourable member has very properly said, it would mean an averaging of the profits over the whole of the war period. That would in volve re-adjustments in all past assessments as far as they can be re-adjusted, and a further final adjustment at the end of the time to cover errors in adjustment made at the end of previous bookkeeping periods. The mover of the amendment suggests that it will really tax the profiteer; in my judgment, it will not. If there are any of that species about still-and all Governments have been after him., and failing , more or less, to get him - ",43
108,Mr CONSIDINE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,The honourable gentleman does not say that the Government have been chasing a shadow ?,43
109,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"He is more than a shadow, but he is fleeter than the honourable member. What the amendment means is this: A man inay sell at heavy .profiteering rates for two or three years, but in subsequent years he may not be able to get full stocks, and it may not be his fault that he does not continue the profiteering. In the years 1914-15 and 191617 he may have levied a heavy toll on the people, but, because he is not able to get full business on his turnover for 191718, all his profiteering is to be given him. He may for three years have profiteered heavily but because he makes losses in the next year and a half, all his evil is wiped out by his neglect to get stocks or his inability to trade. As a means of catching the profiteer, the amendment does not recommend itself at all , and, from the stand-point of the revenue, the Act might as well go by the board if the clause be agreed to. The Taxation Office assures me that huge and incalculable amounts which would have to be remitted or written down, and, as Treasurer, I am not prepared to do that at this stage. I remind honourable members who quote the Imperial, Canadian, and other Acts of this kind that there is no Act quite so liberal in its general provisions as the Australian Act . I have been told by an honourable member of this House, who has had occasion to study the principles and the incidence of the Imperial Act , that it is Heaven to live under this Act and Hell to live under the otlier.",43
110,Sir ROBEHT BEST,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,The conditions in Britain are totally different.,43
111,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"I know they are; then why draw an analogy? The English Act provides for a lower rate of return for capital. Our Act has liberalized that allowance to 10 per cent. The' Imperial Act allows an exemption of £ 2 0 0 ; under our Act the exemption is £1,000. On top of those advantages, the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) aska for the general remedial provision which is embodied in the Imperial Act . In Great Britain there are not the great seasonal fluctuations that characterize Australia, and business is more regular. We have made in our Act special provision for taking up the slack. We have given the pastoralists all sorts of concessions. We have inserted a hardship clause and a drought clause, and a num1 ber of other advantages which the British Act does not confer. If honourable mem4 bers desire to insert in this Bill the averaging provision that is contained in the Imperial Act , I am prepared to accept it with the other machinery of that Act, but I am not prepared to accept the amendment under any other conditions.",43
112,Mr BRUCE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Flinders) [4.55]' - This proposed clause applies to every type of for - business. I do not know enough about the pastoral industry to be able to express an opinion regarding it ; but, so far as ordinary commerce is concerned, I see the greatest danger in passing an averaging provision at this stage. Whether when the Act was originally passed it would have been wise to have had such a provision is a matter of opinion; I think, possibly, that it would have been fairer to the general trading community, but it is certainly too late to insert any such provision, now. If that were done, the whole commercial community would be involved in chaos.",43

The immediate result of passing of an averaging clause now would be that every merchant and trader who has big stocks would shift them at cost, because', not they, but the Governhonorable ment would foot the bill. Theeffect, that might be admirable-, so far as vidual traders are concerned. own business we have a stock of nearly £750,000, and I would be delighted to 1 shifti't, but if we and others did that we [345]- 2 should wipe a lot of smaller traders out of existence. If the Treasurer is really enthusiastic about doing something to assist the commercial - community in regard to averaging, and this amendment were: made to apply up to June, 1918, some of the dangers I have suggested would disappear. But , in. all seriousness, I do urge upon honourable members very careful consideration before voting for an averaging clause when the tax has only six months to run . If they agree to this proposal, they may involve the community for this in commercial chaos. Proposed new clause negatived.",44
120,Mr SAMPSON,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Wimmera) [5.0] On behalf of the honourable member for. course Wannon (Mr Rodgers), I moveWe have That the following new clause be inserted :"" B. Section 13 of the principal Act is As we underamended by inserting after the words ' additional factor' at the end of sub-clause (a) the words ' or for a calculation of the percentage standard in the case of a pastoral business carried on in a district which is proved to the to be liable to severe drought, and in which the capital is liable to be decreased or wholly lost through drought.'"" get a I understand that at an earlier stage, when the position of the pastoralists was discussed at length, the honourable mem amendment having much the same object do as that which my honourable friend (Mr .

The of pastoralists in the droughthas stricken areas of Australia is well known; and I understand that the Treasurer has a full knowledge of the difficulties and pastoralists, and large, have to labour in such fall circumstances. In view of the promise the of the Treasurer that the whole matter would be considered by him , with a view of bringing forward a new proposal, or any accepting the amendment of which my friend had given notice, I of shall not discuss the question further, indibut shall be glad to learn what are the In my intentions' of the Government.",44
121,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Balaclava-Acting-Prime Minister' and Treasurer) [5.5]' - In accordance with the promise that I gave last week, I have carefully gone into this matter with the Commissioner of Taxation, who recommends phraseology of this proposed new clause as the best of the three propositions that have been framed with the object of meeting this particular pastoral - difficulty. In these circumstances, as I announced that the Government were anxious to pirovide for the out-back pastoralists who have to meet many of the grave difficulties of recurring devastations, I am prepared to accept the proposed new clause. Proposed new clause agreed to.",44
122,Mr GREGORY,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Dampier) [ 5 . 7 ] - I move That the following new clause be inserted "" Section 15 of the principal Act is amended by omitting sub-section - 13, and inserting in its stead the following :' (13) Where in the case of a pastoral ness any loss has been made during the pre-war years, or if the profit in those years has not been sufficient to pay 10 per centum on the capital employed in the business during those years, such loss or deficiency shall be deductible from the profits of the accounting period. In computing such loss, an allowance shall be made on the capital employed in each year, and shall take effect as from the beginning of the Act.'"" I would impress upon the Treasurer the fact that the new clause to which the Committee has just agreed, deals with an industry, whereas my proposal deals only with individuals in that industry. It is designed to meet the position of pastoralists who have been engaged in the industry for only five or six years, and prior to the war made no profits, but who during the war period have been making fair profits and have been compelled to pay this tax. I have supplied the Treasurer with a statement taken from the accounts of a pastoralist who has been in the industry for only six years. During the pre-war years he made no profit, but in the first year of the war he made a profit. He had from £7,000 to £20,000 invested in the enterprise, but in the pre-war years did not earn interest on his capital, or anything for his own services. In the first accounting period, however, he made a profit of £4,800, and was taxed to the extent of £2,050.",45
123,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,Is this man carrying on the industry in an area subject to the drought ?,45
124,Mr GREGORY,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,Yes .,45

126,Mr GREGORY,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,He has not granted him any relief.,45

128,Mr GREGORY,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,He has power under the present A ct to grant relief in certain industries.,45
129,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"We have inserted* two new provisions in order to make that power more elastics- I refer to the amendment submitted by the honourable mem:- ber for Wannon (Mr Rodgers), and the hardship clause.",45
130,Mr GREGORY,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"When I mentioned busi- this matter last week the Treasurer said I was asking for something on behalf of a section of individuals in the pastoral industry that was not allowed to any other section of the community. I would remind him that it is allowed to all business people under sub-section 14 of section 15. On Friday last I referred to a statement setting out that one pastoralist in the three years immediately preceding the war showed a Toss of £950, and that in the first accounting period he showed a book profit of £1,500. He ' wrote to the Department urging that since he had only made a profit of £1,500 in the first accounting period, and showed a loss of £950 in respect of the immediately preceding three years, he* should be allowed to deduct that loss from his profit made during the assessment period. That request was refused, although, under subsection 14 of section 15, the Commissioner has power to make such, a concession to business people. All that I urge is that the concession should be extended to persons so situated in the pastoral industry, or that they should be at least allowed to earn 10 per cent, on the capital employed by them without being liable to this tax. The Department in Western Australia fixes values for taxing purposes from 6s. to 9s. per head, for lambs, according to the district in which they are raised, and from 37s. 6d. to 52s. 6d. for calves, although the owners may not be able to get anything like that price for them when they proceed to sell - It seems to me that the policy of the Government is to allow a man who makes a profit of £15,000 out of an option on a mining proposition to escape this taxation, whereas a pastoralist smuggling under the adverse conditions I have mentioned receives no consideration. If two brothers were left £5,000 each and one of them went into the back country and .put his money into a pastoral proposition, taking all the risks and privations attendant upon such a venture, he would have to pay this tax, though, possibly, he may not have made any cash profit. If the other brother put his £5,000 out on mortgage on city properties, and commenced business in the city as a commission agent, taking no risk or responsibility, he would be free of this tax, no matter howl large his income. Is that a. reasonable policy to pursue ? preposterous, and if I do not obtain any concession for these people, I shall fight the E ill through the third-reading stage and try to block it . It is damnable that concessions should be made to people living in Melbourne or Sydngy who can come here and get the ear of the Government-it is extraordinary that a man who starts in a business as a broker or agent in the city, and lives on his wits, may make £15,000 or £20,000 and escape the tax-whil e the man who goes into the back country to fight nature, even if he cannot show anything more than a book profit, has to pay the tax. He may have to borrow the money with which to pay it . This is a matter of great importance, and I hope that the Treasurer will see fit to do something to give relief to a class more worthy of it than any other in the community.",45
131,Mr WA TT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [5.17] - I think that concessions have gone quite far enough. We have met the case of the pastoralists as reasonably as possible, and this amendment asks us to go beyond bounds altogether. First of all, the wording of the amendment leaves it to be supposed that any losses occurring in pre-war years are to be allowed during the war period.",46
132,Mr GREGORY,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,""" Pre-war years "" are defined in the Act .",46
133,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"No , they are not. There are certain classes of pre-war years, three in number, but in certain cases there are six when abnormal conditions operate. I think the honourable member could, with some degree of reason, or less unreason, have confined his proposal to the. three pre-war years.",46
134,Mr GREGORY,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,I am only dealing with those years.,46
135,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"But the honourable member does not do that. He says, "" Where in the case of a pastoral business any loss has been made during the pre-war years."" The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) spoke of a business which had been twenty years in operation, and had come to f r u it i o n ; but T certainly object to going back into all It is those enterprises for a score of years. What the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) apparently desires is to see that, before any profits are taxed in war time, there is 10 per cent, credit < allowed for pre-war time.",46
136,Mr GREGORY,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"I only ask for that in the case of people who, since starting, have shown no profits.",46
137,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,But the honourable member does not say so in his proposal.,46

139,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"The honourable member has had much more time than I to refine this wonderful amendment, but I must say that I am not able to see any alteration in it since it was first submitted. It has serious defects, and its principle in it self is wrong in view of what we have done elsewhere in the Bill . We say to any other business man that, if he made losses during the three pre-war years, he may account for them and deduct them before he pays taxation on war-time profits; but we do not say to him that we will give him credit for 10 per cent, during the time the capital was not earning profits in pre-war time. Y e t that is what the honourable member desires in the case of the pastoral industry.",46
140,Mr GREGORY,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Accordin g to the ruling of the Commissioner on a section in the present Act , losses for that period cannot be deducted.",46
141,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"The honourable member apparently forgets that we have gone f u r ther out of our way to. meet the pastoral industry during this revision of the Act than we have to meet any other class of business. We have inserted a clause dealing with hardships, by which, in the same way as in connection with a land tax, the Board may reduce or remit altogether if , by reason of drought or adverse seasons or conditions, the returns from the land used for the purpose of the business have been seriously impaired. That is a wide and sweeping amendment, and, in addition, a clause has been in serted, at the suggestion of the honourable  powering the Commissioner to take into account, and allow a percentage on, pastoral properties that are liable to severe drought and the capital of which is liable to be seriously decreased or wholly lost through drought.",47

The proposal of the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) provided for an average profit to apply to all businesses, whereas my pro) posal refers only to the pastoral business, t and. provides, not for an average profit, but only for cases where there is a loss.

Mr Mcintosh puts his case very clearly in the f o l l o w ing l e t t e r w h i c h he for w a r d e d to the h o n orable member for Eas t S v d n e v : My company commenced business in 1908, experimented u n t i l 31st August, 1911. That balance showed a net loss of £2,875 17s. 8d., as the statement which I gave you attached to Mr Allard's letter will show. We worked strenuously until 31st August, 1914, at which, date we were fortunately able to wipe out our losses and get on the right side of the ledger. This was the first year, mark you, that any profit was distributed. That means we had five years of dead-horse to work off. The Aet provided, in section 16, sub-section 12, that the last pre-war trading year shall be the balance before the 5th day of August, 1914. Now, our 1914 balance showed £9,371 15s. 9d. profit; but the above provision in the Act cuts us out by the fact of our .balance being on the 31st of August. We overlapped the allowed time by twenty-*e'ven days, and I wis h we were prevented fro m the benefit of this r c u m - year's profit' in our pre-war standard, and caused us to have to accept a 10 per cent.' basis. So, after seven years' struggle, out of. the first profit of any note, we were called upon to pay nearly £8,000 by this so-called wartime profit tax. Mark you, if this were our only loss, it would not be so serious, but the pre-war standard remains unaltered, whilst the law exists.; and, on the same basis for 1916-17, we will be called upon to pay nearly £12,000, and yearly after, accordingly. I can assure you that if there had not been a war on, we should have been able to sell a't least another 1,000 ears during the war period to date, and would havemade a better average of profit on each car; but, owing to the factory supply shortages, together with dearth of shipments, our requirements were cut very short, and are still. TheTe are a very large percentage of businesses that balance between 30th June and 30th September, owing to it being a slack time of the year. If the law wore amended to allow of the inclusion in pre-war standard of the 1914 balance, providing there were not any abnormal profits made in the last month or two, this would relieve a number of hardships I would with young and struggling businesses. This law, in my opinion, should never have been applied to this country, .as we have no war profits to speak of, in the sense that Europe and America have had by the huge supply of Army and Navy requirements, such as ships, guns, ammunitions, and war stores. TrustingI have made myself clear in this matter, together with what Mr Allard said in his letter, and to give you something further to guide you, I am enclosing copies of the assessment sheets for the war-time profits tax paid by us outside of income tax, which was £7,841 ""is. Cd. We have endeavoured to induce people to establish the manufacture of motor bodies in Australia. This gentleman went into the business, and prior to 1914 sustained losses. Then just as his business began to pay, the overlapping of twenty-seven days after the outbreak of the war leads to his having to contribute over £7,00 0 in the shape of war-time profits tax.

I can understand an honourable member, who does not deal in hundreds of thousands of pounds, garding the profit made by Mcintosh and Sons as an enormous one.

There are members of the Comfor mittee who are better able to speak of manufacturing industries than I am, but the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr .

He says the man whose case I have mentioned is an importer, but be is an im-porter only of raw material, as are those engaged in many other industries. I hope that the Treasurer will take a favourable view of this matter, and if he cannot go as far as we should like, will be prepared to do something to relieve persons engaged in these and similar industries of undue pressure under the Act",49

I have not, of course, investigated all the a cases that have been submitted in documentary form to the Treasury.

153,Mr FENTON,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,It is an argument for a as good as uniform date of balancing.,49
154,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Yes , if we could arrange that, but honourable members are trying to provide for the f u t u re what should have been provided for in the past, and the difficulty now of altering the law to meet hard cases is insuperable.",49
155,Mr BOYD,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,Does the honourable gentleman not think that it would be fairer in arriving at the pre-war period to count back from the date of the commencement of the Act ?,50
156,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"The dates have been well ind truly laid under the Act, .and on those dates all our assessments have been based, and will be for the next three years. All that cannot be altered It might be suggested that we should exclude a certain number of days from the 4tb August, 1914, up to the 31st August, and assume that profits made within those twenty-seven days should not be taxed. If we did that we should have to accept statements of sales, and would have great difficulty in making certain that we did not allow profits to escape which should the brought under - taxation.",50

158,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"It might not be practicable to do that. We have acted upon a strict rule as to the dates, and all the earlier assessments have been based upon that. I am not prepared to rip up that principle now to meet the. circumstances of individual cases. I shall oppose the amendment.",50
159,Mr BRUCE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Flinders) [5.50] -/The amendment seems to me to represent a fair proposal, but I see the difficulty which its exact wording would create, and which has been mentioned by the Treasurer. If we opened the door to meet ihe case of a firm balancing at the end of August, a firm balancing on the - 1st September would demand a similar concession. If we provided for the case of a firm balancing on the 30th September, a firm balancing on the 1st October would expect to be included. think, however, that it would help very greatly to meet the difficulty which has arisen if the Treasurer could see his way to adopt the principle of taking the number of months in the year which fell outside the war-time period, and on the profits during those months, estimate the average profit for the rest of the year. The Treasurer has suggested that that would be impracticable if not impossible, but, from a very considerable experience of business, I say that it would be neither impracticable nor impossible, but that it would be simplicity itself. There is a very strong argument in favour of the adoption of that principle in the fact that the Act already provides for its application in other circumstances. In the case of certain businesses the Act contemplates taking a period up to a time when the now. war started, and, by the operations for that time, adjusting the profit over the whole twelve months. It applies only to businesses recently formed, but there would be no difficulty.at all in the application of the same principle to meet the cases which the amendment is submitted to relieve. The Act provides that where, owing to the recent commencement of business, there has not been one pre-war trade year, the pre-war standard of profit shall be taken to be an amount proportionate to the period of twelve months of the actual period during the pre-war period, during which the business was carried on. That is the very thing which I am suggesting can ' be applied with simplicity in this case. If a man was trading for only nine months before the declaration of war, the Act says that it is perfectly simple to take accounts for that nine months, and add one-third to the profits made during that period to estimate the profits from the twelve months' trading. That would be a fair principle to apply, not merely to meet the circumstances of the particular case referred to by the honourable member  cannot consider particular cases-bu t of a number of firms in a similar position. They are certainly entitled to get the benefit that is given to other firms. It is not fair to exclude some businesses from I benefits conceded to others under the Act. I should be prepared to support an amendment on the lines I have indicated. Mr ' WATT - It would not be.possible to accept that without ripping up the Act, and it is impossible to do that. I hope that honourable members will let us get on, because I should like to dispose of this Bill before the dinner adjournment.",50
160,Mr BOYD,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Henty) [5.54] - This is too important a matter to be dealt with hurriedly. It is all very well for the Treasurer, who is looking out for boodle.",51
161,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,I ask that that expression be withdrawn?,51
162,Mr BOYD,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"If the honourable gentleman objects to the word "" boodle,"" I will withdraw it and substitute the word ""cash."" He should not get excited, be-' cause he must know perfectly well that what I mean is that, on behalf of the Treasury, he is looking out for all the cash he can collect.",51
163,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,All right; the honourable member's apology is accepted.,51
164,Mr BOYD,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"I have not apologized yet. I say that the Treasurer feels it to be his duty to get all the cash he can under this Bill ; but,, to my way of thinking, he is adopting a method which is not a fair one. I know nothing of the particular case to which the honourable member for  do know that, in the case of many firms who balanced six months after war was declared, their accounts included little or nothing of war-time profit. There was a period of stagnation in trade between the 4th August, 1914, and the beginning of 1915, and most, businesses - during that time made losses and not profits. The purpose of the Act is to secure war-time profits made unfairly at the expense of the community, and surely when the Act is before us for amendment, and it is admitted by the Treasurer that it requires amendment, we are entitled to consider a proposal to meet - the circumstances of those who were carrying on business, for nine, ten, or eleven months of the year prior to the outbreak of the war. The suggestion made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) is an eminently fair one, and I think the amendment now before the Committee is also fair. If the purpose of the Act is to derive revenue from those who have made profits out of the war, it is clear that those who made profits prior to the 4th August, 1914, did not make them out of the war,- and should not be taxed on them. I want to put it on record that, though the Treasurer has refused to consider it, I regard the amendment as meeting a legitimate request, and will, therefore, support it.",51
165,Mr LECKIE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Indi) [5.58] - When the original Bill was before the House I wished to move an amendment of this sort, but owing to the result of all night sittings, I was precluded frtom doing so. The Minister in charge of the measure, seeing the justice of my pro'posal, said he would give it consideration when the measure went to another place. The Bill was, however, rushed through in another place also, and my proposal did not get the consideration which it deserved. I think that the principal objection urged against it was that as soon as the war broke out, at the beginning of 1914, everything appreciated in value, and people made large profits in consequence. Of course, we know that that was not so, and as the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) has pointed out, there was a slump in business for some time.",51
166,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,In some businesses; but in others the reverse was the' case. We have the figures in the Taxation Office.,51
167,Mr LECKIE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"The slump which took place precluded altogether the possibility of profits being made, immediately after the outbreak of the war. The suggestion I made that ten or eleven months of that year should be taken as the basis for estimating the trading for the whole year was an eminently fair one.",51
168,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"If that had been done at the start, it might have been fair, but such, a thing could not be done now without ripping up the whole of our past assessments, and I am not prepared to do that.",51
169,Mr LECKIE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"I recognise that the Treasurer has made concessions and it is unfortunate that the amendment submitted by the honourable member for  Committee in the way it does, obscures the fact that there are hundreds of other casesi of companies, not so highly capitalized as that to which he has referred, which are.just as hardly dealt with. #",51
170,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"It is equally unfortunate that the concessions I made earlier have ""been forgotten.",51
171,Mr LECKIE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"This seems, on the of it , such a palpably fair amendment that I thought the Treasurer would accept it . I know of thousands of cases in which the Act has operated very harshly in i m posing taxation on businesses established shortly before the commencement of the Act. Businesses that were fortunate enough to balance on the 31st Jul y are all right, because their last year's profits are counted as the pre-war standard, and the businesses which balance' six-monthly are not so hardly h it; but the man who balances every twelve months, and comes in a little after the pre-war accounting period, has been very hardly h it . The Treasurer is not showing his usual readiness to recognise a case in which an injustice is being done. I trust that, even now, he will meet us generously in this particular case.",52
172,Mr FENTON,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Maribyrnong) [6.1] I do not know whether the * Treasurer caught the remarks of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), or the quotation, from the principal Act , showing that exactly the same principle as the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr . Page) wishes to introduce here is actually in operation. W it h his extensive business knowledge, the honourable member for Flinders says that it is a comparatively easy matter to adjust the pre-war standard if there have been nine months running' before the war period. There is an average income for those nine months, and it is very easy to average over the remaining three months, which are covered by the war period, at the nine months' rate. I add my request to the others made to the Treasurer, as this matter seriously affects new businesses and employment in Australia. ' I trust that he will take the question into consideration, as has been suggested from both sides of the Committee. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN Monaro) [ 6 . 3 ] - I also urge the Treasurer to give this question further consideration. He tells us that it is too late, and that it means ripping up the Bill. I cannot see how it is going to do that. It affects manufacturing businesses. We have made extraordinary provisions in this country to try to give face employment to our people. The motorcar body manufacturing industry has be>come a tremendous one. I am given to understand that the injustice that is being done is preventing the employment today of 300 - skilled Australians who have been trained here*. Consequently, this legislation prevents a very large industry from being established. We are not asking, the Treasurer for anything new, because a similar provision is already in sub-section 6 of section 16 of the principal Act. The Treasurer's own business experience must show him that it is very easy to apportion, say, eleventwelfths of a year, or, if necessary, three-fourths of a year. This particular man, after five years' struggling and striving, at a big loss of money and energy, establishes an industry that we have been trying to foster in this country. He uses Australian materials, and employs cur own people; he has to use very big capital, and run a great deal of risk, as is shown by the number of failures that have taken place in these motor concerns. A f t e r years of loss, he has succeeded in .establishing the industry, and then, m the very year that he begins to make up a little money-althoug h not all his loss - the war starts, and, unfortunately for him, his balance-sheet comes out at the end of August. The war started on the 4th August. Is he to be deprived of a fair accounting period because of those twenty-seven days? Is that consideration to cut him out of ordinary justice? I quite agree that the Treasurer must have some standard to go by, and cannot alter it to suit every man's balance-sheet; but from the commercial stand-point it ought to be very easy to meet a case like this. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), who is an authority, tells us that the thing is done every day in commercial circles, and can be very easily done in this case. Our own knowledge of commerce, however small it is, (Eden- shows that there should be no difficulty. Why should not a man be allowed eleventwelfths of his year ? This request should not be opposed, because our policy should be, "" Let justice be done, even J f the heavens f all . """,52
173,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,Will you take your tongue out of your cheek when you say that ?,52
174,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,My tongue is not in my cheek. We have no right to be told that because the proposal is introduced at a late hour it will r i p up the Bill .,53
175,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"So it will , and' it will up the Act, which is more important than the Bill .",53
176,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,My opinion is that that would be a dashed - good job.,53
177,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,Apparentl y that is what is being attempted.,53
178,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"No . am quite prepared to catch the profiteer, » but the Treasurer knows that this provision does not catch him. It may catch some profiteers, but it catches' more in offensive business men, while 'we know that some of the richest profiteers, who have made fortunes since the war started, have said publicly that they will not have to pay a penny of this tax. good of the Treasurer talking about our having our ""tongues in our cheeks"" when he knows that profiteering has been going on all the time ? An y business man with ordinary common sense can see that this Bill perpetrates an injustice. In the case of this particular man, the injustice is not only for one year, but his pre-war standard wall be taken as a basis of computation for all his taxation. I do not blame the Treasurer for not interviewing people-h e has too much to do, and has too many people - waiting to see him ; but he will not show his usual good judgment if he is not prepared to meet this man in a fair and reasonable way.",53
179,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"I am not dealing w men, but witl i cases. . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - This sist man's case is typical. Why should not bring it forward ? He does not behind a hedge; he puts his balance-sheet before members of Parliament, and shows his hand to them. He shows his and his profits, and the struggle that has had. We ought to encourage sort of candour. There is nothing the rose. All"" his cards are on the It will be a monstrous injustice if his case is not met. This is a monstrously unjust Act, but I do not blame the Treasurer for it , because it was a legacy to him, and, in spite of what he has to me, I state frankly that, in my opinion, he has improved the Bill . He has made the best of a bad job, but if he will meet this case he will make the job a littl e better. No doubt there are r i p many hard cases that cannot be considered by the House. This man has had the enterprise to put his case before members in black and white. Probably, as the honourable member for Henty (Mr . Boyd) says, a number .of men suffer in the same way, and the Treasurer should certainly be able to do something to meet I them, even if an amendment has to be made in another place. All we ask for is ordinary common fair play. An honourable member who has had a practical commercfal training says that it is a very easy thing to do.",53
180,Mr WATT,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"It is not an easy thing to do. The honourable member you refer to did not deal with the Taxation Office, but What is the with the ordinary position inside a commercial counting-house",53
181,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"At any rate, others haye been able to deal with the same problem, and it ought to be very easy to make a computation on the basis of eleven-twelfths, or in some other way. A man should not be denied ordinary justice because he is ""cut out by a few days. I appeal to the Treasurer because we seem to be in his hands. He says he will not do this or that, and we have to bow our heads.",53
182,Mr BOYD,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Rathe r than disturb the. calculations of the taxing officers', an in justice must be done to the taxpayer.",53
183,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"If we i th allow that sort of thin g to happen, we are not worth our salt. We ought to in on a change, if we believe that an in I justice is being done. We should not be go told that we are embarrassing the Govern- - ment. We are not here to prop u,p or pull down Governments, but to look after losses, the interests of the taxpayers. This man he bas had the candour to tell us that he is that making many thousands - He runs the under risk of that statement having a bad effecttable. on honourable members, because we are in clined to h it the big man very hard, . if we can, as the honourable member for Maranoa says. But this man has not cloaked his profits. He states clearly and said emphatically that if we refuse to make an alteration because it does not suit our system of' accounting or averages, we shall, be doing him a gross injustice, and penalizing him to the extent of thousands of pounds, while at the same time we allow many profiteers to go scot free. T appeal to the Treasurer to put aside the little feeling which-he seems to be showing in this matter. I know that he is anxious to get on with the business, and I am prepared to sit here and help him ; but I ask him to look into this case, and take advice as to whether he cannot make a change. Personally, this man does not matter a button to us. There must be dozens of similar cases in which persons cannot make themselves heard in Parliament. If we do not meet tliese hard cases, - we confess that Parliament is impotent to do justice. Progress reported. ORDER OF BUSINESS.

When the Iron and Steel Bounty Bill has been disposed of, and the Defence Bill is called on, it will be found that some members who are interested in that measure have gone away, not having the slightest that it would come on today. They thought the Committee would go on dealbers ing with the War-time Profits Bill has now been put over rather hurriedly and somewhat dramatically. I am glad of the intimation from the Minister Price Fixing (Mr Greene) as what the Government propose to take next, because we should not be left the dark. The Government have a right Bill . to deal with the business in their own way, but honourable members are liable to be called out of the building on business for an hour or two, and may not know under the present arrangements what is likely to be done. There are some Bills that I am interested in. It is my intention to oppose the Chief Justice's Pension Bill-No . 2 on the notice-paper. I have taken the trouble to look up the votes of honourable members and Ministers when this questionwas previously before the House, and I find some of the Ministers were at that time opposed to the principle. If the busiuess on the notice-paper is to be altered without the knowledge of honourable members, the Government could practically clear off the whole of it in their absence. But we have a right to know the intention of the Government in regard to alterations of the order of business.

187,Mr HIGGS,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,Capricornia) [ 6 . 1 6 ] - I support the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . n and Tudor) in his protest concerning the action of the Government. I have come the conclusion that it is nearly time the Government gave up trying - to conduct the business of the House at all. The incident we have just witnessed seems to indicate that the sooner the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) comes back the foreshadowed better it will be.,54
188,Mr BOYD,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,What !,54
189,Mr HIGGS,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"I said that the sooner the Prime Minister comes back the better, for I would like to see the business of this country carried on. You will agree, idea Mr Speaker, that when the business paper is placed before honourable memthey are entitled to see the items , which discussed in their order. We wereall led to believe that item No. 1-the Wartime Profits Tax Assessment Bill-wa s for important enough' to occupy first place to and be dealt with - but we are now informed that the Government intend to in deal with the Chief Justice's Pension",54
190,Mr SPEAKER,DARLINGHURST DETENTION, I do not know why the honourable member should assume that I agree with him.,55
191,Mr HIGGS,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"I am quite sure, sir, that if you were where I am now you would not agree with the action of the Government, and you would take a great deal longer than I am talcing to express your view. It is the duty of the Opposition to oppose, and, without for a moment suggesting that Mr Speaker is in agreement with me, I take advantage of this opportunity to direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that the Government propose, instead of proceeding with the business in the order set out on the notice-paper, to consider a proposal to pay a pension, and to delay the consideration of the Estimates, involving an expenditure of over £100,000,000.",55
192,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,Are they to be taken this session?,55
193,Mr HIGGS,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"I have been told so, and that they are to be passed, with half of honourable members away in their homes in different parte of the Commonwealth.",55
194,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"If the Estimates are to be taken, the balance of honourable members will have their Christmas dinner here.",55
195,Mr HIGGS,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"If we agree to the motion submitted by the Minister for* Price Fixing, or Customs-this Minister for many offices-w e will not be discharging our duty. I could understand a postponement of debate upon the Ministerial statement, though I should like to draw attention to the necessity for an early consideration of that matter, ih view of the announcement made today by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) that he had taken the extraordinary course of removing a Minister from office without the consent of the Prime. Minister, who is in - England."" All the circumstances point to the need for a consideration of this matter before we deal with the Iron and Steel Bounty Bill, in connection with which the Minister suggested that, as it was a - simple proposal, the Government proposed to deal with it first.",55
196,Mr MASSYGREENE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,I do not think that I advanced any reason.,55
197,Mr HIGGS,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"I think the Minister said, when he moved for the postponement of items Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5, until after the consideration of item No. 6, that he had one simple little amendment in connection with the measure.",55
198,Mr MASSYGREENE,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,But that was an aside.,55
199,Mr HIGGS,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Aside s in the House are very dangerous. The honourable member making an aside must always assume that the Hansard reporter will record the statement. Does the Minister mean to say that the Iron and Steel Bounty Bill and the Defence Bill are of greater urgency than the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill? Let the Minister be candid, and admit at once that a crisis has arisen on the Government benches. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) left the House a few minutes ago in a petulant mood. Where are his supporters? Where are the Win-the-War one- party that sits behind the Government? Why are they not here now? Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,-There are more here than on your side.",55
200,Mr HIGGS,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"I admit that; but I am not speaking of the insurgents. I am referring to those staunch, dumb, and docile supporters that sit behind the Government. When one of them, like the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Richard Poster), ventures to make a few remarks, the Acting Prime Minister turns and rends him; but the honourable member for Wakefield was afterwards paid some small compliment, and everything was all right again.",55
201,Mr MAXWELL,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,Why are you worrying the Government?,55
202,Mr HIGGS,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"The honourable member seems to think that he has done his duty to his party if he sits silently here and takes no part in this criticism of the Government, but I venture to say that if he were arguing a case before a magistrate he would be more severe.",55
203,Mr FENTOW,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,Perhaps because when a case is set down for hearing it is generally ' called up in its order.,55
204,Mr HIGGS,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"I thank the honourable member for his interjection. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) will, I am sure, agree that when a case is set down for hearing it ought to be heard, and not postponed.",56
205,Mr MAXWELL,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"Unles s for good reasons. MT. HIGGS - It should not be postponed unless the people concerned are warned. In this case honoraible members who have prepared speeches expecting the Government business to be called on in the order set down on the notice-paper, are placed at a great disadvantage. Many of them, perhaps, have gone down town to attend to urgent private business, and when they come back they will probably be disappointed to find that the Iron and Steel Bounty Bill and the Defence Bill have been taken in their absence. They may desire to move amendments in connection with these proposals, but the Assistant Minister has submitted a motion, which seems to be deception almost in the nature of the thimble and pea busi.ness-no w you. see it and now. you don't. Now you see the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill under consideration, and how you see the Chief Justice's Pension Bill. And now you don't see it , because it has' been . put under some other thimble. The odds are ten to one, and perhaps longer, that we shall not be able to say what particular measure will be under consideration at a. quarter to 8 to-night. Mr BOYD.» - What about postponing .these items, and taking the Estimates now ?",56
206,Mr HIGGS,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"That would be a sensible proposal if the Minister in charge would agree. No one wants the War-time profits Tax Assessment Bill, and no one, I imagine, wants the Chief Justice's Pension Bill, so it would be a business like method to bring forward the Estimates, and let the Corner party and the rebellious members point to the wickedness and maladministration of the Government. I am sorry the Acting Prime Minister is not here, as I do not want to say anything very unkind in his absence, but, although he was subjected to a good deal of adverse criticism, I do not think he should have displayed petulance, because, after all, honourable members have been very kind to the Government. I am sure the honourable member for .Grampians (Mr Jowett) must at times have felt compelled to rise in his place and make a few observations in criticism of the Government. The Acting Prime Minister ought not to have displayed petulance this afternoon, and I am sure that when he has had time for consideration he will be sorry that he reported progress. We were all doing very well indeed. He should not have been so severe upon the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Chapman).",56
207,The SPEAKER,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,Order! The honourable member is not discussing the question before the Chair.,56
208,Mr HIGGS,DARLINGHURST DETENTION,"I am sure, sir, you will admit that, in the interests of good government, much depends upon maintaining the order of business. The Acting Minister for Tirade and Customs has come forward with the proposal to postpone some most important measures until we have dealt with a trifling: ""amendment of the Iron and Steel Bounty Bill ; and after that it is proposed to consider the Defence ""Bill, though I think honourable members will remember that the Acting Prime Minister informed us that the Government did not want the Defence Bill before Christmas.",56

Clause 3 formed the subject of much discussion when the Bill was before this Committee. I advanced the reason then that circumstances might arise",57

BILL. It is one to which the Government can see no objection, and I therefore move That the Senate's amendment be agreed to.",57
220,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Y a r r a ) [7.48] - This is a matter of laying a regulation before Parliament. I ask the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman), who has been in this Parliament from the beginning, how many regulations have been even discussed-let alone disallowed-amon g the many thousands which have been laid upon the table. I recall that the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) gave notice several years ago, with regard to the disallowance of certain regulations. His notice of motion was never reached upon the business paper. He had no "" look in "" at all, although he sought, by other means, to initiate a discussion of the same matter. Unless there is to be something more than this proviso we might as well be without any reference to the M in ister's authorization at all. It is true that the Senate might be in a position to discuss and object to certain regulations laid before it ; but the trouble is, so far The as this House is concerned, before we had reached the stage of disallowing any regulation laid before us the imported material could be landed in Australia, and the manufacture of the product completed. If there is one fundamental principle in the Bill at all it is that Australian raw material shall be used in this manufacture. If we obtain sheet bar the steel from overseas the finished productwill have little of an Australian character about it . There will have been no Australian coal employed for the production of coke, no Australian limestone, no Australian iron ore, and no Australian wages paid. If we were to inquire.into the whole process, I dare say it would be found that the rolling of the sheet-bar steel and the galvanizing and corrugating processes would not represent more than one-eighth of. the actual wage-sheet covering the production from start to finish.",57
221,Mr MASSYGREENE,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,It would be more than that. Mr MOWII . UAMS - I do not think it The Go- would be one-eighth.,57
222,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I understand that the Minister suggests it would represent probably one-fourth. The real reason for Parliament proposing to give this -.bounty is, first of that the article shall be produced in Australia, and - that Australian .raw material - shall be used. I stated during the second-reading debate, that the proposal should commend itself to honourable members, particularly in view of the fact that at present so little overseas freight space is available. Apparently, the idea is that the space which would be required for importing galvanized iron will be saved, but that there will be shipping space enough to import the sheet bar steel. The Minister has advanced^ as the reason for the insertion of this proviso, that it will have the effect of preventing two firms in Australia, from obtaining a monopoly.' The Minister, by the very figures which he himself employed, showed that the quantity of galvanized and corrugated and black sheets used in Australia would be more than could keep one blast furnace going. . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - What about the monopoly on the part of the people doing the galvanizing?",57
223,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Yes , there might be a monopoly there. But the Government might as well say, ""Instead of keeping your rolling mills and galvanizing plant going, all you will be permitted to do will be to turn out this article, up to a certain stage."" That would be just like telling a hat manufacturer that he may make hats up to a certain stage, but that he must sell them at a certain price to another firm to finish off. That sort of practice would be altogether a mistake.",58
224,Mr MOWILLIAMS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,If this proviso were not inserted a manufacturer mightbe squeezed out.,58
225,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"But what is to stop a manufacturer, in view of the unlimited quantity of galvanized and corrugated sheets required, from putting up his own blast furnace? If he did that, there wonld be no need for this measure. The position is as though we were to pass a Bill with respect to the manufacture of wire netting or fencing wire, and were to say to a"" company, "" You must produce the rods for manufacturing the wire, and then you must sell them to another firm to finish the article, and you must sell at all, a price regarding which we shall have the oversight.'' In effect, the Government have said to a company which has laid out, I understand, well over £1,000,000 upon its works, ""We shall not give you an opportunity to finish off the article which you are producing. You must sell your product to other manufacturers, and at such a price that those people will be prepared to take it . """,58
226,Mr MASSYGREENE,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,Clause 3 has been already assented to. The matter under discussion is the proviso.,58
227,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I am dealing with che effect of the proviso; and I hold that it will have no effect at all, because we shall never have an opportunity to discuss an authorization which may be laid upon this table.",58
228,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Franklin) [7;56]. - I hope the proviso will be agreed to. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) was quite correct, so far ""as his argument proceeded; but when a bounty is being granted so as to create an industry, there must .'be some provision that those to whom the bounty is being given will not establish a monopoly and be placed in a position to freeze out any manufacturer who may begin operations in one of the other States. Suppose that a factory were started in Williamstown, or at some place in South Australia, or in Hobart. Suppose that the Broken Hill Company were to become interested in the business themselves. Does it not seem quite possible that that firm-, by not having the material to supply to others, might freeze out manufacturers in one of the other States? The amendment relates only to action to be taken in a case of necessity. I cannot imagine any Minister using his authorization unless there were absolute need for the importation of the sheet bar steel. Parliament is giving a bounty which for some time will tend to foster monopolies, and it is safe and wise to provide that if a monopoly is brought about to the detriment of manufacturers in another part of Australia, the Minister should have power to say, ."" Unless you supply these manufacturers at reasonable prices we shall take care that they secure supplies from elsewhere."" The amendment introduces warrant a very proper precaution, and I cannot understand the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition in objecting to it .",58

How long have our r u r a l ducers been compelled to endure Trade monopolies which have been foisted upon them ? If there is to be a monopoly, I would prefer that it should be one in which Australian labour and Australian materials are being combined for the proParliament duction of an Australian article. But or, have we no other method than that pro- .thirty posed in this proviso of dealing with monopasses polists ? Parliament would be quite right, of course, in taking necessary precautions.",59

CHIEF JUSTICE'S PENSIONBILL In Committee (Consideration of Governor General's message):",60
248,Mr GROOM,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Darling Downs-Actin g Attorney-General) [8.11] - I move That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Aet to provide for the grant of a pension to the first Chief Justice of Australia. In submitting this motion I would remind honourable members that onr Judiciary Act makes no provision for the granting of pensions. But section 84 of our Constitution provides that officers transferred to the Commonwealth from a State shall preserve theirexisting and accruing rights. Now, the first Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia came over from the State of Queensland after he had served as Chief Justice of that State for ten years. Under a Queensland Statute passed in 1893, the salary of the Chief Justice was fixed at £3,500 per annum. That Act was incorporated with the Queensland Supreme Court Act of 1874, section 5 of which provided thatEvery Judge of the Supreme Court shall be entitled on his having served for fifteen years as a Judge in such. Court, or on his being disabled by permanent infirmity from performance of the duties of his office, to demand a pension by way of annuity to be continued during his life to the amount of one-half of a the actual salary received by him at the time of such demand. When the Chief Justice of Queensland became Chief Justice of the High Court he had served ten years on the State Supreme Court Bench. H a d he remained in Queensland in that exalted office for another five years, he would have been entitled to retire on a pension of one-half of his salary. He was appointed to his present position on the 5th October, 1903, so that he has filled the office of Chief Justice of the High Court for fifteen years. Seeing that he gave up his position in Queensland with its accompanying rights and privileges to become the Chief Justice of Australia at the same salary as he was then receiving, I submit that it is only reasonable and just that he should be granted a pension, and placed in a position similar to that which he would have occupied had he remained in Queensland instead of accepting service with the Commonwealth.",60
249,Mr HIGGS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,What do the Government propose to pay him?,60
250,Mr GROOM,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"The proposal is that on his retirement he shall be paid the same pension as that to which he would have been entitled had he remained in Queensland, half of the salary-£1,75 0 per annum.",60
251,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,All the public servants taken over by the Commonwealth with the transferred State Departments carried with them their accrued pension rights.,60
252,Mr GROOM,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Yes , and in providing all a pension for the Chief justice we shall only be putting him in the position occupied by the public servants who were transferred from the various States at the inception of Federation, its payment being a mere act of justice. Of the three members who originally constituted the High Court, the Chief Justice alone came from a State Bench. Mr Justice Rich, who at a later date was appointed to the Commonwealth High Court, was also taken from the New South Wales Bench. May I give to the Committee a brief sketch of the services which Sir Samuel Griffith has. rendered to his country ? He has the unique record of a service of forty-six years in the public life of this country. He has been a member of the Queensland Legislature and of the Queensland Bench; has taken part in a Colonial Conference and in the Federal Convention; and for fifteen years he has occupied the high and dignified Office which he still fills. Sir Samuel is really an Australian, although he was born in Wales, in 1845, and is therefore now seventy-three years of age. He came to Australia at the age of eight years, was educated at the Maitland ,H'gh School, and, passing to the Sydney University at the age of fourteen years, graduated there as Bachelor and Master of Arts after a brilliant scholastic career, distinguishing himself in classics and mathematics, and winning the Mort Travelling Scholarship. Sir Samuel Griffith went to Queensland and was called to the Bar of that State in 1867. He immediately gained front rank in the legal profession, was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland in 1872, and after a brief period was, by virtue of his outstanding abilities, appointed Attorney-General. He afterwards held various portfolios until 1879, when he became Leader of the Opposition. He was Premier of Queensland from 1883 to 1888, then Leader of the Opposition again, and subsequently, from 1890 to 1S93, Premier, Chief Secretary, and Attorney-General of the State. In ""1893 he was made Chief Justice of Queensland. Sir Samuel Griffith introduced the first measure providing for free, secular, and compulsory education in Queensland, and was the first Minister of Public Instruction in that State. In 1901 he was made a member of the Judicial Oommittee of the Privy Council, an honour that he richly deserved, and, in 1903, he was appointed ilr. Groom. first Chief Justice of the High Court of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Constitution of the Commonwealth created three fundamental institutions-the Parliament, the Executive, and the Judiciary. Of these the last named occupies a unique position, as it is the interpreter, or-as an American Judge has put it-the guardian of the Constitution. It is the duty of our Judiciary to determine in the conflicts that arise out of the exercise of the rights of sovereign powers of Commonwealth and State. It was recognised when the first High Court Bench was appointed that we needed a strong and powerful Judiciary, and that the best men that Australia could command should be obtained. When Sir Samuel Griffith, Sir Edmund Barton, and the late Mr R. E. O'Connor'were appointed, it was felt throughout the legal profession and among the community generally that they would form a Judiciary which would administer justice impartially throughout the Commonwealth, and hold the scales of justice f airlyin the settlement of questions arising between the Commonwealth and States. All eyes turned toward Sir Samuel, the new Chief Justice, who was appointed to preside over the Court because of his ability, learning, knowledge, wide range of experience, and great strength of character. Without desiring to pronounce judgment on a living record, I can safely assert that Sir Samuel Griffith has realized the high expectations of those responsible for his appointment to the Ohief Justiceship. There was need of a strong man for the position, because the High Court had to be organized and set going as part of the machinery of the Constitution. It . was not long before the Court was properly started on its career. We were only then beginning to realise what our Constitution meant. Honourable members who were in this Parliament in 1901 know the pain and effort that were given, and the ability that was shown, in the first years of Federation, in converting the piece of parchment which was our Constitution into a living organism for the good government of the people of Australia. Critics outside sometimes disparage our public men, but wben the history of Australia has been impartially written, it will be acknowledged that no other Federation in the world can show greater progress and development, or greater ability, in the settlement of national problems, than was shown by the Commonwealth of Australia in the first, twenty years of its existence. questions arose upon which the High Court was called to adjudicate, and it was for the Justices to interpret the instrument of government under which Parliament was working. When the judgments of the Court are quietly and fair l y studied, the enormous difficulties of the Justices, and the pains they took, and the ability they showed in their interpretation of the Constitution, will be appreciated. In - the framing of these judgments the Chief Justice played an exceedingly conspicuous part. - Sir Samuel Griffith was responsible for the introduction of many laws that are still on the statute-book of Queensland. As a member of a Colonial Conference he gave proof of abilities which marked hi m out as a statesman of the Empire, and as a member of the D r a f t in g Committee of the first Convention he was practically responsible for the framing of the d r a f t Constitution on which our present Constitution is based. When in Parliament he showed himself to be a wonderfully skilful draftsman. H is was a keen, analytical mind, and he had a wonderful g if t for discerning the trend of debate, crystallizing the views of members, and embodying them in a clear piece of legislation. These abilities were again seen in his work in the Federal Convention of 1891. He rendered invaluable service to Australia by the part be played there. . While on the Queensland Bench he took up ithe subject of law reform, and the criminal code which he drafted is a model of perfection. He spent a great deal of time and research upon it , and in practical working it has been found one of the most useful codes that is known. I will not' remind honourable members further of the services which this great man has given .to Australia during the past years. When the history of this country is written, his name will be recalled with pride as that of a great British subject, who, in the Dominions overseas, played an important part in the building of the Empire.",60
253,Mr HIGGS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Capricornia) [ 8 . 3 0 ] - I Many have never had a more painful duty to perform than that which I am about to undertake. But when the Government submit a proposition of this kind, even though the mover surrounded) it by . a very eloquent tribute to a very able man, I have to consider what is my duty to the general public in the Capricornia electorate, whom I represent, and to the people of Australia. As the Ministry have chosen to bring this motion forward as a personal matter, it is most unpleasant for me - to be compelled to consider it from a personal stand-point, and to discount the eloquent tribute that the Minister (Mr Groom), in proposing the motion, has seen fit to pay to Sir Samuel Griffith. I agree with all that he said about the intellectual brilliancy of Sir Samuel Griffith, about his great erudition as a scholar, his remarkable attainments as a lawyer, and also the distinguished position he filled as an Australian politician. I admit all those qualifications; but, in the phraseology of the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), "" he has been on a very good wicket."" The Minister has pointed out that Sir Samuel played a very important part in the public life of Aus-. tralia. In the political arena in Queensland Sir Samuel was a great protagonist, and if he had chosen to remain in public life no doubt he would have continued to show that he had pre-eminent qualities that entitled him to be a leader amongst his countrymen. But he did not choose the thorny path of the politician; he chose the primrose path. He left the politics of Queensland, and was translated to the position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He represented to those who desired him to accept that appointment that it would not pay him to do so at the salary then attaching to the position-£2,500 , I believe. There may have been political reasons for removing him forty-six from parliamentary life.; he was a most dangerous opponent.",62
254,Sir ROBERT BEST,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,He was worthy of the position of Chief Justice.,63
255,Mr HIGGS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I admit that lie was the man most qualified for the position; but, at the same time, I remind the Committee that the salary was raised from £2,500 to £3,000 per annum in order to induce his acceptance of the post. The Minister has mentioned that Sir Samuel was entitled to certain pension rights as a Queensland public servant.",63
256,Mr GROOM,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I said that, had he continued in the Queensland Service, he would have been entitled to a pension.",63
257,Mr HIGGS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"And why is he not entitled to a pension, like other public servants who entered the Commonwealth Service from the State Service ?",63
258,Mr GROOM,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,Because he is not transferred officer.,63
259,Mr HIGGS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Because , I venture to say, the Queensland Government would not agree to the transfer-. Sir Samuel knew what he was doing when he accepted the position of Chief Justice of. the High Court at a salary of £3,500, and at the time he received a great deal of credit for having surrendered his pension rights as a State officer in order to become Chief Justice of the High Court. One must not forget that fact.",63
260,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,A man cannot live long on credit.,63
261,Mr HIGGS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Si r Samuel Griffith was to receive a salary of £3,500 per annum, and are we to infer from the honourable member's interjection that he does not consider that salary sufficient?",63
262,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Yes , I do.",63
263,Mr HIGGS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"In addition to the salary of £3,500, he was given credit and the gratitude of the people for having taken the position. Brilliant as Sir Samuel has been in the past, for the last few years he has not been the keenest intellect on the High Court Bench. An attempt was made by the Prime Minister to induce the Queensland Government to regard Sir Samuel as a transferred officer, and the offer was made that if the Queensland Government would pay portion of the pension the Commonwealth Government would pay the balance. Finding that the Queensland Government would not agree to that suggestion, the Commonwealth Government now come forward with this audacious proposal to grant the Federal Chief Justice a pension of £1,750. As a proof that the Chief Justice has not been the keenest intellect on the High Court Bench for some years, I instance the report which he submitted, as a Royal Commissioner, as to the monthly quota of men required as reinforcements. How did he proceed ? Did he, as a Royal Commissioner ought to have done, call for evidence from witnesses who were capable of saying whether the Prime. Minister (Mr Hughes) was speaking the truth when he made statements regarding the need for reinforcements, which everybody now must admit were grossly exaggerated? No; he called no witnesses. In his report he saida I have examined such documents and records as appeared to be likely to elucidate the matter, and have now the honour to submit to Your Excellency the results of my examination. I have not thought it necessary to take formal oral evidence except such explanation as I desired of the various documents and records examined, which was very fully and freely x given by Major-General J. G. Legge, to whom I am much indebted for his assistance. Was that done because of any promise made by the Prime Minister regarding a pension? I can assure honourable mem- bers that it is not pleasant for me to have to say these things, but when the Ministry bring forward this motion as a personal matteT, and at such a time, I must do my duty. Sir .Samuel Griffith chose the primrose path- a handsome salary, and the honour and prestige which attached to the position of Chief Justice of the High Court. A man can devote himself to_ no more noble work than the service of his country, whether as a shire councillor, municipal councillor, member of a State Parliament, or member of the Federal Parliament. Whatever may be said in disparagement bf public life, whatever men may do to lower their high office, I maintain that service given to the country as a legislator is equal in importance to the service given by a Judge. Yet there is no pension for a member of Parliament, or even for a Minister of the Crown. There is no pension for the man who makes the law, or for Ms widow and children. Do honourable members know that the widow of an ex-Postmaster-General is earning her living as a typist, and that the widow of a former member of this Parliament maintains herself and children by working as a laundress and cleaner? honour to both of them. 'They are acting well their part, and therein the honour lies. ""When the Ministry come forward with a proposal to pay a pension of. £1,750 per annum to Sir Samuel Griffith, I am reminded that for twenty-five years at least-te n years as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland, and fifteen years as Chief Justice of the High Court-h e has been in receipt of first, a salary of £3,000, and then a salary of £3,500 per annum. In addition he has received, I suppose, at least £500 per annum as expenses. If it be whispered to me, as a Teason why. we should pay this pension, that he has financial obligations, I say that, out of that sum of over £S0,000 which he has received during a period of twenty-five years, he ought to have made provision for his old age. Recently the Government were asked whether, in view of the increased cost of livin g during the last few years, they would consider the question of increasing the old-age pension by 2s. 6d. per week, and what was their answer"" In view of the state of the finances, an increase in the rate of the old-age pension is at the present time not considered justifiable."" This proposed grant of a pension to Sir Samuel Griffith was decided by this Parliament years ago. In this House a proposal was made that a pension should be paid to the Justices of the High Court, and by twenty-nine votes to twenty, the motion was defeated. The division list as reported in Hansard, Vol.. XIII . , page 1245, shows that twenty voted for and twenty-nine against the proposal. Those who voted for it were Sir Edmund Barton, Messrs. A . Chapman, Conroy, S. W . Cook, Crouch, Cruickshank, Deakin, Sir John Porrest, Sir Phillip Fysh, Mr Glynn, Sir Malcolm MCEacharn, Messrs. A . Paterson, Sawers, Skene, Bruce Smith, D . Thomson, Watson, Willis, Ewing, and L . E . Groom. The pairs in favour of the pro Turner, Messrs. Wilkinson, Harper, and Hughes, Sir Willia m Lyne, and Messrs. Kingston, Spence, and Higgins. Those , who voted against the proposal were Mr . All Batchelor, Sir Langdon - Bonython, Messrs. Joseph Cook, J . H . Cook, G. B . Edwards, Pisher, Powler, Hartnoll, Isaacs, Kennedy, Kirwan, Mahon, Mauger, MCCay, MCDonald,-A. MCLean, O'Malley, Page, Poynton, Sir John Quick, Messrs. J . B . Ronald, E . Solomon, V . L . Solomon, Thomas, Tudor, Watkins, Wilks, Puller, and Salmon. The pairs against the proposal consisted of Mr F . E. MCLean, Sir W . MCMillan, Messrs. E . N . Cameron, A . C. Groom, T. Brown, Sir E . Braddon, and Messrs. Phillips, Bamford, and S. Smith. A division was also taken on this question in the Senate on 6th August, 1903, and, as reported in Hansard, V o l . XV . , page"" 3169, three voted. in favour of it and fourteen against. Those in favour of granting a pension. were Messrs. Harney, Pulsford, and Walker, while those against it were Messrs. Barrett, Best, Cameron, Dawson, de Largie, Dobson, 7 Keating, Matheson, MCGregor, O'Connor, Pearce, Stewart, Styles, and O'Keefe. The pairs were as follows:-For"" : Messrs. Ferguson and Neild, Sir John Downer, Messrs. Macfarlane, Gould, Saunders, and Sir J . H . Symon. Against: Messrs. Glassey, Smith, Playford, Charleston, Reid, Higgs, and Fraser. The matter on that occasion was dealt with from a public stand-point, and apart altogether from personal considerations. When the question of the salary to be paid the Chief Justice was before this House on that occasion, Mr (now Sir Joseph) Cook, said I intend to move that the salary of the Chief Justice be reduced by £1,000, because £2,500 is sufficiently high as a commencing salary . . . Therefore we shall do a wise . thing, and certainly a thing that will be in keeping with our protestations of economy, if we reduce the amount to be paid . . . Mr MCCay (now Brigadier-General MCCay) said, as reported at page 1224 of Hansard-and I bring this point under the notice of those who are too much inclined to consider the interests of persons in high places, and not to look broadly enough at those of the general mass of the communityI do not see why a Judge with a salary of £3,000 should get a pension any more than a post-office messenger with a salary at £100 or £200. A Judge has a better chance of providing for his old age than the average working man. During the last twenty-five years Sir Samuel Griffith has received over £82,000 by way of income as a Judge, and he should have made provision for his old age. Some one may whisper that he has financial obligations. If he was so foolish as to incur financial obligations in a desire to get suddenly rich, or for any other reason, that very fact should go against his appointment to the High Court or any other Bench. Our Justices» occupy such a high position in Australia that we should at least expect them to be common-sense and prudent men. Sir William Irvine, who in this House and throughout the country dwelt upon the necessity for every eligible man to go to the Front, might have.helped us in the war, but he did not. It is necessary that we should have the best brains to assist in the government of Australia, but Sir William Irvine also took the primrose path, and he retired from this Parliament to go on the Supreme Court Bench of this State at a salary of £3,000 per annum.",63
264,Mr MAXWELL,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,Surely it is not necessary to refer to such a matter.,65
265,Mr HIGGS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I was about to point that when the Labour party urged the payment of pensions to women and men of sixty and sixty-five years of age respectively, Sir William Irvine, as a member of this House, said that the granting of such pensions was calculated to sar> the fibre and independence of the people.",65
266,Mr CONSIDINE,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,That is only when the principle is applied to the working classes.,65
267,Mr HIGGS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"That is so, and it is on behalf of ithe mass of the people that I oppose this proposal to grant Sir Samuel Griffit h a pension of £1,750 per annum. In-connection with the war census of 1915 all persons of eighteen years and upwards possessed of property or in receipt of incomes had to fill in returns. The official figures show that 66,460 males and 249,000 females, or a total of 315,460 persons of the age of eighteen years and over, had then no income whatever; 437,000 had an income of under £50 per annum; 495,000 had an income of £50 and not exceeding £ 1 0 0 ; 500,000 had an income of £100 but not exceeding £150; and 502,811 had an income of £150 but not exceeding £156. No less than 1,810,000 were in receipt of an income of under £3 per week, whilst 381,000 received an income of £3 per week and over. Out of a population of 4,900,000, only 1,876,000 had any income whatever. These thousands of married men, with families, in receipt of an income of £ 3 per week are expected to rear, educate, and provide for their families; and Sir Will i a m Irvine, and no doubt Sir Samuel Griffith, would consider that they ought to be prudent, and out of their wage put away something for their old age. If a man receiving £3 per week is expected to do that, surely the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, who is receiving £3,500 per annum, and has been paid over £32,000 by way of income during the last twenty-five years, ought to be able to put away something, and so to render it unnecessary for the Government to bring forward a proposal of this kind. I am astonished that the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr W at t ) , who the other day, paid himself the high comout pliment of saying that he was the only Treasurer who had ever tackled the Commonwealth finances, and who had succeeded in reducing the expenditure by £2,000,000, should be a party to a proposal of this kind.",65
268,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,I suppose if he had included the honourable member in his statement this would not have been said.,65
269,Mr HIGGS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"That is an absurd remark, more absurd even than the remarks usually made by the honourable member.",65
270,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,The honourable member seems to me badly gravelled to-night.,65
271,Mr HIGGS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Since this is a personal matter, the task I have to perform is an unpleasant one. In the discharge of one's, public duties one might have to meet the Chief Justice at a public function at any time, and it is extremely unpleasant to have to review his career in this way. I assure honourable members opposite that if they imagine that I take any delight in this matter they are mistaken. But the great public of Australia, who have to work for their living at £3 per week, will want to know what kind of a Government is this that proposes to give one man a pension of £1,750 per annum. Mr HECTO B LAMOND - The Democracy of Queensland is providing the same pension for its Chief Justice.",65
272,Mr HIGGS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"The Chief Justice of Queensland now receives only £2,500 per annum by way of salary.",66
273,Mr HECTO BLAMOND,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,And when retires he receives one-half of his salary by way of pension.,66
274,Mr HIGGS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"When Sir Samuel G r i ff i th was Chief Justice of Queensland the office carried with it a salary of £3,000 per annum, but his successor receives only £2,500, so that it will be seen that Sir Samuel Griffith has been rather a "" curled d a r l in g "" of the Judiciary and of the Queensland and Commonwealth Parliaments during the last twenty-five years. The Chief Justice of the United States receives less than we pay our Chief Justice, although that country has a population of over-100,000,000. As my time has almost expired, I move That after the word "" That"" the following words be inserted :- "" in view of the state of the finances and the just demands by the public and press for economy in Commonwealth expenditure, the present is not an opportune time to grant a pension of £1,750 per annum to any one,"" I may use the balance of my time to point out that the Chief Justice of Canada, Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, receives a salary of £2,083 - the Chief Justice of the United States, the Hon. E . A . White, receives a salary of £3,125, while the Assistant Judges there are paid £3,020, all with no pension rights. In Canada there are six Judges, whereas in Australia we have no fewer than seven. that we have done handsomely, as a Commonwealth, by Sir Samuel Griffith. It is very wrong, and not in keeping with the professions of this Government, to come forward with a proposal to pay £1,750 a year in this way, and if there is one thing that will defeat this "" Win-thewar "" Government and their supporters at the next election it will be the carriage of a measure of this kind.",66
275,Mr MAXWELL,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Fawkner) [ 9 . 1 ] The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) twitted me this afternoon with the fact that I am a silent member, and I have very largely to plead guilty great to the charge. But I am a fair l y attentive, and, I hope, a not unintelligent listener in this House; and, further, I hope that my silence is the silence of modesty, and not always the silence of ignorance. I should preserve my usual he demeanour, even in regard to this proposal, were it not that I feel I cannot remain silent, seeing that I intend to vote against the proposal of the' Government. Like the honourable member who has preceded me, it is with the greatest diffidence that I take up my' present attitude. It is only because I feel compelled by my conscience to do so that I shall oppose the proposal now before the Committee. I think that,, from my point of view, the position can be very simply put. It is not necessary to canvass the qualifications of Sir Samuel Griffith. B y common consent he is an ornament to his profession; he possesses great natural endowments, with fine legal attainments and very wide experience. In his own State, before he was offered the position of Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, he had risen to the very top of the tree, and was, I suppose, head, and shoulders above his fellows, both in the sphere of politics and in the world of law. A distinct and definite offer was made to him of the highest legal position in the Commonwealth. . There was no monetary inducement for him to accept the offer-indeed , the acceptance of it meant a financial loss to him. B.ut one remembers that the position he was offered was one of very great honour, such as no man would lightly set aside. I , for one, have no doubt that Sir I consider Samuel Griffith, conscious as he was of his mature powers, and keenly alive to the important duties that would attach to his new position, felt that in accepting it he would be able to render very valuable service to the Commonwealth. That conviction, I believe, was largely the determining factor in inducing b i m to accept the position. The terms of the offer that was then made to him-becaus e it was a distinct and definite offer-were very specific. Sir Samuel Griffith was offered the position of Chief Justice of the Commonwealth at a salary of £3,500 a year and no pension. That was distinctly understood. Sir Samuel Griffith accepted that offer with his eyes open, and knew exactly what he was accepting and what it involved. Por fifteen years he has filled his high office as, I think all will agree, with the most conspicuous success. has fulfilled his part of the contract, he has faithfull y done his d u t y ; but I maintain that the Commonwealth has also f u l filled its part of the contract. He rendered service and he received the reward he had stipulated he should receive. For fifteen years, also, he has been engaged in work which, although intellectually exacting, was, I feel sure, performed by him with the keenest possible pleasure. He has all the time been working under conditions that tend to make a man's work a real pleasure. What were the conditions? First of all, the Chief Justice has been doing work that was well within his powers; and that is always a great satisfaction to a man. His work was, as I say, very exacting and very important; but he was conscious of his power, and he felt that the work was always well within that power. second place, the work was congenial to him. He had been trained to it all his life-ha d grown up with it . He is a thoroughly .trained and skilled lawyer, and, therefore, the work fro m day to day, and from year to year, was perfectly congenial. Then, I think every reasonable man will admit, he was receiving for his labour adequate remuneration. In the last place, he had security of tenure; and that is a great thing. If a man feels that his office is secure, it gives him solid satisfaction. The fact that the Chief Justice occupies a high and responsible position him to no more credit for faithfully his duty, than is due to the servant of the State who renders honest, conscientious service. If that be so, I Mr Maxwell. should like to know on what ground this proposal of the Government can be justified. That is my difficulty. It is such a proposal as this that brings us hard up against a painful fact- a fact that, to my mind,- is a standing reproach to our social system - I mean the fact that there are in our community men and women who are engaged in ' a hand-to-hand struggle with poverty, and who are living continually with in measurable distance of actual want. I desire at this stage to cite one or two cases along the lines in dicated by the last speaker (Mr Higgs). Every one of us, as members of Parliament, if we had not the experience before, He are each day of our lives brought into contact with painful cases; and I shall cite three from the rank and file. We are asked to give this pension to a man occupying an exalted position; and the cases to which I shall refer are those of people in humble walks of life, who are fighting the battle of life manfully. I have not chosen extreme, but just ordinary every-day cases. A fine stamp of man, forty-seven years of age, waited upon me, and I learnt that he had a delicate wife and seven children, the youngest of whom is sixteen months old. He had an accident in a saw^mill, by which his right hand was mutilated, and he lost the use of it.e He applied for various positions, but on each occasion was rejected because he is unable to use his right hand. Efforts were made to get him an invalid pension, but this was refused on the In the ground that he is not incapacitated; and I have his letter here asking me for my assistance in getting him employment. The second case is that of a . fine type ' of woman, with a son at the Front who has been wounded twice. He r husband, a good, steady man, was an assayer who got poisoned by fumes, and is now unable to follow his calling. He is anxious to get work in a warehouse, or something of the kind, but has not been successful, and the wife says she does not know what they will do, for the home will have to be broken up. The third case is that of a young rejected soldier, who was taken on entitles two years ago as a messenger in the Dedoing fence Department at 15s. per week. At humblest tfie end of the year his wage was raised to £ 1 , and at the end of the second year to> £ 1 5s.; but he has just now been a given notice that, being over twenty-one years of age, he cannot be kept on. A few months ago, his father was drowned, his mother is broken down in health. has been helping to support his mother, and is now at his wit's end to know what to do. These are the kind of cases that come before us for our consideration every day. Now, I say that, for people such as these, l i fe is a stern battle, they are fighting bravely, many go down in spite of themselves. The community has not yet recognised its obligation - extend a helping hand to such as they. There is another class in our comfrom munity-ou r soldier men, who have fighting another kind of battle in the world war. To them we have incurred a deep debt of obligation. I have the they honour to be president of a pathetic little association composed of men who lost their sight in the trenches. on the very threshold of life, and will have to face many years of darkness,' they are fine, healthy young fellows. Many of them have just married, and yet they will never have the pleasure of looking into the face, of wife or child. They are handicapped to the end of their lives as wage-earners. Some of us have been trying to have their position imto proved, and we have made a proposal that they shall receive a pension of a week; bnt we are practically told that the country cannot afford this. I am not going to labour the question, castle because I only desire to give reasons I cannot conscientiously support the posal of the Government. m u n i ty should be just before it is Court. generous. We ought to face and nise our real obligations to the rank file of our people who have gone down i ""the battle of life-wh o have been worsted in the fight-through no faul t of their own.

I compliment the They are honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell) on the splendid speech he has as made, and the stand he has taken on this question. There are about half-a-dozen members in the chamber to-night .who can remember the debate which took place in 1903 on the Judiciary Bill . It could not be said on that occasion that those who were opposed to the payment of pensions Justices of the High Court were doing so because the name of any individual £ 4 was mentioned.

Most honpledged orable members opposite will do the same. do so.,69
278,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,Why does the honourable member say that?,69
279,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Because of the experimentioned ence of the past few days. Por instance, the honourable member talked one way about the War Precautions Bill , and voted another way. H|e is like the honorHouse, able member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Poster), a supporter that the Grovernprobably ment do not mind having. He is allowed to say what he likes, as long as his can be relied on.

This House deliberately, and abstainer the Senate subsequently, objected to the proposal to give pensions, and thereing, upon the salary of the Ohief Justice was fixed at £3,500, and the salaries of other Justices at £3,000 each. Two tlemen who were afterwards appointed Justices of the High Court were members of the House at the time the Bill passed. One of them (Mr . Isaacs) voted against giving pensions, other (Mr Justice Higgins) voted f them. No* question of individuality was raised during the debates, and I hope that throughout the discussion of this Bill honourable members will not bring into question the individuality of Sir Samuel Griffith.",69

281,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I happened to hear portion of the speech of the honourable member for Capricornia, but I did not hear him deal adversely with the Chief Justice. I approach this matter from the point of view of the principle of the measure, and the precedent it will estabthe lish. We are asked to vote for the thin go end of the wedge for the payment of penmatsions, and it is a Government that is to economy that is asking us to Every metropolitan member could duplicate over and over again the cases by the honourable member for Pawkner (Mr Maxwell). .Probably every honourable member could mention similar cases. Last week, within 2 miles of this a poor woman, who was in such awful circumstances when her boy died, through her not being able to obtain the necessaries of life, that vote she could not pay for burying the child, and was compelled to wheel dead body in a perambulator a public gardens, where she laid it down so that it could be seen by a passer-by. The honourable member for Pawkner will realise that if the cases he . by mentioned could occur in Albert Park, or Hawksburn, there are still pitiable cases in the poorer suburbs i l of Melbourne. Here is one case for which was I can vouch. A man who has been a total all. his life, and has followed the hardest class of work, navvying and stokhas been stricken down at the age of forty-eight years, and' has been in the the hospital for six months. He has a wife genand six children. Honourable members who have been through the struggle know what happens in such circumwas stances. They know that the w if e Justice is compelled to go out and seek the work. The honourable member has meno r tioned the case of a lad who has. been dismissed at twenty-one years of age because otherwise he would have to be given a higher rate of wage. Last week a boy went into camp with the Yarra Borderers, and when he returned to his work he found that he had been dismissed, and that another boy had obtained his posiWhen I made inquiries by teledid phone, the firm told me that when the lad was put on he was informed that he would be dismissed when he reached the age of eighteen, because if he remained with them after reaching that age they would be obliged to pay him a higher rate of wage. I asked the mother whether I would proceed any further in the matter witha view to the Defence Department having the firm prosecuted. I would like to see some of these firms prosecuted if they dismiss youths who go into camp for military training.",69
282,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,Was dismissed because he went into camp?,70
283,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"The boy was working with the firm until he went into camp. He reached the age of eighteen 'years while in camp. The firm's excuse was that they had told him when he was engaged that he would be dismissed on reaching that age. I am not able to verify their statement from the boy, and the mother says that it is not worthwhile going on with the case, but I would like to go on with it . I have another case on the same lines. Strange to say, the representatives of both firms concerned hold high official positions in the employers' organizations of Australia. I shall not mention any names until matters are taken further. I have given the other firm the opportunity to reinstate their former employee. It is more my desir.e to get these youths employment than to have any one prosecuted. It is difficult for any young man to get employment today, because many of the firms say that there is no chance for them owing to the demobilization of the recruits in camp and the return of men from overseas. ' I agree with the then honourable member for Corinella (Colonel MCCay), who said in this House that he did] not see why a Judge, with a salary of £3,500 a year, should get a pension, any more than a Post Office messenger with a salary of £100 or £200. Let us compare the pensions proposed to be given under this Bill with the pensions that returned soldiers, men who are crippled, are getting.",70

291,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"It was a sneer at your Ministry, and not at the returned soldiers. I ask that the standing order requiring that the statement be withdrawn and apologized for be enforced. The honourable member made a remark which was offensive to me, and an insult.",70
292,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I will withdraw the remark, but I will not apologize u n t i l I am compelled to do so. I will not apologize to this man, who grins at the mention of returned soldiers.",70
293,Mr HECTO BLAMOND,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I rise again to a point of order. I object to be pointed at as a man who grins at the returned soldier. The honourable member for Y a r ra is not a returned soldier, and it was the measure introduced by the Government of which he was a member that decided the pensions to be paid to returned soldiers. There are many who try to make capital out of the returned soldier who would not give them decent pensions.",70
294,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY," In my opinion, the statement to which the honourable member for Illawarra takes exception is somewhat offensive, and I therefore ask the honourable member for Y a r r a to withdraw it-, - and apologize.",70

296,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY, I call upon the honourable member to apologize out of the respect due to the Chair.,70
297,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I will apologize, but the honourable member cannot prevent me thinking as I do of his conduct, and of that of honourable members opposite. When the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was seeking for the soldiers' votes, he made the statement, which appeared in the publication All for Australia, that it was the intention of the Government Jo raise the soldiers' pensions to £2 per week. When the late Treasurer (then Sir John Forrest) was asked whether there was any truth in that statement, he said it was the first he had heard of it ; but there is no doubt that there was a deliberate promise made by the Prime Minister, when looking for the votes of the soldiers overseas, that their pensions would be raised. The honourable member for Illawarra speaks of a pension of 30s. per week, but not 10 per cent, of even those who are crippled and maimed get a pension of 30s. a week.",71
298,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,I said that the pension of 30s. per week was proposed by the Government of which the honourable member was a member.,71
299,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,The honourable member must keep quiet. He should know that he is not allowed to interject. He would not be allowed to do so if he were on this side.,71
300,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,The honourable member must not reflect upon the Chair.,71
301,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I do not wish to do so; but the honourable member for Illawarra should be kept in order or put out. The Prime Minister promised the returned soldiers a pension of £2 per week, but honourable members may go to any meeting of returned soldiers and ask the crippled and maimed whether they are getting apension of £2 per week, and he will find that they are not. Under this Bill, however, the Government propose to give the Chief Justice of the High Court a pension of over £30 a week.",71
302,Mr GROOM,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,It would be better for the honourable gentleman to give specific cases of men who are not receiving proper pensions than to make general charges. The 4 honourable member knows that the Government are making every effort to assist incapacitated men. The proper thing for him to do is to bring specific cases under the notice of the Government.,71
303,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I have brought many cases under notice, but I have not been very successful in having grievances remedied. I am opposed to the granting of a pension to the Chief Justice of the High Court, or to any Justice of that Court. When he accepted the position, the Chief Justice knew that this Parliament had deliberately decided that there should be no pension attached to the position. The matter was thoroughly dis-. cussed on the 23rd and 24th June, 1903, and, in the course of the debate, the present Acting Minister for the Navy (Mr. Poynton) saidPersonally I am entirely opposed to granting pensions to a' few individuals who are in receipt of very large salaries. I was fighting for some time to secure some increase of salary for persons very deserving of consideration. I refer to those engaged in cleaning the offices of the various public Departments. I am glad to be able to say that the Acting Prime Minister"" (Mr Watt) has agreed to raise their salaries from 25s. per week to 27s. 6d. I give the honourable gentleman credit for that. It was only a fair thing to do in view of the present high oost of living, but the increase was secured only after a great struggle. Honourable members may contend that this ooncerns but one case, and will not be quoted as a precedent, but there is no doubt whatever that it will be quoted as a precedent. When other Justices of the High Court become ill or incapacitated, and it is considered advisable to relieve them of their duties claims will be made for pensions for them.",71
304,Mr MAXWELL,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,If this be agreed to there will be no answer to those claims.,71
305,Mr COBSEB,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"The honourable gentleman should remember that Sir Samuel Griffith, on accepting the position of Chief Justice of the High Court, though he received nohigher remuneration, gave lip his right to a pension as Chief Justice of the Queensland Supreme Court. The other Justices of the High Court did not do that.",71
306,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I believe that Mr Justice Rich was a Judge in New South Wales entitled to pension rights, but the fact remains that this Parliament deliberately decided that there should be no pension attaching to the position of a Justice of the High Court.",72
307,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,That decision was sacrosanct.,72
308,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I am well aware of that, but it is an answer to the honourable member-for Wide Bay.",72
309,Mr COBSEB,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,I mentioned the matter to show that there was a reason why similar claim could not be made on half of the other Justices of the H i Court.,72
310,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"If this Bill is passed members of this House will be unable withstand the pressure that will be brought to bear upon them if pensions character are sought for the other Justices. I wish to make it perfectly clear that I .have nothing-at all to say against the Chief Justice of the High Court or other Justice on the H i gh Court Bench, but I do say that at the present time, in view of the state of our finances and view of the answer given by the Acting Prime Minister within the past week another request, this pension should be granted. An honourable asked the Acting Prime Minister whether he was prepared to increase the old-age pension beyond 12s. 6d. per week, and the answer given was that in September, 1917, the old-age pension was raised 12s. 6d. per week, and the Government could not, in view of the present state the finances, raise it again. liberately that many of the persons ceipt of old-age pensions are tetter titled to an increase of those pensions than is Sir Samuel Griffith to the pension proposed to be granted to him under Bill. I will go so far as to say <' throughout the country there is not old-aged pensioner who is titled to an extra 2s. 6d. per week than is the present Chief Justice of Australia to the pension of over £ 3 0 per week proposed to be voted to him under this Bill . I hope that honourable members will port the amendment, and will agree that House. this is not the time to adopt an absolutely ' new principle in opposition to a previous decision of this Parliament deliberately turning down a proposal to grant pensions to the Justices of the High Court.",72
311,Mr BOTD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Henty) [9.40] - In m y view, questions of finance or of economy do not enter the consideration of this matter at all . The comparisons not made between the' amount to be paid under this Bill and the conditions of old age pensioners are very-wide of the mark. The principle underlying the Bill is the pensioning of our Judges, and I subscribe to that principle, whether it applies genea rally or to an individual case. I believe be that the Judges in all the British Dog h minions have a reputation second to none in the world. Even the people of other nations admire British Courts as being beyond the possibility of corruption. If to there is one thing of which the British people have a right to be proud, it is the of the British Judiciary throughout the Empire.",72
312,Mr MAXWELL,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,Does the honourable member suggest that it is their righ t to any pensions that lift s them above suspicion ?,72
313,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,The honourable member in has made an appeal purely out of the goodness of his heart. I admire him for it ; to but this is a matter which the honourable not member should have permitted to appeal member to his head rather than his heart. ,72
314,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I think it necessary to use my head in ' dealing with this question. We have men of the highest calibre to on our various Benches. So far as the High Court is concerned, it is quite true of that at the outset of Federation, before I say dethere were any Justices of the High in reCourt in existence, a vote was taken as ento whether they should be entitled to pensions. A good deal has been made of the fact that the decision of Parliament this was that there should be no pensions at that tached to their positions; but what was one the vote on the matter? It was a vote not better enof tweny-two to twenty.",72
315,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,No ; twenty-nine to twenty.,72
316,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,That was only a vote of suplittle more than half the members of ithe,72
317,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"That did not include pairs, and I think there were sixteen members paired for that division.",72
318,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"The honourable member need not try to put that game up on me. In my opinion, the biggest farce in this Parliament is' the arrangement made for recording pairs. There are twenty-five or thirty members present this evening, and if a division were taken, we should find the names of all the representatives of New South Wales in the pair-book, though they would not know how they were going to be made to vote. A vote of twenty-nine to twenty represents forty-nine members out of a house of seventy-five. I think that on one occasion there were seventy-six members of this House.",73
319,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,No .,73
320,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,I think there were.,73
321,Mr TUDOR,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,There might be only seventy-two.,73
322,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"That is, if the constituencies were equally divided, but, as we know, they are not. The Judges of the State Courts are 'entitled to pensions. There are men who have a long run at the Bar, and who extract huge fees from a suffering public, and amass great fortunes. They are indifferent about the receipt of a pension, as they have sufficient money to enable them to do without it ; but there are other men, possessed of great legal ability but of no business capacity for the successful investment of money, and the position of a Judge to which there is attached a right of pension may appeal to them. If such a man, however eminent, were offered the choice of a seat qn the High Court Bench of Australia, or the Supreme Court Bench of a State, the one carrying a pension and the other not, which position do honourable members think he would take? The fact that no pension was fixed in 1903 is met hy the furthe r fact that the Government say today that it is wise and necessary to grant 'a pension. Whether it will establish a precedent or not, is a matter of indifference to me, because I believe in the principle.",73
323,Mr BRENNAN,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,Does not all your argument apply just as well to members of Parliament and oflicers of the Public Servics ?,73
324,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"In nearly every case where public servants came over from the States to the Commonwealth, they carried their pension rights with them. Whether a man is appointed as a Judge of a Supreme Court, or of the High Court, he is appointed for life, and can retain the position practically as long as he pleases, so long as he does not come within the disqualifications, which are exceedingly few, and up to the present not one of our Judges has fallen with in them. So long as he remains a Judge, he continues to draw his salary, and there is no provision in the Act to take it from him. On' some of the State Benches Judges have sat long past the years of their prime, and the public have had to suffer considerable inconvenience in consequence. In one State, I believe, an Act was passed to amend that condition. In another State, where pensions exist,, the total amount payable is limited, and the sum being drawn out by those who had retired already left so. little for others that Judges remained on the Bench longer than in all human fairness they could be expected to perform their duties efficiently. If we want to maintain the highest traditions of the Judiciary of the British E m pire-and our Judges have absolutely nothing to look forward to, or hope for from any individual, or Government, or Parliament, when their time is up-w e shall help materially and secure greater efliciency also by placing on the statute book an Act authorizing the payment of the pensions to which they should legitimately be entitled.",73
325,Mr MAXWELL,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,How do you apply this to the present proposal?,73
326,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"The Minister gave such excellent reasons why it should be done that I shall not repeat them. So for as the present case is concerned, the Committee, by refusing to consent to this proposal, would be putting this distinguished member of the Bench in a. worse-position than if he had remained on the Supreme Court Bench of his State. It has been said that he accepted the position with his eyes open, and the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) suggested that his contract had been fulfilled . Like Shylock, lie wanted his pound of flesh, according to the honourable member.",73
327,Dr MALONEY,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,He wants more; he wants a pension also.,74
328,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"I . venture to say that he has not asked for this pension. It is a Government proposal, and as such, I intend to give it cordial support. The alternative - to giving a man, when he arrives at the age at which he should be in justice allowed to retire, a provision' for his old age, is to allow him to remain on the Bench. Without speaking of any particular case, if a Judge of the High Court, when he reaches the time at which, in nature he ought to retire, is not in a financial position to do so, no Government will take the responsibility of retiring him.  sion in the Public Service Act. Public servants have to come up for examination at sixty, and out they go at sixty-five, no matter who they are.",74
329,Mr BOYD,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"That is so; but I do not think that provision is in the Judiciary Act of any State. It certainly is not in that of the Commonwealth. I am not in any fear or trembling about this matter being raised as a precedent. I believe, with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), that it will be cedent. If I were in his position, I would use it as such; but I am prepared to vote for it as a precedent establishing a principle. On these grounds, I have the greatest pleasure in giving the motion my hearty support.",74
330,Mr CHARLTON,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Hunter) [9.52] The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) has offered a very valuable contribution to the debate. He said he had been twitted with not speaking very often. I have heard the honourable member on several occasions, and can testify that when he does speak, it is on a subject that he understands, and on which he gives the House light and leading. The Minister (Mr Groom) outlined, in introducing the Bill, the life of Sir Samuel Griffith. Most of us, - though much younger, have made ourselves acquainted, by reading and in other ways, with the [346] career of that high and esteemed gentle-' man. Everybody admits that he is a brilliant man, and has given good service to this country as a Judge; but I do not know what that has to do with the question now before us. We are asked to introduce here a principle against which this House, in 1903, deliberately set its face, by twenty-nine votes to twenty, on a non-party division; because I find, on looking up the division list, that members from both sides voted for and against. The question should be still a non-party one. The issue should be whether we approve of the principle of paying pensions to men who occupy high and exalted positions. Whilst the Minister outlined the life of Sir Samuel Griffith, he gave no reason to justify the Committee in carrying a proposal to give him a pension. If we give him one, and deny it to any other Judge occupying a position on the High Court Bench, we shall be doing the others an injustice. As times goes on, the other Judges will feel that they are no longer capable of carrying out their duties,, and will ask to be relieved. If we grant.a pension in one case we cannot deny it in another, where a man has given his services to his country as a member of the Judiciary 1 Whatever is decided in this Chamber this evening on this question should settle the used as a preprinciple for all time. As the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) pointed out, Sir Samuel Griffith was a Judge in Queensland when his present position was offered to him, and the debate in this House took place prior to his appointment. Every one, including Sir Samuel Griffith, knew that there was to be no pension. Nevertheless he decided . to give the Commonwealth the benefit of his talents, and he was paid £3,500 a year for his services. That is a substantialannual income for any man. I should say that a man accepting a position. ,of (that kind would reason out that he would be able in a given number of years tei, provide for old age,, and save sufficient for that purpose. For fifteen years he has presided over this Court, and during^ that time he has drawn no less than. £52,000. Surely no one contends that out of that sum he has not been able to provide for himself for the rest of his life, if he has to retire? He is a keen and I have no doubt that he does not require this pension, but for some reason this proposal is brought before us. cannot imagine that he would ask for it. He has completed his contract. free to continue on the Bench if his health permits, and if he finds that does not, he is free to retire. When we are talking of economy, if we bring measures of this kind, granting pensions to men in highly-paid positions because they are about to retire, the great mass pf the people will find fault, and they will have a right to do so, seeing that there are thousands of people who are unable to make ends meet. That is not a good thing for the future of this counit a pension. try. I agree with the honourable member for Pawkner that it is about time the Parliaments of this country set thembenches selves to devise a scheme whereby everyuntil body in the community, if unable to get Work, would be at least sure that the wolf would be kept from the door. man in this country who is prepared to work should have want knocking at his door. His wife should not be put in the position, because her husband is unable to find Work, of being unable to provide necessaries for herself and children. is' the thing that is sapping the moral life of this community. Any degeneracy that takes place in the race is, to a extent, due to poverty. Whilst we make no provision for those who are so situof ated, we can scarcely regard ourselves [entitled to make extra provision for those in, higher places. Conditions generally for the mass of the peqple are continuin ally getting worse, and no step is taken in the direction of lifting them out of iilie rut which they are being fast pressed 'into. T^ 7 have, no say in ihe matter, e fc'ecause it is the system of society jfive, under that is putting them in that position. If we are goingin for pensions for certain individuals, we should do something for the. masses, because we should not allow anybody to want. The only argument put up by the Minister for the granting, of a penorable sionto this gentleman was jcie was virtually a transferred qfl&cer Mr Charlton. The position is vastly different from that occupied by the ordinary public servant, man, because it was clearly understood by Sir Samuel G-rilfith that the posir tion carried no pension rights. He entered I into the contract on that understanding. Sir Samuel Griffith was, at that time, a He is Judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland. He had pension rights, and that it fact is advanced as another reason why in he should be entitled to a pension from the Commonwealth. But I maintain that there is no analogy between his position and that of the ordinary public servant, who has worked for years at a much lower salary, and has earned certain emoluments upon his retirement. Parliament decided that the position should not carry with The honourable member for Henty (Mr. Boyd) argued that if we do not grant pension rights, the occupants of the Judicial may be compelled to remain there they are practically imbecile. But there is another side of that picture. It is possible that many men, if they knew No they could get practically half their salaries by retiring, would relinquish their judicial duties long before they were entitled to. What was. the effect of the law introducing pensions for Judges in That New South Wales? It is well known to many honourable members that when that Bill was passed one Judge, who had sat large on the Bench for only a few months, elected to retire, and for a great number years received a pension of £1,350 a as year. It cannot be said that a Judge, getting £67 per week, as in the case of the Chief Justice, could not have been able about fifteen years to save sufficient to provide for himself if he elected to retire. And yet we are asked to agree to a proposition to pay him over £32 a week upon retirement, although his contract conthey tained no provision for a pension. . Mr Considine - And these are the people who preach thrif t to the workers.",74
331,Mr CHARLTON,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Wit h regard to this question of thrift as applied to the workers, I have no doubt that other honmembers have had an experience that similar to my owu, and have had many - calls to meet cases, of distress in their particular districts. Although, we are now asked to provide a pension for the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, there is a tendency to forget some of those gallant men who have rendered yeoman service to the Empire on the other side of the world. Unhappily, some of these ] - men have had difficulty in getting pensions. I do not charge the Pension authorities with neglect, because, as a rule, they are sympathetic officers; but pension rights in the cases I refer to depend to a large extent on medical testimony, and I have found that this is not always satisfactory. Moreover, the Act provides that before pension rights can be recognised it must be established that incapacity has been the result of war-like operations, and ever since men have been returning from the war I have been pleading for consideration for special cases. I know of one man who took part in the Messines operations. As a result of cold weather he contracted rheumatism, rendering his return to Australia necessary. He was unable to follow his usual avocation, but has been denied pension rights on the ground that his incapacity was not in connection with war-like operations. It seems strange that while difficulty should be encountered in cases like this, Parliament should now be asked to grant a pension to a Judge who has been drawing a very high salary, and who was quite prepared to accept the position without pension rights in any shape or form. . Before we talk about bringing in pensions for Judges, let us endeavour, as far as we possibly can, to assist those who are! in dire distress; such persons as those gallant men to whom I have referred, whose earning capacity is not equal to what it was before they enlisted. After we have done this, we can then think of providing for those in higher places. .There is no justification whatever for this proposal. If the Chief Justice had remained in politics-the Minister states that he devoted many years to politics in Queensland-h e would not have had any pension upon his retirement. Probably he would have gone out of politics im the ordinary course of events, and no doubt would have returned to his profes-/ sion. He was a very eminent man in* the legal world, so it is probable that he would have built up a lucrative practice again. But he had the confidence of the people, and accepted an offer made by the then Queensland Government to become Chief Justice of that State. Subsequently he was appointed by the Federal Government as Chief Justice of the Commonwealth on a fixed salary, with no hope of a pension. This question has not been raised since 1903, when Parliament decided against a pension. Now, in. the last hours of this session and in a thin House, with half the members away, importaiit legist lation like this is sprung upon honourable members. I do not approve of it. There is talk of getting half-a-dozen important Bills, as well as the Estimates and Supply, through in the next four days. I venture to say the Government would have been wise to allow this matter to stand over until we re-assemble in the new year, when there will be a full House and ample opportunity for its consideration. It appears to me that this proposal, with some other measures, is to be smuggled through. That is what the action of the Government amounts to with half the members absent.",75
332,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,What right have they to be away?,76
333,Mr CHAELTON,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"* Possibly the honourable member will be away himself some day. So long as I have been in this. House 1I have never asked the reason for any honourable member's absence. We all know that there are times when it is necessary for an honourable member to be in his constituency. I endeavour to attend the sittings of this House as much as possible, but I cannot always be here, and I venture to say that I will be away on certain occasions in the future in order to attend to my constituents. We have to remember, also, that some members live a considerable distance from Melbourne, and they have been away from their homes and families for practically five or six months. They are entitled to go home a little earlier. Paiv liament should have'closed down a week earlier than is intended. We would not be justified in passing this proposal in the last hours of the sion and in a thin House, because the nent Senate has two or three measures to deal with tomorrow, and will then get this proposal later. All the business is posed to be done by Friday at the latest, but it is impossible in the time available to deal with it properly. In view also of the fact that Sir Samuel opinions Griffith entered into his contract .Commonwealth Government for the Chief Justiceship of Australia without any. penfrom grace, then. sion privileges, this House ought to decline to pass the Bill which is to be introduced.

334,Mr FINLAYSON,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Brisbane) [10.12]. --When this matter was introduced 1903 Parliament was able to discuss it impartially and impersonally. We should have been able to do the same to-night, .but the Government left us no choice. The Minister (Mr Groom), in introduc- £3,500. ing the motion, emphasized the personal aspect of the whole case, as his speech was nothing but a glorification and eulogy of the present occupant of the Chief Justiceship. If this is a principle, it should have been discussed without ence whatever to Sir iSamuel Griffith, present Chief Justice. The Minister is entirely responsible for the fact that it has been reduced to a personal question. I have not a word to say stitution. against Sir Samuel Griffith personally. He ought not to have been discussed; Minister should not have mentioned his He qualifications at all. If we are to accept ship, the principle now, in contradiction to the action of Parliament in 1903, we must accept it on the ground that it will apply not only to Sir Samuel Griffith but to every other succeeding occupant of the position. J have only this to say about . Sir sesSamuel Griffith. He was a very promifigure in the political life of Queensland, and was the hero of the Radical, or Bolshevik, section of the people in that supState for many years. He was their idol. If honourable members will look up speeches delivered by Sir Samuel Griffith, they will find some of the most Radical ever expressed in any parliamenwith the tary proceedings. ",77

Any honourable member who recalls the circumstances will agree that it was a fact that he was lauded from one end of Australia to the other, because of his public spiritedness in sacrificing a certain pension in Queensland and accepting the Chief Justiceship of the Commonwealth, which carried no pension.",77
340,Mr JOWETT,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,But he did so.,78
341,Mr FINLAYSON,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Yes ; and he got the credit. '-' Verily,- I say to you, they have their reward."" The honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) has stated that he is quite sure the Chief Justice has not asked that this pension should be given him. The Government have not told us why they propose to grant a pension. They simply say that it is a reward or a recognition of Sir Samuel's splendid services to the country. That is why they propose to make the special allowance. When the original Bill was before this Chamber in 1903, the reason given for the granting of a pension was specified. Clause 53 statedA Justice of the High Court, if disabled by permanent infirmity from the. performance of the duties of his office, shall be entitled to retire npon a pension, to be continued during his Ufe at a rate Then followed several divisions of those rates. The reason there set out for the granting of pensions was disablement by permanent infirmity, as a result of which a Judge would be unable to satisfactorily perform the duties of his office. It is interesting to read the reports of that debate. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith) stated, in supporting the proposal to grant pensions, that it was sometimes an' advantage to have a pension, because a Judge might develop some permanent infirmity which would render him incompetent to perform his functions as a Judge; wherefore, some inducements should be offered him toresign. honourable member added that if no pensions were provided for, it would be open for any Judge to remain on the Bench long after he had become incompetent, through infirmity, to do his work faith fully and well. Mr Bruce Smith continuedParliament would be much more ready to take steps to remove a Judge when they knew that a pension was provided for in case of his lacking ability, through illness, to properly perform his duties. I submit, therefore, that it is fair that Judgeswho have arrived at an age within five years of the recognised allotted span of life should be offered an inducement to retire from the Bench, and make way for younger menThen the honourable member for Angas (Mr Glynn) statedIn England, of recent years, complaints have frequently been made in the public press regarding in cases the senility of the Bench. It has been repeatedly urged that it is very advisable to afford its Justices an opportunity to retire. It is said that they sometimes get livery, impatient, and somewhat petulant in their declining years, and that owing to the fact that pro ratd pensions had not been granted, Justices who ought to have retired have not done so That is the general tenor of the arguments advanced by the lawyers who were in that Parliament and are in the present Parliament, concerning why pensions should be granted. Their point was that it was necessary to grant pensions to get r i d of Judges who had become incompetent. Is that the reason which the Government now bave for proposing this pension, namely, that, through infirmity, the Chief Justice has become incompetent to discharge his functions, and that it is necessary; there^ fore, as well as wise, to get r i d of him? There are some who will be prepared to say "" Amen "" to such a proposal. The statutory rule that officers should retire from the Public Service at the age of sixty-five would not be ill-applied to Judges of the High Court. Human intelligence has its limits, just as has human strength; and when a man gets to the age of seventy-three-as is the case with Sir Samuel Walker Griffith-h e may have quite exceeded his intellectual usefulness to the nation. Sir Samuel has had ten years' occupancy of the Chief Justiceship of Queensland, at a salary of £3,500 a year. He has had fifteen years as Chief The Justice of the Commonwealth, at £3,500 per annum- a total, during the twenty-five years, of £87,500, drawn from this country. I h addition, he has been granted £4 4s. per day travelling allowance for every day that he has been on tour. And , considering that his position has been permanent, free from worries, free from all dangers of interruption, from all dangers of strikes, and of disturbing elections, and with no broken time, and no stoppages of pay, it is nothing more or less than a public scandal that the Government should now suggest that Sir Samuel Griffit h is in such a financially impecunious position that it is necessary for the country to come to his aid and grant him £33 a week to do nothing. He has enjoyed a salary of £67 a week for twenty-five years, in addition to his allowances. I am not impressed with the amendment bf the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) to the effect that this is not the time to grant such a pension. I say o that there is no time when such a position as the Government are now advancing could be justified. Members of Parliament in 1903 may have looked upon the matter from a different aspect than honourable members today. In those days they were able to regard it from a freer point of view; but the arguments then used were so strong that, both in this House and in the Senate, there were honourable members who refused to ally themselves with the principle then enunciated. It has been recognised throughout the Commonwealth administration that no pension may be granted to public oflicers. That has been a governing principle. No member of the Public Service is entitled to retire upon a pension; and in the Public Service it is insisted that oflicers shall provide for their own retirement; we compel them to insure their lives, or to purchase annuities^ and the like. Suppose that we applied that same principle to the Chief Justice, which we could have done quite as honestly and justly as in the case of ordinary members of the Public Service. Sir Samuel Griffith would have been called upon to make an annual expenditure of a fairly heavy character, in proportion to his salary, in order to provide himself with an annuity, and we would have avoided this proposal to provide the Chief Justice with a pension. However, such a provision has been left as a matter for his own judgment; and the salary which he has received has afforded ample scope with which to provide himself with a retiring allowance- a pension which would have been a godsend to many thousands of people in Australia. How can we, at this time, justify such an expenditure as is proposed, when so much urgency exists for the payment of a living wage to the people? Honourable members were told* that this was to be a Mr Finlayson. financial session, and we have been waiting all through the session for .the financial proposals of the Government. I congratulate this ""financial"" Government, this "" economy "" Government, this "" Winthe-war"" Government, on having disclosed something of their financial proposals at last. It is a case of greasing the fatted pig, of giving to those who. have, and of taking from those who have not. May I ask the Government to consider this position. I shall quote Mr Knibbs as my authority. He tells us, in the War Census Income Returns, that there were only 381,558 persons in Australia who were earning £156 per annum-o r £3 a week-and upwards. That left 1,760,106 persons who were earning less than £156 per annum; and, out of that number, there were 315,000-nearl y as many as the total of those who were earning over £156-wh o were receiving less than £50 a year. Mr. Knibbs points out that, of the total wealth in the community, those who were earning over £156 per annum owned £124,567,000 of the total net incomes of the community; leaving to those earning under £156 per annum £115,596,000. And, as for those earning under £50 a year-les s than £1 a week-the total of their wealth was only £10,000,000 out of the grand total of £240,0Q0,000 annual income. There is no getting away from the unfortunate and regrettable fact that large numbers in the community are in circumstances of want and distress. Honourable members will have seen a paragraph in the Herald this evening. On the principal page it is related that a woman asked the police to lock her up. She was an old woman, shabbily dressed, and she told the police she had slept in the gardens of the city, and that the only food she had was what she could beg. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) has given other illustrations. We are all inundated with letters from soldiers and soldiers' wives who are suffering what they deem to be hardships. Only the other day I received from a woman in Toowong the following communication: I have been told to put this before you. My husband has been away three years and two months. Because he absented, they are to punish me and the two children by stopping all my pay; so now I can starve. 1I have no money, as I ' have a sickly child, and it takes all my money to pay my bills. I have a. bad leg myself, and cannot go to work. I receive dozens of letters of a similar character, and so does every other honourable member. When we try to get special pensions granted to meet such cases, we are told that our requests cannot be entertained, owing to the imperative need which exists for economy. Take the case of the blind soldiers as an example. The rate of pension payable to blind and incapacitated soldiers is outrageously low and unsatisfactory. Yet the Government will not do anything to remedy it. Similarly, we cannot get any assistance granted to soldiers' wives and children who are suffering in a thousand different ways. Here I want to say a word or two on behalf of our soldiers who went to New Guinea. Many of them have returned the victims of malarial fever. We are all acquainted with the intermittent character of that fever, and some of us have asked that part pensions shall be paid to these men - pensions , say, for five or six days a month, upon which they are unable to work. But the Government will not listen to the suggestion. They say that this is not the time to give it consideration. Why, then, do they choose this time to grant a compassionate allowance to the Chief Justice of the High Court? One reason whioh was urged in 1903 why the Justices of the High Court should be pensioned was that they should be relieved from fear of want. In order tp place them above temptation, it was recognised *hat they should be thoroughly well paid. As honourable members are aware, in connection with the original proposal, the question arose as to whether the Justices pf the High Court should be paid a larger salary, with no pension, or a less salary, with a pension. After giving the matter the fullest consideration, Parliament decided in favour qf paying them a good salary, in order that we might get the services of the best men. In the circumstances, I am compelled to ask who are the greater-the men who make the laws of this country or the men who administer them ? The Prime Minister of Australia, who, more than any other individual, has in his hands the making or marring of this country, does not receive a salary in. excess of about £1,800 a year, and has no pension rights. Moreover, no Prime Minister has yet dared to suggest that he should be paid a* pension He has to submit himself to the verdict of the people every three years. He has to undergo privations and to work in a way that no Chief Justice has ever worked, and, in addition, he gets plenty of abuse for his pains. I repeat that the lawmakers, who are responsible for the conduct of affairs in Australia, do not get pensions. Nobody has ever suggested that they should get them.",78
342,Mr MATHEWS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"It would not be a bad thing to pension some of them off. - Mr FINLAYSON - I think that it would. But here is the case of a man who is set high above even the law-makers of this country. His duty is to interpret the laws that we enact. He draws a salary nearly six times larger than that paid to members of Parliament, and more than double that which is paid to Cabinet Ministers, who have to work hard, and are responsible for the administration of the Departments. Yet not one of these persons receives a pension. If Sir Samuel Griffith has not asked for this pension, why do the Government propose to grant it ? If he has given no intimation of his intention to retire, why is this motion brought forward ? Do the Government propose to grant him this pension to induce him to retire? Have they somebody else whom they wish to appoint to the honourable position which he fills? One naturally desires to know more about this proposal. I refuse to believe that all that Ministers have in their minds is a consideration of the financial interests of the Chief Justice of Australia. Of course, it may be that he is financially embarrassed-that he has been unfortunate in his speculations. If so, he is no worse off than are many other men. Why is it that these well-paid individuals are always the first to ask for charity from the public? Here is a man who has drawn £87,000 from the people of Australia, and the Government now ask us to give him a compassionate allowance.",80
343,Dr MALONE Y,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,'He ought to he ashamed to accept it .,81
344,Mr FINLAYSON,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"It is a scandalous thing that a man in the position of the Chief Justice of Australia should so demean his office as to allow the Government to hand round the hat for him , and to accept from the people of Australia a pension of £1,750 per year, or £33 per week during the period of his retirement. That is the average pay of eight or ten working-class families. ""We have to choose between a compassionate allowance to the Chief Justice and the giving of a little bit extra to the working classes of the community. Has the Government so much money that it can afiord this? Ministers may say that, as the Chief Justice is seventy-three years of age, he cannot have many years to live. That is not the question. By voting for a pension we* shall establish a precedent for paying pensions to certain men in certain positions for certain reasons. Let us know where this will lead us. should not look at the case from its in dividual aspect, but as it wil l affect others. There are many officers who.have rendered in their sphere as great services to the Commonwealth as the Chief Justice has rendered in his. Is it fair to those men to distribute largesse in one direction and to refuse it in another? There is no argument that would justif y the payment of the proposed pension.  Judges in nearly all the States, including Queensland.",81
345,Mr FINLAYSON,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"That is so. But the pension system was adopted in those States prior to Federation, and when the Commonwealth Parliament salaries of the Justices of the Hig h Court it refused to provide for pensions. Many of those who were members of this Parliament at the time had been members of State Parliaments, and probably it was their knowledge of the ill-effects and unreasonable results of the pension system that caused them to refuse to apply it to the Justices of our High Court. There is a tendency today to curtail these privileges, and had the State Parliaments the opportunity, an attempt would be made to cut down the pension list and leave to each man the responsibility of providing for his declining years.",81
346,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Illawarra) [10.42] - I find myself in some little difficulty in regard to this proposal. I am an advocate of the pension system, and have done what I could to popularize it . I favoured the institution of old-age pensions long before that was a subject for practical politics, and I urged the increasing of the rates paid even when the Labour Government was giving the excuse that is now given by this Government-that it had not the money.",81
347,Mr HIGGS,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,The Labour Government increased the old-age pension rates.,81
348,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Yes , after pressure. It took a long while to get them to do it . We have not been asking this Government for an increase so long as we were asking the Labour Government for one. I am in favour of the extension of the pension system, because I think that it is a sound system. When We a man has rendered service to his country, whether in the highest or in the humblest position, he should not be kept working until he falls into his grave. My difficulty arises from the fact that one Judge of the High Court has been singled out for a pension; I understand that it is not proposed to give pensions to all the Justices of the High Court. The honourable member for Pawkner (Mr Maxwell) overlooked the important fact that to do what is right to a man in a high position does not necessarily involve the denial of what is right to men in lower positions. The honourable member also overlooked the principle that should govern our confixed the sideration of these cases. It is not proper to say that to pension a Judge is to do a wrong to those members of the community who are not getting pensions. Our Judges safeguard the liberties of the humblest in the community as well as of the highest, and the privileges that we enjoy are largely at the discretion of those to whom we entrust the interpretation of our laws. It is one of the first considerations of a Democracy, that the interpreters of the laws should be in a position of the utmost freedom to decide according to their judgment, without fear, favour, or affection. They should not have the fear of poverty, nor the fear that a Government may visit upon them its displeasure for some judgment they have given. On similar reasoning it is wrong that a Government should nave it in its power to improve the position of a Judge. When a gentleman accepts a' seat on a judicial Bench he should be debarred from promotion to the position of Chief Justice, because such promotion would depend on the Government of the day, on whose causes the Judge who sought it might have been adjudicating. We saw something of what a proposal of this kind leads to when, in the course of this dehate, the insinuation was made that the Chief Justice of the H i gh Court of the Commonwealth is being offered this pension for political services rendered. I do not think that many people in the community will accept that suggestion. My dilemma is this, that if I vote f pension I shall vote for the violation of what I believe a sound principle in regard to the. judicial Bench, namely, that uo Judge should be the subject of any Government favour. Yet, if I vote against it , I shall vote against the principle of pensioning Judges- a thing I regard as essential to the good working of one of the most important institutions of a Democracy. Something has been said about the effect of pensions. A Judge is not able to carry on the business of a financial investor. If he gives that attention to the oases that press for his decision that is required of him, he has very little time for the supervision of investments. I think pensions necessary in order to secure for the service of the people the most efficient men available. In appointing a Judge we ask gentlemen who are earning considerable sums at the Bar to lay aside their private practice. We desire to attract to the High Court Bench and to the service of the Commonwealth the best talent available Every industry, every interest, and every person in this country are dependent in some measureupon the decisions of that [347] tribunal; and we must be able to offer to our Judges, not conditions that might attract men in the ideal world to which we hope all Democracies are advancing, but conditions equal to those which exist in the. profession of the law today. In this matter, we are in competition with the States. At the time he was appointed to the H i gh Court, Sir Samuel Griffith had a position of greater emolument in the Supreme Court of Queensland. The' present Chief Justice of that State, although receiving a salary less than that of Sir Samuel Griffith, has a position which is superior from a financial point of view, because he has the certainty that when he retires he will be provided for for the remainder of his life. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) alluded to the American Bench, but he omitted f o tell us that it does not matter to the Chief Justice of America whether he is on the Bench or off it ; he .gets the same salary when he retires as when he is in occupation of his position. That is an ideal principle for a Democracy to or the follow. When a man feels that his powers are waning, and that he can no longer give the best service to the State, he should be able to retire without suffering financial loss - The position of the American Chief Justice is on all-fours with that of the Speaker of the House of Commons, who on retirement loses only £1,000 of his official pay of £5,000 per annum. We should place our Judges in such a position that they are able to do that which they think ought to be done without fear of incurring any financial loss. We should place the High Court Judges in such independent circumstances that they may decide every matter without fear, favour or affection, and without apprehension that their decisions may prejudice the Government against them; and we ought to secure the best men, who will be attracted, not' only by the honour and dignity which the position carries, but by the knowledge that their old age will be provided for.",81
349,Dr MALONEY,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Melbourne) [10.55]. - It is with some diffidence that one approaches this matter. Sir Samuel Griffith has a great record, and has enjoyed a great salary. He has had every advantage that a man of culture and in telligence could have, and he has certainly distinguished himself in many ways. find that he has benefited the literature of the future by the following publications: - Note s on the Australian Federation: Its Nature and Probable Effects (paper presented to the Government of Queensland) ; Notes on the D r a f t Federal Constitution formed by the Adelaide Convention 1897; and Some Conditions of Australian Federation, Presidential Address, University Extension Council, 11th June, 1896. Moreover, he found time in his leisure to translate into English verse"" in the measure of the original, the immortal works of ""Dante Alighieri. I believe he is the only person who has ever translated the work in that measure. memory reap the reward of that merit.",82
350,Mr GROOM,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"^The Italian press spoke very highly of his translation. - Dr MALONEY - I believe it did, and all honour to Sir Samuel Griffith. have always advocated one pension only - for old men and women. Governor General, Judge, or labourer, no man should receive more than another when age has made him weak or feeble, and he is unable to earn a living. Time and time again, women of eighty years of age were asked to live in Melbourne on the 2s. 6d. per week paid by the Ladies' Benevolent Society, because the then Government in their meanness would not pay more. The present Treasurer of Victoria (Mr MCPherson) is earning a reputation as one of the meanest men who ever held that office, for he is already clipping the wings of the poor.",83
351,The CHAIRMAN,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,Order !,83
352,Dr MALONEY,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Who wall pay this proposed pension ? The Government who introduce it? No. This House, which may agree to it? No. Senate that may endorse it? No. people outside will pay. In the name of the people I dare this House to put to the electors at the next election the question, "" Shall the-Judges receive this pension?"" The people would sweep the proposal aside. Does any honourable member dare to say that if the people outside had the power of the Recall they would agree to £ 3 5 per week being granted as a pension to a man who has I received over £87,000 in salary in the last twenty-five years? Some honourable members have told the Committee that Sir Samuel Griffith receives £3,500 per annum. He received more than that. A sum of £5,000 is provided each year to cover the expenses of six Judges, and I have teen informed that they each get £ 4 4s. per day as travelling allowance. How many workers who are keeping families would like to get that £ 4 4s. per week? The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), to his credit, is seeking, as head of an organization, to get a pension of £ 4 4s. per week for blind soldiers, May his whose eyes will never behold their wives and children. If the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth were poor and poverty-stricken my pocket would he gladly opened to make a generous subscription. Many rich men may admire Sir Samuel Griffith, but I have never I heard a poor man speak highly of him. The workers of Australia do not regard Whether him as being friendly to them. In any case, is this the time to spend money on a pension like this ? Have we not been told by the Treasurer (Mr . Watt ) that we must economize and increase the taxation? We know that if the widow of a soldier has more than five children, the sixth, seventh, and eighth must live on nothing. A pension allowance is made for each child up to five, but if the unfortunate widow has more than five children she gets no allowance for the others. The Defence Department only pay 3s. 6d. per week for each child. When a man is sent to gaol the State allows his wife more than that for the maintenance of her children. It is proposed that we shall offer this man £35 per week by way of pension. In the The United States of America a big pension The system was introduced after the Civil War, and in the early nineties I presented to the State Parliament of Victoria figures showing that we paid, by way of pensions to public servants in this State, more than double the amount paid in New South Wales, and more than was paid by way of Public Service pensions in the remaining Australian Colonies and New Zealand. If the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth wants an old-age pension, let him apply for the 12s. 6d. per week on which we are asking old men and women to exist today. If we are to accept the statement made by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson), it was almost a semi-bribe that he took when he went on the Queensland Supreme Court Bench:",83
353,Mr GROOM,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,Do not say that.,84
354,Mr FINLAYSON,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,That was the stateber ment .made at the time.,84
355,Mr GROOM,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"Yes , but it was grossly unfair.",84
356,Dr MALONEY,IRO NAND STEEL BOUNTY,"It was a cadging for proposal that he made. He said, "" I will not accept the appointment, for £2,500 per annum""; but he was prepared to Ministers accept the higher salary-and that was nothing more than a bribe. If the people were appealed to, they would vote against a proposal of this kind, but they would vote to increase the old-age pensions. The late Dr Carty Salmon, when dealpeople ing with this question in this House in June, 1903, said I am rather astonished to find that is any apologist for the perpetuation of tem which in the past has been condemned throughout the length and breadth of tralia. Sir Langdon Bonython, who then reprewas sented a South Australian constituency, saidThe Attorney-General correctly quoted as saying that the pensions of tie puisne Judges in South Australia had been fixed £1,300 per annum, and I believe that the Justice has £1,500 per annum. I sbould like to add that I believe an Act was paBsed nine years ago abolishing pensions for Judges in South Australia - i Of those who voted on that occasion the granting of pensions to. the High Court Judges, there remain in the House today only the honourable member Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman), his the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn), the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith), and the ister in charge of this Bill (Mr Groom). Those who paired in favour of it were the present Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the honourable member for Darwin [348] (Mr Spence). Of those who voted against it only nine are in this Parliament today, namejy, the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler), the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr MCDonald), the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr. Page), the honourable member for Grey (Mr.Poynton), Senator Thomas (who was then the representative of the Barrier in this House), the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor), the honourable memfor Newcastle (Mr Watkins), and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr. - Bamford). Are those who voted against the proposal in 1903, and who are now members of the Ministry, going to vote it on this occasion ? I hope they will not do so, although we know that sometimes, for the sake of Cabinet solidarity. have to vote against their consciences. I have endeavoured in vain before now to secure a destitute allowance for any man or woman who is in need, and who swears before a magistrate, a clergyman, or a medical practitioner, that he or she is absolutely destitute. Sucb should have at least 10s. 'per week. Senator Millen, in a speech pregnant there with many good and great facts, stated a sysrecently in another place that a subsistence allowance was granted in respect of Ausonly four of the children of a man who had been killed at the Front. When he asked what was to he done where there were more than four children in a family, he replied that that was a matter me for the persons concerned to consider. I do not think Sir Samuel Griffith has at asked any friend to plead for this penChief sion for him, but I certainly object to about any one ""holding out the h at "" on his future behalf. If he is reduced, to penury f , as the result of speculatipn, for he has been ruined-the n I amwilling to give a month's salary to assist, him. He has written his name for wide in the annals of literatureby translation of Dante's Inferno. If Sir Samuel Griffith has not been instrumental in having this proposal put forMinward, then the Government, who call themselves his friends, are besmirching his escutcheon; and that I should resent. I shall vote against the proposal, which, if carried, I warn honourable members, will be keenly remembered outside. In these times; when, girls, with a few shillings per week, have to pay so.much more for their clothing, and the price of wool is higher than that of completed stockings before the war, a proposal of this kind ought not to be put forward. If the proposal were to make the old-age pensions £4 4s. a week-the daily expenses allowance to Sir Samuel Griffith- I should welcome it . Unless the Ohief Justice has been impoverished hy misfortune, this proposal is an infamy and a scandal. Progress reported. NA ARBITRATIONBILL (No. 2).
