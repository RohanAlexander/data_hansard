7,Mr BILSON,NOES,"Dunkley-Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence) (9.21 am)-by leave-I move: That, for this sitting, so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent questions without notice being called on at 2.30 p.m. Question agreed to. NA First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Fran Bailey. Bill read a first time. Second Reading FRAN BAILEY (MCEwen-Minister for Small Business and Tourism) (9.22 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Tourism Australia Amendment Bill 2007 amends the Tourism Australia Act 2004 by making changes to governance arrangements for the organisation. The changes introduced in this bill form part of the implementation of the government's response to the Review of corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders that was conducted by Mr John Uhrig. Tourism Australia is the federal government statutory authority responsible for international and domestic tourism marketing as well as the delivery of research and forecasts for the sector. Tourism Australia was established on 1 July 2004, bringing together the collective skills and knowledge of four separate organisations: the Australian Tourist Commission; See Australia; the Bureau of Tourism Research and Tourism Forecasting Council. Tourism Australia has emerged as one of BUSINESS the world's leading national tourism organisations. It works to influence those outside Australia to visit the many regions of Australia, whether for personal, recreational, professional or business reasons. It works to persuade Australians to travel throughout their own country. It works to foster a sustainable Australian tourism industry. And it works to increase the economic benefits to Australia from tourism. These economic benefits include export income and jobs, especially in regional Australia. BILL 2007 The government has assessed Tourism Australia's existing governance structure against the recommendations and principles of the Uhrig review and has identified that the board template is best suited to Tourism Australia's role as the government's tourism marketing agency. This bill amends the Tourism Australia Act 2004 by making minor improvements to the governance and accountability arrangements for Tourism Australia. These amendments will bring the existing governance arrangements more closely in line with best practice under the board template as identified in Uhrig, and provide increased accountability to the parliament commensurate with the high levels of public funding for the organisation's activities. The government has confirmed that the existing structure of a statutory authority operating under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 with governance by a board is consistent with the Uhrig recommendations. This recognises the need for Tourism Australia to operate flexibly in a commercial environment. These arrangements are strongly supported by Australia's tourism industry. The minor improvements proposed in the bill seek to balance increased independence for the board, principally through removal of the government member, with improved accountability appropriate to an organisation that receives over 80 per cent of its income through appropriation and whose work involves considerable public scrutiny, both here and overseas. On behalf of the government I would like to thank those who contributed to the assessment. The views and interests of Australia's tourism industry will continue to inform the government's tourism promotion activities. Debate (on motion by Dr Emerson) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (ADDITIONAL SCREENING MEASURES) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mrs De-Anne Kelly. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",20
8,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY,"ANNE KELLY (DawsonParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services) (9.27 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Aviation security is a high priority for this government and is under constant review to ensure that the regulatory framework is responsive to changing threats to the Australian aviation industry. On 9 August 2006, United Kingdom security services interrupted a terrorist operation involving planned attacks against international aviation targets. The foiled plot revealed vulnerability in the technical capability of aviation security screening points with respect to liquid explosive detection. This vulnerability has prompted the United States, Canada and the European Union to introduce restrictions on the amount of liquids, aerosols and gels that can be carried on board international outbound and domestic flights. The Australian government has also moved to deal with these risks. On 8 December 2006, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services announced that from 31 March 2007 there would be enhanced security measures to limit the amount of liquids, aerosols and gels that can be taken through an international screening point by people who are flying to or from Australia. This bill makes the amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 that are necessary to better manage this vulnerability. The bill amends the power to make regulations to cover liquids, aerosols and gels. As a necessary enhancement the act is also amended to allow for appropriate frisk searches at screening points. Overall this bill facilitates screening for liquids, aerosols and gels to protect Australians and the Australian aviation industry. Debate (on motion by Dr Emerson) adjourned. NA (TAKEOVERS) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum pre Bill read a first time. Second Reading  Secretary to the Treasurer) (9.30 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Takeovers serve a crucial role in supporting efficient dynamic share markets. The potential exposure to takeovers encourages companies and their managers to be efficient. It promotes sound management, better returns for investors and a more efficient allocation of resources. For takeovers to perform this role, they need to operate efficiently and in an informed market. The vigorous takeover activity in Australia in recent years shows that the takeovers provisions in the law have worked well. There is a dynamic, competitive market for control of companies in Australia. The Takeovers Panel has played a key part in achieving such a market. Recent court cases have thrown doubt on the panel's ability to keep performing its role as well as it has done. This bill will amend the Corporations Act 2001 to ensure that the Takeovers Panel can continue to perform its part in ensuring takeovers are conducted legally, properly and fairly. Chapter 6 of the Corporations Act 2001 deals with takeovers. Its aims are set out in section 602. In particular, one of those aims is that the acquisition of control over voting shares should take place in an efficient, competitive and informed market. The Takeovers Panel is fundamental to achieving those aims. The Takeovers Panel was constituted in its present form in March 2000. Until then, there was a great deal of tactical litigation associated with takeovers. The panel was designed to minimise tactical litigation and to replace the courts as the principal forum for resolving takeover disputes during bids. It was not a judicial body but a panel of experts. It was to apply its specialist expertise to give fast, informal decisions, having regard to the spirit of the takeover rules in section 602. The panel has fulfilled those expectations. It has operated successfully for some years in the way intended. The panel's processes are as simple as possible. Applications are determined in an average of 14 days. Disputes have been resolved faster and tactical litigation has been reduced. For the first time since it was reconstituted, the panel was taken to court in 2005, and again in 2006, by a company dissatisfied with the panel's decision. The court twice considered the panel's powers and ruled that they were narrower than the panel had thought. Those cases raised concerns that the current law does not give the panel the powers and jurisdiction it needs to perform effectively the role envisaged for it by parliament. This bill will ensure the panel has the powers and jurisdiction it needs. There are three main changes in the bill. The first relates to the definition of ‘substantial interest'. One large part of the panel's power to intervene relies on there being circumstances which affect the acquisition, or proposed acquisition, of a substantial interest in a company. The court interpreted the phrase ‘substantial interest' more narrowly than the panel had done. The new definition of ‘substantial interest' in the bill will mean that phrase is not confined to a narrow set of rights and interests. It will also allow for regulations to specify that particular interests will not, or may, constitute substantial interests. Takeovers is an area where new techniques and structures are constantly evolving. Allowing for regulations will give some flexibility to cover future situations and allow the law to react promptly to new developments where necessary. The second major change will mean that the panel can act where it is clear that circumstances will produce certain effects, or are likely to do so. It need not wait until those effects, and the consequent harm, have actually occurred. The panel can presently intervene where it considers circumstances are unacceptable for one of two reasons. Circumstances could be unacceptable either because of a contravention of the law or else having regard to their effect on the control or potential control of a am)-I move: company or on the acquisition or proposed acquisition of a substantial interest in a company. The third major change gives the panel the power to intervene in a third situation: where circumstances are unacceptable having regard to the purposes of the law, as set out in section 602. The intention is to give the panel the power to act in order to give effect to the spirit of the law. For example, it be that particular circumstances have the effect of causing a control block of voting shares to be traded in an uninformed market. The panel could intervene in that situation under the new provision if they considered the circumstances were unacceptable. The bill also addresses minor machinery concerns. For example, it provides that the time limit for concluding a review of a panel decision will date from the time of the application for review, not from the earlier decision. The panel needs to have adequate powers to perform the role envisaged for it. The bill is designed to ensure that it has those powers so it can continue to act as the main forum to resolve takeover disputes, and that it can do so efficiently and effectively. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Emerson) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (GREATER SUNRISE) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Baldwin. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",21
9,Mr BALDWIN,OFFSHORE PETROLEUM,"PatersonParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources) (9.37 That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greater Sunrise) Bill 2007 is to incorporate into the Offshore Petroleum Act 2006 (OPA) the Greater Sunrise Unitisation Agreement, which gives effect to the agreement between Australia and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste relating to the unitisation of the Sunrise and Troubadour fields. might The agreement was signed by Australia and Timor-Leste in Dili on 6 March 2003. The agreement was incorporated into the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 (PSLA) in April 2004, however due to unforseen circumstances and competing priorities it was not included when the PSLA was rewritten and renamed the Offshore Petroleum Act in 2006. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that in 2004 the policy on this issue was fully debated and agreed to for incorporation into the PSLA. This exercise today is a matter of formality to have the same details incorporated into the OPA. The agreement has been considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The committee supported the agreement and recommended that binding treaty action be taken. The agreement provides the framework for development and commercialisation of the petroleum resources in the Sunrise and Troubadour fields, which are collectively known as Greater Sunrise, as a single unit. This resource straddles the border between the joint petroleum development area, which is the area of shared jurisdiction between Australia and Timor-Leste established by the Timor Sea Treaty, and an area of Australian jurisdiction. The bill puts into place the administrative arrangements for the unit development of the Greater Sunrise petroleum resource. In practice, this means that Australian regulators and regulators of the joint petroleum development area will be able to ensure, jointly, that administration of the Greater Sunrise petroleum operations is coordinated, and that recovery operations are conducted in accordance with good oilfield practice. To the extent appropriate, the administrative arrangements will mirror those that apply elsewhere under Australian regulatory control. There are, however, some aspects of the agreed arrangements that will be specific to administration of the Greater Sunrise petroleum resource. For example, the process for approving the development plan and the unit operator will be Greater Sunrise specific. This reflects matters agreed between Australia and Timor-Leste and has no application outside the Greater Sunrise resource. To ensure consistency of administration of development of this resource, the arrangements that usually apply in the Northern Ter- force. ritory adjacent area will be modified to enable the responsible Commonwealth minister to exercise statutory powers, rather than the Commonwealth minister working in concert with the counterpart Northern Territory minister, or instead of the Northern Territory minister working alone. In practice, the Australian government will work with the Northern Territory government on the dayto-day administration of the Greater Sunrise resource. The agreement includes a mechanism for adjusting the initial petroleum production apportionment between the joint petroleum development area and Australia if new geological evidence indicates that a revision is needed. For the purposes of taxation, the part of the petroleum production from Greater Sunrise attributed to the joint petroleum development area will be taxed in accordance with the arrangements under the Timor Sea Treaty whereby Timor-Leste has title to 90 per cent of production and Australia to 10 per cent. The part of production from Greater Sunrise attributed to Australia will be taxed in accordance with Australia's domestic taxation arrangements. The Greater Sunrise Unitisation Agreement, which was concluded in March 2003, will be replaced by the provisions of the new Treaty between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMATS) when it is ratified by Timor-Leste. CMATS, which was signed on 12 January 2006, will set aside maritime boundary claims for 50 years and lift Timor-Leste's share of Greater Sunrise revenues from under 18 per cent to 50 per cent. I understand that the Timor-Leste will shortly be ready to bring the treaties into Greater Sunrise is a world-class resource estimated to contain some 8.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 295 million barrels of condensate. Development of Greater Sunrise has the potential to deliver significant benefits to both Australia and Timor-Leste. These benefits include investment and employment as well as export revenue. In addition, development of Greater Sunrise will stimulate increased investment in petroleum exploration and development in the Timor Sea, which will be in the interest of Australia and particularly Timor-Leste. In relation to Australia its development could result in revenues in the order of $10 billion over the life of the field. It is clearly in the national interest tralia, as well as Timor-Leste, that this bill approved. I reiterate that the issues around this matter were debated in detail upon its introduction the first time in 2004. Matters between Australia and Timor-Leste have progressed substantially since that time and it is in no party's interest to delay it any further, particularly as the provisions of these bills are already in effect under the PSLA. Their incorporation here is today a matter of formality. I commend this bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Emerson) adjourned.

10,Mr BALDWIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"PatersonParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources) (9.44 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Greater Sunrise) Bill 2007 contains amendments that change any references to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 in the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to the new Offshore Petroleum Act 2006. This bill is cognate with the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greater Sunrise) Bill 2007, which incorporates into the Offshore Petroleum Act 2006 the Greater Sunrise unitisation agreement that gives effect to the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste relating to the Unitisation of the Sunrise and Troubadour fields. The agreement was signed by Australia of Ausand Timor-Leste in Dili on 6 March 2003 be and provides a framework for the development and exploitation of the petroleum resources in the Sunrise and Troubadour fields, collectively known as the Greater Sunrise petroleum resource. The agreement was incorporated into the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 in April 2004 and the required consequential amendments were made to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 at the same time. However due to unforeseen circumstances and competing priorities the agreement was not included when the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 was rewritten and renamed the Offshore Petroleum Act in 2006. The policy on Greater Sunrise was fully debated and agreed to in 2004. This exercise today is a matter of formality to have minor amendments reflecting the Offshore Petroleum Act 2006 incorporated into the Customs Tariff Act 1995. Debate (on motion by Dr Emerson) adjourned. NA BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 February, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Kelvin Thomson moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House acknowledges; (1) that the native title system is currently mired in bureaucracy, and urgently needs a considered and practical approach from the Government; (a) to resolve native title claims effectively, expeditiously and fairly; and (b) to ensure Indigenous Australians are able to take full advantage of their legal rights; (2) the recent findings of Griffith University study which found that ‘federal policy and legislative and budgetary initiatives during the last decade have substantially weakened the negotiating position of Aboriginal people; and (3) that the amendments proposed by the Government; (a) represent a missed opportunity to remedy the real causes of delay and bottleneck in the native title system; (b) overlook calls from the Minerals Council of Australia and successive ATSI Social Justice Commissioners to properly resource Native Title Representative Bodies and Prescribed Bodies Corporate; (c) contain changes which, despite being intended to improve the performance of Native Title Representative Bodies, will adversely effect their capacity to sent and pursue Indigenous interests; and (d) run the risk of making the claims resolution process slower and more bureaucratic”.",25
11,Mr ANDREN,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"As I begin, can I correct the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. It is unfortunate for him to continue to pronounce Timor-Leste ‘TimorLeased' with all the connotations that that phrase may have. It should be pronounced ‘Timor-Lestay'. It is a pity that the parliamentary secretary cannot be questioned about his carriage of that legislation in this House, but that is another matter. When the amended native title bill came from the Senate on 6 December 1997 after 55 hours of debate and the government voted down those passionately argued changes and laid aside the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996, I said on that day: The rights of pastoralists will prevail. There is nothing in this amended bill that says otherwise, so the right to negotiate remains just that: the right to negotiate. Aborigines do not want freehold but access, with the right to negotiate ... The Prime Minister speaks of his covenant with the miner and the pastoralist. What about the third part of that troika, the Aborigine? Where is the covenant with him? After all of the tribulations and debate on native title over the past decade almost, we come to the Native Title Amendment Bill 2006. The general stated intent of the bill is to address the incredible delays that thwart timely resolution of native title claims. It is also supposed to allow the minister to put a badly performing native title representative body on a year's notice and more easily not renew recognition of that body. This bill is mainly about making processes more efficient. It is no small irony that it is largely govrepre- ernments that oppose claims as a matter of course and as a matter of ideology, tying up precious time, resources and money in forcing such claims to appeal. Given it can take up to 10 to 20 years to resolve a native title claim in some instances, often with the claimants not living to finally witness formal recognition of their continuing connection with their country, it is an admirable and proper aim to tighten the process and limit the excessive delays inherent in the current process. But this bill just does not seem to do this. It is important to note that out of the 1,683 native title claims filed, there are currently 604 remaining, suggesting that 13 years of claims have sorted out many of the procedural and legal questions for use in later cases. My concern starts with the process around the bill itself, with a recognised lack of consultation by many parties to the native title process, especially with the native title representative bodies, NTRBs, which represent the native title interests of Indigenous Australians-or are supposed to-especially in the establishment of native title claims. Not only this, but with just six weeks for submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee-over the Christmas and New Year break-and with that inquiry's report not even due until the 23rd of this month, I seriously question any commitment to truly working this process out and to properly debating it in the House of Representatives, since we are without the benefit of the report, as is so often the case. Certainly some measures appear to be recognised as positive, such as splitting claims to progress the more straightforward areas of a claim while the rest is argued, or the granting of legal aid to respondents. However, the main achievements of this bill seem to be entirely at odds with its aims and with the original aims of the Native Title Act itself. First of all is what looks like a complete undermining of native title representative bodies. This bill explicitly removes the criteria that a representative body, to remain eligible as such, must represent and consult with its constituency across its region. These bodies will provide policy advice to governments about land, water and customary use of country by traditional owners. Under this bill, registration of native title representative bodies is exclusively at the invitation of the minister, which opens up the possibility of large and expensive law firms, with no endorsement by Aboriginal people, providing representation for those people about processes that are in effect about ancient connections to country, without being representatives of those people. It is absolutely inappropriate that non-Indigenous bodies could take up the role of native title representative bodies in this process. With this proposed further diminishing of Indigenous participation, this bill also allows the ‘summary dismissal of certain native title applications' if a presumption is made about the reasons for which a claim is being made. Further, this bill also allows the minister to recognise a representative body for a minimum of one year at a time, and for up to six years, ostensibly to enable the derecognition of such a body if it continues to not perform. So the bill proposes a situation where all the representative bodies may or may not be invited to tender to continue their functions every six years at the most. Those bodies that may have just one year's grace imposed must try to keep hold of specialist legal staff on a one-year contract, divert already scarce resources towards the process of rerecognition-as will happen every six years regardless-and demonstrate progress in processes that can take up to 10 or more years. There are surely better ways of dealing with the nonperformance of single bodies. With that in mind, and in the name of cutting red tape, the bill also removes the requirement for strategic plans. How on earth does this provide greater efficiency where resources are so stretched, where cases take up to a decade or more to progress and where an already high turnover in staff or board members of these bodies diminishes corporate memory and can remove traces of those markers that flag the way? In this environment, how does a representative body mark its priorities and progress and how does it build critical levels of competence-and how can a court determine this and how does a minister measure outcomes?-without a detailed strategic plan to provide a compass to stop the process going in circles for even longer periods? Surely it would be more helpful to ensure good public strategic plans are in fact formulated and followed, with the resulting transparency informing questions of governance and forward planning of scarce resources and providing answerability to its constituents-and indeed the minister. Another major concern is the role under this bill of the National Native Title Tribunal, which is invested with a quasi-judicial power at the expense of the Federal Court with its power to supervise and impel the progress of proceedings. Under the bill, the tribunal, with its members who are appointed to provide mediation, is given power to coercively direct parties to attend mediation conferences and produce documents. But this is totally inappropriate for an administrative body and will in fact increase costs and delays, because only the Federal Court has the power to enforce such orders to make them effective. Further, this is constitutionally suspect and inappropriate for a mediation setting and is very likely to set off further litigation as parties, especially governments, so ordered by a tribunal seek to protect their own privileges. It is also proposed that the court's power to mediate be restricted while the tribunal is mediating a matter, reducing the court's ability to progress a claim by threatening to take the matter into its own hands and make a determination. Without this threat, the process of mediation can be very easily subverted by parties who do not have an interest in settling-and, as with any litigation, delays usually favour one of the parties. In the case of native title, the parties with the interest waiting are usually governments. The tribunal in fact already hasn't the capacity to fulfil its expected functions, with parties already taking advantage of procedural rights that hold up the whole process without having to be tested themselves within that process. Just over a year ago, of 356 claims with the NNTT for mediation, 272-about 76 per cent-had been with them for more than three years and 170-just under 48 per cent-for more than five years. Yet in the name of expediency this bill bestows yet another option to further divert the process by allowing parties to apply for a review in the tribunal of the existence of native title. This is where a claimaint could be made to bear the time and cost of presenting their case to the tribunal and the applicant for the review. With so much of the work in a native title claim going into assembling evidence over years, one would be forgiven for thinking that compelling a claimant to do this in a tribunal mediation setting, when it has to be done again in a court anyway, is a structured system that creates, perhaps not deliberately, a further delaying tactic designed, inadvertently or otherwise, to diminish the claimant's energy and resources and to provide a valuable dry run for the applicant to the review in testing the claimant's case prior to a court hearing, without any binding determination. It seems clear that the Federal Court's ability to flexibly case manage native title claims, including its ability to order conferences and mediation, is highly regarded and should not be diminished or compromised by a parallel, inexpert and unpractised process that will have to refer to the court in the end anyway. I am not in the habit of supporting second reading amendments-often as they are an expression of the world as it might be if there were a change of government-but in this case one would hope that the second reading in amendment would be a precursor to substantive amendments with the arrival of the inquiry into this in the other place. I note the second reading amendment says: ... that the amendments proposed by the Government; (b) overlook calls from the Minerals Council ... and successive Commissioners to properly resource Native Title Representative Bodies and Prescribed Bodies Corporate; (c) contain changes which, despite being intended to improve the performance of Native Title Representative Bodies, will adversely effect their capacity to represent and pursue Indigenous interests; Those are exactly the sorts of concerns that I have been able to identify in my study, along with that of my staff, of this particular piece of legislation. I support the opposition's second reading amendment as an expression of the processes that need to emerge from this while I am hopeful that there will be possible, and indeed necessary, amendments in the other place. Finally, I come to what I said on that highly charged Saturday morning in 1997 when the House sat to consider those amendments brought back from the Senate. There had been 55 hours of forensic debate. It was the most inspiring debate that I think I have seen in this place in a decade. Due respect was paid to the work of Senator Harradine and others, and the agony was obvious in the decisions that they arrived at. What happened is that when those amendments arrived in this House they were voted down by the government and the bill was laid aside at that point. I said on that Saturday in 1997, as that amended bill was laid aside, that I had decided that the bill as amended at that point ‘provided the framework for the coexistence of title identified in the Wik judgement'. I said: ... genuine native title is the key to restoring our acceptance of the validity of the Aboriginal culture and recognising that without that title or belonging our Indigenous fellow Australians are condemned to tiptoe around the fringes of this society as outcasts in a predominantly white society. Nothing-or very, very little, if anythingATSI Social Justice has changed.",26
12,Mr RUDDOCK,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"I first thank the members for Wills, Jagajaga, Fisher, Grey, Lingiari, Hotham, Kingsford Smith, Fremantle and Calare for their contributions to this debate. I often find there is little in amendments that I can agree with, but I do agree with (1)(a) of the Labor amendment: (1) that the native title system is currently mired in bureaucracy, and urgently needs a considered and practical approach from the Government; (a) to resolve native title claims effectively, expeditiously and fairly … I agree with that. That is what the Native Title Amendment Bill 2006 is about. That ought to be our objective. But I find that the rest of the amendment is fundamentally misplaced and I will demonstrate that in my comments. A number of members, including the member for Calare, who has just spoken, have referred to the current inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the provisions of this bill and have suggested detailed consideration could await the committee's report. Yet the motion put forward by the member for Wills effectively pre-empts this by asserting the bill represents a missed opportunity to remedy causes of delay and particular bottlenecks. In this, Labor are trying to have it both ways: portraying the current native title system as a failure but refusing to engage constructively on reform. The opposition has not put forward any real proposals for reform since the substantial amendments to the act were passed in 1998. At the last federal election, the opposition's general policy on native title reform comprised three sentences: A Federal Labor Government will review the Native Title Act to ensure its workability. will not amend the Act without comprehensive consultation with Indigenous Australians, miners, pastoralists and other governments ... Labor's review of the Native Title Act will consider PBCs' operational funding needs. These are all steps that have been undertaken by the present government in a transparent process dating back over the past two years. I say to the member for Calare in particular that the government's framework for this native title package was announced in September 2005. At the time of that announcement, I emphasised the need for practical reforms to achieve better and more efficient outcomes and, since then, there have been extensive consultations with stakeholders on all aspects of the reforms. From September 2005, the consultation has been ongoing. It was to help give us advice as to what matters might be dealt with in the bill. The bill was introduced into the House of Representatives more than two months ago and it has been available for scrutiny since then. Yet, when it is scheduled for debate in this chamber, the most the opposition can do is offer a motion suggesting that native title needs a considered and practical approach. However, I should acknowledge the opposition's express support for the provisions contained in schedules 3 and 4, which implement two aspects of the four key reforms contained in the bill. The member for Jagajaga and the member for Hotham referred to the Keating government's enactment of the original Native Title Act in 1993. With considerable understatement, the member for Jagajaga was at least prepared to acknowledge that the original legislation was ‘not perfect'. It is instructive to consider the opposition's record on native title when it was in government. The Keating government sought to respond to the Mabo decision of 1992 through the Native Title Act 1993. At the time, the coalition's clear and Labor consistent view was that the act was inadequate, unworkable and failed to address many of the uncertainties arising from Mabo. In the period from 1993 to the Howard government's amendments in 1998, progress was painfully slow. Only three determinations of native title were made in that time. After the election of the Howard government in 1996, the government worked through an open and participatory process on the development of amendments to achieve a more workable system. Many of the government's amendments were opposed, particularly by the opposition. However, following the commencement of the government's amendments, the situation has improved. It has improved very steadily to the point where, as of 12 February this year, there have been 95 determinations of native title claims. Significantly, 53 were consent determinations which have been made with the agreement of all of the parties involved. Sixty-four determinations were to the effect that native title exists in all or part of the determination areas. We are happy to stand by this record when we compare it to that of the Labor Party. We believe that we have been securing practical and considered measures and that these reforms will help further. A number of members, including the member for Calare, have raised specific concerns about the proposals to enhance the performance of native title representative bodies. The level of proficiency of native title representative bodies in performing core functions is a key factor in the effectiveness of this system. Experience over time has identified varying levels of proficiency. With some, there are examples of poor administration and governance. In 2002, as the then minister with responsibility for Indigenous affairs, I commissioned the Miller report to examine the performance and accountability of NTRBs. Mention has been made of the role of the strategic plans. As minister, I had to approve the strategic plans. I tried to read them to get what guidance I could on performance. With the information that was provided, where there was no requirement for a body to be compared with other bodies, I found no realistic basis that the strategic plans performed any useful functions whatsoever. I wanted to be able to compare performance. I wanted to see which organisations were performing more effectively, what aspects of their management and approach led to more effective outcomes and whether it was better to pursue negotiated outcomes than litigation. There was no way in which to find out about effective performance and accountability by examining the strategic plans. The Miller review identified a series of shortcomings in relation to accountability, performance standards and the constitutional and governance arrangements. It was clear at the time, and subsequent developments confirmed, that further measures were needed to ensure that NTRBs would focus squarely on the provision of services to native title claimants and holders. These reforms are to assist in improving NTRB performance in the interests of securing better services for Indigenous parties within the native title sys- vice. tem. Particular mention has been made of funding of the representative bodies and their capacities. Currently the NTRBs have sufficient funding to perform their functions and no increase in funding is proposed. Almost half of the total Australian government budget expenditure for the native title system goes to the NTRBs. In the last financial year, a number of the NTRBs reported significant funding surpluses. On the question of capacity building, the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs continues to fund significant target activities to improve the performance of NTRBs under its performance enhancement program. The members for Wills, Lingiari and Jagajaga raised concerns about the introduction of fixed recognition terms for NTRBs. The fixed terms will provide an opportunity for periodic review of their performance and will provide incentives for NTRBs to work towards outcomes for clients. Mention was made by the member for Wills and the member for Calare that the stated reforms may lead the government to doing an open tender and bringing in nonIndigenous law firms. I might say they said the same about the government's changes to the way in which we fund Aboriginal legal services. While there has been a capacity for other bodies to indicate that they might be able to provide such services, it has not led to a non-Indigenous body running Aboriginal legal services. I think it has been very important. As I said when I announced the tender results, it has led to increased performance and they have been able to demonstrate that, as against others, on meeting the criteria they are best placed to be able to do so. We have produced substantial efficiencies in their operations as a result and they are better able to assist Indigenous people who need legal adThese amendments do expand the range of organisations that can eventually be recognised as NTRBs. To be recognised, they will still need to show that they can satisfactorily perform the functions, and this of course is one of the reasons why Indigenous organisations, because of their local knowledge and networks, would be better able to do that. Removing the requirement for the representative bodies to be incorporated under Indigenous-specific legislation has the potential to expand the range of skills and experience available to the NTRBs. The three current native title service providers form functions in New South Wales, Victoria and southern Queensland are incorporated under the Corporations Act. This has not affected their ability to provide culturally propriate services. There has been mention that rerecognition might cause disruption. Replacement of NTRBs is unlikely to be a frequent occurrence. NTRBs that perform well during the initial program recognition can expect to be recognised for subsequent terms. The reasons for not inviting bodies to apply for subsequent terms would be poor performance, a lessening of workloads in the area or a wish not to be recognised. That has happened. That is what happened in New South Wales and Victoria. In relation to the Claims Resolution Review and dissatisfaction with the NNTT, a number of members opposite have raised concerns about measures to provide the NNTT with additional powers and functions to facilitate its mediation role. For the ber for Calare, although he is no longer here, I ought to explain that mediation has to be conducted on the basis of producing an outcome which is consistent with the framework of law. It is certainly appropriate, going to be able to encourage parties to reach a decision that is within the framework of the native title law that has been enacted as part of this nation, where there are issues of connection that have to be sufficiently dealt with, that the mediation process is one in which that sort of information has to be reasonably canvassed to ensure that the parties are well informed and appropriately informed so that their legal rights and entitlements are properly protected. So I do not accept the view that, in dealing with a mediation, you should not do so in the knowledge and background of the legal rights and entitlements and a proper assessment of those matters to ensure that the parties are fully which per- informed in the mediation. We come to the question of how many mediators the Commonwealth should pay for. One of the reasons I adopted, and my ap- colleagues accepted, the recommendation that the role of the National Native Title Tribunal be enhanced is that it is the body we are funding to carry out the mediation task. The idea that you can have courts saying, ‘We want something dealt with by way of mediation but we will send it off to a different group of mediators that we have decided should undertake the task,' seems to me to leave you dangerously exposed to having a body that you have funded with public money underutilised while you then have to find the resources to pay for the choice of mediator that the courts might have identified. There were two views in relation to the Claims Resolution Review that I initiated. The proposed changes to the NNTT were a result of the consideration of the views of the mem- two independent consultants, Graham Hily QC and Dr Ken Levy. That report and the response were released publicly in August last year. The review recognised concerns about the effectiveness of the NNTT mediaif you are tion and in particular found: … that the NTT's present powers are inadequate for it to effectively perform its mediation role. It stated: … there appears to be no reason to assume that another body with the same constraints as those which presently exist in relation to NNTT mediation could have been more effective than the NNTT. Accordingly, both consultants recommended that the tribunal be given greater statutory powers of compulsion and a number of additional functions, and these recommendations have been adopted by the government. The review also found that existing duplication and mediation functions between the court and the tribunal create confusion and have significant resource implications, and it recommended that mediation should not be carried out by both bodies at once. The tribunal was originally established by the Keating Labor government in 1994 with its primary function being to mediate native title claims. The people who were involved were people with considerable experience: former Liberal ministers-people like Fred Chaney-and former Labor ministers, some from South Australia. This is not a body of this government's creation, but the government does remain of view that the NNTT has played a valuable role and will continue to play a valuable role in providing specialised mediation services in native title proceedings. As the review recognised, it is patently inefficient to require parties to participate two separate alternative resolution processes, with two different institutions, at the same time. The government concluded that the most effective means of addressing the problems identified by the review was to remove that duplication. As noted by members, the bill also confers a number of additional powers and functions on the tribunal designed to address concerns that the tribunal's lack of statutory powers inhibits effectiveness of mediation. The new powers and functions of the tribunal must be considered in the light of other measures in the bill. Amendments will better enable the tribunal to report to court about issues relating to a mediation, including the progress of mediation, behaviour of the parties and priorities of regions. This will ensure that the court is better informed about the progress of mediation and better able to make decisions for the disposition of native title claims. The amendments will enable the court and the tribunal to work together in guiding parties to facilitate agreement. Ultimately, all native title claims are proceedings before a court, and better coordination between the court and the tribunal is necessary to ensure expeditious resolution of claims. In relation to the views of stakeholders, a number of members opposite were somewhat alarmist about reported views of native title stakeholders in relation to the bill. While I acknowledge some concerns have been raised about aspects of the bill, I think it is important we approach this discussion in a balanced and constructive way. From the Western Australian government's perspective, the Office of Native Title advised the Senate committee: Overall, the Office of Native Title considers the amendments proposed in the Bill have the potential to improve practical operation of the system. The Minerals Council said it supports the in proposed reforms to the Native Title Act relating to representative Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander bodies, including simplified derecognition processes. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner's submission to the Senate committee notes in paragraph 68, relating to the resolution of claims: I welcome and support many of the reforms in Schedule 2 of the Bill ... In summary, the picture is not as bleak as the opposition would have us believe. While we remain prepared to engage in constructive consideration of ways to improve native title, it is important that the debate be open and the realistic. This measure has been underway since September 2005. There has been very considerable consultation and dialogue. The bill is a significant piece of legislation. It is designed to deliver better outcomes in native title, which is in the interests of all Australians. I take no pleasure-and I have made this point before and stated it many times publicly-that the delay in the resolution of claims is such that many people may not see claims to which they are entitled resolved in their lifetime. I take no pleasure in that. I want to see all parties using these measures in a way to achieve outcomes that are lawful. We are dealing with the Native Title Act, which represents the situation resolved by our High Court about native title rights that existed. It is a codification of that system. We cannot remove it. That is one of the points I have made. Were we to seek to remove it, there would be claims for just compensation. These measures we are implementing are not a doctrinaire response but measures that have been designed to address the particular problems that have been identified about getting effective and efficient outcomes from the system. I deliberately eschewed measures that might be seen as fundamental changes to the Native Title Act. This bill is about improving performance, and I hope that, in looking at these matters, people take a constructive approach. I have noticed the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee have often done that. I hope that they do so in relation to this matter and I will look ob- Nairn, G.R. jectively at any recommendations that they might make. I do not have a closed mind to them, but I do not want to undermine the fundamental framework, which I believe is important to ensuring that the courts and the tribunal can work together and effectively to achieve the most efficient and effective outcome in resolving these issues.

14,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,NOES,"The opposition will not be opposing the Family Law (Divorce Fees Validation) Bill 2007. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Family Law Act 1975 to validate retrospectively the charging of an unauthorised filing fee for divorce applications in the Family Court of Western Australia. In July 2005 the filing fee in the Federal Magistrates Court for divorce applications under the Family Law Act was increased. The equivalent fee in the Family Court of Western Australia, which has its own Family Court, would normally have been increased to match the Federal Magistrates Court fee to ensure consistency across Australia through an amendment to subregulation 11(1A) of the Family Law Regulations 1984. However, due to an administrative oversight this did not occur. The Family Court of Western Australia assumed the necessary amendment to the Family Law Regulations had been made and began to charge the increased fee. An amendment to that subregulation 11(1A) of the Family Law Regulations, effective from 9 October last year, authorised the Family Court of Western Australia to charge a fee equivalent to the fee applicable at that time for a divorce application in the Federal Magistrates Court. The bill before the House will validate retrospectively the charging of the fees that were in fact charged for divorce applications in the Family Court of Western Australia for the period 1 July 2005 to 9 October 2006. The fees that we are talking about apply to divorce proceedings which were instituted in a court constituted by a stipendiary magistrate who is the principal registrar or a registrar of the Family Court of Western Australia as well as to divorce proceedings instituted in another court for transfer to such a court. The fees which have been specified in clause 3 of the bill were the fees that had been in fact charged for filing a divorce application in the Family Court of Western Australia during the two periods that I have referred to. So the opposition will not be opposing this legislation.",35
15,Mr FAWCETT,NOES,"I also rise to address the Family Law (Divorce Fees Validation) Bill 2007. As the member for Wills has outlined, this bill is fairly simple in its purpose and intent, which is to validate the actions of the Family Court of Western Australia and to amend subregulation 11(1A) of the Family Law Regulations to retrospectively authorise the increase in fees made in the Western Australian Family Court to make sure that we have consistency across Australia. So I support the bill. I would like to look at some of the history as to why Western Australia has a separate family law court and some of the unintended consequences that have come out of the Family Law Act 1975. Some of those unintended consequences were things that the Western Australians had hoped to overcome. In the Family Law Act 1975 there was an agreement that state courts could be set up if states so wished to do that. The establishment of a state family court is not required. Subsection 41(1) only requires, that as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Family Law Act, a state could establish a court. Western Australia is the only state that elected to establish its own state court for family law. There was some debate in October 1975 in the Western Australian parliament. The Western Australian Minister of Works, Mr O'Neil, at that time stated a number of reasons why the Western Australian government chose to establish their own court. Largely, it comes down to a unity of jurisdiction. Under his first reason he finishes with the statement: When jurisdiction is divided, unfortunately is often a problem of demarcation and this could have serious consequences for parties who choose the wrong forum. He goes on in his next paragraph, however, to a second reason where he talks about the fact that there needs to be: ... an exercise of jurisdiction in family law matters ... to retain complementary action with other responsibilities ... This would allow jurisdiction on or related matters to be carried out under one jurisdiction. From what I am told by colleagues in Western Australia this has not necessarily had the complete result he was hoping for. It is an issue that, I believe, is worth highlighting in this place as we address this bill today. One of the serious impacts that this division of jurisdiction between state and federal authorities has had is on people who are contesting custody of children following a divorce. This is predominantly because of the justifiable and correct principle that we need to protect children and make sure that their best interests are served. One of the areas that consistently comes up is the impact on children of violence where that occurs in the family. Unfortunately, there is a disconnect between the state and federal systems in that anything to do with violence tends to be dealt with by the state system. It is the state police who will actually attend the situation. It is the state police that people go to with an application for a DVO. And it is the state courts that will then process that and, if somebody contests that, clear the person of that accusation of violence. Under the federal system, however, there are a number of requirements for magistrates and judges to take into account accusations and, under the new law, to have reasonable grounds to believe there that there is violence. Over a number of years, what this has translated to in reality is a growth in the tendency of the person who has custody of the children to make accusations of violence, often encouraged by people who are advising them, although the grounds for those accusations sometimes appear to be very weak. It is certainly a widely held view in the community that those accusations are often made purely with the object of stalling the non-custodial parent's ability to have a fair hearing in court in terms of continuing a relationship with their children and having access to them. The breakdown in that relationship is one issue. But, more importantly, a pattern of custody is established while the Federal Court is processing the access orders and the custodial issues, because there is quite often a delay in the state system in dealing with the domestic violence order and the accusations there. If somebody cannot clear those state based issues before their case is heard in a Federal Court, it means that they are unfairly disadvantaged in their ability to put forward their case as to why they should be able to continue their relationship with and have access to their children. Because, on the basis of that contested but yet unproven domestic violence order, they are not able to have access to their children, you then start getting an established pattern of who cares for the children and that often appears to be taken into account in terms of future custody orders. Lastly-and this has a significant impact on people-if orders are actually decided in the Federal Court and subsequently the person manages to clear their name in the state system and verify that taking out a violence order was not justified, they then have to pay to come back. It is a large financial impost on people and eventually it wears them down, to the point where they run out of either money or the emotional energy to keep going back into that system. So I believe it is very important that we look at that sort of situation-when we consider that Western Australia has a separate court-and try to get rid of this duplication and misalignment of jurisdictions. We need to ask how we can overcome this, because it is unfairly disadvantaging some people who are caught up in this dreadful process that occurs after a divorce. We have a number of options, and one that I am very heartened by is the Children's Cases Program, which has come out of this government's family law reforms. Based on the experience in Western Sydney, where it was piloted, under the principles of this system the whole proceedings are very much directed by the court. These principles include decreasing delay and decreasing formality to make sure we get outcomes. The judge or magistrate has a fair degree of freedom to take the evidence he wants, to engage parties as he wishes, to bring forward what is in the best interests of the child. I am hopeful that, as this system becomes more widespread, we will see far quicker and far more meaningful resolutions that will encourage people not to go down this path of falsely applying for DVOs as a way of frustrating the process and getting their way. It will not necessarily fix all the problems, though. Whilst I am hopeful about and heartened by the success of that program, I believe we can and should be doing more. I have spoken with the federal Attorney General and I am encouraging him and his state colleagues to address this issue and try to get an increased alignment of the systems so that, where a domestic violence case in a state court will have an impact on a case in the Family Court-in any state other than Western Australia-of the federal system, that is given a priority such that the person who is defending his or her name and reputation against the accusation of violence will be able to go into the Federal Court free of that very strong impediment to a fair chance of getting orders that enable them to have a meaningful relationship with their child. I am not pretending that it is going to be easy or quick, but I do implore the attorneysgeneral of the states and territories as well the federal Attorney to bring that forward as an agenda item, to find a way forward, because it is well proven that the impact on families, particularly on children through not having a meaningful relationship with both parents, is a significant contributor to dysfunction and less than optimal outcomes in terms of education, employment, mental health, involvement in crime et cetera. There is not a 100 per cent correlation; not every child in that situation will fall into that, there is a strong weight of evidence to say that the breakdown of family, the breakdown of relationships with both parents and the conflict that often goes with that have a ous impact on a child. So I think it behoves us as legislators to work with the state system to try to find a way forward to maximise these children's chances, post the decision of their parents to give up on their own relationship, of a good future. One last point I wish to make before I cease addressing this bill is that, yet again, this is an area where we are looking at the consequences of a situation-we are looking at the consequences of a separation, the consequences of domestic violence-but so infrequently do we go back and try to address the cause. There is a great deal of research, both international and domestic, that looks at why good marriages and good relationships last as well as why they break up. Robyn Parker wrote a very good paper looking at why marriages last. She has done a metaanalysis of a number of studies around the world-some by Karney and Bradbury, some by Gottman and others-that have various theories as to why some marriages and relationships last and why they work. They have different words and different names for their theories-but their conclusions are common in that every relationship will face stresses, strains and triggers that will cause conflict. That is common to pretty as much every relationship. The ones that last are those in a position to establish a framework whereby they can cope with those triggers, pressures and stresses that come upon them. That framework comes from two things. One part is the motivation of knowing that it is worth working at, not only for the benefit and for the best interests of the child but by highlighting the impact on financial, mental and physical health and a whole range of other things. We can and but should be doing more as a government to emphasise those motivating factors. The second part, which people like Gottman and Karney and Bradbury highlight, is seri- the provision and the encouragement of skills for a couple to know how to communicate effectively to resolve conflict, to help build that framework and to help buffer them from these things that come through life. These skills are a critical component. And so I would encourage governments at both levels to continue significant and focused investment in providing opportunities for skills development for couples and, in fact, individuals before they get into a relationship. I am talking about children in high school; I am talking about people before they get married and people after they are married. We should provide opportunities for them to access information and educational resources about how to communicate and how to resolve conflict. If we can help people to do that, we will not fix everyone's problems but we will decrease the chance of violence because violence often comes out of frustration. Frustration comes because somebody feels misunderstood, misrepresented and is not able to communicate. So I implore governments to look at ways to work with people and to invest resources as required to provide these educational resources so that people can access them. A group session in a classroom suits some people but not many. When you look at the success of Supernanny you realise that there are certain media which people are comfortable to use and access and from which they get good information. You can help to change their expectations, particularly as we are looking at a generation now where many come from a family of origin in which they have never seen modelled constructive and healthy ways to relate, to resolve conflict and to communicate. If all they are watching is things on TV that exacerbate the negative ways to do that, it is no wonder that so many relationships are breaking down and there is violence in some relationships. So we need to go on the front foot to provide those resources and that help for people to break some of those moulds. In conclusion, I support the bill. I think need to take out of the history of the bill the fact that Western Australia established its own Family Court for a very good reason. I am not convinced that has necessarily worked but it highlights some of the unintended consequences of the disconnect between state processes and the federal process. I believe we do need to move forward and address that and also look at putting more resources and effort into normalising the concept of helping people learn how to communicate and resolve conflict.",36
16,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"in reply-I first thank the member for Wills and the member for Wakefield for their contributions to the Family Law (Divorce Fees Validation) Bill 2007. I thank the member for Wills for signifying the opposition's support for this measure. That is a sensible approach. Errors of this sort described as administrative oversight involve several parties. Obviously, some in my department failed to ensure appropriate regulations were passed. Those who were collecting the fee failed to identify that they had a lawful obligation to check that the measures to ensure that they acted lawfully were put in place. I am not assigning blame but I am concerned to ensure that an irregularity of this sort does not occur again, and I have raised that with the department. I hope administrative arrangements will be put in place to ensure that such oversight does not occur on another occasion. In this bill we are retrospectively validating charges that have already been made. They were no greater than people had to pay elsewhere but there is an equivalence and it is appropriate that the validation should occur. The member for Wakefield raised some interesting matters as to why we have a family court in Western Australia. It was unique and it reflected the desire of Western Australia to maintain an involvement, not to give we up matters to the federal authority and to have a state family court. All states were entitled to have a state family court but only Western Australia took it up. One should not assume that that has given them a unitary system without other difficulties-if I can say that to the member for Wakefield. It is certainly the case that the same judges and magistrates will hear matters relevant to the issues relating to children, for instance, and, if there are family disputes, issues relating to family law. That means of course that, at that first instance stage, there may be less opportunity for the sorts of issues that the member for Wakefield adverted to that occur in other states where apprehended violence orders are obtained in a state court and issues in relation to ongoing care and management of children are dealt with in the family law system. Of course the fact that there is a single jurisdiction at first instance does not mean that there is a single jurisdiction on appeals. At the moment you still have the situation in relation to an appeal in family law matters where they go off to the full court of the Family Court and if the issues involve a matter of state law they go off to the state Supreme Court. So there is a potential for there to be quite different appeal outcomes because of the appellate jurisdiction being in separate directions. We are trying to work through some of those issues at the moment. We have some difficulty with the Western Australians from time to time on getting a referral of power to cover the field where, I think, covering the field might mean that you avoid different decisions from a state appellate court and the full court of the Family Court. I do not think there is any easy way forward, but I think the member for Wakefield has correctly identified the need for ministers, through the SCAG process, to look at some of these issues to ensure that the time delays and the potential costs, which he has identified, that can be imposed are worked through. I want to see a little more work done-and I might say that to my staff and officials-on the impact of the AVO system in the state courts and the extent to which they are able to be relied upon in the family courts, whether they are obtained in a timely way or not and whether there are issues we can raise with the state attorneys, perhaps in April when we meet here in Canberra. I appreciate the opposition's support for the measure. As always, I appreciate the thoughtful contributions from the member for Wakefield. I commend the bill to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",39

18,Mr HARTSUYKER,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 and related bills, which will enhance the role of private health insurance in our healthcare system. I believe it is right to extend the freedom of choice to those who can afford it whilst ensuring the position of those who cannot. I believe it is right that we should take measures which seek to relieve the pressure on our publicly financed health services. The introduction of broader health cover in the private health sector seeks to: firstly, remove the artificial financial incentive for hospitalisation in the private sector where clinically appropriate alternative treatments exist; secondly, reflect contemporary clinical practice in Australia which has been facilitated by advances in medical practice and technology; and, thirdly, align private health financing of chronic disease management and prevention with the public sector. There are those, of course, who see no role for the government encouraging the private sector, whether in the health service or in our schools, and I will address some of those arguments later. But, first, let us look at the demands being placed on our health system. The number of patients admitted to hosinpitals in 2004-05 was seven million, an increase of some 2.6 per cent over the previous financial year. These figures are likely to continue to rise. We already know that in the years to come we are likely to be in a position where a smaller proportion of working people are supporting a higher proportion of people enru- titled to various taxpayer funded benefits. It is also true that those working people will be supporting a rapidly increasing bill for public health services. The pressure on cost comes from not just population factors. Advances in medical science mean that more treatments and more expensive treatments are available. At the same time we are all aware of the demand for new and expensive drugs to be included in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, often for the benefit of a relatively small cohort of patients, but which are capable of making a huge difference to the quality of life of those patients. This is not to say that decisions about providing new treatments or drugs should be decided on the basis of the numbers who benefit. What it does say is that a humane and prosperous society like ours will have to think long and hard about how it finances its health care if it is going to continue to meet the legitimate demands of its citizens. How much is the health service costing at present? The coalition government will spend some $48 billion in the current financial year, an increase of 138 per cent since 1995-96, representing 22 per cent of total Australian government spending. On public hospital funding alone, the coalition government will spend $42 billion between 2003 and 2008 under the Australian health care agreements, an increase of 83 per cent over previous agreements for 1993-98. There are those who say that the current arrangements for funding hospitals should be changed. But let us put aside for the moment any arguments about the wisdom of disbursing this much money through the states and territories with little control over whether it is used effectively. That is something we should question. Let us put aside any arguments about whether that makes political sense. Whatever one's position on those matters, we can surely agree that this is an issue that needs careful management. Why? We are dealing with, currently, more than one-fifth of government spending. The amount allocated has already increased more than 2½ times over 10 years and, according to some, is still too little. The numbers contributing providing those resources through taxes will suffer a relative decline in the coming years. We have no direct control over the demands made on the resources. People will always fall ill, people will always break limbs and people will always want to have children. And, as I say, we are a humane and prosperous society and therefore we need to meet these demands, as well as those for education, transport, the environment and all the other areas of government responsibility. The question is: how? Part of the answer, at least, must be to courage those who can afford to do so to turn to the private sector, which is bearing an increasing share of the load. In 2003-04, private hospitals treated 2.64 million patients, an increase of 57 per cent since 1996-97. More than 55 per cent of all surgery is now performed privately. Thanks to measures such as the 30 per cent rebate and a focus on lifetime cover, 43 per cent of the population now has private health cover, compared to 34 per cent under Labor. I am pleased to say that we should be able to claim some crossparty support on this issue. Labor's own health minister in 1993, Graham Richardson, warned that the health system would be in danger of collapse if private health insurance coverage were to drop below 40 per cent. This is what he said: We've always had the view that the private system has to co-exist with a public system. If it doesn't, the public system can't cope. We haven't had private health insurance numbers this low in the last ten years and I think it's time we did something about it. Is a taxpayer subsidy in the form of a rebate worth it? I think the answer is a resounding yes for both the recipient and the taxpayer. The rebate is worth almost $1,000 a year for the average family with two children, and it has been estimated that every dollar spent on the rebate itself saves $2 in government to spending, including state government spending on public hospitals. More broadly, the existence of a viable private health sector takes pressure off the public system. In 200304 private hospitals treated some 2.6 million patients, a 57 per cent increase since 199697. More than 55 per cent of surgery is now performed in private hospitals. Private hospitals are making a huge contribution to the health system in this country. All this activity in the private sector translates into shorter waiting lists in the public sector. To restate the problem: the health service enrequires a large and growing portion of the government's budget. Our ability to finance this from tax revenue is likely to diminish. We cannot control demand, and developing the private sector is a rational response to the problem. Let me now turn to the measures proposed in this bill, particularly those which extend private cover into new areas. It has long been accepted that health care does not begin and end in hospital. It may be an overused adage that prevention is better than cure, but never has it been more applicable on both an individual and an institutional basis. As part of the solution to the problem of the rising demand on health services generally, it is clearly good policy that we encourage people to take better care of themselves and adopt more healthy lifestyles, including, particularly, giving up or not starting smoking. It is this element of personal responsibility that part of these measures seeks to encourage under the heading of broader health cover. Being able to include wellness and prevention services, including suitable exercise programs, in health insurance packages will surely make the take-up of private health insurance more attractive for many and save public costs further downstream by, hopefully, avoiding hospitalisation. I also welcome the extension of private cover into services that substitute for hospital care in the form of outpatient or day admission. Relieving hospitals of some of the demand for, say, post-discharge care or dialysis and at the same time relieving those patients of the need to re-enter the clinical environment and enabling them to receive treatment in the comfort of their own home will benefit all concerned. Broader health care will provide for more diverse offerings from private health insurance companies through the wider range of services that can now be covered by insurance. We know that many members opposite abhor the spending of public money in private schools while conveniently ignoring the load that the private sector takes off our public schools. If all students who currently attend private schools were to enrol in state government schools then the taxpayer would need to contribute an additional $3 billion to $4 billion. In the case of New South Wales, the state government is already failing to meet demand from its schools, though by way of excuse it points the finger at the federal government for supporting the private sector. Similarly, many members opposite will oppose the extension of private health insurance. I believe this is a blinkered and short sighted view. It is blinkered because it stems from an archaic, socialist mindset that services such as health and education are the business of the state and that the private sector has no business being involved. What can possibly be wrong with the private sector offering a service that people want at a price they are prepared to pay? It is short-sighted because it ignores the rising demand for and rising costs of health services and therefore offers no solution. Somehow, I do not think members opposite will be pressing for tax increases anytime in the near future. In my electorate some 30,000 people enjoy the benefits of private health insurance. It plays a vital role in providing improved health outcomes in our community. I believe the balance between private and public health services should be maintained. I commend the bill to the House for being part of that strategy.",41
19,Ms GRIERSON,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"The Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 has been described by the minister as groundbreaking. Apparently this is the most significant change to private health insurance policy since the introduction of the government's rebate and Lifetime Health Cover scheme in 2001. Let us have a close look and see if it lives up to those expectations. This is a package of seven bills in total but the Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 is the main bill and very central to the package. The key focus of this package is to allow private health funds to provide what the government has called ‘broader health cover'-that is, medical services outside the hospital gate. More specifically, these bills implement a series of changes to current private health insurance policy. These include the expansion of private health insurance to cover medical services provided outside hospital which either substitute in home or community settings for in-hospital services, such as chemotherapy and dialysis, or are designed to prevent hospitalisation in the first place, such as health promotion and chronic disease management. This broader health cover and the expansion of private health insurance to medical services that come under this umbrella is the most significant policy change in the package. The package also includes changes to Lifetime Health Cover, the scheme introduced by the government to make private health insurance more expensive as you get older if you fail to take out private health insurance by the time you turn 30. In this new legislation, people who have retained private health insurance for over 10 years will, when they get to the 10-year mark, no longer be subject to lifetime health cover loadings on their health insurance premiums. So there is incentive for people over 30 to join again. It also introduces requirements for private health insurance funds to provide standard product information to consumers. That sounds quite reasonable. This bill also implements changes to existing administrative and regulatory arrangements for the sector and will therefore, it is assumed, streamline the legislative framework for private health insurance by bringing the main components of the existing legislative framework-currently in three acts-all under one act. That sounds like a sensible thing to do. It also includes changes to existing reinsurance arrangements where companies offset their risk, but, interestingly and quite riously, the government has chosen to adopt the private health insurance industry's preferred model for reinsurance rather than its own recommended capitation model. In the explanatory memorandum to this bill it is made clear that the government's preferred model would have been ‘the best strategic option for the long term'. So the question remains: why didn't the government have the nerve to pursue its own advice and go for that better long-term option? The other bills in the package are to provide for transitional arrangements and consequential amendments-quite technical matters-to existing legislation. If this legislation is so good, as the minister claims, what is Labor's position? We are supporting the package, but I can tell you why. It is because this is the only deal on the table. This is the only legislation put forward that we can even consider. There is no legislation to address chronic medical workforce shortages. There is no legislation to address the inequities in health funding between metropolitan and regional areas. There is no legislation for the expansion of Medicare funding to cover these new innovative services and treatments or any bold reforms to the Commonwealth-state health divide. No, this is the only deal we have on offer. But, that said, there are aspects of this package that Labor welcomes. The move to standardise private health insurance product information for consumers is a good thinga bit of consumer comparison shopping is essential when you are taking out insurance. The changes to Lifetime Health Cover are worth noting as well. We would hope that the requirement to provide standard information to consumers and therefore allow them to compare different private health insurance products and to understand their entitlements will give consumers more security and cercutainty about what they are signing up for. We are told that information would include things like the costs of premiums, waiting periods, exclusions, gaps and excessesbecause every day we have conversations in our electorates with people who say: ‘I've got private insurance and I've just been sick,' or, ‘My wife's just been in hospital-I had no idea what costs I would be up for. I thought I would be covered for everything.' So they have been crying out for that sort of information for some time. In conjunction with this provision, the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman has also been funded to develop a website to enable consumers to easily compare product information. We support these initiatives and we hope they will assist all consumers. The removal of the loading on premiums for people who have retained Lifetime Health Cover or had long-term membership is a bonus which hopefully will assist them with the costs included in private health insurance. Those are the best aspects of the bill, but Labor has many concerns about the package and they are outlined in the second reading amendment moved by the member for Gellibrand. We hope the government will support the amendment. Labor is particularly concerned about the likely consequences of this legislation. We fear that inequities will now exist for the majority of Australians who do not have private health insurance-such as the entrenchment of a two-tiered healthcare system where access to services is based on ability to pay and not on need. We are concerned that this further undermines Medicare and the universality of our health system. Labor's amendment highlights these concerns, and we should look more closely at them. Firstly, there is inequitable access, which we think this bill just about guarantees. If, the minister suggests, these measures will enable the private health sector to: ... adapt to the realities of early 21st century health care: a way of care that does not always centre on admission to hospitalbut instead focuses onday procedures, outpatient services, hospital the home, wellness and preventionthen the question remains: if that is so good why is the minister happy to allow this just for private patients but not for public patients? Clearly not all Australians are equally deserving in this minister's eyes. Indeed, if the minister were seriously interested in delivering quality innovative health care for all Australians, regardless of wealth or location, we would today be debating an expansion of services to be provided under Medicare and the inclusion of out-ofhospital treatments and new forms of service delivery in the Australian health care agreements, under which the federal government pays for public hospitals throughout the country. To date, these agreements have completely ignored out-of-hospital services. The Commonwealth funds only those people who are admitted patients. So what will happen to those who are not insured and therefore not covered by these changes? If the minister's track record is anything to go by, those without private health insurance will simply go without. There will be no access to new innovative medical treatments or to service delivery beyond the hospital for the majority of Australians who do not have private health insurance. These changes will entrench a two-tiered system of health care which, again, threatens the universality of our health system. Most people out there in the community say governments are there to deliver services for all of us. The most important one, they will tell as you, is health. If the broader healthcare provisions give people with private health insurance access to services and treatment options which people without private health insurance will not have access to, then the package just further entrenches the division in the delivery of health services in Australia. If the in government were genuine about ensuring the best possible health care, regardless of wealth and location, we would be debating very different legislation today. Where is the legislation to provide funds to expand the range of treatments and services available under Medicare? Unfortunately, there is no legislation to deal with some of the major health catastrophes that are occurring in this country, but obviously some people will benefit-and who are they? The private health insurance sector. This is one way for them to increase their membership. They can development a membership drive; you can see the advertising coming now. The providers will make themselves more financially viable with these expanded services. I think it should be noted that there are some very interesting electorates that also stand to benefit. It is worth noting these electorates, where they are located and who holds these seats, to demonstrate the skewed nature of private health insurance coverage in Australia and the very limited demographic reach of the benefits of this legislation. Just 35 out of 150 electorates across the nation have constituencies with rates of private health insurance coverage at 50 per cent or more. That means just 23 per cent of the electorates represented in this chamber have a majority of constituents with private health insurance of 50 per cent or more. So 77 per cent of all the representatives in this House do not have more than 50 per cent of their constituents covered by private health insurance. According to the latest figures, coverage in the Hunter ranges from 38.6 per cent in Paterson to 45.3 per cent in Charlton. In my electorate of Newcastle the coverage of private health insurance has been stagnant for two years at 44.2 per cent, which is close to the national average. Let us look at the electorates at the top of the pops-the ones that are going to do very well. Leading the list of the top 10 electorates for private health insurance coverage is the electorate of Bradfield, held by the Minister for Defence, with a staggering 79.8 per cent of constituents with private health insurance. Bradfield is followed by the electorates of Berowra, held by Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock; Kooyong; Tangney; Menzies, held by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship; Goldstein, held by the Minister for Vocational and Further Education; North Sydney, held by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations; Warringah, held by the Minister for Health and Ageing; Cook; and Wentworth, held by the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Malcolm Turnbull. They are the top 10, they are all blue-ribbon Liberal seats and they will all do very well, thank you very much. The electorate of Bradfield has not only the highest rate of private health insurance coverage but also one of the highest Medicare spends in Australia, so it is reaping benefits from both the private health dollar and the public health dollar. So much for the government's argument that an invigorated private health sector takes the pressure off the public health system and the public purse! Rural and regional Australians are the big losers here. With no genuinely national private health insurance fund and a scarcity of private health facilities in rural areas, the Howard government simply cannot ensure that all Australians will have choices in accessing these new programs and services. If you are living in isolated regional Australia, just try to get a chemotherapy service to your home. We are not treating the people of this country fairly. That National Party members come into this chamber and tolerate secondrate treatment by their coalition partners of the people who elect them. I think is quite unforgivable. Where are they on this legislation? Where are they in defending their constituents and their access to services? When determining the range and location of services to be provided, private health insurance funds are under no obligation to ensure that they remain focused on health outcomes and health needs instead of costs. There are no guarantees that patient groups with the greatest need will ever be able to access these services. I am sure that Aboriginal people living in rural and remote communities, who are up to 50 per cent more likely to need dialysis than the national average, would love to have access to dialysis treatments at home instead of travelling 500 kilometres or more to their nearest renal clinic. But I do not see anything in this package to suggest that people in rural or remote communities will ever have access to such programs, despite a clearly demonstrated need. In my region-and this is appalling-the Hunter's alarming death rate is worsening relative to the rest of the state and has risen to second place behind the most remote and rural areas of New South Wales. These are some of our statistics. We have the highest rate of colorectal cancer in men and women in New South Wales. We have the second highest rate of melanomas in the state. Hunter women experience an above average number of asthma deaths. The Hunter also has a higher rate of death by injury or poisoning. The region's biggest killers are coronary heart disease and stroke, followed by cancer. The region has the highest prostate cancer death rate in the state of New South Wales. Community mental health teams have been cut by half, preventing home visits after 5 pm. I have heard it before. What will the government say about this? Blame it on the states. Let us not blame it on the states; let us have an evidence based healthcare system based on need, and perhaps we will be able to hold our heads up high for a change. Medical workforce shortages are most acute in rural and regional Australia, and there is nothing in these bills to redress that crisis. Nor is there any reason to believe that private providers will be rushing to set up health services in areas of need in regional Australia. These bills manifestly fail to deliver equal access for the 43 per cent of Australians with private health insurance-let alone for the majority of Australians who are not insured. There is also no evidence to support the government's argument that the package will not increase premiums, and premiums keep going up. The last time the government said it would reduce pressure on private health insurance premiums was in 2000-01, when it introduced the 30 per cent rebate and Lifetime Health Cover. Since then, there has been a 40 per cent increase in premium costs. Between 1998 and 2006, the cost of private health insurance increased twice as fast as general inflation. The government cannot be trusted; we know that. We learnt long ago that the ‘ironclad guarantees' of the health minister count for nothing after polling day. Where is the logic in the argument that expanding services offered will reduce premiums? Where are the assurances in these bills that any savings made by the private health insurance industry will be passed on to consumers? Do not bother to look; you will not find them; they are not here. If the government is genuine about wanting to protect consumers, why does this legislation strip the Private Health Insurance Administration Council of its current role to minimise premium levels? Why remove those kinds of consumer protections if it is serious about keeping premiums down? I guess there is one solution. Remember that private health insurance premiums are also predicted to rise once Medibank Private is sold. When will that be sold? The legislation is there. As soon as the election is over, if the government wins, Medibank Private will be sold. What is the solution to that? Do not elect the government. Let us do something serious about health in this country and have a Labor government once and for all. These bills also fail to provide safety and quality assurances. There is no quality assurance mechanism for broader health cover services until July 2008-15 months hence. Some services, such as telephone advice lines, do not have any quality standards in the bills. Who is going to be giving advice when you pick up the phone? Is it going to be a scripted text that someone reads? Is it going to be a doctor, a nurse or a paramedic? Who knows! That is a risk to consumers that no-one should have to bear. Recent disturbing reports that one of the country's largest private health insurance funds, HCF, has been passing on medical records of patients discharged from mental health facilities to a contractor, MCKesson Asia-Pacific, which then pushed patients to accept follow-up services, show the importance of having some quality assurance in this sort of legislation. I urge the government to ensure that this legislation will protect patients' privacy and rights. We have to get everyone to lift their game. The AMA has also expressed concerns about the lack of sufficient safeguards in the bill for doctors to expressly continue to make clinical decisions about the best interests of their patients. Others have raised concerns about the package for moving towards managed care. That is a system whereby the private health insurer assumes responsibility for the health costs of its members and therefore, for example, directs contract arrangements with doctors and other providers. They become bidding wars. They become all about the costs of service delivery rather than the benefit of that service or the quality of that service. I have so many concerns about this bill, as a matter of fact, and we will be movre- ing an amendment during the consideration in detail stage to strengthen this bill's protections of doctors' clinical freedoms. The $50 million worth of advertising to sell this measure is free advertising for private health insurers and comes straight from the taxpayer's dollar. That is there for the next four years, and I guess mates rates apply. I think everyone would agree it is pretty outrageous that this government collects taxes from all Australian families to fund a marketing campaign for the private health insurance sector. It is a shameful waste of taxpayers' money and scarce health resources. That $50 million would actually provide an additional 1.5 million GP consultations for the country. I know what we would do with that $50 million in my electorate of Newcastle. It would fund the Medicare licence we desperately need for a PET scanner, the refurbishment of the Hunter dementia resource centre, a GP after-hours access service and its long-term funding, and a Commonwealth dental scheme-the sorts of things that my electorate calls out for over and over again. I think the private health insurance sector is already generously subsidised. This legislation fails to address the real issue of the sustainability of the private health sector and it certainly fails to address the real health needs of this country. There is really no choice in this legislation. I think it is about time that members of the National Party stood up to its big brother in government and demanded a fairer deal for the health and well-being of rural and regional Australia. It is about time that the government removed its ideological blinkers and did something about our health system. It should restore some equity, fairness and quality to our national health system in Australia.",43
20,Mrs HULL,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I rise with great pleasure to the support the legislation that we have in front of us today. Before I commence outlining the reasons why I support the Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 and related bills, I will refer to the speech the member for Newcastle. I feel it is imperative and incumbent upon me to assure Australians that it is absolutely not a crime have private health insurance. The member for Newcastle would have you believe-if you listened to her speech and the assertions she made within it-that it is. She has not represented those in her Newcastle electorate who would dare to have such a thing as private health insurance. Given the statements that she made in the House today, she has clearly told the electors of Newcastle that if you have private health insurance then your interests will not be represented by your member. Far from paying out on members of The Nationals, she should note this. The one thing that you can be assured of about National coalition members is that they will represent all constituents equally. There is no discrimination in the way in which we voice the concerns of the constituents. Regardless of whether we agree with them or not, the voices of the constituents can be heard, and they will get representation. That is certainly what people have been told by the member for Newcastle they will not have if they have private health insurance. I will now move on to the reasons why I support this bill. The particular area of the bill that I want to mention concerns the broader health cover that has been sought for so long by my electorate. When this is introduced, it will mean insurers will be able to pay benefits for medical services that are provided outside a hospital. What a very sensible decision to make! While private health insurers must offer a product that covers hospital treatment, they will now be able to develop a health insurance policy that can pay benefits for hospital services that can be safely delivered outside a hospital environment and setting. This allows for the best care to be provided in the most suitable location for the person who has taken out private by health insurance. Who knows: it could move on to the public health system as well and enable pressure to be taken off that system as to people who have private health insurance take that action, so that more public patients who are unable to have private health insurance can access treatment. They probably cannot if they live in the electorate of Riverina, which is under the Greater Southern Area Health Service run by the New South Wales state Labor government of Premier Iemma. It is not easy to access any service, whether it be inside or outside a hospital. You have got a significant waiting list. I was told recently of a man with an injury who does not have private health insurance. The fact is he was told he would have to wait three years before he could even have a remote chance of being put on the list to have his bicep repaired. That is what we have to bear in New South Wales under the Iemma Labor government. Once the Private Health Insurance Bill goes through, it will enable patients to receive benefits for services which do not require admission to a hospital. Take someone with cataracts. Having cataracts is a common reason why an elderly patient or a not so elderly patient has to be admitted to hospital, although now they could have their procedure done safely and effectively in a very low-acuity setting. The second most common reason for admission to hospital is chemotherapy. We all know people who are in the unfortunate circumstances of suffering from cancer and requiring admission for chemotherapy. But this chemotherapy can be provided just as conveniently and safely in a community setting, either in a person's home or in a low-acuity health facility. You should be able to access this treatment under your private health insurance and you should not have to be forced into hospital. The changes will mean that pressure is taken off our health system, as I have indicated, through fewer people being admitted to hospital and these additional hospital costs being avoided. The idea is that, when you factor in the high cost of providing health care in a hospital setting with nurses, the overheads and all of the issues that go into making up a day charge for a hospital, you will be able to stop premiums from rising to account for the additional costs of providing medical treatments or services to those in hospital who simply may not need to be there because those types of services could be delivered elsewhere. Broader health cover will also allow health insurers to work with a wide range of service providers to develop more flexible and innovative products that reflect our modern clinical practices and our consumer expectation. Again, these are things that are so beneficial for somebody recovering from an illness or needing the appropriate and adequate treatment for an illness that could be available outside the system rather than within the hospital system itself. Health insurers will be better able to assist consumers to manage and prevent acute and chronic conditions. Many people could benefit from tailored programs that support and sustain a healthy lifestyle, such as a personalised health check, dietary guidance, exercise supervision and support to quit smoking. All of these things can now be taken into consideration in the way in which private health insurance is paid for. Broader health cover is set to come into effect on 1 April 2007, and it will include: outpatient and day services; in-home services such as dialysis and post-discharge care; and condition management, wellness and prevention services. The previous speaker outlined that she thought many of the people in her electorate would love to be able to get dialysis at home and be able to claim it. Yes, that is the case, but many of the people who need dialysis want to take comfort in the public hospital system. If you take the pressure off dialysis units in the public hospital system by enabling people to utilise their health benefits and set up dialysis at home, it has to be better in the long term for access for public patients. We have a whole suite of options that can come into play to give everybody better opportunities to access the treatments they require. There are also dental and optical services, out-of-hospital chemotherapy, nursing, dietitians, domestic assistance, ambulances, hearing services, theatre fees, physiotherapy and podiatry. All of these will be eligible for the 30 per cent and over-65 higher PHI rebates plus public health insurance rates. Nothing will stop private patients being treated in public hospitals, but this will encourage private-insured wellness, prevention and early intervention for fund members, which could prevent or minimise expensive hospitalisation. That is the priority of the government, and it should be. We need to offer a suite of services and choices and try to minimise the cost overall by always being innovative and enabling new practices to come into play that can reduce or contain costs in an everburgeoning health world where many of our health treatments are so expensive and sometimes cannot be avoided. I think that it will greatly appeal to younger and healthier people who currently feel that hospital cover is not relevant to them. In some circumstances these services may be more suitable, safer and more cost-effective for members. Health funds, as I have mentioned, may also offer to cover preventative services which, in helping people to better manage their health, may place downward pressure on premiums over the long term. That is all that we can hope for. We need to start putting into practice policies to put downward pressure on premium hikes and prices. Individual funds will decide what services they include in the private health insurance product. I would encourage them to be expansive, and innovative and to explore any and all options that can contain health costs over time. In my electorate of Riverina there is only one private hospital to cater to the entire electorate, so it is under enormous pressure. If I had a hip replacement, I could decide to go into the private hospital, as I have private health insurance, in order to free up one extra space in the public hospital for somebody else who will hopefully come off the threeto four-year waiting list-and sometimes longer-for the same type of procedure. If I go into a private hospital to have my operation and then am very well, I will still need some physio and somebody to occasionally check on my wound. For me to be in a position where I am going to run up the cost of all of the nursing and health services provided in the hospital that come into the costing of that bed seems quite ridiculous to me. It seems to me that I should be able to go home and have somebody come in and dress my wound and still claim that on my medical insurance. It would be much better and healthier for me as the patient, it would establish an external practice that is able to accommodate and assist those services and, at the same time, it would take the pressure off the hospital system and not be so costly for the private health insurance fund that it has to continue to raise its premiums. I think it is such a sensible idea to be able to have these options. In rural and regional areas it is often to have treatments for a serious illness in a more comfortable setting, such as home environments, due to isolation and lack of beds. This legislation can assist in these situations for those people who have committed no crime. They have private health insurance; that is simply not the crime that previous speakers in this debate would have people in this House believe. If people are prepared and willing to do that to take the pressure off the public hospital system then this is what we should have, but it should have a multiple choice factor. The fact that these changes can, as I say, lead to lower premiums for residents is welcome, especially for those rural people who outlay an enormous amount in travel costs in order to be treated. Serious illness is very difficult for people in rural areas. They travel to hospital because they are not covered for that treatment at home or in another setting. The costs can be extraordinary, as can the social and family isolation and dislocation. It is very sensible to broaden health cover to enable them to access the treatments they are entitled to. Currently, private health care must be performed in hospital if members are to receive a benefit from their health fund. Hospital tables with ancillary insurance are able to cover only other kinds of health services. As a result, many patients, such as the people in my electorate of Riverina, seek in-hospital treatment in order to utilise their private health insurance, even though safe and suitable out-of-hospital services exist at less cost for that particular treatment. I am not saying that this is the case for all treatments, but it is a simple matter of horses for courses. Until now, health funds have been prevented from covering preventative treatments and services that are provided as a substitute for inhospital care, and this change is the most sensible decision I have seen in health in a easier long time. I congratulate the Minister for Health and Ageing for entertaining this possibility, for giving cost options and for looking at ways to put downward pressure on spiralling health costs for those people who take out private health insurance. The change is not expected to have an impact on the premiums people pay now but it will effectively remove the current boundaries between hospital insurance and ancillary insurance. It will not be mandatory for health funds to offer broader health products, but I suggest it would be a very smart thing for any private health insurer to consider for all of the reasons I have outlined-and the lower the cost the better. The government's changes will allow people to have that opportunity which they do not have now. The government and the minister expect that this type of cover will become the principal form of private health insurance product, and I certainly endorse that. Research into broader health cover found that it would not lead to higher premiums, because health funds would have more flexibility in how they cover services. In offering broader health cover, a health fund may include a wider range of services than is currently available. It is an issue that we have needed to address for a long time. These guidelines were developed in consultation with the industry and with consumer representatives. We should not forget the consumer, because it is a consumer choice. If I had a family member who needed treatment, I would hope that I would be able to access that treatment at home in a comfortable, warm environment if that treatment could be delivered by a health service that could come to the house. I should be able to claim that and it would save the pro rata cost of a hospital bed when insurance premiums came to be determined. I want to reiterate my absolute support for this bill, and in particular the area of the legbills, islation I have spoken on today, because it enables private health insurers to provide myriad choices for the consumer. I also want to reiterate that, far from being ashamed of having private health insurance, as some in this House would advocate, people should be proud of wanting to have higher health insurance. In turn, those people who do not have health insurance because they cannot afford it should not be ashamed. They are entitled to quality public health services and access, off waiting lists, to procedures. It simply is not right that people who can afford to pay for treatment do not pay for it and take up valuable positions in the hospital and health system at the expense of having more and more people on waiting lists. In the New South Wales Greater Southern Area Health Service we already experience a disgraceful waiting list. I think this legislation is one way of being able, quite rightly, to assist people who do not have the resources or the finances to purchase health insurance which would enable them to access treatment faster. If you are a person who pays into a health insurance scheme, far from feeling ashamed and that you should not undertake new and innovative treatments, you should feel that you are contributing to the health of other Australians who are not as fortunate as you. That will always be the case. In enacting this bill, we hope that other valuable and worthwhile Australians will be able to access the public hospital and health system far more readily, and particularly those in New South Wales. I commend the minister on his ability to cut to the chase and pick up these initiatives and I commend the bill to the House.",49
21,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise in the House today to speak on the Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 and related but I speak with a little bit of concern. I have concern for those with private health insurance who may in the future-we do not know, but we can predict-find themselves eventually facing higher premiums; I have concern for those in our community who cannot afford private health insurance; I have concern for the professional independence of medical professionals; and, in particular, I have great concern about where this government is taking our nation when it comes to health care. I am happy to say that we on this side of the House are honestly supporting this bill. My colleague the member for Gellibrand has moved a second reading amendment that is essential, in my mind, to making this package of bills fair and worthwhile, and I am happily, wholeheartedly supporting that amendment. For the first time ever I actually agree with the Minister for Health and Aging when he says these bills represent the most signifimost cant change to private health insurance in the last five years. The provisions in the bills covering broader health cover are certainly welcome. Where it is deemed clinically appropriate by a medical professional, out-ofhospital services should be able to be covered by private health insurance. Services such as chemotherapy, dialysis and allied health services can be effectively and efficiently delivered in domestic or community based settings. These services should not be limited to hospitals, where scarce hospital beds are occupied unnecessarily in those cases. For the first time these out-of-hospital services will be covered by private health insurance. We on this side of the House welcome that initiative. The broader health cover provisions in the bills will also allow private health cover for preventative treatments, health promotion programs and chronic disease management. The government should be congratulated on finally taking action on preventative disease management particularly. This is an area that Labor has been very vocal on in the last 10 years, and I welcome the government's decision to improve access to these programs, even if it is only for private health insurance holders and not the community at large. But more on that in a moment. Given there is no detail in the bills as to what the rules will be for treatments to qualify under broader health cover, I have strong concerns that, for want of a better term, lifestyle programs may be included. Whilst a very broad range of activities can have preventative health benefits, I would be concerned that any alleged benefit can be substantiated in a clinical setting. One of my major concerns with the package of bills as introduced is that it does not protect explicitly the clinical independence of medical professionals in determining the appropriate medical treatment for their patients. I understand that the AMA has raised similar concerns. Labor does not want to see a situation where private health insurance companies are dictating what types of services will be offered to patients solely on the basis of cost to the health insurance companies. Those are decisions to concern doctors, not insurance companies. The member for Gellibrand has addressed this in her second reading amendment to these bills. I call on the government to support that amendment-and to at least think carefully about it. Any failure by the government to support this amendment should be a clear warning to the public that this government's priority could be seen as industry profit, not patient profit. My final and paramount concern in relation to broader health cover is that the government has chosen only to provide these services to privately insured patients. The previous speaker, the member for Riverina, put, in her words, a very strong case for why this is probably a good thing. There is a certain benevolence about the way the argument was put: that those people who can afford private health insurance should not be ashamed of having it-well, nobody is claiming they should be-and that they should feel good about the fact that by doing so they are assisting those other poorer folk who cannot afford health insurance. I do not think the access of health care in this country should be based on benevolence from anybody; it should be based on need, equity and access. Public patients in public hospitals and their doctors deserve to be given the same options for medical treatment as privately insured patients. The member for Riverina-and I am only using her words, because I was here to hear them-made a big call. She described very carefully how it is more comfortable, more secure and better for your health to resort to a home or a close-by community setting to receive particular types of services. Those very same claims could be made by a Medicare patient. They could equally be more safe, more secure, more comfortable and more in tune with their community by receiving these types of treatments at home. The benevolence should be removed out of it. And I say that with the greatest of respect to the member for Riverina and other members who may have that attitude. We should not have a range of preventative and disease management treatments that are available only to those in our community who can afford private health insurance. The minister opened his second reading speech with the words: This government is committed to choice in health care. This government is threatening the universality of our healthcare system by providing choices to private patients that are not available to public patients. The minister went on to say: This is a groundbreaking change. My question to the minister is: is this groundbreaking change not suitable for public patients, who are predominantly working families, low-income earners, welfare recipients, older members of our community and many people who make an enormous sacrifice to try to attain private health insurancethe majority of whom, of course, are Medicare or public patients? I ask the question: is it a good thing that we can see that they could be treated as second-class citizens under what now begins to emerge as a twotiered system of health? Are they to be denied the choices offered to those with private health insurance? If this government is serious about choice, it should fund public hospitals so that the same treatment choices can be offered to public patients as is offered to private patients. I support a balance in health care between the public and private sectors. I have never said and I never will that there should not be private health insurance. It is a two-pronged approach that this community has managed for many years. My fear with this legislation is that the balance is now beginning to be tipped too far in one direction-the direction of private health insurance policyholders. If public patients do not have access to the same prevention and disease management programs as privately insured patients, surely they will be more likely to be admitted to hospital or seek the services of their local GP. I note that last week the minister for health was crowing quite loudly about his success in raising the levels of bulk-billing for GP services-fair enough. I would like to congratulate the minister on his government's efforts. Here in the ACT, bulk-billing rates for non-referred GP attendances in 2005-06 was 21.8 per cent lower-that is right, lower-than in 1995-96. Over the 10 years of this government we have gone backwards on bulk-billing in the ACT. On top of that, ACT residents pay higher out-ofpocket expenses than anyone else in the country when visiting a GP. In fact it is almost double the national average. The figures get even worse when we look at bulkbilling rates for operations. In the ACT less than 22 per cent of operations were bulkbilled to Medicare in 2005-06, down from over 27 per cent when this government came to office-1995-96. My other concern with the broader health cover provisions is that, with the addition of so many new services, premiums will continue to rise at levels well above inflation, putting further pressure on family budgets or even putting private health insurance out of the reach of many families who are already being squeezed by rising interest rates, the price of petrol-which has been jumping up and down like a yoyo-and grocery bills. The cost of living is increasing. As private health insurers broaden their service base, my fear is that their cost base will broaden also. If recent history is anything to go by, and it usually is, private health insurance premiums have increased twice as fast as the rate of inflation since 1998. Labor recognise that many families have struggled to meet these increases. I would like to take this opportunity to assure private health insurance customers in my electorate that Labor are committed to keeping the 30 per cent health insurance rebate. Many families and individuals have factored this rebate into their household budgets when it comes to being able to afford private health cover. They rely on the rebate to make ends meet. And Labor are committed to keeping that rebate in place. We will not pull the rug out from under their feet. We have said that constantly. I understand very clearly the efforts to which some older folk and families go to try to have private health insurance. When you look at the sorts of services that they try bills. to get you can understand why they do that. One element in the package of bills that we on this side of the House are very critical of is the $50 million allocated in the last budget to health insurers to promote their services. This money could and should be spent on more productive areas within the health budget. Disease awareness and prevention programs for the whole community could be well funded with this money. My colleague the member for Gellibrand pointed out in her speech that this money would cover 1.5 million GP visits. That is a lot. That would be money well spent. The $50 million on health insurance advertising is a waste of taxpayers' money and should be diverted to providing health services for all Australians, not only those with private health insurance. I reiterate: the delivery and receipt of health services in this country has nothing to do with benevolence or helping some part of our community feel good and warm in the tummy about helping others get health services; it is all about equity, access and universality. I am pleased that these services are now going to be available; they are sensible. The previous speaker, the member for Riverina, made that very clear and I agree with her. They are very sensible ideas but they should not be confined to only those people on private health insurance. That is wrong. The point that has been made by many speakers on the other side is that this will help us get well, make recovery better and deliver services better. Any public patient in my electorate or in any community in this country who is a public patient and requires chemotherapy, dialysis or whatever the other services are, is no less a person by wanting to have it in their home or their community setting like a private health insurance patient will be able to after the passage of these I say to the government: think very clearly about the path of health care you are taking in this country if you provide these services only to privately insured patients. It is not equitable, it is not accessible, it is not fair and it is not the way health services should be delivered in this country. As far as I am concerned, the government's record on the delivery of health is atrocious, and the $50 million of taxpayers' money going on glossy advertising is crazy. That, in fact, would begin the process that I am talking about in relation to public patients. Of course, we support these bills but I again draw the attention of the House to the amendment to the second reading moved by the member for Gellibrand. It is important, sensible and fair, and would make an enormous improvement to this package of bills should the government have a spark of intelligence and decide that they should support such an amendment. We would be far more comfortable if that were the case.",52
22,Ms GEORGE,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I apologise to the Hansard staff and to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for my voice. Overnight I have developed quite a bad head cold. I have put my comments in writing to assist Hansard staff. The Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 is the main bill in the legislative package before us, and there will be cognate debate on it. This package was introduced very late during the parliamentary sittings late year, and from what I can see was rushed through with only one day of public hearings. The bill implements a series of changes to current health insurance provision, including the expansion of private health insurance to cover medical services provided outside hospital-which can either substitute for inhospital services or are designed to prevent hospitalisation-including health promotion and chronic disease management. This new offering is to be called broader health cover. As indicated, it will for people covered by private health insurance provide services outside hospital. It is probably one of the most significant elements of change in this package. The other change goes to changes in Lifetime Health Cover rating whereby people who have retained private health insurance for over 10 years will no longer be subject to Lifetime Health Cover loadings. Thirdly, and very importantly, there is the introduction of requirements for private health insurance funds to provide standard product information to consumers. The Minister for Health and Ageing says that the broader health cover represents the most significant shift in private health insurance policy since the introduction of the rebate and the Lifetime Health Cover scheme back in 2000-01. On behalf of the people I represent who are covered by private health insurance, I believe that these changes will be welcomed. But I do want to draw attention to my fear that the majority of my constituents, who do not have private health insurance, may be left behind. The changes will mean a significant shift in what private health insurance can do, and subsequently a subtle but important shift in the balance between services funded predominantly through Medicare, such as GP, specialist and public hospital services, and services that in future will be provided and last funded through private health insurance. I have always believed that the rationale for private health insurance coverage is that it gives patients additional choice but without necessarily providing a different kind of service per se from that available to non-insured people in the community and what they can obtain through the public hospital system. The notion of universality in quality health provision is, I think, an important principle that begins to be eroded by some of the changes proposed in this bill. We are told that broader health cover means that private health insurance funds will be able in future to provide cover for medical services provided outside of hospital which are not covered by Medicare. In other words, people will have a broader set of options that will be covered by insurance as opposed to simply augmenting or providing additional services on top of those that currently exist for all people. As I indicated, I have major concerns that this package represents the shift towards a two-tiered system of health provision. Why do I say this? On my understanding of the legislation, it will potentially make more services and treatment options available but only to people with private health insurance, and those without will not get access to those benefits. The broader health cover provisions in the package, we are told, will make available to private health insurance consumers a range of services not generally available through our public system, professional services for which a Medicare benefit is not payable. The explanatory memorandum indicates these include services such as chemotherapy and dialysis at home as well as preventative and chronic disease management programs. There is an argument that if people with private health insurance have better access not just to out-of-hospital services also to preventative and chronic disease management programs which are generally not available through the public system, they will indeed end up having access to a better overall quality of health care, thus breaching what I believe is a fundamental principle that universal provision of quality care should apply to all in our community. Of course the government and the Minister for Health and Ageing and the industry rail against the suggestion that this package represents a shift to a two-tiered system of health care. But if the broader health cover provisions give people with private health insurance access to services and treatment options which people without such insurance will not have access to then in my view the package does exactly that. If it is preferable in certain situations for patients to have access to chemotherapy and dialysis treatments on an outpatient basis, or in fact in their own home, why is the health minister happy to allow this for privately insured patients but not for all public patients? The area of greatest concern to me in this legislation is the government's plan to allow private health funds to offer cover for what is called ‘general treatments'. These are defined in the minister's own words in his second reading speech as: ... tailored programs that support and sustain healthy lifestyles, services such as personalised health checks, dietary guidance, exercise supervision, and support to quit smoking. With a greater focus on preventive health measures and better management of chronic conditions it may appear this is the way to go in the delivery of cost-effective health care. But this private health insurance cover is only for programs not covered by Medicare and is not available to all in our community. Again I ask: if such programs are deemed by the minister and this government to be important on medical grounds, why are they but going to be made available only to those with private health insurance? I am concerned that some of these changes will disadvantage people that I represent, people without private health insurance and people in rural and regional areas who will not have access to many of these services and treatments. We know from available data and from coverage in my own electorate that people with higher incomes are more likely to have private health insurance. This was confirmed back in 1998 in an ABS survey. More recent data from Roy Morgan Research shows that in the year 2003 having private health insurance cover continued to be strongly associated with higher income levels. When analysed by the income level of the main income earner, Roy Morgan Research showed that 23 per cent of people with an income below $20,000 had insurance while 76 per cent of persons on incomes of $100,000 or more had insurance-23 per cent at the low end of the income scale compared to 76 per cent at the top end of the scale. When analysed by total household income the research data showed that only 19 per cent of people with total household incomes below $20,000 had private health insurance compared to 68 per cent of people with total household incomes of more than $100,000. Interestingly, when I looked at this data I noted that over half-54 per cent-of all persons who hold private health insurance and reported a total household income below $20,000 were over 65, and most likely were aged pensioners. That is certainly the impression I have in terms of the extent of health coverage in my electorate of Throsby. I know that many people on pensions and fixed incomes go to extraordinary lengths to take out private health insurance to provide them with a degree of certainty in the event of any emergencies arising. I have to ask: why is it that these new visions will continue to be subsidised through the private health rebate to which all taxpayers contribute? Those with insurance and those without all contribute through the taxation system to the outlays that go to the health rebate. I think this is quite inequitable because not all taxpayers, as I indicated earlier, will receive the benefits of the changes-and we should remember that the private health insurance rebate in 2005-06 was in the order of $3 billion. We can already see how a two-tiered system operates in the area of dental health provision. If you can afford private health insurance, which some in my community have, your dental costs are partially subsidised through the 30 per cent rebate. But if you cannot afford that option-and the majority of my constituents do not have private health insurance-you could find yourself among the half a million to 600,000 people languishing on our dental health waiting list for attention through the public dental system. The Australian Dental Association recently commented: People who are disadvantaged by socio-economic status experience greater levels of oral disease than those from more affluent groups. It goes on to say that it is acknowledged: … that “profound disparities exist across socio-economic groups in Australia … [as] the incidence of caries and periodontal disease increases as socio-economic status decreases.” This, it says, is: … referred to … as the “polarisation of the burden of [oral] disease”. From estimates obtained through the Parliamentary Library, it seems that dental care now accounts for around 48 per cent of benefits paid out under ancillary coverage, which amounts in effect to an indirect subsidy in the order of $325 million to $345 million a year. So on the one hand the government, through the rebate, indirectly subsidises the pro- dental health needs of people with private insurance and on the other hand the government turns its back on those most in need by refusing to reinstate and fund a Commonwealth dental program. As funding has been withdrawn from public patients, subsidies for the oral health needs of privately insured Australians continue to grow. A huge divide has grown such that low-income earners without private dental health insurance are now 25 times more likely to have had all their teeth extracted than high-income earners with insurance. I use that analogy to show the impact of the differential operations of dental care to make the point that, once you move away from government funded universal provisions for all people in the community, it only stands to reason that those who have the means to avail themselves of private health insurance will continue to have better oral and general health outcomes than people who do not have such insurance. The government and the Minister for Health and Ageing argue that the changes in these bills will not have any impact on premiums. In fact, the minister argued in his second reading speech that, by streamlining regulatory arrangements and enabling funds to operate more efficiently, the provisions in this package will reduce pressures on premiums. I find that amazing, coming from a minister of a government that promised back in 2001 that their policies would keep private health insurance affordable and put downward pressure on premiums. Yet every year since then premiums have increased by well above the rate of inflation-in aggregate, close to 40 per cent since 2001. It stands to reason, I think, that if the funds are able to offer a broader range of products then at least in the short term people will be expected to pay more for these services. This view is confirmed in submissions made by the AMA, who argued: The health funds will have great difficulty suading anyone that they can expand the range services covered by their products without any increase in premiums. Of course, after the next election, if the ernment has its way, Medibank Private will be sold. Many of my constituents are currently in that fund. In that transition to its sale, Medibank Private will lose its current not-for-profit status. Given it is Australia's biggest health insurer, once it becomes a forprofit company this will inevitably lead to premiums rising, not just for the members of Medibank Private but for the whole sector. If the market leader's premiums are rising then other insurers will surely follow. Community sentiment and expert opinion are against the sale, and that is no doubt why the sale has been put off until after the next election. I need to alert my constituents with private health insurance to the fact that under this bill there is no restriction on the number of premium rises that can be sought by a health fund in any one year. In the draft exposure bill it was suggested that an annual contract be instituted guaranteeing 12 months protection to consumers on the premium rates that would be charged. Unfortunately, this measure was dropped-probably, I would suggest, due to pressure from the insurers. While in the bill before us the minister retains final authority over premium rises, the bill does not specify that funds must show justification for these rises. Nor does the bill provide details of any criteria to be used by the minister in making his decision, although the minister has previously made a commitment to the development of clear criteria against which premium increases will be considered. Private health insurance is out of reach for many of my constituents, and that is reflected in the data about those who are covered and those who are not covered. Those perwho are covered face every annual premium of increase with growing levels of trepidation, particularly pensioners and other people on low and fixed incomes. I have many submisgov- sions made to me on an annual basis complaining about the justification, or lack thereof, for the constant rises. In fact, I pursued increases charged by one of the insurers and, at a time when the minister was saying that the average rise was in the order of eight per cent, when I looked at the different levels of contribution, the average increase for one fund was in the order of 17 per cent. Many of my constituents also complain that they do not get value for money from their insurance policies. As part of this cognate debate, we are also dealing with the issue of prosthesis application and listing fees, and I want to bring to the minister's attention a couple of issues that came to my notice just recently. One case involved a 45-year-old woman who underwent an above-the-knee amputation. As we know, in Australia all amputees are eligible to receive a basic prosthesis, or artificial limb-although the specifics vary from state to state-in the $2,000 to $2,500 price range. This particular constituent of mine, however, was unable to get assistance through her private health fund-even though she was contributing at the highest level-for the fitting of her choice of prosthetic limb, which was a microprocessor-controlled knee joint. This new technology offers amputees much greater safety and function, and has a longer life, but it is expensive. It is important that people here in our community are not denied new technologies that are available to people in other countries. The other case involved a constituent faced with the necessity of surgery to remove an embolus from an artery. Due to a two-year waiting list at the local public hospital, the procedure was carried out in a local private hospital in January 2006. He tells me he was charged for the titanium coils, as they were not listed at the time, as well as for the costs that he had expected in having surgery in a private hospital. On pursuing his case with the parliamentary secretary, I was surprised to be told: There is no definition of ‘prosthetic' in the lation which supports current Prostheses Arrangements. Such a definition was not included in the legislation as it could become problematic if the way in which health services are provided changes. In addition, there may be a risk of precluding the listing of new technologies if they do not fit the definition. I think I have gone round in circles in trying to assist both of my constituents in accessing suitable prosthetics to help in the treatment of serious illness. In conclusion, while there is no doubt that the bill will provide benefits for many of my constituents who are currently covered by private health insurance, I do worry for them about the impact of further rises in their premiums, which, in my view, could only worsen once Medibank Private is sold. I also want to put on the public record my concern that this is possibly the beginning of a twotiered system of health provision which might end up disadvantaging many of the people I represent who do not have private health insurance. At the core, I think the principle of universality of quality health care for all is certainly at risk as we move in the direction foreshadowed in the ‘broader health cover' services and provisions.",56
23,Mr ABBOTT,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"The Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 and related bills are all about making a good system even better. I say it is a good system and today we have had further evidence of its public appeal. A further 170,000 Australians have become covered by private health insurance over the last quarter. This takes the percentage of the population with private health cover to 43.4 per cent and it is the sixth consecutive quarterly increase in the number of people covered. Essentially, these bills are about making private health insurance a better product by allowing the funds to cover treatments and legisprograms from their main tables that might prevent or substitute for hospital cover. In addition, it will put in place for the first time a quality and safety regime for privately insured services and it should make it easier for people to work out which product is best for them. So they are good bills. I welcome the contributions from both sides of this House which have accepted that there is much that is to be welcomed in this bill. I note that these bills are being considthe question. ered by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which is due to report on 26 February. I will carefully consider any recommendations which the committee makes. As well, the government has already indicated that it will be moving amendments in the Senate based on further consultations with the sector. There are some amendments which the opposition wish to move here. I have to say that I think they are unnecessary. If I could address one amendment nownamely, that which seeks to restore the current requirement that the Private Health Insurance Administration Council has as one of its objectives to minimise the level of private health insurance premiums-I think this is essentially redundant, given that the proposed bills retain the public interest test. Nevertheless, in order to provide a belts and braces approach, if you like, I will happily look at putting that back in after having received the recommendations of the Senate committee. Let me just say, on the subject of premium increases, no-one ever likes premium increases. I like them as little as members opposite, but I do point out that since 1996 premium increases have been significantly less than they were in the previous 13 years. While I certainly am in no position to predict now what the next round of premium increases might be, I do think that they ought to be significantly lower than in recent years given the very large profits or surpluses which the funds have recently made. I commend these bills to the House.",60
24,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Gellibrand has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words.

Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. NA 2006 Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.,61
25,Ms ROXON,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE BILL,"I move: (1) Clause 172-5, page 136 (lines 7-12), omit the clause, substitute: “172-5 Agreements with medical practitioners Medical Purchaser Provider Agreements (1) If a private health insurer enters into an agreement with a *medical practitioner for the provision of treatment to persons insured by the insurer, the agreement must not limit the medical practitioner's professional freedom, within the scope of accepted clinical practice, to identify and provide appropriate treatments. Hospital Purchaser Provider Agreements (2) If a hospital or day hospital facility enters into an agreement with a *medical practitioner, under which treatment is provided to persons insured by the insurer, the agreement must not limit the medical practitioner's professional freedom, within the scope of accepted clinical practice, to identify and provide appropriate treatments. Other Purchaser Provider Agreements (3) If a private health insurer enters into any agreement for the provision of services or goods intended to manage a disease, injury or condition, the agree to ment must not limit the freedom of medical practitioners and/or other health professionals involved in the provision of the service or good, within the scope of accepted clinical practice, to identify and provide appropriate treatments.”. This amendment deals with a very important issue that the medical profession in particular but also the community are concerned about, and that is the issue of a doctor's clinical autonomy under this new regime. We believe that the amendment is necessary to make it absolutely crystal clear that, despite the changing procedures that will be available for people with private health insurance, the doctor who is treating an insured patient is still given absolute clinical autonomy to advise and to act in the best interests of the patient. We do not believe that the provisions in the bill at the moment are clear enough as they stand. The House will note that we have inserted three new provisions which go to a doctor's clinical autonomy in a number of different situations: where there are medical purchaser provider agreements, where there are hospital purchaser provider agreements, and other purchaser provider agreements. The last one is intended to catch those services that are likely to be hospital substitute services, the types of services that will no doubt grow quickly and will be accessed by many more people as a result of the changes in the broader healthcare package. Our major criticism of the existing section 172-5 is that it is limited to only medical purchaser provider agreements-that is, agreements between health insurers and medical practitioners directly. Whilst that is important, we are concerned that these other circumstances do not have the express protection that they need to. Both the AMA and the Australian Private Hospitals Association argue that the legislation specifically needs include these protections in other circumstances and contexts, as I mentioned, such as hospital purchaser provider agreements. I think that it is welcome, of course, that the minister has indicated he will consider these and other issues if they come up as a result of the Senate inquiry that will occur in the other place. But I do think it is important for us in the House of Representatives to be able to indicate our clear and strong concerns about issues that are a matter of consumer protection. I think there are very important issues around the professional practice that doctors need to feel that they are able to provide. I do think there are some more extreme concerns that have been expressed by others, not in this House, that this is just going to give the insurers direct control. I do not necessarily adhere to that view, but I think that one way we can give both consumers and doctors that assurance is by ensuring that their clinical freedoms are protected. I understand that both the minister and the health insurance industry have clearly indicated that they do not want that changed. In that case, even if it is out of an abundance of caution, it is worthwhile having these sorts of provisions in the act, particularly where we are changing the system as it applies to very many people. The proposed new clause regarding hospital purchaser provider agreements is similar to what is currently in the National Health Act. The clause regarding other purchaser provider agreements is designed to cover those other circumstances, including circumstances in which medical practitioners provide care and treatment in other contexts, such as hospital substitute services. These services might be in a community setting, at home or any number of other settings where we still want to make sure that the doctors have the autonomy that they need, as well as circumstances in which other health professionals, such as allied health professionals, are involved in the provision of services. We accept that the drafting we have opted for may not be the only way of delivering this outcome, but we do believe that it is vital to have it in here. We urge the minister to reconsider his position in this House. We should be able to make good law in this House, not just in the Senate. I ask him to consider this amendment. Question negatived.",61
26,Ms ROXON,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE BILL,"I move: (2) Clause 264-5, page 220 (line 3), after graph (b) insert: “(ba) minimising the level of health insurance premiums;”. This is the amendment that the minister has already referred to in his summing-up debate. It deals with the issue of minimising the level of health insurance premiums. I certainly think that the minister has got one thing right in respect of this: no-one does like premium increases. That is not news to anybody here. But we do believe, as legislators, that we should make sure that we regard it as our obligation to do what can be done to minimise premiums. We do not accept the government's view that this is a change that has no impact. As things currently stand in the National Health Act, the Private Health Insurance Administration Council has an express objective-one of only a few-of minimising the level of health insurance premiums. We cannot understand, when the government is so sensitive to any suggestion by any of us on this side of the House that premiums may go up as a result of this package, why the government would not be falling over itself to leave the existing protections in the legislation that make sure there is at least some hope the insurance administration council can have some control over insurance premiums. It has not been included in the bill, and I have seen argued in the media that the reason this specific clause has been removed is that there is a more general clause about protecting the interest of consumers. The minister himself referred to the public interest test, but we need to separate what the administration council's objectives are. It is not as if a new provision has been drafted that deals with public interest or protecting consumers. Those provisions are already there. This minimisation of the premiums is an additional existing protection and objective for the administration council. I cannot paraunderstand why the government would want to remove those protections that are already in there. This amendment is simply to reinsert the specific clause that is there into the relevant section of the act. The government's argument for taking this clause out also seems to be based around an argument that because PHIAC does not set the premiums it should not be required to have the minimisation of premiums in the legislation. I think there are two very important answers to that for the minister to consider. One is that PHIAC does have a role to play in keeping premiums down by virtue of its role regulating the private health insurance sector. Its regulatory role includes looking at the passing on of benefits, particularly if there might be any sharp practices or others. Then there would be a role for the regulator to be involved. Those sorts of things can have a particular impact on premiums, and I do not think we could argue that they do not. Of course they may not have the key role in setting the premiums, but that does not mean that they cannot have some important influence and role to play in the minimisation of them, particularly in circumstances where, as I said, sharp practices were involved. But, even more importantly, if the government says that PHIAC should not have an objective of minimising premiums because it is the government that approves the premiums then I would challenge the minister to agree to this amendment or perhaps move his own, where the minister takes responsibility for the minimisation of premiums. There is nothing in the act that requires that to be an objective that he considers. If he believes that it is inappropriately an obligation for PHIAC because he has that responsibility then it would be appropriate for that protection, if it were to be moved, to be moved to his specific obligations. We have not had any indication that the government is interested in taking on responsibility for the reduction in premiums. In fact, we have just had attacks made on us that we are being hysterical about the risk of an increase in premiums. I know that the minister has not promised that premiums are going to go down this year and he has not promised that premiums will be at a particular rate. Certainly, the general MCMullan, R.F. rumours are that they will be lower than usual, but there is no suggestion that there will not be an increase this year and there is no suggestion that the increase will not be higher than CPI. No-one could honestly suggest that the community does not feel those increases extremely acutely. In that case, why would we as legislators take away an existing protection? If the minister truly believes it is just inappropriately placed with PHIAC, he should have the guts to say he will put that commitment in as an obligation for him expressly under the act.

28,Ms ROXON,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I move: (1) Clause 14, page 10 (lines 23-25), omit the clause substitute: “14 Quality assurance requirements The quality assurance requirements in Division 81 of the new Act commence from 1 April 2007.”. For the convenience of the House, this is the last amendment that Labor will be moving to this suite of bills, and we will not ask that the House divide on the question. However, I do think this is a very important amendment and I encourage the government to consider it. This deals with the issue of quality assurance for the services that are going to be able to be accessed under the broader healthcare package. The current clause provides-and I noticed that, when summing up debate on the second reading, the minister also referred to this as an important part of the packagethat there will be quality controls and standards that will apply as part of this whole package. However, unfortunately the provision makes clear that any of those quality assurance issues and standards will not apply in relation to an insurance policy until 1 July 2008; although, as the House would be aware, this package of bills, if it passes through the other place, will come into force on 1 April 2007. This leaves a significant lag between the time that insured consumers will be able to benefit from the changes under the bill and the time that the services that they are accessing and that their insurers are paying for will actually have the sorts of consumer protections and guarantees that exist for current services. Again, it may be a belts-and-braces provision-that we want to make sure that consumers are able to have full confidence in this changing scene in the health area. I do not think that there should be any concern about standards and quality assurance controls being in place. Everybody across the sector seems to believe that this is important, although we do acknowledge that there are different views about what those standards should be and how they should apply. I know that the government have said that there is not anything in the bill that will compromise standards. Their view is that insurers of course would not cover other products that do not meet certain standards, and I would agree that health insurers have a very strong interest in making sure that the services that are used are of top standard. But in this place we regulate the control of quality and have standards in place services for very important public policy reasons; we want to make sure that any person who is treated under a service has the basic protection that they meet a certain standard. Obviously the government accept this, because they are proposing to introduce standards. Unfortunately those standards are not going to be in place for 15 or 16 months. I know that the government are not confident that those standards can be ready in time. The effective date for the rest of the act, have said, is 1 April 2007; that still gives some time. I do not think it is wise for us to be legislating that standards will come into place after such a significant time lag, and I do not want to be in the position of any of us having to come back into this place and say, ‘We got that wrong and we should have made sure quality protections were in place.' I would have thought it is in the interest of everyone-the parliament, the insurer and the consumer-to make sure that these protections are there. We have these sorts of protections for hospital services; we have them for many other health services. It does not seem to me that we need to totally re-create the wheel; they are not being designed from scratch. Some different issues need to apply because of the settings that some of these services might be provided in, but that is all the more reason for us to make sure that there are strong quality controls in place. I agree that it is not appropriate to use the quality standards that apply in a hospital for a service that might be provided in a home, but it is just as important-maybe more important-if someone is going off unaided, perhaps without the assistance of other colleagues, to provide a service which can be provided in the home. We need to make sure that appropriate standards will still be in place for for all sorts of those people. It is simply an issue of Labor wanting to guarantee that consumer safety is protected. We think that the quality assurance package for broader health cover products should be in place as soon as these products come onto the market. If the government say that there is nothing in the bill that will compromise standards, we do not see why this change will cause them any problems. I can understand, however, that this might be one of the amendments best suited to be dealt with folas I lowing the recommendations we have not yet seen from the Senate committee, because no doubt it is an area that they are particularly turning their minds to. There are probably a number of different options for the way this issue can be solved. Making sure there is not a time lag is our vital concern. We want protections and standards to be in place so that we make sure that consumers are protected. Question negatived. Bill agreed to. Third Reading",65

35,Mr ALBANESE,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"I rise to speak on the ACIS Administration Amendment (Unearned Credit Liability) Bill 2007. The Labor Party supports this bill, which seeks to confirm the Australian government's continued ability to issue participants in the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme with unearned credit liabilities that are offset against future ACIS credits in the case that items of ineligible expenditure or other errors are identified. It is important that the Australian automotive industry is able to participate in ACIS and not be disadvantaged by administrative delays. The significance of the Australian automotive industry, and indeed all Australian manufacturing, cannot be overstated. The Australian Labor Party has a strong history of supporting Australian industry and keeping pace with changing industry needs over time. Labor's approach has included the introduction of a generous 150 per cent research and development tax concession, the development of specific industry policies in areas such as automotive and pharmaceuticals, and a proactive approach by government in attracting foreign capital. If it were not for the assistance provided by previous Labor governments, some industries would never have passed the embryonic stage. Under the leadership of Labor's former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Senator John Button, industry was assisted to modernise, innovate and face foreign competition. Labor Party reforms have enhanced the competitiveness of Australian firms by removing tariff walls and other barriers that had sheltered Australian industry from international competition and engagement. Today the automotive industry directly employs around 80,000 Australians. With turnover of approximately $27 billion per annum, the industry accounts for six per cent of employment in the manufacturing sector and around one per cent of Australia's GDP. Reforms initiated under John Button have allowed the industry's productivity and quality performance to become a significant asset and allowed some Australian firms to supply products to particular export markets. But, upon coming into government, the Howard government wasted no time in undoing many of these positive reforms. The first their Howard-Costello budget slashed the R&D tax concession, from 150 to 125 per cent, and cut back funding for export and trade enhancement programs. Two years later they announced a pause in the tariff at 15 per cent, from 2000 to 2004, followed by a reduction to 10 per cent in 2005, and the introduction of ACIS, designed to provide the automotive industry with import credits to be offset against customs duty on eligible imports. But, in truth, ACIS has been little more than a rebadging of the Export Facilitation Program, a similar assistance program introduced under the previous Labor government. In December 2002 the government announced that its automotive policy commitment beyond 2005 would revolve around a 10-year, $4.2 billion extension of ACIS until 2015 and, following a 2008 Productivity Commission review, a reduction in the tariff on passenger vehicles and automotive components to five per cent from the beginning of 2010. What is clear in 2007 is that the Howard-Costello government thinks it has done everything it needs to do as far as the Australian automotive industry is concerned: it has extended the ACIS program, called for a review or two and reduced vehicle tariffs. What the government has failed to do is to keep step with the rest of the world and the changing face of the global and local automotive industry. This is an industry that must now take into account globalised supply chains and the emergence of new automotive economies such as those of China and India. There are unaddressed industry concerns that ACIS is failing to deliver benefits to cal industry, in terms of both R&D value and in facilitating the involvement of Australian manufacturers in the global supply chain, and that car makers are using import credits in a way that reduces the local content of domestically manufactured vehicles. The Howard government approach to policy leaves industry unprepared-and this is not confined just to the automotive industry. The Howard government has washed its hands of the plight of the Australian manufacturing industry as a whole. We on this side of the House know that good industry policy translates into vibrant and growing manufacturing industries of all varieties. However, on the Prime Minister's watch manufacturing has plummeted to under 12 per cent of GDP, amongst the lowest levels in the OECD. Just over a decade ago, manufacturing accounted for over 14 per cent of GDP. That is over $24 billion in today's value lost to the economy Between 2002-03 and 2005-06 alone, manufacturing output fell by $860 million Despite the fact that the manufacturing industry employs over one million Australians, the Howard government does not have a plan for the future of critical manufacturing industries, such as the automotive and textiles industries. Without policy reform, the numbers will continue to decline. The downward trends are astounding. Since the election of the Howard government in 1996, we have lost over 110,000 manufacturing jobs. This is equivalent to approximately 204 manufacturing jobs disappearing each and every week that the Howard government has been in office. Since 2004 alone we have lost 36,700 manufacturing jobs. That is equivalent to 352 every week. The impact of these job losses on local communities and workers is severe. At the beginning of 2006, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union conducted a survey of workers made redundant at Ion in Albury loaround September-October 2005 and at Tristar in Sydney in August 2005. The findings of the survey are astounding and should be of concern to anyone interested in the long term future of manufacturing and communities which are dependent on manufacturing employment. The main findings were: - The percentage of redundant workers who have found employment is 37.2% with the average length of unemployment for the lucky ones who found jobs being 5 weeks. - The unemployment rate amongst these people up to 6 months after they were made redundant is 48.2%. - 5.1% of those surveyed were forced to retire prematurely because of the redundancy. - Only 41.4% of the workers who had managed to find jobs were able to secure employment in the manufacturing sector. - Only 48.4% of those workers employed found full time employment. 31% of the workers had to accept casual jobs. The average hours for the redundant workers who found full time jobs was 44.4 hours per week representing 10% more hours than they worked in their previous job. - Of those lucky enough to find employment, 89.7% suffered a reduction in wages with the average reduction being 28.3%or more than one dollar in every four- Exactly half of those who were made redundant believe that their long term financial curity has suffered significantly from this dundancy. In other words, high-skill, high-wage manufacturing jobs, once lost, are extremely hard to replace. This is the ultimate price that Australia will pay if we allow the automotive component industry to disappear. Another big concern for manufacturing is the significant downturn in export growth and the impact this is having on the trade deficit. The data is telling. Between 2001 and 2005 manufacturing exports fell by $1.3 billion, while manufacturing imports grew by $28.4 billion. In 2004-05 the manufacturing trade deficit blew out from $29.7 billion to more than $89 billion. This government has reached new records and filled industry data with superlatives. Australia's share of world exports has now fallen to its lowest level since records began in 1946. The Howard government has presided over 57 monthly trade deficits in a row-the longest run of any Australian government. This government's declining support of industry is damaging and does not bode well for future economic prosperity. There is a dire need for this government to develop sound industry policy that will see to industry growth, not decline. How can we revive a globally competitive manufacturing industry in Australia? One of the strengths of the manufacturing industry here in Australia is its innovative nature. We must build on this strength. Australian businesses and industry have imagination and a desire to grow. We must catapult emerging industries so that they become Australian success stories of tomorrow and not foreign success stories built on Australian innovation. In the last decade, it was a tragedy that some of our best technology and brightest and, indeed, most innovative people went overseas. Take, for example, the solar hot water systems developed at the University of seSydney. The Chinese saw its commercial repotential and grabbed it. It is now a huge part of China's solar market-invented in Australia, but made in China. Some of you may recall Dr Zhengrong Shi, a dual ChineseAustralian citizen. Dr Shi completed his PhD in solar energy at the University of New South Wales, but his wealth, which is estimated at $3 billion, comes from commercialising solar energy technology in China. Dr Shi told the Sunday Telegraph on 27 August 2006: ... if Australia had a similar type of incentive program (to China's), we definitely would have set up a manufacturing facility in Sydney or Australia. I have met Dr Shi and spoken with him on a platform at the Australian National University. He is indeed someone we should all be proud of. We should be encouraging innovators such as Dr Shi to develop industry here in Australia so that the profits and the jobs stay here. Australia needs the right mechanisms and incentives to encourage innovation and investment. We simply cannot afford to lose these sorts of opportunities. Labor believes that innovation and research and development are the keys to a competitive manufacturing industry, but a complacent Howard government is unable to create an environment that fosters innovation. Under its watch, business expenditure in R&D in Australia has been declining in comparison with our competitors. In Australia, business expenditure in R&D, or BERD, is 0.89 per cent of GDP. This ranks Australia 15th in the OECD. The OECD average is 1.5 per cent. By comparison, Chinese firms have been increasing their R&D expenditure by over 20 per cent per year. Though the government will argue that since 1996 BERD has been growing on average at 2.6 per cent per annum, it will not tell you that in the previous decade R&D investment grew by 11.4 per cent per annum-11.4 per cent under Labor and 2.6 per cent under the Howard government. Manufacturing has taken a more severe hit, with BERD down from 10.5 per cent to 0.8 per cent. This is a devastating decline given that manufacturing is generally seen as the major driver of BERD. Within manufacturing, the automotive industry contributes the majority of research and development. The future of Australian industry must be underpinned by innovation-a critical factor to drive productivity and therefore to drive growth. It is not just Labor that says so. In its paper New concepts in innovation: the keys to a growing Australia, released in March 2006, the Business Council of Australia stated: … there is a lack of understanding … about how innovation occurs within businesses and the policy environment required to allow it to thrive. We need to meet the challenge and kick-start the next generation of innovation. Under a Rudd Labor government, industry will be driven by investment in research and development, a highly skilled workforce, sound intellectual property arrangements and venture capital finance initiatives that facilitate commercialisation. The Howard government strategy for making us competitive is very simple: cut wages and conditions so that Australia can compete with its neighbours on wages. It is a road to a low-wage, low-skill economy. Labor believe in a high-wage, high-skill economy and we believe in an expanding manufacturing sector. Labor's industry policy will appreciate Australia's place in a globalised market. It will map a long-term, forwardlooking strategy that is sensitive to the competitive advantages of the Australian economy and the pressures being felt by Australian industry. With Kevin Rudd's education revolution we will make the right investments that are needed in the skills and education of our people. Australia cannot stand ready to meet new challenges and take advantage of emerging industries if the Howard government continues to reduce public investment in universities and TAFEs while other OECD countries increase it. Labor's industry policy will ensure that Australia's great research institutions, including the CSIRO, are supported, heard and respected for the work they do. It will foster a culture of innovation that will not just advantage manufacturing industries but will also allow our mining and agricultural sectors to build their skills and add value to exports. It will position Australia such that it can offer our region the banking, financial, educational and environmental services of the future. It will be an internationally competitive Australia that is proud of its modern manufacturing, smart services, cutting-edge health and medical research, innovative mining and sustainable agriculture. There is an example of what is occurring, particularly in the automotive industry, at the moment in my electorate of Grayndler. When I was first elected, the Tristar plant in Marrickville employed over 600 Australians. By and large, these are Australians who came here after the Second World War, many of them migrants from southern Europe. They have worked hard and made an outstanding contribution to the economy, to the local community and to Australia as a whole. It is an outrage that 30 of those proud Australians have had to put up with the extraordinary actions of the owners of Tristar, who have moved the work offshore to China and who make those workers clock on every day and sit in a vacant factory simply because their redundancy entitlements of four weeks per year of service would entitle them to a considerable redundancy payment. These are Australians who have worked in the manufacturing sector for years. The late John Beaven worked in that factory for 43 years. It was the only job he had. The 30 remaining workers have an average service to the company of well over 25 years. They rely on the manufacturing sector. Many of them will find it very difficult to find other ployment; therefore, the securing of their entitlements is vital for them and their lies. Yet, when we raised questions about this issue in the parliament on 10 August last year, when the Tristar workers came to parliament in November and we asked questions again in the parliament, and when the workers wrote to the Prime Minister, they were treated with contempt by this government. They were thrown on the scrap heap, just as large portions of the manufacturing sector have been regarded as unimportant. They are the personification of Australia's decline in manufacturing. Labor will continue to campaign for them to receive the payments to which they are entitled. This is nothing more and nothing less than theft by this company. The government, which treated those workers with contempt for many months, has now acknowledged there is an issue but has failed to take real, effective action. To conclude, Australia's manufacturing industry, including the automotive industry, is now at a tipping point. For more than 10 years, the government has failed to demonstrate the national leadership required to secure Australia's industrial future. Australia must develop a forward-looking industry policy and strategy. Our long-term prosperity as a nation cannot depend on exporting more raw materials to developing nations, or slashing wages and working conditions such that they are lower than other nations. Australia's ongoing future prosperity will be guaranteed by being innovative, with leading businesses and individuals that are the best and most productive in their fields. Complacent governments like the Howard government generally concentrate on distributing income rather than generating it. More than 10 long Howard years represent a missed opportunity that will impede Australia from sustaining our prosperity and compromise our ability to em- remain internationally competitive. The alternative Labor formula is simple: investfamiment equals productivity equals growth equals sustained prosperity-prosperity for Australian industry and sustainable prosperity for all Australians.",68
36,Mr MCARTHUR,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"I have listened with interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Grayndler and commend him on his thoughtful speech. However, I do observe his very gloomy figures on jobs and the fundamental truth that in all Western nations-the member for Grayndler, who is leaving the chamber, might like to hear this, because I am referring to his speechMr Albanese-I've got a tactics meeting, sorry. Mr Fitzgibbon-I'll let him know, Stewie.",72
37,Mr MCARTHUR,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"In all developed Western democracies there is a problem with changing technologies. Jobs have moved out of the manufacturing sector fundamentally because of improved technology. Of course, some jobs have moved in the component industry to low-wage countries. He talks about a sound industry policy. Like the Leader of the Opposition, we are still waiting to see what a sound industry policy actually means. My final observation is that he makes the untruthful remark that the Howard government has managed to support the manufacturing industry by cutting wages. The reality, as the member for Hunter knows, is that real wages have increased by about 16 per cent from 1996 to 2006. Contrary to what the member for Grayndler was saying, manufacturing has provided jobs and real wage increases to those workers, even though there is a fundamental change, as we all know, in the manufacturing sector in Australia and other westernised nations. I am delighted to contribute to the debate on the ACIS Administration Amendment (Unearned Credit Liability) Bill 2007. You may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I have had a strong interest in Australia's automotive industry for many years, as Ford operates out of Geelong and is an important employer across the Geelong region. ACIS, which stands for the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, was introduced by the Howard government in January 2001. The ACIS program is part of the government's strategy to enhance the long-term competitiveness, profitability and sustainability of the Australian automotive industry. The automotive industry operates in a very competitive international environment. Trade liberalisation has put significant pressure on Australian car manufacturers over the past 20 years to reform, to adopt new technology and innovation, and to embrace more flexible industrial relations pracjust tices in order to compete successfully on the domestic market in competition with imported vehicles and to enhance the industry's position by exporting Australian manufactured cars to markets overseas. The ACIS program encourages new investment and innovation in the automotive sector through the provision of import duty credits to help the transition to a new low-tariff environment. It is important to recognise that the Howard government has provided the automotive industry with certainty in moving towards a low-tariff environment. By contrast, the Labor Party has flip-flopped over recent years on the automotive industry tariff question. Under the Hawke government, the Labor Party took an enlightened approach to the industry. The Labor Party MPs at that time recognised the importance of the future for our domestic automotive sector of moving away from the high-tariff protection of the past to a low-tariff environment. I particularly commend Senator Button for his contribution to that policy debate. Those of us who were sitting opposite at that time supported Senator Button's endeavours. Unfortunately, Labor in opposition have often reverted to a parochial position on tariffs and industry policy, playing to the high-tariff protection prejudices of union leaders like Doug Cameron, who is well known to many in this House. Labor members know the future of our manufacturing sector lies in international market liberalisation, but they try to pretend otherwise to get some union support and win a few union votes. In this regard, I was interested to note that on the day of his election as Labor leader the Leader of the Opposition nominated a renewed emphasis on industry policy. It has never been explained what Labor's new belief in industry policy means-whether it is a return to the bad old days of protectionism: an inward-looking, uncompetitive and unsustainable industry propped up by taxpayers and consumers. Those of us on this side of the House wait with interest to learn of the opposition's policy plans for the manufacturing sector. We hope it will not take the country backwards and we look forward to a more precise position from the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Grayndler on industry policy. Under the ACIS program approximately $2.8 billion of transition assistance was provided to the Australian automotive industry between 2001 and 2005 in the context of a reduction in the automotive industry tariff passenger motor vehicles and automotive components from 15 per cent down to 10 per cent in 2005. That debate on tariff reduction has been very much part of my philosophic stance over many years and I am delighted that now the Australian automotive industry is becoming world competitive in terms of both price and quality. The ACIS program is continuing between 2006 and 2015 with an estimated additional package of $4.2 billion of assistance to encourage the industry to move to a long-term sustainable position with the proposed further tariff reduction to five per cent in That five per cent is basically a negligible tariff level. That position has been the subject of considerable argument. The exchange rate has a much greater impact, as members would be aware, than the tariff itself. Over the full life of the ACIS program to 2015, some $7 billion in assistance will be provided to the automotive sector under the program to help industry move to a viable and internationally competitive position. Under the ACIS program the industry has been able to plan for the future and invest with confidence. I emphasise that point. The success of the government's approach to the automotive industry is demonstrated by the very positive results being achieved by the industry. In 2005-06 Australian automotive exports reached a record value of $5.2 billion. That is a far cry from what the member opposite said-that the manufacturing industry was in decline. The automotive component exports were last year valued at $1.76 billion, and there was $3.44 billion in vehicle exports. Again, this is a far cry from the torical position where the automotive industry was basically designed for the domestic market. Some 126,000 vehicles were exported in 2006 to destinations including the Middle East, the United States, China, South America, South Africa, New Zealand and for South-East Asia. Again, that is a remarkable transformation from what was an inward looking industry. In 2006 our domestic automotive manufacturers exported 38 per cent of local production. This is compared with only seven per cent of local production exported under Labor in 1990. As tariff levels have declined, the Howard government has helped industry compete internationally and export to foreign markets. Holden has recently announced it will be commencing significant new exports later this year to the United States of the Commodore, as the Pontiac G8. The Ford Motor 2010. Company, which is well known to me in Geelong and Broadmeadows, plans to export some of the new versions of its Falcon and Territory models. These developments demonstrate that Australia is becoming a competitive producer of quality motor vehicles under Howard government policies. Nationally, the automotive sector has a turnover of $24 billion and employs 70,000 people-a far cry from the remarks of the member for Grayndler. The sector is much larger than just the four major vehicle producers, with 250 component producers, machine tool producers and service providers. Again, I emphasise the importance of the component producers in the regional city of Geelong, in Melbourne and in Sydney. In this more internationally competitive environment, where the market is much more important to car manufacturers than government programs are, the Howard government support for the automotive industry remains strong. The government has initiated an Automotive Industry Strategic Group to hiswork towards a coordinated effort to access global supply chains and secure more international work for the Australian automotive component sector. Ford Australia has received a $52.5 million grant to develop the next generation of Falcon and to design and engineer a pick-up truck platform for the world market. The government has provided a $6.7 million grant to Holden, matching the funding by the Victorian and South Australian governments, to introduce safety and fuel management improvements and further reduce greenhouse gas emissions from Commodore vehicles. There can be no doubt of the government's commitment to a viable automotive sector. In addition to the ACIS program, which is providing transitional assistance and encouragement for the automotive industry to move to a low-tariff environment, the Howard government has improved competitiveness of the automotive industry through the following fundamental policies. Firstly, there is the lowering of inflation through our policies of strong economic management, thus minimising the rise in domestic input costs. That is a very key component of making our automotive industry competitive internationally. The government has also provided an improved business investment environment by creating conditions of low interest rates, which again is a very important factor for those manufacturing facilities. Finally, there is the introduction of greater flexibility in industrial relations system, which provides significant benefits to our large manufacturers and also to the smaller businesses manufacturing automotive tools and components and those businesses delivering services to the automotive sector. I was recently in the Toyota factory and saw the results of the more flexible approach to industrial relations, and I commend that particular company for the way in which they have organised their workforce and their quality control. That was a standout example of what the manufacturing industry is doing in car production, and I think the changes in industrial relations have helped that quite large workforce adapt to the quality control and delivery of very high-quality vehicles to both the Australian and the international markets. Of course, there has been some indecision and evasion from the opposition over its position on Work Choices reforms and what the Labor Party would do if they were elected to government. It is hard to ascertain exactly what the deputy leader says on industrial relations-whether it be on unfair dismissals, big business or small business. We await the debate this afternoon. There might be some enlightenment on where the Labor Party stands on industrial relations, because it is very hard to understand from the public comments exactly what they have in mind, except to rip up the current legislation. The Labor Party's position on IR should be of great concern to Australians employed in the automotive sector. Even smaller businesses with fewer than 100 employees providing services and components to the automotive sector would be concerned about employing new staff because the Labor Party might restore the unfair dismissal provisions, which they voted against. As the honourable parliamentary secretary at the table, Mr Hunt, knows, the Labor Party voted 44 times the in this parliament against the unfair dismissal legislation. Now the Leader of the Opposition is saying, ‘We might look at it; we might not.' It will be interesting to see where he finally ends up on unfair dismissals. Small business operators know that these provisions have helped to create jobs by giving employers the confidence to employ more people, secure in the knowledge that they can take action against lazy or unruly employees. As the honourable member who is at the table knows-the Hunter Valley has many small businesses-small businesses now know that if they put somebody on and it does not work out they can put somebody else on without parting with about $7,000 because of an unfair dismissal claim. In this context it is important to recognise that more than 240,000 new jobs have been created since the introduction of the Work Choices reforms in March 2006-240,000 more Australians have jobs as a result of the government's policies. These jobs would be at risk if the Labor Party were elected and returned to the old industrial relations laws. In the context of this debate on ACIS-a program providing transitional assistance to the automotive sector to adjust to a low-tariff environment-I wish to make a few comments on other policies that might impact on the sector and the future of manufacturing in Australia; in particular the debate on greenhouse emissions and climate change. Climate change is a topical debate in this House and in the broader community. Climate change radicals, including the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Kingsford-Smith and the member for Grayndler, persist in trying to scare the public on climate change. For years the Labor Party has been talking up radical premonitions of climate ruin and the need for equally radical measures to address climate change, such as emission targets, renewable energy targets and emissions trading schemes. The Labor state governments have even proposed going it alone, introducing emissions trading schemes to win the plaudits of the green movement at the detriment of our industries. Only this last week we have seen an argument about the coal industry erupt in some of the Labor electorates. The Leader of the Greens is saying that the coal industry should be wiped out over the next three years. What a remarkable policy position the Greens have on the coal industry! Over the last week the Leader of the Opposition got himself into some trouble with his climate change policies, which put at risk major industries such as coal. There has been an ongoing debate about this. I notice that the Labor Party have changed their position because of those of its members who have historically represented the coal mining electorates. Labor has not put on the record what the implications of signing the Kyoto protocol would be for Australian industries or the impacts of other related policies, such as increasing the mandatory renewable energy target",72
38,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"Mr Quick)Order! I find that the comments of the honourable member bear little relationship to the Australian automotive industry and the ACIS bill, so I would ask him to come back to the bill under discussion.",76
39,Mr MCARTHUR,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"I was referring to greenhouse emissions. The automotive sector is struggling to adjust to reductions in industry protection with the reduction of tariff levels. It is appropriate to raise the potential impact of the suggested radical new greenhouse taxes on the automotive sector. The National Greenhouse Gas Inventory 2004 reports that the transport sector contributes 13.5 per cent of Australia's net emissions, and transport emissions are one of the strongest sources of emissions growth in Australia. Transport emissions were 24 per cent higher in 2004 than in 1990, and are increasing by 1.5 per cent annually. If the climate change radicals in the Labor Party want to address emissions and want to introduce emissions trading schemes, which effectively represent a tax on industry, then the transport industry must logically be one of the sectors targeted. The unilateral imposition of emissions trading in Australia would put domestic industries and manufactures at a disadvantage. The approach of Labor and the unions to the automotive industry raises some questions. If reductions in tariff protection can have an impact on the profitability of the automotive sector, then what would be the impact of the new emissions taxes on the sector? How would the industry cope with higher energy costs raising the price of manufacturing inputs resulting from emissions trading and higher mandatory renewable energy targets? What impact would that have on the profitability of Ford in Geelong and other manufacturers in Victoria and South Australia? Returning specifically to the amendments introduced in this bill, the purpose of the bill is to amend the ACIS Administration Act 1999 to clarify the Commonwealth's powers to issue an unearned credit liability in circumstances where the ACIS participants have received credits from the government to which they are not entitled. I understand that the need for this amendment has arisen as a result of a recent decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The tribunal's finding limited the Commonwealth's ability to issue unearned credit liability notices to very specific circumstances as under the act. This is a serious matter. Under the ACIS program, credits are paid in advance and audited after to ensure the payments are eligible. As a result of the tribunal's finding there is a risk that ACIS credits could be paid to automotive industry firms without a guarantee that the payments could be recovered later if the audit found that the firm was not eligible for the payments. This circumstance is contrary to the understanding reached between the industry and government when the scheme was established. Unless these amendments are made to the act, the government might need to consider an alternative approach to administration of the ACIS which would see claims for credit fully audited prior to the payment of credits, resulting in untimely delays that would be unacceptable to the industry members eligible for credits. These amendments would assist the smooth and efficient administration of this important industry program. I am pleased to voice my support for the bill in supporting a more competitive and sustainable automotive sector in Australia. I commend the bill and I commend the sentiments of the ACIS program. I put it on the record that I am delighted with the dramatic change that has taken place in the automotive industry. They are now competitive. They are now efficient. I have been an advocate of lower tariffs and the lower tariff regime has brought about this set of circumstances.",76
40,Mr RIPOLL,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"I have great pleasure in rising to speak on the ACIS Administration Amendment (Unearned Credit Liability) Bill 2007. I will start by going through what the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme is. Basically it is an industry assistance scheme for the Australian automotive industry. It is administered by the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources. The responsibility for the program delivery comes under AusIndustry. The scheme commenced on 1 January 2001 and expired in December 2005. It replaced a Labor government scheme, the Button car scheme, previously called the Export Facilitation Scheme. Since then it has been renewed and extended. In fact, in December 2002 the Australian government announced a new assistance package for the automotive industry. Under the package and after the scheduled reduction in January 2005, automotive tariffs are to remain at 10 per cent until January 2010, when they will be reduced to five per cent, and they will remain at least at that level until 2015. The package also includes an extension of the ACIS scheme from January 2006 to December 2015, albeit with some modifications, including a phasing down of assistance between 2011 and 2015. The ACIS program, in short, is massiveit is a huge program. It is a massive scheme. In fact, the Productivity Commission stated: Although assistance to both motor vehicle producers and parts suppliers has declined significantly since the mid-1980s, the automotive industry remains one of the most highly assisted industries in the manufacturing sector. This assistance derives largely from tariffs and tariff concession schemes, particularly the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme (ACIS). ACIS is in fact the single largest government tax concession scheme. It represents a massive proportion of industry assistance, and automotive assistance in itself represents about 38 per cent of all manufacturing budgetary assistance. It is a good thing, and it is certainly something we support. We are supporting the amendment to this bill-it is very necessary-but questions still remain and need to be answered on the outcomes of the scheme and whether the Commonwealth and industry are getting bang for their buck rather than perhaps what is taking place at the moment. The purpose of ACIS is to improve the automotive industry's investment and competitiveness in the lead-up to the planned implementation of free trade under the APEC Bogor goal in 2010. There are a range of firms that are eligible for assistance. Mostly they are motor vehicle producers. There are also automotive components producers, automotive machine tools and tooling producers and automotive service providers. There is a variation in how they are assisted, through either production credits or investment credits on plant, equipment and expenditure on R&D. Duty credits can only be used to offset an import duty liability within the Australian Customs Service, which is in fact what this bill is about-trying to rectify something which was not in the original intent of the bill in the way it was originally set up. As import duty liabilities arise, a holder of a duty credit can use that credit in lieu of cash to meet that particular liability. Duty credits can also be transferred-that is, they can be sold to any other person-but there are restrictions on their use. The offsetting of an eligible import duty liability still remains. What today's amendment to the ACIS Administration Act 1999, and hence the ACIS scheme, does is no doubt necessary and in the best interests of the efficient use of this enormous financial resource set aside for the scheme. However, it is what it is-a minor amendment at the end of the day, a minor amendment to the one and only policy tool that the Howard government has been able to devise to assist the Australian automotive sector. If you took the toolbox of available instruments that the government has, you would see that it is a very large tool but that it is the only tool in its box. The Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources is not bringing before this House a vision. There is no new direction, nothing has been planned and there is no considered strategy for the Australian automotive sector. This simple procedural tinkering at the margins is not what the Australian economy needs, nor is it really what Australian industry needs or, for that matter, what the automotive industry needs. I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak on ACIS and on the broader automotive industry and industry related issues, but at the end of the day, while the amendment is supported by Labor, it is a very small, minor amendment. Labor has for many years now been advocating a much more considered approach, a much more comprehensive whole-ofgovernment approach, to innovation in Australian industry. I do not think anyone would argue that there is no better time than the present to actually get on with that job. The leader of the ALP, Kevin Rudd, has recently articulated a vision for the Australian economy that involves using the great prosperity we currently have through our resources boom to invest in our economic future. That is very important to the economic future of the automotive industry and, more broadly of course, right across industry. While the government's only policy response to lift our productivity has been to introduce ill-advised and unfair labour market reforms, the ALP is thinking much bigger and much smarter. We want to invest in our human and physical capital. We want to invest in our ability to innovate. We want to invest in the future. To do that you have to do it today. Innovation is at the forefront of Labor thinking in finding new solutions and formulas for the Australian automotive industry and for industry. The Labor Party's record on automotive industry policy is actually quite impressive. It was the Hawke-Keating government that made the hard, necessary decisions to break down trade barriers. We just heard from the member for Corangamite, who laments tariff reductions-mind you, tariff reductions supported by his own government, of course, because they are necessary. They are necessary to drive that very important tool, the most important tool that industry has, that is international competitiveness. Without that in your toolbox you cannot compete and you cannot survive. All you can do is rely on tection for some short-term gain, and eventually your industry will collapse. The result of the government not having a focus, not looking at what it ought to be doing, is that the automotive parts industry is struggling. We made the hard decisions on trade barriers, on liberalising capital markets and, yes, on the sensible, measured labour market reforms that were needed at the time. The result was that an industry that was once inward looking is now much more efficient and has endured many decades of competition. It will continue to do so if it becomes more internationally competitive, more focused on the international market and more export oriented, but there is no doubt that it does need assistance from government and some vision in that area. Because of the Hawke-Keating government, the consumers of Australia have been provided with an automotive industry that makes sense and delivers forward for them, an automotive industry that has rationalised its structure and an automotive industry that has improved its methods, its R&D performance and its export focus. The previous speaker talked about some of those improvements and some of those things that happened, and those improvements today can be seen in the sale to the United States of rebadged Commodores, the success of the Ford Territory, the sale to the Middle East of the Holden Statesman and so forth. All those success stories were not built in the last five years or in the last few years; they were actually built on previous Labor plans-on the Button plan, in fact, which no-one really questions. If you look at the Button plan and its rebadging as the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme today, you will find that there is not really a great deal of difference. That in itself is okay; it is okay that the pro- government just picked up Labor's policy and ran with it. The problem that exists today is that they have not adjusted that policy, that they have not looked forward. The policy was fantastic in its day and delivered much for the Australian automotive industry, but I think it needs another review. I think we need to look a little further down the track. What is going to be the policy for the next two decades? We cannot just sit on a policy that was once successful and say, ‘That's enough,' because one thing you can guarantee in life is that a past success does not guarantee a future success. We need to seriously investigate ways to do a better job. Just merely sitting on the policy plans of others is not going to deliver that. It is almost a great irony that while Labor put in the hard yards, the many years of reform not only in the broader economy but also in industry-and it was quite involved, with vision and leadership required to actually deliver those 16 years of economic growth that we enjoy today-and while the government ride that wave of prosperity, the only policy solution they have is called industrial relations. By giving the tools to down wages and making it easier to get rid of people, they think that that is somehow going to deliver greater prosperity, productivity growth, innovation and increased skills. All those things that we actually need will not be delivered just through that one simple tool that this government are using in terms of industrial relations. As I work through this legislation, I also want to mention that the government's other response to the automotive industry was a four-page action plan. It is quite uninspiring and, frankly, does very little. What is even more worrying about this action plan from the government is that it ended in 2002. There has been nothing since. There was very little to inspire us back then, but now there is no action plan at all for the automotive industry. It is as simple as that. It has been five years since the government sat down and actually thought about it and asked: ‘What do we need to continue to make the proper adjustments that we need?' What Labor believes in and what the government ought to be doing is looking at properly investing in skills, in research and development, in human and physical infrastructure. This is what needs to happen, and a myriad of data is there to back that up and prove it. Whenever we raise this data, people say we are talking down the industry or that somehow we are trying to paint a gloomy picture. That is far from the case. Australian industry certainly is doing well, but it can do much better. It certainly needs to do better in the area of emerging technologies and it certainly needs to catch up with the rest of the developed world, particularly the OECD. When the member for Grayndler made his contribution to the debate on this legislation, he talked about some of the very poor and sad figures about where Australia stands on its spending on education and skills. We are at the bottom end of the OECD when we drive should be at the forefront, when we should be leading. Australians have a great heritage and great history of being thinkers, innovators and doers-practical people. Partly because of where we come from, our geography, the tyranny of distance and all those harsh elements of Australia, we have always been able to adjust and be innovative. But you need to support that innovation. If you ask any man or woman in the street, one thing that always concerns them is that all the best ideas that are thought of here in Australia walk their way offshore. We heard from the member for Grayndler about Dr Shi and solar hot water technology. What a great loss to Australia that this technology was actually invented here but was not supported. There were no mechanisms or processes by which he could be assisted to make that happen in Australia, and he had to go back to China to make it happen. I will not go into all the details of that hugely successful story about Dr Shi and the technology, but I lament that great loss to manufacturing in this country. There are a number of challenges for us and it is poignant to raise that in terms of how we spend our money. Because ACIS is such a large scheme, it is very important that we look at how we spend that money and how that gives us a much broader picture. We will hear much talk in this House about the threat of China and India and international competition, that battle for imports into Australia, but those fronts are not quite as they seem on the surface. We tend to consider that the really big threat coming from China is simply cheap labour, that cheap labour will be what makes us come undone because we cannot compete on that front and manufacture as cheaply as they can. Australia still has an advantage, though. We still have some natural advantages with our resources, we are still internationally competitive and we still innovate. We still put some money into R&D, but we are falling behind in R&D. The reality is that while Australia is marching backwards in its spending on research and development, China are increasing their spending year on year by 21 per cent. They have actually understood what is going to make them internationally competitive in the next two decades, and it is not fact that they have cheap labour. That certainly will give them an incredible natural advantage, but what will give them an extra advantage, an extra leg-up over us here in Australia, is that they are now becoming the innovators as well. Imagine the picture in Australia for the manufacturing and automotive industries, and for industry generally. Not only do we have to compete against countries in terms of cheaper labour but suddenly we have to compete in terms of how they innovate. I am referring to how they change processesmanufacturing and management processesand financial industry products. When they start to become competitive and think outside the box, as we have always been known to do, we suddenly lose the last little bit of our natural advantage. We will be left only with resources. Resources are great, and certainly we are now going through a once-in-a-lifetime boom, with the rivers of gold-taxation gold and revenue-that flow into this government. I have to say that I don't know what they are doing with this revenue. Are they keeping it for a rainy day? Shouldn't they be investing it? Isn't that what they do with our taxes? Should they hold onto the money or should they invest it, on our behalf, in education skills, in our children's future, in industry, in the most innovative pathways, emerging technologies and new industries that will deliver the jobs of tomorrow? Is it the government's role to just sit on huge surpluses and say: ‘Look, aren't we great? We've got this big bag of money'? While everything around us is crumbling-infrastructure is crumbling; industries are facing huge challenges globally-the government says, ‘Look, our bag of dollars is getting bigger and bigger.' But it is not doing anything with it. Any mum and dad sitting around the table and doing the budget know the they cannot buy a house by just sitting on a bag of money; they have to borrow and invest. That is the point. This government simply does not understand that aspect. The moral of the story I am telling today in the chamber is a simple one. It would have been great if the minister had been here to hear it. The small, minor change contained in the bill that is before us is simple and straightforward. Labor supports that change; there is no question about that. It is something that needs to happen. But that is it; that is the end of it. There is just one small, minor administrative change to ACIS-the single biggest scheme from the government in terms of supporting the automotive industry-but there is nothing else. I think that in itself speaks volumes about the devastating figures that we have before us regarding where manufacturing is going. If we look at some of the data, we see that manufacturing output has actually shrunk. No matter what the government says, output has shrunk; productivity has shrunk. So our capacity to grow is shrinking. While the numbers may vary, it is the growth figures that I think are the most important. There is also a very sad side in terms of lost manufacturing jobs. Since 1996, 110,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost. That is sad. What is being done, though? I know that a lot of people who lose their jobs in traditional manufacturing areas, if they are skilled up, retrained, if there are packages in place for them, will go on to bigger and better They will go on to other industries-new, emerging industries. It is a matter of taking old industries and making them new again. So there is potential for them, but the government does not do that. This is not a government that looks forward; it is a government that reacts to what has happened in the past. Not only has it reacted by introducing ACIS, which rebadges a very good Labor program; it has also reacted in a backward fashion. It waits for people to be displaced from industry before it moves forward to do something for them. In my book, that is a little too late. It is a little too late, when somebody loses their job in manufacturing, to decide to give them some sort of assistance package to try and retrain them. It would be much cleverer if the government had packages in place that looked to the future to see where those new, emerging technologies, jobs and industries will be. There are a whole range of sad figures, and I will not go through all of them. There are some good figures and some bad figures. Obviously, there are niche markets and areas where Australia does incredibly well. There are stories out of Victoria of a components manufacturer that once used to provide a bulk, generic type spring for a vehicle and decided that there was a great niche market for a high-performance, innovative product. It did that and now supplies a global market-Mercedes-Benz and other highperformance car manufacturers-with some great products. In the short time remaining to me, I want to raise a couple of other points. With respect to the automotive industry, the action agendas-things that the government puts on paper that it wants to do-ended in 2002. In the five years since, there has been nothing. I assume it is no longer interested. There is no action agenda for the broad industry sector either. There is no action agenda for manujobs. facturing. There is no action agenda for emerging industries. There is no action agenda for emerging technologies. Where is the government? Is it just looking backwards again? Obviously it is, because there is nothing in its own documents and papers to suggest that it is in any way interested about the future of the automotive industry or industry more broadly. It just looks to the past. It sits on its rear and hopes that, with a strong economy, driven by a resources boom which it has had nothing to do with, it can skate home and ride the wave of economic fortune. (Time expired)",77
41,Mr BALDWIN,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"PatersonParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources) (1.57 pm)-I say to the three members who have spoken in the debate on the ACIS Administration Amendment (Unearned Credit Liability) Bill 2007-the member for Grayndler, the member for Corangamite and the member for Oxley-that we do appreciate their contributions. In relation to the most recent contribution, that of the member for Oxley, I say to him that perhaps he has been reading his own press releases and speeches for far too long and he has not actually taken a lesson in reality. This government developed the action agendas on, and is working in, advanced manufacturing and tooling, and is progressing in the areas of the aviation industry and the motor industry. There is a lot to go forward. The whole idea is that the government works with industry but that industry takes a leadership role, because industry understands and knows the solutions. The action agendas are designed for industry to have its say to government and then for government to have the opportunity to enact the recommendations that come out of the action agendas. Today, we are talking about ACIS, involving the automotive industry. There are some key points for consideration, and I will come back to the comments by others in a little while. One of the key points is that this is exciting industry-an industry that has gone through remarkable change. It is an industry that is renowned world wide for its innovation; it is renowned for the quality of standards and, in particular, for expertise in de- dustry. sign and engineering. I want to give the House a level of understanding of this issue, which is perhaps highlighted by General Motors-Holden's recently announced export deal. They will be sending Commodores to the USA, badged as the Pontiac G8. This shows that Australia can compete in an international environment. Americans in particular are very fussy about their motor vehicles. Our motor vehicle sector has achieved a lot. It employs more than 70,000 people, has a turnover of nearly $24 billion, comprises four major motor vehicle producers and more than 250 component producers, machine tool producers and service providers. The ACIS provides assistance for research and development and is intended to assist investment in these areas in order to achieve further international competitiveness. It amazing sector that has gone through the ups and downs of industry, but a sector which has still achieved export volumes of $5.2 billion in 2005-06-a record figure. In 2006, around 126,000 vehicles were exported to the Middle East, the United States, China, South America, South Africa, New Zealand and South-East Asia. As I said, last week Holden announced it would commence significant new exports to the United States from the fourth quarter of this year. Those exports are likely to be 30,000 units per annum, and possibly more. Ford will be producing new versions of its Falcon and Territory models, and has indicated some will be for export. Toyota has an excellent record in export; it is our leading exporter, primarily to the Middle East. The component an sector is also performing well within its export performance arrangements. All of these factors are essential if we are to have a strong domestic industry. The export industry is the cream on the top of our domestic inI listened with amazement to the comments by the member for Oxley. He talked about how it was Labor that got rid of the tariffs that built the viability of this industry. Unfortunately for the member for Oxley, he has not been here for the same period of time that I have. He does not seem to remember his colleagues voting against all of the tariff reductions this government put into place to enhance industry in particular and its competitiveness. He talks about investment; he wants to talk like a drunken sailor spending. Ninetysix billion dollars was the black hole this government was left with. He wants to talk about increasing taxes so that the government has a bigger cash bag to spend as it sees fit. The best people to understand spending are those who pay the taxes. They do not is an mind their taxes being invested in a wise manner that returns the benefit to them or to Australia, but they do have concerns when they are used to ramp up spending and then go into an era where spending gets out of control-in particular, in the last year of the Labor government we were left with a $10 billion black hole, which accounted for roughly 10 per cent of the $96 billion worth of debt. I contrast that to the comments by the member for Corangamite, who made a good contribution. He has been true and steadfast to this motor industry, predominantly because he has the Ford motor vehicle company in his electorate. The member for Corangamite could see the future and knew that, by reforming not only industrial relations, which he mentioned, but also reducing the tariffs agendas, it would provide a more competitive industry and would lead to a higher quality built product in Australia. He understands the industry. The one who amazes me is the member for Grayndler. He gives the appearance of being a smart fellow, but his speech changed that interpretation. People like the member for Grayndler will continue to grandstand on false figures. It is this government, the ard government, which is working hard to build a sustainable future for the Australian manufacturing industry. Its industry and workplace reforms have provided a sound economic framework, allowing industry to grow and adapt to a changing global market. As we heard the member for Corangamite say, ‘240,000 jobs have been created since the introduction of Work Choices.' This is about reform. It is not about words written on paper; it is about affirmative action taken by government that delivers real results. The member for Grayndler talked about a lack of investment. I would say to him we are investing more than $7 billion in the automotive industry, plus another $1.4 billion in the textile, clothing and footwear sector, which he also mentioned, through our long-term industry plans. It is within this positive economic climate that Australia's manufacturing sector is achieving some impressive results. Manufacturing industry value added in 2005-06 was $96 billion in real terms, representing 10.4 per cent of GDP. That is sourced from the ABS national accounts figures. Our total manufactured exports on an industry basis rose by $11.4 billion in the 2006 calendar year to reach a record $83.1 billion. The source of that data was the ABS publication on international trade in goods and services. Over that same period exports of elaborately transformed manufactures, or ETMs, rose by nearly $1.4 billion to reach $27.4 billion. The source of that information is the DFAT STARS database. In fact, private new capital expenditure by the manufacturing sector was also at an all-time high last year, as sourced from the ABS publication Business indicators. It makes a furphy of what those opposite have said: that we have driven back investment, that we have driven back jobs, that we Howhave denied industry investment. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we have created the framework, we have made the investment and, in parallel with that, industry has made the development. In fact in 200405 research and development in the manufacturing sector represented almost 41 per cent of Australia's total business expenditure on research and development, with total expenditure increasing by 3.8 per cent to a record of almost $3.5 billion. The source of that data is again the ABS, in its publication on research and experimental development in businesses. The government is working with industry, the government is creating jobs, the government is attracting investment. This bill, ACIS Administration Amendment (Unearned Credit Liability) Bill 2007 is part and parcel of that. The government has been providing significant support to the industry through the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme-ACIS. ACIS is a transitional assistance scheme which encourages the industry to become internationally competitive through investing in its own future at a time of phased tariff reductions. Through these arrangements, the government has provided the automotive industry with a decade of certainty. The participants in ACIS number about 250, and they include the four motor vehicle producers and the automotive component producers, automotive toolmakers and automotive service providers. ACIS will deliver assistance to participants through the issue of duty credits and will provide over $4 billion in assistance during the period 2006-2015. This will be of great benefit to the 70,000 employees who work in this industry. Assistance is provided up-front-that is, duty credits will be issued on receipt of quarterly claims from registered ACIS participants. A subsequent audit process will ensure that claims are legitimate and eligible expenditure. If items of ineligible expenditure or other areas are identified in unearned credit liability, it will be issued to the participant and offset against their future ACIS credits. A recent decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has important implications for the Commonwealth's ability to issue UCLs under the ACIS Act other than in a very limited range of circumstances. That decision has raised the prospect that the eligibility of claims from participants may have to be fully assessed prior to any credits being issued, and that will create more red tape for industry. This government is about reducing red tape for industry. It would be unacceptable from a financial management perspective for the Commonwealth to issue credits unless it is certain that it has the ability to recoup any issued credits to which a participant is subsequently found to be not entitled. The up-front assessment of all claims would result in lengthy delays in the issue of duty credits, which could impose significant financial hardship on members of the automotive industry. The industry has long accepted that issuing credit up-front, and then issuing UCLs should ineligible expenditure be identified, is the best way for them to receive credits in a timely manner. The Commonwealth is keen to ensure that that approach continues. This bill will confirm the Commonwealth's ability to issue UCLs. It will ensure that industry can continue to receive credits as soon as practicable after they submit their quarterly returns, and it will ensure that the ACIS scheme can continue to be administered in the manner agreed by all parties when it was established. In summary, the amendments being debated are designed solely to restore to the Commonwealth the power to administer the ACIS scheme in a manner that best meets the needs of the Australian automotive industry. As I said, members opposite need to take a reality check when they look at industry, which is becoming more competitive and needs red tape to be cut. This bill is a part of that process. I commend the bill to the House and I urge members opposite to support it. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",82

43,Ms ROXON,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"It gives me great pleasure to be speaking today on the Aged Care Amendment (Security and Protection) Bill 2007. In fact this is the first opportunity for me to address this House on aged care since taking on my portfolio responsibilities for health, so standing here representing my colleague Senator MCLucas on this matter is a great honour. We are dealing with a very problematic issue within the community-that is, the abuse of elderly residents in aged care facilities. This bill is the government's response to some particularly appalling allegations of abuse which you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I am sure others in the House would remember came to light in February last year. Members may recall a program that ran on Lateline on ABC TV on 20 February 2006. The story revealed by the family of an aged care resident was about the abuse of their grandmother in an aged care facility. The claim was of the alleged rape of an elderly Victorian woman in a specialist dementia unit. This story offended each and every Australian and was certainly a very confronting issue for many people to address. Further allegations of a less serious but equally offensive nature were also discussed. They included the allegation that an elderly woman was squirted in the face with a water bottle by a so-called care provider. This apparently happened at least three times. Unfortunately these are not isolated cases. When we debate this very serious issue, and we do not want to downplay the importance of it, we should also rush to add that the vast majority of aged care providers in our community do a fantastic job and that the vast majority of aged care nurses and those who care for the frail and vulnerable are amongst the most compassionate people and staff that we could find in many areas within our communities. But these instances do occur and, unfortunately, they are not isolated. These stories of abuse, sadly, occur far more often than we think. Questions at Senate estimates hearings reveal that, from July 2006 to date, there were 29 allegations of abuse in aged care facilities, of which seven have resulted in charges being laid. That is not a large number, but obviously we need to do and want to do anything we can to make that number zero. This legislation is part of the government's response to these and other reported events. While Labor will support the legislation, our view is that it is but a small part of what is needed to tackle the abuse of older people in Australia, not just within aged care facilities but more broadly within the community. This bill does not deal with any of the issues of abuse of elderly people in the community. The key elements of the bill are: the requirement for compulsory reporting; the protection of those who report; the establishment of ‘investigation principles' by regulation; and significant changes to the aged care complaints process. Staff members will now be required to report assaults. They can report to the approved provider or an approved provider's key personnel, to the police, directly to the secretary of the department or to another person authorised by the approved provider to receive reports of suspected reportable assaults. The particular subsection, 96-3(2), describes the matters that may be included in the way complaints are resolved, and section 63-1AA actually deals with responsibilities relating to alleged and suspected assaults. The section sets out the responsibilities of an approved provider of residential care in relation to an allegation or suspicion and defines what a reportable assault is. It includes unlawful sexual conduct, unreasonable use of force or assaults specified in the accountability principles, and there are a number of other matters. Under this legislation, although this is stituting a process for compulsory reporting, approved providers are afforded with some discretion not to report some allegations of suspicions of sexual or physical abuse. In these cases covered by the investigation principles, all three of the following circumstances must exist in order for the providers to be given the discretion not to report. Firstly, the approved provider must have reasonable grounds for believing that the offender is a resident; secondly, a medical diagnosis must have been made of the mental impairment of the offender; and, thirdly, there must be a behaviour management plan in place for the suspected offenders. These protections are there, no doubt, as many in this House would know, because a number of sad instances do happen between residents, particularly when you have residents affected significantly by dementia. This regime is designed to protect the elderly people in aged care facilities from abuse at the hands of their carers and others who are running these facilities. It cannot and does not hope to deal with all the issues that occur between residents. Obviously, any assaults and other serious matters will still be reportAs able and there is nothing in any way which suggests that these sorts of incidents should not be reported. It merely provides the providers with an opportunity and a discretion not to report where some very tight circumstances and conditions are met and where it would not be in anyone's interests necessarily to pursue this course of action. Where an allegation or suspicion of physical or sexual abuse is made to an approved provider, the provider is responsible for reporting that legation or suspicion to the police within 24 hours and also to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing. A very important change as part of this bill is to make sure that, if you are going to inhave a regime of reporting, you protect those who actually make a report. The legislation requires that staff members who make disclosures must have their identities protected and must not be criticised for having made those reports. Further, it protects the people who have made the disclosure from civil and criminal liability. This is an essential element of the legislation. Too often in the past, aged care workers who have made reports concerning suspicions of sexual or physical abuse have themselves been ostracised in their working environments. Again, on the Lateline program that we saw early last year an unnamed aged care worker said, in relation to the elder abuse story in a specialist dementia unit in Victoria: In the facility, in this particular facility, it was starting to happen before I left more and more and you feel you have-you can't do anything. You have no recourse to say anything. Because if you do say anything, you are then bullied by management, from right up, the head office right the way down. You have no recourse. There is nowhere-you put in reports and say that this is happening. Nothing is ever done. It disappears never to be seen again. part of this proposal it is vitally important not just to protect people who do make a report but also to protect the identity of anyone who makes the report. There is a specific provision in the act, section 96-8(7), which specifies how a person should be treated and methods that should be used to ensure that the person's identity is not given. Identity can only be provided where it is necessary to one or more of the following: a police officer with responsibility relating to the area, inal- cluding the place where the assault is suspected to have occurred; the secretary of the department; and a person, authority or court to which the approved provider is required by law to disclose the fact. Obviously this is important. It means that a person is protected from having their information passed on to other staff, to family members, or perhaps to a range of other people who may have some vested interest in playing havoc with the fact that a report has been made. This is similar to the protections that are provided in many other circumstances when people report offences, to make sure that they are not going to be victimised for bringing the proper attention of the authorities to somebody who is alleged to have committed a terrible offence. The third element of this bill relates to the provision of ‘Investigation Principles' by regulation. These principles will provide guidance for which matters are to be investigated, how investigations are to be conducted, considerations in making decisions relating to investigations and procedures for reconsideration or examination of decisions relating to investigations. This is a significant change to the way complaints about aged care will be dealt with. Many complaints about the current system focus on the frustration caused by the current requirement for complaints to reach a mediated resolution. This has not always proven to be possible or necessarily to be the best way to deal with these matters. For example, Advocacy Tasmania in its evidence to the Senate inquiry into aged care, which was tabled in June 2005, said: ... you cannot mediate about some things. It depends on the actual incident that has happened ... Mediation is fine if there has been some behaviour ... someone being nasty. Ideally it should be recognised that that did happen and there should be some acknowledgement of the fact that it happened ... mediation is not always satisfactory, and unless people are supported it can be extremely intimidating.” So this system should improve on that situation. The new Office of Aged Care Quality and Compliance will have the power to investigate all complaints. In the case of a breach the office will have the power to require the approved provider to remedy the situation and apply sanctions if necessary. The fourth element contained in this bill is the insertion of a new part 6.6 into the act and concerns the Aged Care Commissioner. The Aged Care Commissioner will replace the existing Commissioner for Complaints and will have the powers to investigate complaints arising from the actions taken by the new Office for Aged Care Quality and Compliance with regard to investigations and conduct of the office. The commissioner will also examine certain decisions and complaints made by the office and make recommendations accordingly. The commissioner will examine complaints about the conduct of an accreditation body or the conduct of a person carrying out an audit or making a support contact under the accreditation grant principles. The commissioner may make recommendations to the accreditation body arising from the examination but will not examine a complaint about the merits of a decision under these principles. It may all sound like a fairly technical process with the number of new offices, but I think in this area it is really important to get good procedures in place, and this is the government's attempt to do that. These technical changes will hopefully make a difference to the safety and security of people who are in our aged-care facilities and also to the comfort and confidence of families that their loved ones are being treated appropriately. The commissioner-and I think this is quite an important addition-will also have the capacity to undertake ‘own motion' reviews. The commissioner will advise the minister, at the minister's request, about any matters that arise from examinations. While there is some flexibility in the terms of the commissioner's functions, the bill also ensures there is appropriate parliamentary scrutiny of any additional functions that might be proposed in the future. The commissioner will have some discretion not to deal with a complaint when a complaint is deemed to be frivolous or vexatious, or was not made in good faith because it was already being reviewed by a court or tribunal. I turn now from the key elements of the bill to the financial impact of these changes. It is important for the House to note the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum, because it is staggeringly brief. It baldly states: The new initiatives that are implemented through this Bill are part of a $90.2 million … package of reforms aimed at further safeguarding older people in Australian Government-subsidised aged care from sexual and serious physical assault. But these words in no way indicate what the financial impact of this legislation will actually be. Deputy Speaker Jenkins has been in this place a lot longer than me and probably remembers when financial impact statements were introduced-he may not go quite that far back; I am certainly not trying to cause any offence to the Deputy Speaker! They were introduced by the Hawke government, by the then finance minister, John Dawkins, who set out the need for governments or parliaments to tell the community what action they are taking, why they are taking it and how much money they are going to spend on it. He said at the time that the government was ‘taking this action on financial impact statements because it believes the community has the right to know the financial and economic effect of government policies and programs and that this reform would give tangible effect to this belief'. Unfortunately, if Mr Dawkins were here today to read the financial impact statement for this bill, I think he would be very disappointed. Labor put that framework in place for sound financial management, but the Howard government is now thumbing its nose at it-quite regularly, I might say, but particularly in relation to this bill. It is far from adequate, but it is not that surprising given the lack of respect that the Minister for Ageing-not to mention the Minister for Health and Ageing in this chamber-has traditionally shown for parliamentary processes and scrutiny. I would have thought that the department in particular would be desperate not to have this bill go forward with such a flippant explanation of its financial impact and so little opportunity to understand what it includes. The community, of course, have a right to know how much is being expended and on what. I also want to draw the House's attention to the issue of timing in relation to this bill. The issue of timing has been a regular problem for the Minister for Ageing. He announced that the government would introduce this legislation in July last year, with a start-up date of 1 April 2007. But it is not as though the legislation was available in July last year; that might have given people some time to think about it! He seems to have forgotten the need for what is perhaps just of passing interest to a minister: the legislation needs to pass through the houses of parliament to come into effect. Having only introduced the bill on Thursday and wanting it debated today, with no opportunity for feedback from the community, the minister seems to have taken it for granted that the parliament will pass whatever the government wants and in whatever time frame it wants. He does not seem to believe that the parliament has a proper right to be involved in this process and the community has a right to understand the proposals. Although these concerns have been around for a long time-these issues have been raised regularly and the government could have acted much more quickly in responding to them-the government took their time to take any action. But now that they have taken action they are determined to rush the legislation through, to the point that the bill had not actually been introduced into this House when our shadow minister in the other place was asked to sign on to a Senate committee reviewing the bill, a bill that she had not even been paid the courtesy of being shown. She was asked to agree to a timetable for consultation through the Senate review process when the bill had not even been provided to her. This is a ridiculous way to run a government. Unfortunately, we are seeing it more and more now that the government has the numbers in both this House and the Senate. The Senate has set a reporting date of 1 March 2007 for the committee reviewing this bill, a very short time frame-one that the government pushed through and expected Labor to agree to even though the bill had not been shown to the shadow minister. On what basis does the government think that people will make a decision if they do not even get to see the legislation before they expected to agree to it? Then, last Thursday, the bill was tabled in the House of Representatives and, of course, long before any opportunity for feedback or response, changes were able to be made in the Senate. We have come to expect this from the Minister for Ageing: on 21 December 2006, just four days before Christmas, this minister tabled a series of delegated struments which were to have immediate effect and of which he had not given the aged-care sector any notice at all. I am not sure how the minister thinks the aged-care sector can actually deal with these sorts of issues when they are given no notice of changes and things are rushed through several days before Christmas. As I mentioned, the bill has now been sent to a Senate committee legislation inquiry through which we will ascertain the workability of a number of these proposals. In particular, Labor senators will need a clarification of the discretion not to report; the definition of ‘mental impairment', including the evidence needed to establish it; the process for establishing existing resident diagnosis; and the actual cost of the changes. Labor flags here that, as a result of the Senate inquiry, it may become apparent that amendments are needed to technical aspects of the bill. In conclusion, while these measures are welcome and Labor supports the bill, the process for the bill is not welcome. The bill has been rushed into the parliament. The shadow minister was not even paid the courtesy of being shown the bill before the government recommended it go to a Senate legislation inquiry. The ‘Investigation Principles' that support this bill are still in draft form and have not even been sighted; they are being implemented two years after a Senate inquiry. We are still being forced to rush the bill through the House even though are the government dragged its feet for two years on this vital issue of protecting people in aged-care facilities from serious abuse. It is about time that the government took this seriously and worked with the community to deal with these shocking and appalling reports of how some older Australians have been treated, in limited circumstances, in aged-care facilities. We need to make sure in- that steps are also taken to deal with the abuse of older people outside aged-care facilities.",86

45,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," Mr Speaker, I inform the House that I will be absent from question time tomorrow as I will be in New Zealand to attend the annual trans-Tasman prime ministerial talks. The Deputy Prime Minister, who will act as Prime Minister during my absence abroad, will answer questions on my behalf. NA",91
46,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's rejection of the bipartisan US BakerHamilton strategy recommending a staged withdrawal of US forces to pressure the Iraqis to negotiate a political settlement between the Sunni and the Shia. Why does the Prime Minister reject a strategy that his own Minister for Foreign Affairs greeted as a good piece of work and one that drew all the right conclusions?,91
47,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As usual the Leader of the Opposition is misrepresenting not only what I say but also what the Minister for Foreign Affairs says. Let me go to the BakerHamilton report. Let me read to the House an excerpt from the Baker-Hamilton report. On page 37 it states: A premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. Let me repeat that: Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return. Those words are very close to the words of the national security estimate, which no doubt the Leader of the Opposition has read, in which it said amongst other things: If Coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this Estimate, we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq, intensify Sunni resistance to the Iraqi Government, and have adverse consequences for national reconciliation. Iraq It went on to say: If such a rapid withdrawal were to take place, we judge that the ISFIraqi Security Forceswould be unlikely to survive as a non-sectarian national institution; neighboring countriesinvited by Iraqi factions or unilaterally-might intervene openly in the conflict ... and it goes on in similar vein. When challenged to state his own view as to the consequences of an American withdrawal by March 2008, the Leader of the Opposition has sought refuge in cherry picking BakerHamilton. That is what he has sought to do. The Leader of the Opposition has sought refuge in cherry picking Baker-Hamilton and he has ignored the conditionality of the proposition put in Baker-Hamilton. He has completely ignored the assessment that if there were a premature withdrawal in Iraq by the American forces there would be the consequences that have been outlined. The most that the Leader of the Opposition would say this morning on AM when he was asked about the consequences of an to the American defeat or withdrawal in circumstances of defeat was: it would be bad. The sum total of the Leader of the Opposition's assessment of the consequences of an American withdrawal in circumstances depicted as defeat is that it would be bad. That is the one word: it would be ‘bad'. I think it would be worse than that. It would represent a catastrophe for the West. It would have serious security implications for this country. A humiliated, weakened America after a withdrawal from Iraq depicted as a defeat would be bad news for the world and it would be bad news for the security of Australia.",91
48,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of international attitudes on the future of Iraq? Is the minister aware of views which could imperil Iraq's future?,92
49,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First, I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. I have been in Munich at the security conference there and I had the opportunity to talk with US Defense Secretary Gates, several United States Republican and Democrat members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the German foreign minister and the defence minister, the Pakistani foreign minister, the NATO Secretary General and the Swedish foreign minister. I also went to Ankara and met with the president, the foreign minister and the speaker of their parliament, who, Mr Speaker, sent his best wishes to you-I believe you are acquainted. The point is, in relation to the honourable member for Boothby's question, that of course this list of people-and there were others-have a variety of different views over whether it was right or wrong to throw Saddam Hussein out of office. But they are all united on one point-that is, a precipitate withdrawal from Iraq would be disastrous. It would be a victory for terrorists. It could draw neighbouring countries, such as Iran, Saudi Arabia and possibly even Turkey, into the conflict. It would destabilise the Middle East as a whole. It would have disastrous consequences in the war against terrorism. It would embolden terrorists around the world and bring terrorism closer to Western countries. But, ultimately, it would also be a human disaster for the people of Iraq. They are suffering enough.",92

51,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Labor members interIraq ject, ‘What about now?' They are suffering enough already. Why is it that the Leader of the Opposition would wish them to suffer more by the precipitate withdrawal of American troops? As the Prime Minister has pointed out, when the Leader of the Opposition-and before he was Leader of the Opposition, by the way, when he was the spokesman on foreign affairs-is asked, ‘What would be the consequences of an American withdrawal?' he always ducks the question. On 17 October he was asked that question eight times and he decided it was not convenient to answer that question. Of course I know while I have been away he has been asked that question and has continued to duck it. He came up with this thought bubble that he might quote the Iraq Study Group, and so he ran that line. He would not answer the questionMs Plibersek-What's your exit strategy?",92
52,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sydney is warned!,92
53,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"except for some blather on the Iraq Study Group, which is, to say the least, cherry picking, selective quoting and deeply misleading. The Iraq Study Group has been quoted by the Prime Minister, but it also said: The point is not for the United States to set timetables or deadlines for withdrawal, an approach ... we oppose. That is what the Iraq Study Group said. Labor members obviously have not read the report of the Iraq Study Group. There is no doubt about it: the international community believes it would be a mistake for America to withdraw precipitously and the Leader of the Opposition happens to think the reverse. The opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, the member for Barton, said, when President Bush announced the surge, that Labor was opposed to the surge. Mr MCClelland-Dead right!",92
54,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, he says. But the Iraq Study Group said that it could support a surge. So the Labor Party says it supports the Iraq Study Group; the Iraq Study Group said ‘we could ... support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilise Baghdad'. So when the Labor Party, in particular the Leader of the Opposition, desperately trying to find populist positions, starts flailing around on a national security issue, he is exposed, as he has always been exposed on national security issues, for being an opportunist and not a deep policy thinker.

78,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Our strategy, in cooperation with our coalition partners, is to build the circumstances where the Iraqi security forces are able to provide a reasonable level of security in that country on their own so that the people of Iraq may be able to enjoy the democracy that they have on three occasions, in the face of the most fearful intimidation, voted to embrace. Those of us in this nation who have only ever enjoyed peaceful democracy should be in awe of the courage of 10 million Iraqis who, in the face of the most terrible intimidation, have voted to embrace a democratic future. That is our goal. Another goal that we have is to avoid the consequences of a premature withdrawal. The consequences of a premature withdrawal have been pointed out by Baker-HamiltonMr Burke- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 104. The Prime Minister missed the word ‘exit'.",94
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Watson will resume his seat and I will rule on his point of order. I have been listening carefully to the Prime Minister and he is entirely in order.,95
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Part of our goal is to avoid the disastrous consequences of a premature withdrawal from Iraq-as described by Baker-Hamilton, as described by the national intelligence assessment and as described by General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was here in Canberra only two days ago. This is what he had to say: I think that if coalition troops pull out prematurely then we will then have a humanitarian asterA humanitarian disaster! That is what the opposition want to happen in Iraq-a humanitarian disasterbecause you will have sectarian violence that get out of hand. You will have then many more Iraqis who are killed and you will have then, I believe, a spillover effect into Afghanistan. So our strategy is to create the circumstances of stability by staying until the job is done so that the Iraqi security forces can look after the security of that country without foreign assistance. And our strategy is also to avoid a precipitous withdrawal and a withdrawal of American forces in circumstances depicted as defeat. I say again-and I say it very deliberately to the Leader of the Opposition-that if out of Iraq America retreats in circumstances of defeat and humiliation, the consequences will be enormous not only in the Middle East and for Iraq but around the world, including for the long-term security interests of our nation. Water",95
81,Mr SECKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister explain to the House why a national approach to water management in the Murray-Darling Basin is important for regional Australia and especially for my electorate of Barker?,95
82,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Barker for this question. To specifically answer the question, the member for Barker need look no further than the fact that, until Melbourne Cup day last year, the states had not done any contingency planning at all for supplying water to the communities across the lower Murray-Darling Basin, particularly in the electorate of Barker, given the extreme circumstances as far as those water supplies dis- were concerned. It took a meeting convened by the Prime Minister to address the issue and put in place those contingency plans. It took the federal government's announcement of a $10 billion investment to secure those will water supplies into the future and take a national approach to what is a significant issue. The member for Barker knows only too well the track record of our government in securing water supplies in his electorate. We have made significant contributions to piping the Loxton irrigation system which have addressed a couple of issues: water security and salinity. It is very important to recognise our government's commitment. We have continually tried to improve the circumstances of industry and communities alike throughout the Murray-Darling Basin system. We have heard comments today from the National Farmers Federation supporting our National Plan for Water Security. We welcome that support. The farming community have been calling for this sort of investment for quite some time. They have been calling for a recognition of what needs to be done to improve the circumstances of the system. To them, this $10 billion investment represents an acceleration of the National Water Initiative, something they have been consistently calling for. This morning, along with the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, I met with representatives of the National Farmers Federation and also with an expert based group of representatives from the irrigation industry to discuss the implementation and the way forward with this plan. They are all committed to seeing the investment taken across a number of states in this system to generate more water-to save that water that we have indicated can be saved with the $10 billion investment. They want the federal government to get on with it. They want to be involved in this process and in the technical development of the scheme, and we welcome that commitment from the industry. It is important to note that we need to implement this plan and we need the states to agree that this plan needs to be implemented. The Prime Minister has made abundantly clear to the states our view of how this structure should work, and this decision should be taken in the national interest. That is the attitude of the National Farmers Federation. That is the attitude of the irrigators in industry that operate right throughout the basin towards this plan. It is time that the state governments also took that approach and started thinking about the communities, thinking about the industry and thinking about the jobs that rely on water security throughout the basin and beyond that can benefit from the implementation of this plan. They should understand that water security equals job security, and just at the moment in regional Australia there is no greater imperative to dealing with some of these issues than securing job security into the future. NA",95
83,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon visitors from the Swedish regional ambassadors meeting. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Iraq",96
84,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister, on Iraq. Given that the mission statement of our troops in Iraq has been first to find weapons of mass destruction, then to secure a regime change, then to protect Japanese troops and then to perform security overwatch, given these changes, will the Prime Minister precisely define for the parliament what is the current mission statement of our troops in Iraq and what reasonable, precise benchmarks have been set in terms of the numbers of Iraqi forces which need to be trained?",96
85,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have already indicated in answer to the last question what, to use the Leader of the Opposition's expression, mission statement. In an earlier question it was ‘exit strategy'. I think, ‘mission statement', is a better term to use. It is a rather more hopeful expression, and I am into hope; I am not into surrenders-so I think it is a rather more hopeful expression. I noticed this morning on radio that the Leader of the Opposition was sort of saying, ‘Oh, well, we only have this number of people.' Yes, we only have just under 1,500. They are making a wonderful contribution in a very difficult situation, and it ill behoves the Leader of the Opposition to give any credence to the proposition that our contribution is inadequate. But what we want is a situation where the Iraqis can reasonably provide for their own security. They plainly cannot do that at the present time, and all the intelligence assessments suggest that. It stands to reason that if participants in the coalition from the very beginning-and that includes Australiastart nominating so-called exit dates, it will only encourage those who want to prevent the Iraqis being in a position to look after themselves to continue the mayhem and maintain the chaos, maintain the sectarian strife and the sectarian violence in the full knowledge that, eventually, nations having nominated an exit date will give fulfilment to that prediction. It seems to me to be an elementary exercise in common sense that when a nation that was in the coalition from the beginning stands up and says, ‘We want to be out by X month in X year,' those who are opposed to our interests are going to say, ‘All we've got to do is keep the mayhem going until that particular date and then we know we've got them.' That was really, in a sense, the starting point of some observations that I made at the weekend. I think it is very unwise in the extreme, if you are interested in a strategy that produces a positive result for the people of Iraq, to be nominating the benchmarks that the Leader of the Opposition is calling for. And he knows that. Part of the Leader of the Opposition's dilemma in this matter is that in his heart he knows what I say is right about the consequences of a precipitate coalition withdrawal. He must understand that if the coalition leaves before the Iraqis are able to look after themselves, the place will descend into greater conflict and into total civil war, and the consequences of that will be enormous. I say again to the Leader of the Opposition: our position has been clear. Our position has been forthright. We know it is not popular with a lot of Australians. We know it is not popular with the opposition-but at least we have the courage to state our position. At least we have the courage to state it and argue it. But all the Leader of the Opposition can do in response to my challenge is to go on radio this morning and try and cherry pick the Baker-Hamilton report and, when he is finally confronted on the third or fourth occasion with a question about the consequences of an American defeat in Iraq, he says, ‘Oh, it would be bad.' It would be more than bad, let me say to the Leader of the Opposition. It would be, to use one of his expressions, a ‘rolled gold' catastrophe for the security interests of our own nation. Economy",96
86,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline to the House the recommendations of the OECD's report Going for growth? Are there alternative models for the economy?,97
87,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. Overnight, the OECD released Economic policy reforms: going for growth 2007, which made recommendations for all of its members, including Australia. The OECD recommended five reforms that it believed would enhance growth and productivity in the Australian economy. The first was to ‘reform disability benefit schemes'. Mr Speaker, you would know that the government has been attending to this, against the opposition of the Labor Party-alas!over the last couple of years. The second thing the OECD recommended was to ‘improve upper-secondary education attainments'. You would know, Mr Speaker, that it is a focus on this that has the government to introduce the Australian technical colleges and, indeed, to push standards under a national curriculum, because the secondary education system is mostly run by the states. The third recommendation was to ‘strengthen competition in network industries', such as electricity and telecommunications. Again, the government is focusing on this with the Australian energy market, which the Commonwealth has been leading at the national level. The OECD recommended that withdrawal rates for means-tested benefits be lessened, and of course the government has been putting this in place over successive budgets, reducing withdrawal rates on pensions, on family payments, on Newstart allowance and on other payments. The fifth thing which the OECD recommended was a phase-out or rationalisation of the award system, and members of the House will know that the Work Choices legislation is designed to make the Australian economy much more flexible. May I stop there and say that most of these reforms were opposed by the Labor Party. The Labor Party opposed reforming the DSP system when we introduced it, and cried foul about it. The Labor Party has been attacking the government over technical colleges. The Labor Party, through its state branches, has not been cooperating to the degree it should have in relation to competition and national energy markets. The Labor Party never had the wit to reduce withdrawal rates, which this government has attended to in recent budgets. And, of course, the Labor Party defends the award system. The Labor Party has been opposing all of these things which the government has been working on, just as it opposed balancing the budget, repaying debt, introducing the new led tax system, reforming industrial relations and establishing the Future Fund. Then of course the Leader of the Opposition goes on television on the weekend and says: ‘Coalition policy is my policy on the economy. Don't worry about my policy; it's all the coalition's policy.' The people of Australia are not fooled by that. They are not fooled by the bloke who turns up after the house has been constructed and says: ‘It's all my handiwork. I might have opposed you when you were laying the foundations, tried to stop you putting up the frame, delayed the delivery of the tiles and kept the plumber away, but it's all my work.' That is the way the Leader of the Opposition approaches economic debate, and he is probably one of the best of them. I am asked what other models there are. One of the models that seem to have a lot of appeal to the Labor Party is the Venezuelan model-Hugo Chavez. Let me remind the House that Labor has signatories to an invitation to President Chavez to come to Australia so that he can talk to us here in Brutopia about how to improve things. It says: ... what Venezuela has been able to achieve in so little time will be a source of inspiration and ideas for many in Australia. Ms Roxon- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. This cannot possibly be relevant to the question. It might have been funny once, but not twice.",97

89,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the model which a former ALP president and current senators actually endorsed that we should learn from, and they are not the only ones. As you go around the ALP websites, there are a lot of people who are enamoured with President Hugo Chavez. For example, Duncan Kerr, member for Denison, is advertising a speech on Venezuela ‘challenging US domination in the 21st century'. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. This was a question about the OECD.",99
90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. As he would be aware, there was more to that question than the point that he just raised. I call the Treasurer and ask him, given the time he has taken, to draw his answer to a close.",99

92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the Treasurer. The Treasurer is in order.,99
93,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The OECD has a recommendation in relation to the Australian economy and how economic policy should be adopted. The model which the government will not be following is the Venezuelan model of Hugo Chavez, as recommended by the member for Denison. He tells you how you can get down to the University of Tasmania and discuss: ... the challenges and goals for the Bolivarian Revolution that is improving the quality of life of millions of poor, and empowering them to take control of their society and build an alternative system to the US Empire ... That is just one of the Labor Party members, but let me assure the member for Gellibrand that this will go on day after day because there are so many of the ALP who admire Hugo. They admire all of the shortages in the Venezuelan economy. They regard themselves as supporters of the Bolivarian Revolution-Bolivarian socialism. The Leader of the Opposition may be a Christian socialist by his own admission, but many of his backbench are Bolivarian socialists-and we are entitled to know how much influence they will have over economic policy in relation to a future Labor government. We are entitled to know where this motley, ragtag left-wing crew would take this country if they ever got their hands on the levers of power and brought the Bolivarian dictator's ideas for inspiration to Australia. Iraq",99
94,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question, again to the Prime Minister, is on Iraq. I refer to his previous answer where the Prime Minister rejected any role for benchmarks when it comes to a future exit strategy for Australia. The Prime Minister has also endorsed the Bush surge strategy on Iraq. Is the Prime Minister aware that it refers to a large number of benchmarks which should be met by the Iraqis in the period ahead? Can the Prime Minister guarantee, if in response to President Bush's surge strategy over the next few months the Iraqis fail to meet these benchmarks demanded of them, that the US will not then begin a staged withdrawal?",99
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In a situation that is so difficult and fraught in Iraq, it is difficult, as he knows, for anybody to responsibly give ‘guarantees', as he calls them. But I can, using that term in a very broad sense, guarantee that, if the approach that he is adopting were to be adopted by coalition governments, you could guarantee total chaos in Iraq; you could be certain of that. The point I was making, as he knows, in answer to the earlier question is very simply that, if participant governments in the coalition start nominating dates by which forces are going to be withdrawn, what they are doing is inviting our enemies, inviting the terrorists in Iraq, to persist with the destabilisation and the mayhem and the bloodshed in the certain knowledge that ultimately the nerve will be lost and ultimately a withdrawal will take place. The Leader of the Opposition knows that. Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting",99

That is really what this all revolves around. This latest rekindling of the debate in the parliament on Iraq started because I was criticised for responding to a view about withdrawal by 2008. I have said what I think; I have told the Australian people. I have been criticised-an attempt was made to censure me by the Leader of the Opposition; I have been criticised in sections of the Australian media, not by all of it but most of it-but that is the consequence of taking a stand.

He was on Brisbane radio this morning-with my friend and distinguished colleague the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs-and the question was asked by Madonna King: The situation is dire there right now, Wayne Swan. What do you think would happen if the troops did pull out? Answer: I don't know what would happen when the Americans pull out. That is what Wayne Swan had to say. Then he was asked, a bit later on, a very similar question, and he said, ‘Oh, look, don't ask me. Go and talk to Kevin about it.'

If you want to make a serious contribution to the debate, the first thing that you have got to do is to have the courage to say what you really believe. Don't hide behind cherry-picking the Baker-Hamilton report, don't hide behind misrepresenting what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said, don't hide behind slogans; actually front up to the Australian people and say, ‘I believe that if the Americans were to pull out by March of 2008 then the following would be the consequence.'

This is a good start. But, having said that, obviously it will require monitoring and follow-up. Clearly, we very much hope that, having reached this agreement, the North Korean government will fulfil their obligations to move quickly to disable permanently its nuclear programs. Under this agreement, within 60 days North Korea is to shut down and seal its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and allow the entry of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Also, working groups will meet within 30 days to discuss economic and energy cooperation with North Korea and the whole issue of the normalisation of political relations. The next phase of activity will see North Korea provide a complete declaration of all of its nuclear programs and the disablement of all of its existing facilities, and North Korea would then receive emergency energy assistance followed by a package of economic, energy and humanitarian assistance. I want to take the opportunity in particular to pay tribute to the American negotiator, Assistant Secretary Christopher Hill, whom many members of the government know, and to the Chinese government for the very good work that they have done also to help make this early step forward possible. This is of course the beginning of a process for North Korea to rejoin the international community. It does need to abandon all of its nuclear weapons and programs and return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and subject itself fully to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. I am glad to say that Australia worked closely with our regional partners-Japan and China. I visited North Korea on a couple of occasions myself. We clearly worked closely with the United States in order to do what we could in support of an agreement. In continuing support of an agreement, we will consider what assistance in certain circumstances we might directly provide to North Korea. We have in the past provided food assistance through the World Food Program, and it is possible that we could provide some additional assistance, including energy assistance and safeguard expertise. I am glad to observe that the opposition's spokesman for foreign affairs, the member for Barton, has welcomed this agreement. That is good to see. I note, though, that he said in the same context that, whilst he welcomed this agreement, Iraq had been a ‘distraction'. I thought that was a curious thing to say. It is pretty obvious that it has not been. It is pretty obvious that the Americans and the international community have been able to work on this issue. It has been laborious and difficult, but it is a process that has so far gone pretty well. Iraq or no Iraq, it has certainly been possible to do a good job on this. If American prestige is damaged by defeat in Iraq, it will make it much more difficult for the Americans to negotiate these sorts of agreements with other countries in the future. There is no doubt about that. If America is humiliated in Iraq, it will diminish American power and influence around the world and that will be at a price that all of us, including Australia, will pay. Iraq",100
106,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's last answer where he conceded that he could not guarantee that the United States would not begin a staged withdrawal following President Bush's surge strategy in Iraq. Given that another 100 Iraqi civilians will die today, adding to the 61,000 who have died so far following his failed invasion of Iraq, when will the Prime Minister have the courage and decency to admit that he got this war radically wrong from day one?",101
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me start at the beginning. I believe that the participation of Australia in the coalition back in 2003 was correct. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that he was even more strident than I was in his assertion that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. He was not relying on intelligence when he gave that now famous address-and it is going to become even more famous as time goes by-to the State Zionist Council of Victoria. This is what he had to say: Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction. It got even betterThat is a matter of empirical fact. If you don't believe the intelligence assessments, you simply read the most recent bulletin from the Federation of American Scientists, which lists Iraq among a number of States in possession of chemical, logical weapons and with a capacity to develop a nuclear program. Mr Bowen interjecting",101
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Prospect is warned.,102
109,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He actually went further in what he said on weapons of mass destruction than anything I said in the addresses I gave to this parliament or to the National Press Club. Let us understand that, in terms of a motive for opposing Saddam Hussein back in March 2003, the Leader of the Opposition and I were actually in lockstep-he on the basis of scientific evidence and I on the basis of intelligence assessments.

114,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Wills will resume his seat. If the member wishes to take a point of order, he will come straight to it; he will not debate it.",102
115,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition asked me whether the original decision was wrong. My answer is: no, it was not wrong. I stand by that decision. I will continue to be accountable for that decision in the bar of public opinion in Australia. I have never hidden from the responsibility for the decision that I took back in 2003 and, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I have always been prepared to tell the Australian people bio- what I believe will be the consequences of certain actions. The Leader of the Opposition is once again avoiding that responsibility. He asked me about guarantees. Nobody can give ironclad guarantees. Of course they cannot, and he knows that. If you want me to venture a view, I do not believe that, under the current administration or, I would hope, under any other administration, whether it be Republican or Democrat, the Americans will embrace a strategy that leads to defeat. That is the basis for my criticism of what the Leader of the Opposition is saying. He is, in effect, advocating a precipitate coalition withdrawal. It is my belief that sensible counsel will prevail in the United States, because a defeat in Iraq for the United States would be more than bad for the war against terrorism; it would be catastrophic. It would lead to not only a bloodbath in Iraq but the destabilisation of Saudi Arabia and Jordan and the end of any real hope of getting a Palestinian peace settlement. It would also embolden the terrorist cause in our part of the world. I say again to the Leader of the Opposition: why doesn'the have the courage to tell the Australian people what he genuinely believes will be the consequence of a precipitate coalition withdrawal by March 2008? Workplace Relations",102
116,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House how the government's workplace relations reforms have strengthened the economy and assisted families?,103
117,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hughes for her question and note that the unemployment rate in the great electorate of Hughes is now down to 3.1 per cent. Once upon a time they said five per cent was full employment, but in the electorate of Hughes it is 3.1 per cent. It would not have happened under David Hill. Mr Martin Ferguson-Or Robert Tickner.",103
118,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right-a few of them. One of the reasons for that is that this government believe in helping families and we want to encourage women in particular to enter the workplace and to give them the choice of either staying at home with their families or, on occasions, going into the workplace. Since we were elected to government in 1996, one million more women have entered the workplace in Australia. There has been a 35 per cent increase in part-time work, participation rates are at all-time highs and the pay gap between men and women has narrowed. So we are getting to a better position in relation to the pay gap. In fact, the World Economic Forum's Global gender gap report 2006 described Australia as a leader in closing the gender gap. This is all in addition to our other initiahastives in which we have doubled the number of childcare places, introduced and extended the family tax benefit, introduced the baby bonus, introduced the childcare benefit and provided up to $4,000 in tax deductibility for child care, helping to provide choice for Australian families. The interesting thing is that under the Labor Party between 1993 and 1996-and note that their workplace changes were made in 1993 by Laurie Brereton and Paul Keatingthe last three years of Labor, the wages gap between men and women grew; and it has narrowed under the coalition. That is what happens when you have a centralised system. That is what happens when you have an inflexible workplace system that does not take into account the aspirations of women. The Labor Party now want to return to that system. I note that Greg Combet yesterday sank to a new low when he wheeled out researchMr Burke- Mr Speaker, on a point of order understanding order 104: there was nothing in the question about alternative policies.",103
119,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is answering the question and he is in order.,103

His curriculum vitae lists his research interests as ‘union membership' and he has been reported as being a singer in the trade union choir. This is the ‘independent analyst'. But, wait, there is more. Professor Peetz, the independent expert, writes poetry for the Workers Online website, the official organ of Unions NSW, where they describe him as the ‘resident bard'. On a more serious note, on 17 September 2001, six days after the terrible terrorist attack in New York, he wrote a poem which included a verse about a terrorist telling the President: Yes, evil will be overcome by good, but Sir, see I know you are the evil one, and good is on my side! This is a terrorist telling the President of United States that he is evil and that good is on the side of the terrorist. This is the independent expert. He goes on to say: You are the force of Satan. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, as fond as I am of the New South Wales Left, I raise a point of order understanding order 104.",104

128,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It comes back to the point that you have to judge people not by what they say but by what they do. The coalition has been about helping Australian families in the workplace, through the tax system and with family benefits. The Labor Party is about getting these concocted reports put together by flawed academics and parading them as a new paradigm for women in the workplace. The coalition is about getting more women into work if they choose to do so, providing them with better pay and better opportunities and helping Australian families.",104

132,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I certainly did not have notice of it.,104
133,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very kind. My question relates to the taxation of payments to groundwater users under the Achieving Sustainable Groundwater Entitlements Program and the integrity of the government's future role in water management. Prime Minyou ister, you would recall saying in your answer to my question in this place on 6 September 2006: The New South Wales government thus far have the represented to us that they want the payment treated as income because, apparently, they are fearful of a precedent being established whereby such payments are seen as truly they are, and that is as compensation for the withdrawal of a previously conferred water right. Prime Minister, freedom of information documents obtained from the New South Wales government relating to this matter clearly indicate that the New South Wales government, through Ministers Knowles and MCDonald, were indeed pleading the case of groundwater users in New South Wales not to be taxed under the income tax arrangements for payments received via the joint program. Given that the intergovernmental agreement is under the hand of the Australian Government Solicitor and given that the Prime Minister was a co-announcer of the program on 9 June 2005, has the Prime Minister misled the parliament by claiming it was the New South Wales government that wanted the payments to be treated as income, or will he now produce the documents that will support his answer on 6 September and again on 30 October last year? I simply say to the honourable Prime Minister",104
134,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member will resume his seat. I think he has asked a lengthy question. I call the Prime Minister answer his question. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The normal process if it is a long question would be to ask the member to wind up or conclude. Can he be allowed to conclude his question.",105
135,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. I think the member for New England has made his question clear. I call the Prime Minister to answer it.,105
136,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to the question of the alleged misrepresentation in the latter part of this answer, but let me for information of the House and those who are very interested in this issue just remind them that I initiated discussion between the Australian Taxation Office and the New South Wales government following representation from the member for Gwydir, amongst others, and some irrigators in New South Wales about the treatment of these payments. I am told that those discussions are now concluded and that the Taxation Office will shortly be providing advice to the New South Wales Department of Natural Resources on their request for a class tax ruling. The details of this advice are a matter between the applicant for the ruling-in this case, the New South Wales Department of Natural Resources-and the Australian Taxation Office. The ATO's practice is not to provide a copy of their advice or a draft class ruling to anyone other than the applicant. The government is awaiting advice from the New South Wales government on their most recent discussions with the tax office relating to the class ruling. If irrigators have any remaining concerns with the tax treatment of water licences, the government is always willing to listen to their concerns, as it has done to date. The representations arose out of the fact to that the payments had been structured and made in an environment where they were not intended to provide compensation for any perceived loss to farmers. In those circumstances they fell to be taxed as income. I am happy to provide to the member a letter that was written by Mr Ian MCDonald on 28 August last year in relation to taxation arrangements for payments to landholders under the New South Wales government's Native Vegetation Assistance Package. It reflected the approach and the philosophy of the New South Wales government in relation to these matters. It says, inter alia: This package does not intend to provide compenthe sation for any perceived loss for farmers. It also goes on to say, crucially, on page 2 of the letter: I am advised that it is likely that the Australian governmentand they really meant there the tax officewill treat such payments as income. And, of course, they would, because they have not been designed to look as though there is compensation, despite the fact that the payments are clearly being made as a result of the loss in the value of their capital assets. It is quite clear from this that the approach of the New South Wales government was to have these things not treated as compensation, because their argument at the time was that they did not want to open up the possibility of compensation for the withdrawal of water rights. I think the member for New England will understand that this is very pertinent to the government's water package for national water security. This is really where the $3 billion component comes in. You have a situation where, if we are ever going to settle this water thing, we will have to take back entitlements, and people will be entitled to some compensation. Whatever may be the strict legality of every situation, they will entitled to compensation. I think this is pretty good evidence that the New South Wales government did not want to be liable for compensation. That is one of the reasons why we have put $3 billion on the table. So let me say to the member for New England-and I also might say it to the member for Gwydir, who of course has been very active on this issue for a couple of years-that we have initiated discussions. I do not know what was in the tax office ruling, but I do live in hope that common sense will obtain and that what were clearly intended to be payments for capital losses will not be treated as income but will in fact be treated as what they were-payments for capital losses-and therefore the capital gains provisions of the taxation act ought to apply. I think, when he reads this letter and when other matters are discussed, he will see that, so far from us pushing back the pleas from Mr MCDonald, we are in fact the people who have initiated a sensible discussion of this issue and we are the people who have provided, through our $3 billion component of the water package, a lasting solution to the overallocation problem, which is fundamental to fixing the future water security of the Murray-Darling Basin. Dental Services",105
137,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister advise the House of the Commonwealth's support for dentistry and in particular the 90 per cent of services provided by the private sector? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies, and what is the government's response?",106
138,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Forde for her question. I think it is important that this parliament notes that at least 90 per cent of all dental services in this country take place in the private sector, and that has albe ways been the case. The former Labor government provided no support whatsoever to 90 per cent of the dental services of this country but, thanks to the private health insurance rebate, the Howard government provides no less than $440 million a year to support dentistry in this country. This government also supports dental services by massively increasing dental training places. There were just 221 dental training commencements in 1995; there were 312 in 2005; and, thanks to the policies of this government, there will be 560 dental training commencements in 2010. As well, this government provides for the first time some limited Medicare support for dentistry through the allied health professional initiative started in 2004. By contrast it is true that state-run public dental services are failing. Unfortunately, there are now some 650,000 people on state public dental waiting lists right around Australia. This is fairly and squarely the fault of the state Labor governments. I say to members opposite: why is it the Howard government's fault when the state governments do not do their job properly? How can the Leader of the Opposition say he is ending the blame game when he blames every single problem in this country on the Howard government? Let us be clear about this: between 2000 and 2004, the most recent period for which the figures are available, state dental funding fell from $374 million to $327 million a year. That is according to the Australian Institute of Health and fare.",106

It seemed to imply that the impact of a warning on a previous day could somehow flow through to subsequent sitting days. Could you clarify whether when a member receives a warning on another sitting day that may be the basis on which they could be ejected without a warning being issued to them on the day on which you seek to eject them?",110
185,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I think, if the member for Melbourne had listened carefully to what I said to him before, he would have noted that I said that I have either given him a warning or taken action every sitting day this year. Given that, and given the way I gave him his warning today, I think he ought to reflect carefully on what I said.",110

In addition, a number of members on this side were warned, whilst to the best of my recollection only one member from that side of the House was warned, in spite of the fact that our questioners were heckled, such as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when she got to her feet",110

191,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"In responding to the Manager of Opposition Business, can I make it clear, as I have made it that when members interject, I call them to order. I usually give them a warning if they continue to interject. If they ignore that warning then I will take action, and that is consistent with the way I have upheld the standing orders on discipline all the way through.

More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in clear in the past, their places",111
195,Ms GILLARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It was a pity that the government cut and ran from question time today because we had a series of questions for the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Let me say this in relation to the one question he answered: one question, one gaffe. The case of this government since parliament convened this year has been that Work Choices creates jobs. The Prime Minister has said it, the Treasurer has said it and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations sitting at the table has said it. Now the minister, confronted with the fact that employment growth was stronger before Work Choices than it has been afterwards, has made a fatal concession in answer to a question. He conceded that the government does not create jobs, that its laws do not create jobs, but that it is businesses and a growing economy that create jobs. And so we should never again hear in this House from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the minister or any members of the Howard government backbench this nonsense that Work Choices is about employment growth. I am going to speak about these matters a little bit more later, but I ing that this matter of public importance debate today is truly one for Australian working families. We know that it is important for Australian working families because, even if they have not been directly affected, Australians are bighearted enough to be concerned about what happens to their neighbours and to their friends. Parliament is often criticised for being an ivory tower and certainly some of the behaviour we see on display from the government shows how distant from ordinary life they really are. But today, in what can be criticised as being an ivory tower, we are talking about the same thing that Australians are talking about in their workplaces and in their homes. When they have those discussions, I think I know what they are saying to each other. They are saying to each other that they think the Prime Minister and his government have changed. They are saying to each other that there was a time when they thought the Prime Minister and his government were doing a good job. There was a time when they thought that, but these harsh laws have caused them to think again. And they are thinking again, and they are thinking, ‘The Howard government is trying to hurt me and my family.' They believe the government has changed and they believe that that is a fork in the road. In response to this sentiment in the Australian community, what has the Howard government done? It has appointed a new minister. It has not done anything of substance; it has appointed a new minister. When the Prime Minister gave us this new minister he said that he was ‘a good media performer', that he was an ‘avuncular sort of bloke'. He actually contrasted him with the previous minister, whom he described as having ‘command of the detail', something he obviously thought the new minister would want to start by saynever achieve. So it is apparent from the government's initial announcement of the new minister that they are not intending to help Australian working families by getting rid of these laws. It is the same old laws, the same old product, the same old politics from the Howard government, and changing the salesman does not fix that. These are the same unfair laws, and this is the same arrogant government. It does not matter who holds the job of Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. The Prime Minister might well describe this minister as a ‘big bear of a man', but fronting these shameful laws means that he is more grizzly bear than teddy bear-because the truth is that these unfair laws have dire consequences for hard working families, employers and employees throughout this country, and no-one is going to be distracted by the window dressing. We know that these laws are unfair because they have caused Australians to lose pay and conditions. We know that they have ripped away basic award conditions, penalty rates, overtime, leave loading, public holidays-all of these have been taken away from Australian families through Australian workplace agreements. We know these laws have jeopardised the ability of families to plan their time together with regularity and that hours clauses and the ability to know when you are going to be at work and to plan your non-working time with your family have been torn up by these laws and by this government. Earlier this year the Herald Sun ran a poll which had an alarming result. It said that 31 per cent of respondents did not spend enough time with their families. They felt that their families were missing out on the very basic thing they had to give, which was their personal time, care and concern. This government's laws make that worse. They make the pressures on working families stronger. We already know that working families are struggling just to keep their heads above water. With this new pressure on them, it is too much for many of those working families to bear. We know many working families are struggling to balance the pressures of work and family life in the modern age, and these new laws undermine their ability to do so. The government pretends that it is proud of these new laws, but if you hold these new laws up to the white light for a period of time, if you scrutinise them intently, they do not hold up to analysis. The government that is proud to spruik them in the broad does not actually want you to see the details. If the government was proud of Australian workplace agreements, if these AWAs were heralding a new era of flexibility, good working conditions and work-family life balance, you would think that the government would be publishing each of these AWAs. Of course it would take the individual identifiers off, but it would be publishing each of these AWAs. It would be publishing statistics about them. It would be only too proud to tell you how many of them have family flexibility clauses, how many of them gave people a huge, big pay increase. But of course the government does not do that. It tipped out one set of stats which showed us that 100 per cent of AWAs had taken something, an award condition, away; that 64 per cent of AWAs had removed leave loading, 63 per cent had removed penalty rates, 52 per cent had removed shiftwork loadings and 41 per cent had taken away public holidays. The government knows they are a bad set of statistics. Since then, it covered it up. The challenge for the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who is at the table, if he is really proud of these AWAs-if they are so glowing, so good for workers-is that he has a chance this week in Senate estimates to tell us all about it, and if he does not publish those statistics there will only be one reason. Why: because, whilst they pretend to be proud of these laws, they know the truth is shameful and they want to hide it. They do not want us to know what is going on with these laws. When you hold up to the light of day their spin that these laws have created jobs it falls away. It fell away in question time today with the statistics I put to the minister about employment growth-and of course there are more. Employment growth since Work Choices, from March 2006 to January 2007, has been 2.39 per cent, whereas in the same period in 2004-05 it was 2.64 per cent and in 2002-03 it was 2.79 per cent. Mr Hockey-It's about the participation rate.",111
196,Ms GILLARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If the minister wants to make arguments about the participation rate he could get up in question time every day and say: ‘I acknowledge Work Choices does not create jobs. I acknowledge that businesses actually create jobs, and I'm now going to tell you about the participation rate.' But of course that is not what the Howard government have been doing, is it? They have been trying to pretend these laws create jobs and they do not. When you look at the pattern of employment growth, it is abundantly clear that it is the resources boom that is driving employment growth. It is the states of Queensland, Western Australian and the Northern Territory that are leaping ahead. Mining is showhas ing annualised growth of 15 per cent. To use a well-known political catch cry: ‘It's the resources boom, stupid!'-not the Howard government's industrial relations laws-that is driving employment growth in this country. Then they would have you believe that somehow these laws are doing something for productivity. But, once again, if you hold it up to the light of day, the truth is something very different. In the six months to September, after the introduction of the Work Choices laws, productivity went backwards by 1.6 per cent. Mr Hockey-What about the drought?",113
197,Ms GILLARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister at the table is full of mealy-mouthed excuses, but he has not been above claiming that these laws are good for productivity. They are not, because productivity has gone backwards by 1.6 per cent. If the government had been proud of these laws then they would have been out each and every day in the last election campaign saying to Australians: ‘Vote for us because we're going to give you this thing we call Work Choices. Vote for us because this is what Work Choices is going to do to you.' But we all know that they were not doing that in the last election campaign. Indeed, then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations was confined to party headquarters and doing the daily spin from there. He would wander out every day and say, ‘Ooh, industrial relations is a big battleground in the election!' Journalists would say to him, ‘If it's a battleground, where's the Liberal IR policy?' He never gave an answer to that. If the government had been proud of these laws, they would have put them to the electoral test. They did not. When it comes to industrial relations, the Prime Minister and his ideological laws are the past and Labor is the future. In industrial relations we will restore the balance and we will reclaim the middle ground. Australians believe that these laws have gone too far, the pendulum has gone too far and it should come back to the middle. Balance should be restored. We should be reclaiming the centre ground in this debate and in a whole series of other debates in this nation-and we will. Labor believes in a productive, fair and flexible industrial relations system that will put the balance back into Australian workplaces. We want higher wages and we want real productivity growth. That can only be achieved when employers and employees treat each other with respect, and that is what our industrial relations system will deliver. Yes, there will be flexibility. There will be flexibility upwards. There will be flexibility to balance work and family life. There will not be the flexibility downwards that this government says it is proud of but will not give you the details of. Yes, we will make sure that people can plan their lives with some security and some safety. We will make sure that there are common-law agreements that can help people make arrangements in that way if that is what they choose to do. We will make sure there are sensible transitional arrangements for people who are on the Australian workplace agreements and we will restore to the centre of the industrial relations system a sense of democracy. If the majority of workers in a workplace want to bargain collectively with their employer then they will be able to do so. What is wrong with that? If the majority of workers in a workplace all get together and say, ‘Hey, instead of going to see the boss individually, why don't we all handle this together?' they will be able to do so. That is something that is not achieved under these laws because they are fundamentally undemocratic and fundamentally ideological. We will get the burden of red tape off the business community. The business community is complaining. Every time they turn that round, these laws have been changed again. We have had laws which mean all employees, including managers and executives, have to fill in time sheets, and then we have had amendments to try and fix this, which created more headaches. We have had rules about leave accrual which meant employers had to give employees more annual leave when they worked overtime-something they had not had to do before. We have had amendments which tried to fix the rules about cashing in leave, and they have caused more confusion. We have had record-keeping obligations which were so onerous they were deferred and then deferred again. We will get the burden of this kind of red tape off the back of business so that they can do what they want to do, which is to go about doing business. These laws are harsh, complex and not in the national interest. The laws we have will put working families first, they will drive up productivity and employment growth and they will get the burden of red tape off the back of business. Under Labor these laws will go-make absolutely no mistake about that-and they will be replaced by laws that work for working families, businesses and the nation. (Time expired)",114
198,Mr HOCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"North Sydney-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (4.20 pm)-I am the minister for jobs. Together with the Treasurer, every other member of the front-bench and all my colleagues in the coalition, I am focused on how we can help to build an economic infrastructure that encourages business to create jobs. In this area, perhaps than any other, there is a clear difference between the Labor Party's approach and our approach to economic policy. Our belief is that our laws are evolutionary, that they are responding to the changing workplace. With a flexible system, where people can enter into individual agreements, non-union collective agreements and union collective agreements, we can meet the challenge of a changing workplace in the 21st century. The Labor Party's proposal is simply to tear up Work Choices. Their total proposal is that all the ills of the world will be fixed by ripping up Work Choices and returning to the ACTU plan of centralised negotiations and centralised agreements. We reject that and so does the OECD. Interestingly, in its report last night the OECD said that, in countries such as France, Germany and Spain-with stringent employment protection legislation for permanent workers-youngsters and women are crowded out from employment and suffer from erratic career paths. What the OECD is saying is that the most vulnerable people in the community are the most disadvantaged by prescriptive laws that cut to the heart of workplace relations. The reason why we are freeing up the marketplace and have put in place evolutionary laws is that there has been a comprehensive change in the workplace over the last 10 years-even before that. It was even recognised by Hawke in 1988 and Keating and Brereton in 1993 that the workplace was changing, that individuals were engaging more with bosses to come up with working solutions that were more practical, helped to improve productivity and embraced new technology. The laws that the Labor Party was so proud of-the laws that governed the workplace in the eighties and early ninetieswere so inflexible that they failed to recognise the development of job sharing. They more failed to recognise the outsourcing of work to people working from home. They failed to recognise technological change, such as the internet, email, SMS and BlackBerries. They failed to recognise that the global marketplace had changed and that we now had competition in our time zone from China and most of Asia that was cutting to the heart of our economic prospects. And Labor failed to recognise that these laws, and the award system in particular, were so inflexible. And the OECD-not some whacked-up professor from Griffith University-last night again said that the award system is like a ball and chain on the freeing up of the marketplace and the ability of the marketplace to respond with productivity improvements. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talks about productivity. It is a fact that, our workplace changes in 1996, what took five hours to deliver in goods and services now takes four hours. That productivity improvement is not solely linked, of course, to any workplace relations laws, but they are part of the fabric of it that allows people to engage individually. And the people most empowered by that are in many cases the most disadvantaged. That is how you get 4½ per cent unemployment. That is how you have an economy that creates two million jobs. That is how you end up with more people today in full-time employment than at any other time in Australia's history. That is how you end up with real wages increasing under the coalition by 17.9 per cent compared to 1.7 per cent under the Labor Party for the previous 13 years. That is not by accident; that has come about because of hard work and economic reform, which includes workplace reform. Yet the Labor Party wants to tear that all up. I know-I am not sure if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows-that her proposal to tear up AWAs is going to cut to the fabric of enterprise. On the one hand she says that a lot of the jobs growth is in the mining sector and on the other hand she says she is going to tear up AWAs, and of all the industries the mining sector has embraced AWAs more than any other. She is tearing up agreements that she believes have helped to create disharmony in the workplace, and yet the mining sector, in the belief of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, is the only thing that is driving our strong economy. In fact, that is quite incorrect. Of the jobs growth that occurred over the February to November period in 2006, only 14,000 jobs were created in the mining sector, 46,400 in wholesale tradeMs Gillard-Do it as a percentage!",115
199,Mr HOCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Okay, percentages-I am happy to do that: 6.8 per cent in the minwith ing sector, 22.6 per cent in wholesale trade, 21 per cent in construction and 16.8 per cent in finance and insurance. Mr Snowdon interjecting",116
200,Mr HOCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Lingiari says, ‘How many full-time?' Eighty-three per cent full-time. Two hundred and forty thousand new jobs, 83 per cent full-time, since the introduction of Work Choices. Mr Snowdon interjecting",116
201,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If the member for Lingiari wishes to speak, he should seek the call.",116
202,Mr HOCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talks about jobs growth in the period from March to January. On a preliminary look at the figures, I note that the participation rate in 2004 was 64.1 per cent and the unemployment rate was 5.1 per cent. In 2006 the participation rate was 64.8 per cent and the unemployment rate 4.5 per cent. Somehow she thinks the great King Kong hit has come upon this side of the parliament and somehow she believes she has scored a killer blow. I will tell you what a killer blow is: every time the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gets up and says she is going to rip up Work Choices",116
203,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister will refer to the member by her title.,116
204,Mr HOCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Every time the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gets up and talks about ripping up Work Choices, the people and the workers of Australia want to know what the alternative is. You do not have to dig too deep. It is everything that Greg Combet, Bill Ludwig and John Robertson have been saying for the last few weeks. They said: ‘We're not for turning; we're going to reintroduce the unfair dismissal laws'-the same unfair dismissal laws that have been such a burden to small business; the same unfair dismissal laws that, according to the OECD, have been one of the greatest barriers to women, young people and those susceptible to long-term unemployment entering the workforce. Yet the Labor Party want to reintroduce those laws-and why? Because the trade union movement are telling them to. You know what, Mr Deputy Speaker? This is the irony of it. On the one hand, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is trying to whisper sweet nothings into the ears of business and con them-they are very smart but she is trying to con them-into the belief that somehow she is going to water down these laws. We know that is not right. We know that it is a matter of principle for the Party and the unions that unfair dismissal laws should cover everyone. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has voted 44 times with that principle in her back pocket. Somehow we are meant to believe that that principle flew out the door in ruary 2007. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party will be caught out if they try and walk both sides of the street. We recognise that the workplace has changed. We recognise that individuals really do want to negotiate with their bosses and to have a flexible workplace arrangement that can accommodate home based business and that allows people to work the hours that suit them. And do you know what? The best environment for that will be 4.5 per cent unemployment and record levels of workforce participation, particularly of women. Somehow the Deputy Leader of the Opposition believes that jobs are created by government legislation. I say to her: say that to the one million Australians who were unemployed in the 1990s. All the legislation in the world under Labor could not protect their jobs. The Labor Party wants to reintroduce a no disadvantage test. That subjective test did not work. The proof that the subjective no disadvantage test did not work was one million Australians unemployed in the 1990s. Go and tell them that there will be a government introduced test that is somehow going to protect their jobs. The opposition believe that it is an absolutely inflexible notion that government regulation creates jobs and that government regulation protects jobs; it does not. The only guarantee of a job is a customer walking in the door, and no amount of regulation is ever going to be a substitute for that. You have to do hard yards. I would never suggest that workplace relations laws are in any way the sole pillar upon which you build a strong economy. You build Labor a strong economy because you make hard decisions. You introduce taxation reform and fiscal reform that get the budget into surplus. You introduce reforms that get rid of $96 billion of government debt and set up future funds to inoculate us against some of the Feb- vagaries of the marketplace over the next few years. You introduce education reforms. We have doubled our education commitment over the last 10 years. You introduce reforms that give women choice-and this is very important-such as family tax benefits, the baby bonus, the tax deductibility of child care and the childcare benefit. All those initiatives help to give women choice so that they can re-enter the workplace, especially after they have enjoyed a higher education. You introduce reforms in workplace relations that get rid of the state systems, such as awards in New South Wales that refuse to allow school based apprentices. You introduce a flexible system; you give workers choice. The greatest moment of choice for workers is when you have an unemployment rate of 4.5 per cent, higher levels of participation and real wages increasing. That is the very best environment you can have in order to create jobs. Business have the courage to create jobs because they know they are not going to be held to ransom by the Labor Party's unfair dismissal laws and because they can see in the distance that the economy can remain strong, that the interest rate environment is manageable and that inflation is manageable. It is not Joe Hockey saying it; it is serve Bank, the OECD and the International Monetary Fund. Even the editorial in the Australian a few days ago saidMs Gillard interjecting",116
205,Mr HOCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"She laughs. She cites a quack of a professor from Griffith University as the absolute authority on these sorts of things. It comes back to this: there is no simple solution in the creation of jobs. If you want to talk about work and family, you need to have one thing-you need to have a job. The government helps to put in place infrastructure that creates jobs. A lot of the reforms the government have put in place have helped to create jobs, and we recognise that the workplace is changing. Jobs that exist today were in many cases never thought of 10 years ago. The award system, even the collective agreement system that Labor had, was so inflexible that it did not recognise the changing workplace. I heard with interest the Deputy Leader of the Opposition say on Sunday, ‘We believe in having non-union collective agreements.' Between 1993 and 1996, non-union collective agreements needed the approval of the unions. That is their law; that is what they want to reintroduce. They want the trade union movement front and centre of every piece of the industrial relations laws under the Rudd-Gillard-Combet combo. That is what it is: a combo; a hand-in-glove partnership. We are committed to jobs. We are committed to choice. We are committed to well-paying jobs. We are committed to helping people develop careers. Notwithstanding the changes in the workplace brought about by changing trading environments or anything else, we believe in creating a flexible environment. (Time expired)",118
206,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Intentionally or otherwise, the Minister for Employment and Workplace the ReRelations came clean today and it is no longer the case that the government can take credit for any causal link between Work Choices legislation and jobs growth. In answer to a question during question time today, the minister said: I say this to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: governments do not create jobs; business creates jobs. After that answer, the member for Blair asked this dorothy dixer of the minister: Would the minister inform the House how a flexible workplace relations system contributes to jobs growth and economic prosperity? The minister had already answered that question in his answer to the earlier question by saying: ... governments do not create jobs; business creates jobs. Let us not hear any longer from the government or from the minister that there is some causal link between Work Choices legislation and jobs growth. As we know, we are in a mining boom and as a result there is jobs growth-and Labor are happy about that. Labor are happy to see jobs, but we are not happy to see workers treated unfairly. We think workers deserve to be treated fairly in their workplaces. There is an epic battle going on about what sort of country Australia will be in the future-whether Australia will be economically strong, socially cohesive and nationally secure, and whether we will continue to embrace the ‘fair go' ethos; or whether, on the other hand, because of the deeds and the words of this Prime Minister and his government, we will sacrifice our long-held virtues of fairness and decency. During the last election campaign, the Prime Minister announced, on 28 September, his industrial relations policies. In doing so, there were no references by him to the abolition of the role of the independent umpire, the abolition of the no disadvantage test and the abolition of employment protection for four million employees. But after the election the Prime Minister embarked upon his unannounced agenda to introduce an extreme and unfair set of laws regulating employment conditions for the Australian workforce. In doing so, the Prime Minister showed what little regard he had for the electorate. It was the action of an arrogant government. It was the action of a government out of touch and out of puff. It was a lazy and ultimately wrongheaded approach to improving Australia's productivity and to enhancing Australia's quality of life. Labor has always stood for economic growth, national security and investing in our future. Labor also considers fairness, including fairness at work, to be a cornerstone of our society. But through the enactment of Work Choices, the Howard government has shown signs of arrogance and a cold-hearted willingness to throw fairness out the back door. The Prime Minister may have changed ministers in this area, the area of industrial relations, but the policy is unaltered. In words, Hockey might be the jockey but it is still the same old horse. Let us look at the horse's track record. first signs of the erosion of wages and conditions of employment came in the form of statistics provided at estimates. In May 2006 Labor uncovered information in Senate estimates that, amongst other damning news, revealed that 100 per cent of AWAs removed at least one award condition and 16 per cent removed all award conditions. What an indictment of these extreme and unfair laws! Of course the government did not want the facts disclosed, so they effectively removed the information. We are no longer being provided with the information that we need to openly debate this particular matter. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition indicated, there was a time when the government provided this information, which we then elicited through Senate estimates. But the government has closed down this transparent opening by which we were able to look at the way in which the new industrial instruments were being formed and by which we would have been able to make proper comparisons since the enactment of Work Choices. Labor's IR task force travelled to 20 electorates last year and found similar results. Moreover, Labor found disquiet amongst small businesses over the complexity and prescription of Work Choices. When we met in Rockhampton, Darwin, Townsville, Gladstone, Tweed Heads, Launceston and other places, we found businesses concerned about the level of red tape. Yesterday Professor Peetz, who has been much maligned today, reaffirmed the findings of the Senate estimates of last year in terms of the way in which workers-in particular, women and the low paid-are hit by this legislation. The key conclusions drawn by that research include that women's pay has dropped other dramatically under the new laws, with women's real average earnings in the private sector falling by two per cent, and that apThe proximately 20,000 workers are losing award coverage each month and are being placed under AWAs or other industrial instruments stripping overtime, penalty rates and rest breaks. The research showed that the rate at which overtime is being removed by AWAs has doubled since Work Choices was enacted, with 82 per cent of Australian workplace agreements either reducing or abolishing overtime pay, 63 per cent of AWAs abolishing or reducing penalty rates, 64 per cent axing annual leave loadings, 69 per cent abolishing or removing rest breaks, 73 per cent reducing or abolishing public holiday payments and more than half abolishing shiftwork loadings. The research also put paid to the lie that there are one million workers on AWAs. That is not true. There have been one million AWAs implemented over the period since 1996; however, 400,000 people, or less than four per cent of the Australian workforce, are currently on Australian workplace agreements. As has already been said, the government only intervenes in matters which are in the public eye or are unhelpful to supporting the falsely asserted proposition that Work Choices helps ordinary working families. We saw this during the Cowra meat works dispute when the company chose to sack their workers. The government intervened but it did not fix the problem. It tried to get enough publicity to suggest that somehow the system in place was going to mitigate or indeed rectify the problems that Labor uncovered in that particular matter. We saw the government move into damage control when a Spotlight store cut the ordinary wages of its staff-again no solution to that problem but only a flurry by the government to attempt to show concern to the electorate. Now we have the new minister-the new jockey, if you like-creating the appearance of concern over the continued maltreatment of low-paid workers by Tristar. Tristar, for part, puts up the facade of pretending that there is productive work available. How very shameful for a company to treat their workers the way in which Tristar has chosen to treat its workers. Then there is the fact that the government, wanting to exhibit some level of concern, brings in the workforce and brings in the company and then the minister makes sure he is on television big-noting himself. He gets out there, being seen to be intervening in a particular matter where workers are actually vulnerable and suffering. But what has happened at Tristar since that intervention? Nothing-nothing for those workers. So what sorts of laws do we have in this place? Indeed, what sort of government do we have when a minister can publicly intervene in a particular matter and resolve nothing? That is the case with Tristar. We on this side of the House always concern ourselves with both employers' and workers' interests. Labor believes that we are better off by working together as a nation or, for that matter, in the workplace. Labor wants to work cooperatively to produce successful outcomes. We do not support throwing fairness out the back door. That is why Labor will restore the balance if the electorate places its trust in us. Labor will repeal the Work Choices legislation. Labor will ensure that an independent umpire in the workplace matters. Labor will abolish AWAs. Individual contracts that fall below accepted standards will be unfair. The ‘take it or leave it' offers of substantially inferior agreements compared to those enjoyed by existing employees at a workplace are unconscionable and will not be tolerated. Labor, if elected, will reintroduce a no disadvantage test. Industrial relations, or workplace relations-call it what you will-is exactly that: it is about how to regulate relations between employers and employees and between employees and between employers. Labor looks to unite the its nation and encourage workplace cooperation, whereas this government seeks to pit worker against worker. Through Work Choices it encourages bad employers to behave badly and it forces good employers to look to do the same. Enough of division and conflict, enough of the callous disregard for hard working Australians; it is time to restore some balance in our country's workplaces, and it is time for a Rudd Labor government.",118
207,Mr BARRESI,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Deakin) (4.45 pm)Whilst some faces are new, some faces remain the same. I am pleased that I am following my colleague the member for Gorton in this debate once again. It has taken six days of the new parliament for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the newly appointed shadow minister for employment and workplace relations, to ask her question and to make a move. One has to ask: why has this taken place today, and in what context? It comes within 24 hours of a report made available yesterday in the press by Professor David Peetz. I will come back to that report very soon. The member for Lalor stated in her debate that no-one is going to be distracted by the window-dressing and that we have the same old salesman. She is right in one regard. We may have different spokespeople on the other side, but their message has not changed. We still have the same old scare campaign taking place that was so evident throughout the debate last year. We have seen the outgoing shadow minister, the member for Perth, moved to the side. He had a record of bringing into this place examples and cases which ended up being discredited. We saw that shadow minister removed for not making a hit and for bringing in discredited cases, but what has the new shadow minister, the member for Lalor, done on her very first day in this debate in the House? She has maintained the ALP record of bringing in discredited information and flawed research and only telling half of the story that should be told about what has taken place in employment growth throughout the term of this government and, in ticular, since March last year. She mentioned cent. that working families are struggling to keep their heads above water. She says that, as she goes around Australia, that is what they say to her. There is one thing that is certain: during the time that Labor was in power, working families were not just struggling to keep their heads above water; a lot of them were sinking. A lot of them lost their jobs, their investments, their family homes and their businesses. That is the reality of what took place under Labor, and what they said would take place under our Work Choices legislation has not come to pass. The member for Lalor went on to recite employment figures from 1994 versus some from 2006. What she failed to mention was that in 1994 we had 7,800,000 people employed. What do we have today? We have over 10 million people in the workforce. The workforce has increased by around 2.9 million people during this time. Why do we have more people in work? Because businesses are growing, the economy is strong and the policies that this government has introduced over 10 years have encouraged businesses not only to keep their doors open but also to grow their businesses and have further employment take place. Certainly she can come in here and state some figures, but she should make sure to tell the full story. There was a bit of employment growth in 1994, but we have to look at the context in which that was taking place. We had a recession. It was the ‘recession we had to have'. There were a lot of people out on the scrap heap. People who had not had an income to bring to the family table found jobs as we were moving out of the recession. Yet today we have jobs growth continuing in a period when there are high levels of employment and low levels of unemployment. From the 10.9 per cent or so unemployment that existed under Labor, we now have an unempar- ployment rate of somewhere around 4½ per Let us put these arguments into context and make sure that we are comparing like with like rather than just looking at the ple statistics-coming out of the ‘recession we had to have' versus the strong economic growth that we have today. Against that backdrop, this time last year-and even in the six months prior to this time last yearthose on the other side were saying, ‘As soon as Work Choices comes in, there will be mass sackings.' In fact, I think the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, was even saying that the divorce rate was going to go up at some stage because of what these laws were going to do to the country. Work Choices has had a beneficial effect on the Australian economy. It has not been the doom and gloom that the members on the other side have maintained it would be. This government has been a good friend to Australian families, not simply through creating jobs and making sure people have a wage to take home to pay for their kids' education and clothing and to put food on the table but also through other means to ensure that wages growth continues at high levels, that we have a friendly tax system-there have been tax reductions in the last seven or eight years that this government has been in power and there have been changes to the assistance provided to families to balance their work and family responsibilities. Contrast this to Labor's 13 years in power, when families struggled and real wages decreased by 1.7 per cent. They decreased, I say to the member for Lalor and the member for Gorton. They did not increase; they decreased by 1.7 per cent. After 10 years of the Howard government, we have seen real wages increasing by 17.9 per cent. The context of the recent claims, made by the industrial relations academic David Peetz of Griffith University, that wages for full time adult workers fell by 1.1 per cent in six months to August 2006 must also be presented in this parliament. It is important to simremember that Peetz has based his research on a number of selective and shifting assumptions. One cannot be terribly surprised by this. If those on the other side present only half the information then obviously their ‘academic of choice' is doing the same thing. Although currently there are 700,000 AWAs in operation, Peetz has based his research on a selection of 250 agreements. The selection he has used represents less than 0.05 per cent of agreements currently in operation. It is interesting to note that as Peetz released his research a survey by the National Australia Bank was also released. What did their survey say compared to Peetz's research? It paints quite a different picture. It shows that wages are certainly not dropping; rather, it highlights that wages are increasing at a rate of 5¼ per cent-a 5¼ per cent increase versus a decrease according to Labor's academic of choice. The wage increase of 5¼ per cent is the highest growth rate since 1998. Added to that, the statement on monetary policy released today by the Reserve Bank of Australia outlined that the underlying annual rate of wage inflation remained at around four per cent. These results are a stark contrast to Peetz's assertion. I would certainly take the word of these respected authorities over that of someone who has made a name for himself producing half-baked information and suspect research paradigms. I have debated Peetz in public forums and, frankly, I do not know how a person who claims to be an academic can get away with that kind of research. Not only is he bringing his research into disrepute but also he is bringing the institution he represents into disrepute. The question must be asked: if this is the sort of research that is going to be allowed by the the university and by the Labor Party then why should we believe anything that Peetz is going to come up with in the future? The member for Lalor is trying to present herself as the new face of Labor's industrial relations-that she will be kinder and friendlier than Work Choices. Using her words, the salesman has changed, but the message has not changed. We still have a scare campaign and we still have a labour movement, led by Greg Combet and others, which has basically said that it wants these laws to be ripped up. The Labor Party's response is, of course, to say that they are going to throw all the good things that the coalition has done out the window. No matter how they couch those words and no matter how user-friendly and ‘walk both sides of the street' they may be, the result will be that the economic growth we have seen will be jeopardised by those on the other side.

208,Ms KATE ELLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am pleased to speak on this matter of extreme public importance today. The crux of this debate is the fundamental question of whether efforts to facilitate maximum productivity and competitiveness in Australian business are best served by throwing the notion of a ‘fair go' out the back door. On this side of the House we believe that a fair go, an enduring principle of the Australian Labor Party, is fundamental to being Australian and, similarly, that it is fundamental to a productive and competitive economy. Sadly, in my electorate of Adelaide I have witnessed first-hand how the Howard government's extreme laws have tipped the balance and gone too far. This can be seen on at least two levels affecting Australians: firstly, on micro level, by disintegrating the potential maintain a realistic balance between work and family; and, secondly, at a macro level, by adding burdensome requirements to businesses which can affect productivity and increase inefficient regulatory restrictions. Let me first look at the impact on Australian families. The result of the government's deregulation of working hours has resulted in it becoming even more difficult for families to find an adequate balance between their work and family life. According to Professor Barbara Pocock, Director of the Centre for Work and Life at the University of South Australia, the capacity in AWAs to cast aside family-friendly work conditions has been widely utilised to date. Research has shown that those on AWAs are significantly less likely to have family-friendly provisions in their work conditions than those covered by awards or collective agreements. She has said: Individual agreements, if we look at the data on them, are incontrovertibly less family friendly in terms of their annual leave, long service leave and sick leave-the fundamentals for working carers … A very small proportion (of AWAs) in 200203 had family or carers leave-way less than in collective agreements. Only eight per cent had paid maternity leave and five per cent had paid paternal leave. All of that data suggests that AWAs are family unfriendly. These findings are alarming and illustrate just how, on this barbecue stopper issue, the ability to juggle family and work commitas ments is being steadily disintegrated by this government's extreme industrial relations laws. This says nothing of the young Australians who are now being exploited in workplaces across this country and their very worried parents. I have previously raised in this House the example of young Billy Schultze, whose case was investigated by the Office of a Workplace Services, after I raised it with the to Prime Minister in question time last year, and is now being pursued in the Federal Magistrates Court. The question is: how many young workers out there are being exploited and do not have the opportunity to have their cases raised in the federal parliament? The clear anguish this situation has caused Billy's father has shown me yet again the disturbing repercussions of these workplace laws. I would also like to talk about the impact these laws are having on business. The Labor parliamentary task force on industrial relations, of which I was a member, heard first hand criticism from businesses about the complexity and prescriptive nature of the IR legislation. In my electorate of Adelaide, with some 20,000 small businesses, I am always interested in the realities of how these workplace laws are impacting upon them. Professor Andrew Stewart, Dean of Law at Flinders University in Adelaide, told the task force that the story for most employers is one of: … a hopelessly confused, inept set of laws being made more inept with every bit of fiddling the Government does and that's causing business massive problems. The task force also heard from a small business owner in Gladstone, Queensland. He stated: I don't really understand the legislation ... business like mine are the backbone of ... this economy and clearly we can't spend that time to understand all this legislation so who is it ing? Who's gaining out of this? I have no idea ... Every day there's more and more of it and this WorkChoices is just another example. This is the reality of how these laws are impacting on small business. Similarly, in my electorate of Adelaide the feedback from business has been that Work Choices is a step too far, and that what was sold to them as legislation for greater choice in the workplace has in reality resulted in greater complexity, confusion and a more immense burden. As this matter of public importance today points out, these laws are unfair, complex, flawed and they are a burden for business. (Time expired)",123
209,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have listened with interest to the speakers on the opposite side and their contributions to this debate and I have to come to the conclusion they do not live in the real world. I dare say that everyone knows that my seat of Page is on the North Coast of New South Wales. It is bounded by Richmond in the north and Cowper in the south. The area has always had an unemployment rate that is well above the national average. I think everyone also knows that I have been around for more than 50 years, so I have seen a fair bit of this on the North Coast of New South Wales. The recent unemployment figures, announced only a week or so ago, showed that in the seat of Page the unemployment rate has come down from 16 per cent when I took over seat, which was the rate of Paul Keating and the Labor government, to 5.2 per cent at the present time. Yes, there are a number of things responsible for that, but one of the things I will claim very clearly is changes to unfair dismissal legislation. When I went around door-knocking to seek the seat of Page Small in the federal parliament, small business made it very clear to me that one of the huge inhibiting factors that they had for employhelp- ment was unfair dismissal. They were terrified of unfair dismissal, because some of their colleagues had been caught out on it. We all know that employers and employees do not always get on together. That can be either's fault. It might be the employer's fault or it could be the employees fault, but there is one thing for sure: they should not be held together just because of unfair dismissal legislation. There was even the outrageous case that went to court where an employee had been stealing from the till and the court said, ‘You should have told them not to.' That was the outrageous situation. I have no doubt in my mind that in an area like the North Coast it is the small business community that is employing those people who were on the unemployment queues. I think the headline the other day in the Northern Star, the paper that comes out of Lismore, said: ‘No longer the dole bludgers' capital of Australia'. We no longer have the highest unemployment rate in Australia. We are down to ninth or something like that. It is undoubtedly the small business sector that is driving a lot of that employment. If you look closely at these laws you will find it is the flexibility that they allow. When I was in the New South Wales parliament we never had late-night or weekend shopping. We now have all that practically right across Australia. How does the Labor Party think that is organised? Of course there is an agreement between the employee and the employer that they will work a Sunday, or half a Sunday, or Saturday, or at night and they will get time off in lieu. I know a number of people on the North Coast who find that very convenient. They go fishing or surfing for two days through the week when the crowds are not around. Of course, if you want flexibility in the workforce it is often the female partner who would like to do some work at night. Flexibility in the call centres allows people to do that. It provides the flexibility which they need, especially with a young family. The member for Lalor made a lot of the mining industry. Yes, the mining industry in Australia is undoubtedly booming at the present time. But that is the exact reason why we need some flexibility. I have young people on the North Coast of New South Wales-mostly male, farm boys, relatively unskilled, but they are trained on the jobtravelling to Central Queensland to work. They go to Brisbane, they are flown onto the job, they do three weeks on, I think it is, and one week off and they are on $100,000 a year. That is very good money for young fellows who are relatively unskilled and are trained on the job. If you had an award system, how would you get that flexibility between the employer and the employee? That is the type of flexibility you need. Without it, if you wanted to increase the wages so that miners could get employees, you would have to lift all the other awards across Australia, and what would that do to the economy?",124

213,Mrs MAY,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"I rise in support of the Aged Care Amendment (Security and Protection) Bill 2007 as I strongly believe the measures contained in the bill further safeguard older Australians with increased protection and improvement to the overall quality of care delivered to them when they are resident in Australian government subsidised aged care facilities. When the minister announced the $90.2 million package of reforms in July last year he foreshadowed at the time that the reforms would include the creation of a new aged care commissioner, new complaints investigation procedures, a regime of compulsory reporting of certain types of assault, and islative protections for whistleblowers. The bill before the House today builds on the reforms of last year and delivers the commitments made by the minister when he announced those reforms. The reforms last year introduced requirements for police background checks for aged care workers and certain volunteers in Australian government subsidised aged-care services. Also introduced were more frequent unannounced inspections of aged-care homes by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency. These reforms were welcomed by the community. In particular, they were welcomed by families and friends of those older Australians who were in aged-care facilities. In fact, I believe the measures being introduced today and those last year have been in response to community expectations of how old Australians are cared for and will be cared for in the future. I have a close association with many of the aged-care providers in my electorate. In fact, I visit many of the facilities on a regular basis so I can meet and chat with the patients. These visits enable me to ascertain for myself whether those older Australians are happy and receiving the care they need. It is amazing what these very special constituents will share with you over a cup of tea. Some do raise issues of concern but these issues are often very simple to rectify. With the close working relationship I have with my providers I have no problem in raising any issues that residents have and I have always found staff and the providers more than happy to accommodate residents' concerns wherever possible. In MCPherson I have 17 aged-care facilities offering different levels of care: dementia-specific care, high and low care, special and independent care and respite for families. Some of the facilities are run by wellleg- respected church organisations-by Blue Care and Lutheran Aged Care-and others by private providers such as the MCKenzie family, who recently opened Sandbrook, and Don Brearly, who owns and operates Villa Serena at Robina. Many of the newer facilities have been opened only in the last couple of years. The Hon. Tony Abbott officially opened Hill View at Merrimac last year. The team at Hill View do a wonderful job caring for older Australians in this beautiful facility, and they have forged a very strong relationship with their neighbour Merrimac State School. The partnership between the home and the local school has brought together younger members of the community with older Australians. I understand the partnership continues to grow stronger and stronger. The RSL aged-care facility at Currumbin is a wonderful example of caring for many of our returned service men and women. A special ANZAC Day ceremony is held at the facility which is well attended by the local community. Each of the facilities has special tributes and I know that the majority of agedcare providers give excellent care. In fact, many of the workers I speak to regard their duty of care to our vulnerable, frail and older Australians as paramount. Strong bonds of friendship are forged, and I know many staff who have grieved like a family member when one of their patients has passed away. Although we have excellent facilities delivering optimum care, it is our responsibility as a government to continue to strengthen the legislation, particularly in light of a number of unfortunate incidents, including alleged sexual and physical abuse, which came to light last year. These types of incidents should not and will not be tolerated by this government. The community expects a high standard of care for our older Australians and, through the bill before the House today, that high standard of care will continue. The system will be improved and made more effective by the measures before the House to ensure that physical and sexual abuse is reported through a compulsory reporting scheme which will protect the people who make the disclosures about abuse. The bill establishes a requirement for approved providers to report allegations or suspicions of unlawful sexual contact or unreasonable use of force on a resident in a residential aged-care service. The report must be made to both the police and to the Department of Health and Ageing. It must also be made as soon as possible and not later than 24 hours after the allegation or suspicion comes to the attention of the approved provider. Under the changes approved, providers will also be required to ensure that there are internal processes in place for the reporting, by staff, of all incidents involving alleged sexual or serious physical assault. Staff members will be able to report to the apat- proved provider or the approved provider's key personnel or other authorised people. The bill also enables staff members to report directly to the police or the department. This may occur where, for example, a staff member does not feel comfortable reporting alleged incidents to the home. Failure to have the necessary systems and protocols in place, and failure to report incidents, will indicate regulatory non-compliance, leading to the possible imposition of sanctions. The bill underpins these new compulsory reporting arrangements with protection for people who report the abuse. It has been recognised that staff are more likely to report incidents of assault where they do not fear reprisal from their employer or indeed other staff members. The legislation ensures that staff members who make disclosures about assaults have their identity protected and ensures they are not victimised in the workplace. The legislation also protects disclosers from civil and criminal liability in relation to the disclosure. A court also has the authority to order that an employee be reinstated or paid compensation if their employment is terminated because of the fact that they made a protected disclosure. These aspects of the bill are important because they protect staff from disclosure. More importantly, they mean that staff can feel comfortable about reporting-that there are protective measures in place which will encourage them not to fear reprisal when reporting incidents. A further measure in the bill is the establishment of a new and independent Aged Care Commissioner relacing the existing Commissioner for Complaints. The previous Commissioner for Complaints was limited within the scope of the previous legislation to undertake investigations and to take action. This bill enhances the role of the commissioner and also enhances the manner in which complaints are handled. A new Office of Aged Care Quality and Compliance has been established within the Department of Health and Ageing and it is responsible for investigating any information about possible non-compliance by approved providers. The office will have the power to investigate all complaints and information. It will have the power to determine whether a breach of the approved provider's responsibilities has occurred. When a breach is identified the office will have the power to require the approved provider to take appropriate action to remedy the breach. More importantly, the office will have the capacity to issue notices of required action to providers who have breached their responsibilities and take compliance action where the provider fails to remedy the issue. The new Aged Care Commissioner will provide an independent mechanism to hear complaints about action taken by the new Office of Aged Care Quality and Compliance in the investigation of complaints and also about the conduct of the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency and its assessors. The Aged Care Commissioner will also have the capacity to undertake ‘own motion' reviews. It is proposed that the new arrangements will take effect from 1 April 2007. Prior to that time line, the department will be issuing approved providers with information and guidelines on the new requirements. It is important that the government continues to work with all stakeholders to ensure the best possible measures are put in place to protect the most vulnerable in our communities. The measures introduced in the legislation are in response to concerns and issues raised directly with the minister, and the government has responded-and responded, I believe, in a positive way that will ensure families, residents, nurses, care workers and providers all have a very clear understanding that abuse of the elderly will not be tolerated. It is unacceptable that any form of sexual or serious physical abuse is perpetrated on the elderly. There is protection for the elderly and, because of the new compulsory reporting arrangements, there is protection for the staff. I commend the legislation to the House.",126
214,Mr HATTON,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"Blaxland) (5.17 pm)The Aged Care Amendment (Security and Protection) Bill 2007 is a sad bill to come before the House because it deals with very difficult areas. Questions of sexual or physical assault in aged-care premises send a shudder throughout the community because people in those areas of residential care are by their very nature relatively more vulnerable than people outside them. The reason for that, of course, is that 96 per cent of the Australian population still maintain themselves outside this kind of residential care. That figure has probably gone down in the last few years, since 1995 or so, but we are still looking at that order of magnitude. Most people can maintain themselves at home. Most people still have a close family relationship. They live either with a sibling at home or with their spouse until the spouse dies, or they have other connected family close to them. They have what we would see as a normal environment in which to operate and one in which the same occasions for the commission of sins are not there. It is not the same cloistered environment that you would find in this kind of residential place or in any of those other places where these kinds of things have been a problem over time-the boarding school environment and other closed environments, whether in the armed forces or closed academies, where you get congregations of people outside the normal family environment. We know that physical and sexual assault can happen within the family context in the family home, but the measures here in this bill deal with a particular and different context. We have a different structure now to the one we had in the seventies, eighties or nineties and since the member for Mackellar was the minister. The structure then has been described as ‘ageing in place' and it was based on the model where you would have one place that a person went into-they might go into a self-care unit. We now have a series of places where there are self-care units and, by and large, people just live the way they did in their original homes. It is a smaller area to take care of and there is a commonality in terms of dealing with all of the needs of the people. The common grounds are looked after, there is an on-site medical service and a nursing service if people get into trouble and there is also a range of other services available. That facility is often combined with a hostel so that if people get to the point where they are no longer capable of looking after themselves in their own self-care places they can move into a hostel. It is a much smaller room-usually just one room with en suiteand there are common meal facilities. It is a much closer arrangement where more of the difficulties outlined in this bill in terms of sexual and physical assault can occur and, indeed, have occurred. Where such assaults are less likely-but there is still the potential for them to occuris at the very end of the process when people have been put into full nursing home care. Prior to the changes we made when we were last in government it used to be that people were inappropriately placed in full nursing home care when their condition was such that they should have been in a hostel or in their own self-care unit. So it is a question time and place and of being put into an environment that people are not used to and one with the potential for sexual or physical assault to happen and for those assaults to be relatively concealed. There are particular notations in the bill with regard to people who have dementia because there need to be exceptions to the reporting requirements where they are concerned. There has been a debate about whether there should be compulsory or mandatory reporting. This bill says that there should be compulsory rather than mandatory reporting. One of the reasons for it not being mandatory is people suffering from dementia. We know that those who do suffer from dementia can have a string of different responses over time and, in some people, there is a progression where they become very physically aggressive as they lose their sense of themselves and their normal control mechanisms in interactions with their family. They can become extremely aggressive and, although they are affected mentally, they do not have a loss of physical power. I know from people in Bankstown who are in those circumstances, who have relatives who need that kind of care, just how difficult it is when a person develops that kind of response. A person who was a normal, loving husband throughout his life who develops into something else can be extremely confronting. That can happen in situ, at home. I am aware of cases where that has happened and where there has been relatively no protection for the spouse from the husband affected by dementia who becomes physically aggressive-except for taking out an AVO or taking other measures to address it. It also happens in residential care situations, but there it should be dealt with more easily and in a more orderly way because they have specific dementia care units. But of people are so physically strong in these circumstances, the adrenalin runs so high, that it can be very difficult to deal with them. I have considerable concern about the manner in which this bill has come before us, with very little time for us-certainly for me-and particularly the shadow minister to consider these matters. The government can say: ‘Well, we've made a quick response. We've come through with a bill that is substantial, small and narrow in focus, but that substantially meets the complaints that have been made. We're putting this into place and we're going to get it through the parliament as quickly as possible.' What is the driver behind this? Media reports of physical and sexual abuse. Those media reports have been recent. The action taken here has already been underlined in arguments on the other side as a speedy reaction. The government have come forward; they have reacted. Normally, the proper thing to do here would be, first, to have had full consultation with the industry to see how widespread and deep these problems are, and then to take speedy action-action that is based on extensive consultation, to ensure that what you are putting into place will really work and work effectively. Second, you would expect that the opposition in this place and in the other place would deal with this in an appropriate manner-well, for that to happen, it is often good to give people a brief on the legislation and allow them to look at it! But here we have a situation where the bill was referred for inquiry by the government on Wednesday, 7 February, and tabled in the House on Thursday, 8 February, and we are debating it today, Wednesday, 14 February. The Senate inquiry is not due to report for a full month, not until 14 March, and then the expectation is that the measures will be implemented on 1 April of this year. What that means, as the shadow minister has argued, is that, firstly, the bill has been rushed in. The shadow minister was not able to see the bill before the government recommended it to the Senate legislation inquiry. Secondly, the principles that support the bill are still in draft form and have not yet been sighted. Thirdly, the bill only came after media reports of sexual abuse in residential aged-care facilities. This last point is telling, given the alacrity with which the government has put the bill forward, because what has happened is exactly the opposite. The provisions of this bill are being implemented two years after the Senate committee inquiry into aged care, with its report entitled Quality and equity in aged care, found deficiencies in the operation of the current complaints resolution scheme and made recommendations to improve the system that go to these very matters. The impetus behind this bill was getting the media coverage: if the coverage is embarrassing enough then the government will move-without adequate consultation. The aged-care providers who are tagged in this bill with requirements for compulsory reporting of suspected physical or sexual assault, by and large, as far as we understand, are willing to take part in the Senate inquiry and are willing to take the measures in the bill forward and put them into place, but they think that they really do need to be part of this process. And a whole series of technical amendments may arise that we will have to look at later, after this has been through the Senate process. Fundamental parts of this bill deal with the new compulsory reporting arrangements, which require aged-care providers to report suspected or alleged sexual abuse and serious physical assault of residents, and, further, require them to have internal processes within the organisation for staff to report all incidents of suspected or alleged sexual abuse or serious physical assault. The identity of staff who report incidents will be protected; there is protected disclosure. There are a number of measures in the bill that go to this situation. As I said at the outset, this is a difficult area. It is difficult sometimes to know, unless it is blatantly in front of you, whether an assault is a direct assault on a person, particularly when it is of a sexual nature. It is ticularly difficult when people who have dementia or who suffer from a range of other problems are the ones doing the assaulting. These assaults do not always occur in the way that people think and they need to be looked at closely. There is a sensible proposal in this bill appoint an Aged Care Commissioner to look at complaints and deal with them. This means not only that there is a greater capacity to investigate the complaints but also that the investigation will be done by someone outside the process. We know that all of the aged-care facilities in my electorate have improved over time, but a number of them which were mentioned in dispatches some years ago have had to significantly improve the way in which they do things. This relates to what they are tasked with, the normal tasks that they have. The majority of those providers which are part of the network have always carried out those tasks. The Uniting Church has provided a significant number of places in Blaxland. Also our Bankstown aged-care organisation provided four basic hostels and now has a magnificent complex up at Georges Hall. People know how difficult it is to adequately provide for not only people's needs but also the particular areas addressed in this legislation. This is very much the case in the dementia care units. In these units you are looking at potential physical and sexual assaults almost from unguided missiles-from people who have lost the restraints and constraints that they used to have prior to being affected by dementia. So it is important that these measures are put into place. The dementia aspect is extremely significant. I want to make the debate a little broader. There are significant language problems that demand a great deal not only of service proparviders but also of the staff in nursing homes in an electorate like Blaxland. This is the case in not only the existing electorate but also the new, redistributed Blaxland. Those language problems are significant and deep. This concerns all of those people who came here postwar. A lot of people who came from to Europe who were from peasant backgrounds left school at primary school age, like most Aussies did before World War II. They were adequate in their own local dialect but they had difficulty with the broader language, be it Italian or Greek-the demotic language of the country. To come here at the age they did meant it was difficult to then go and learn English. As those groups have aged, one of the fundamental problems they have had to deal with is the fact that they cease to have the capacity that they had when they were in the workforce-as good, bad or medium as it was-to deal with other people more readily. They retreat to their original language. If you do not have adequate services to help them then they can be imprisoned in that original language and go back to their original mode of going about things. It is only the family that can help to sort it out, as the young kids used to do when they were at school. The schoolkids used to sort out the problems their parents had. There are specific cases just outside my electorate. St Basil's Nursing Home is a wonderful facility run by the Greek community. It was set up specifically to address the problems in the Greek community. It is open to the rest of the community but is able to address that particularly significant problem of language. It is not just about food or cultural requirements; it is about the problem of people not being able to communicate their needs. In this area they also need to communicate problems of physical or sexual assault on them. How do you deal with this? More than one person in five in my redistributed electorate of Blaxland is Vietnamese. Among that vast community of people who are Vietnamese are those who went through a brutal civil war that the communists finally won. There are people who ended up in camps or in prison and who were part of the refugee efflux in the seventies and eighties. They have been here for more than 30 years and have carried enough crosses in their lives. They have established themselves, worked hard and built strong communities based on their fundamental family and community values. They are the backbone, with their children and grandchildren, of our professional class-the doctors, dentists and lawyers-because they work so hard. There is not a single nursing home in my electorate with a dedicated language facility for people of Vietnamese background. I went just a week or so ago, in the break, to a Vietnamese and Indochinese elderly group to speak to them and see what their concerns were. I had heard before what they were, but this is the first time that this has come into my electorate since I have been the member. In 1984 we had part of it. It includes Cabramatta, Canley Vale, Lansvale and Lansdowne. In that area there is a very high concentration of Vietnamese. There are 1,000 people within this aged-care group. Most of them live in their own homes and come to this group for support once a week. There is a part-time employee five days a week, for four hours a day, doing excellent work, together with four volunteers who roll in every day in order to help the people who have problems, to refer them to federal or state members or to council to sort out their problems with departments. Those kinds of facilities are available to people, but they do not have a dedicated aged-care facility where they can seek to help those people who are language dependent. The group have just initiated a process to look at setting up a hostel and to work within the community to get the money together to do that. I have committed myself in the next term to doing everything I can to support them in setting up a hostel program or an aged-care facility with federal, state and community support, not only from the Vietnamese community but from the community generally. These are the particular results of living in a society based on migration. We did not do enough previously, and there were a series of decades in which not enough was done to help people settle. This is still part of the settlement process, 30 and 40 years on. It is inevitable that when people go into residential care there is a shutdown in their capacity to deal with people who are not from the same linguistic background. To assist them with all of their needs, but in particular the ones that are dealt with in this legislation, we need trained staff who are capable of translating the problems that these people come up with, translating the allegations. So the area reporting mechanisms need to take that into account. In so many of our facilities, not only in the dementia units but in hostel care and other areas, we have people from a whole variety of language backgrounds. You have the same problem but it is multiplied because there are multiple language problems. That is something else that is not looked at here but that I think needs to be looked at very closely in the Senate inquiry. The providers and the staff, along with the government, need to take account of this and put more resources where they are needed not only for the one in five people in my new electorate who are Vietnamese, where there is nothing at all that is specific-it is very difficult for them to get access-but for the plurality of people.

215,Mr HARDGRAVE,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"The member for Blaxland is pretty close to the mark, but there is one variation I will make on his contribution to the Aged Care Amendment (Security and Protection) Bill 2007. It has nothing to do with the extension of the settlement process, when we start to talk about the need for linguistic skills in aged-care services. For heaven's sake, surely 30, 40 or 50 years after people have arrived in Australia, we should let them know they have settled. I see the new Minister for Immigration and Citizenship here in the chamber. I was the first ever minister for citizenship at the Commonwealth level and one of the things I learned was that there are too many government agencies-federal, state and localwho have a belief that if the Australian government's Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs imported people to this country then forever they must be their problem. We really have to understand that our cultural diversity, our linguistic diversity and our religious diversity are very much at the heart of what makes Australia what it is today. Departments like the Department of Health and Ageing have got to have programs that give assistance to providers to offer linguistic skills, cultural skills, religious skills-even food skills. Perhaps providers can be given an opportunity to set up wings in their facilities that can be dedicated to particular groups within the community. There are some great private providers in my electorate. Over time they may be able to provide 20 beds out of 100 for aged people from the Dutch, Greek or Italian communities and, over time, perhaps those from the Vietnamese community, the next group in the community to see its population in Australia age. The member for Blaxland and I will both have to deal with people from the Sudanese, Somali, Ethiopian and Eritrean communities. He has a 100 per cent right to say that this is something in public policy that has to have a sensible aspect to it. So I will join with about 90 per cent of what he has said. But I ring the bells: this will not ruin his re-election in Blaxland-he has got the numbers locked up. Here you have the Liberal member for Moreton-the most culturally diverse seat in Queensland-agreeing with the Labor member for Blaxland on the point that we have to look at the whole of our society when we make our plans about this. I think he is also right in the point he makes about the bill before us on the establishment of the aged-care commissioner, who will be a point of reckoning, a responsibility mechanism, who will report to the minister about the sorts of violations that have occurred, about the attacks on elderly people, on vulnerable people-whether they are sufferers of dementia or whether they are simply physically infirm. From time to time there may be exploitation of older people. Any time it happens is too much. I think I heard the Minister for Ageing, Senator Santoro, say that a few months ago in responding to some horrific reports. We have to be very clear that aged-care sector professionals today are offering dayto-day assistance to those who helped to build this country, the nation builders, particularly the post World War II generation who are now starting to age. Aged-care workers are champions. They do things that I personally would find very difficult, almost impossible, to do-certainly outside of my immediate family. They offer care and they put in extra effort in so many different ways, working unpaid overtime. I have met too many aged-care workers in that circumstance. I do not know whether many owners of aged-care facilities understand exactly what it is that the workers in those places do and the difference that they make through their very personal care and attention for the patients in their care. I am talking about not only those in institutions but also those who are ageing in place, ageing at home. Over the last 10 or 11 years, this government has embarked on making available to people more packages so they can age in place. That makes a difference. Perhaps, to reflect further on the contribution of the member for Blaxland, it also creates another set of probhome lems because of their isolation. Those sufferMile ing from dementia who are ageing at home may revert to the language of their childhood. We find people who are perhaps even further socially isolated and trapped by those who have the linguistic skills to care for them, who become gatekeepers and controllers of their everyday lives. In fact we hope that their inheritance and dignity are in the control of good people. That is what the aged-care commissioner will of course deal with. I think back to when we first came to office in 1996. In Queensland there was an absolutely chronic shortage of aged-care beds. There was a huge problem in Queensland. From memory, Victoria was way oversubscribed. I know the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Andrews, is from Victoria, and he was once the Minister for Ageing. At the end of it, Victoria's entitlement was way oversubscribed from our point of view as Queenslanders. We fought hard to get further beds allocated to Queensland. There was an accelerated program for Queensland. The Prime Minister listened to us. We worked with him to make that difference in our own area. I have looked backwhich I can afford to do in preparation for this discussion-and in my area of Moreton alone there has been a doubling of the number of places and a quadrupling off the base of the amount of money that is expended in aged care. So not only has the number of institutional places doubled but also we have added the community aged-care packages. There were zero in 1995-96 and 187 in 200506. That in itself explains that we not only put pressure on the Prime Minister and the Treasurer back in 1996-97 to get some way forward but also have actually been able to deliver on that. I have new aged-care facilities in my area that are fantastic-for instance, the Regis at Salisbury. The new facility at Eight Plains which the Bethany Christian Care have in place is without doubt, like the Regis home, an exemplary example of agedcare practices, with 32 high-care beds and 64 low-care beds. This is a facility that will continue to grow. I know that Minister Santoro actually opened that facility in Underwood Road last year, and I was very pleased to be there with him. On raw statistics alone, the electorate of Moreton now has 408 high-care beds and 550 low-care beds. I have figures from the Department of Health and Ageing that back up that claim, but I very much want to place on the record my enormous sense of gratitude to those aged-care workers who work in so many different places to make a difference for people who deserve to have a difference made for them. I know that there are a number of agedcare facilities on the south side of Brisbane that have had a history of long service. Because of this government's reaction to the understandable public pressure being applied to update and upgrade facilities, they may face some changes to their circumstances as new facilities may have to replace the old. That seems to be a concern in the sector now, and of course government support to assist with a lot of the practical infrastructure is there-but not in a complete sense, I know. Nevertheless, we have partnerships with private providers like Churches of Christ, TriCare, the Uniting Church, organisations to do with the Catholic Church and others, and the Russian Benevolent Association. The way in which Serge Voloschenko and his team have made a difference at Pine Lodge for 30 or 40 years, offering Russian-speaking assistance to people, is now being met by the enthusiasm of others in the community who want to do more for their particular parts of my enormously culturally diverse local area, and of course I speak of the work being done by the Jeta Gardens corporation. Jeta Gardens have established themselves at Bethania, in the member for Forde's electorate, 20 minutes by rail from Sunnybank in my electorate. Choe Lam Tan and his consortium members have set out to establish a marvellous aged-care facility which will have a Buddhist feel about it. I do not know about you, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I may want to age as a Buddhist at a later point in time. It might be a very nice and peaceful way to go out. I am not sure what my parish priest will make of it, but it might be a very pleasant way to go out. Jeta Gardens are not saying it is only for Chinese and it is only for Buddhists; it is certainly for anybody who wants to be a part of that particular style of aged-care service, and they are opening their doors to a broad range of people. Of course they are following on from the work that has been done by the 310-year-old Catholic order of the Sisters of St Paul de Chartres, marvellous people who, at Boronia Heights in the member for Rankin's electorate, provide beds for all sorts of people from all sorts of backgrounds. This is a Chinese order that has been providing this service for decades, but the order itself is some 310 years old. I remember speaking in this place on the occasion of their 300th anniversary. The sisters there have provided support for all sorts of people. My own grandmother spent some days in respite there about 18 years ago. I make the point about this diversity because I think the member for Blaxland put me on that particular tangent. But at the end of it there is an opportunity for groups in our communities to participate in the dignitygiving which aged-care services should and are providing in this country, and what a difference a decade has made as far as agedcare services are concerned in this nation. Of course with this bill we have an ambition to do more. I thank Minister Santoro for the very deft way in which he has responded to not only the demands that have come out of the media inquiry but, of course, a lot of other interaction about the needs for compulsory reporting, not to put unnecessary pressure on aged-care professionals but to back the good ones by helping to expose if there are any bad ones in their midst, thus giving a structure and some certainty to people who are in the broader community that there can be a great deal of public confidence about the way the aged-care sector actually operates. The safety of the residents is of paramount importance to us as a government, as it is to aged-care sector workers, those people who make a difference. Increasing the quality of care is something that we must do, because as this government has continued to invest its money in packages so that people can stay at home-and these staying-at-home packages have been enormously popular-it tends to be that those who actually arrive at the doorstep of an aged-care facility may well be those who need a higher level of care than may have been the case a decade or more ago. Increasing the quality of care and maintaining a decrease in the risk factors associated with the delivery of that care to residents are, I believe, absolutely vital. The local RSL has undertaken a project. I have raised it in this place before, but I raise it again because it is relevant to part of the way forward. As we start to demand a higher level of care, increase the quality of care and back the professional providers at the coalface-and I am not so much talking about those who have the nice big cars and the wood-panelled offices; I am talking about the nurses and those working at the aged-care bed level-it is important that we in fact encourage another stream of people into this sector, and what the RSL at Sunnybank has done is to engage a couple of local high schools in my electorate. It is a fantastic ject. Runcorn High School students and St Thomas More College students have been given a chance to work at the two RSL homes in my electorate. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, when you had the role of Minister for Veterans' Affairs you came along to Cazna Gardens at Sunnybank Hills-‘Cazna' being ‘ANZAC' backwards in case no-one can read that properly. Cazna Gardens and the Carrington home at Parkinson have been places where these students have gone on a weekly basis as part of their school work to actually interface with older Australians in these aged-care facilities. From the residents' point of view it is an opportunity for them to talk with and engage with a new generation. There are all of the fun things like learning about the internet and computers and so forth. But, for the young people, they have a chance to actually engage on the dignity, and the importance of dignity, associated with ageing. When you actually go along and talk with these kids, you see the fact that they have coped with even the worse set of circumstances. One 16year-old girl had one of her charges die during her time at one of the homes. The way in which she learned to cope with that and the way in which she was supported by the teachers of her school and the RSL in general I think does set a very good pattern of conduct. From my point of view, I want to see those kids' efforts actually rewarded with some kind of certified outcome from that training. It is the elementary stage of agedcare professional training and it should be recognised as such. I think it is very important that we encourage people from all sorts of backgrounds and all sorts of language backgrounds to be involved in this process, particularly in an area like mine. I know that the Charlton Brown College in Brisbane has in fact been dealing prowith those who have come in through the migration program. They have come to Australia perhaps as refugees. They have come with skills which have not been recognised in Australia because of the cumbersome way in which our occupation group recognition occurs and sometimes because of the professional capstones applied by organisations such as unions and state governments. I know of one chap who came from Eritrea who was a trained registered nurse in Eritrea. That would not be recognised here because of what I have just said and because of the conditions I have just outlined. This chap in fact has undergone further training through Charlton Brown College and he is now out there working in the aged-care facilities. What is really great about it is that, no matter what the complexion or the shape of face of the person offering the care, these people are involved with other people who might be of completely different ethnic or linguistic backgrounds. They are part of the changing face of aged care in Australia and, indeed, so it should be. When this government came to office there was an aged-care expenditure of $3.1 billion. Annual government outlays now have increased to $9.9 billion by 2010-11. That is a threefold increase. When we came to government there were issues left undone by the previous administration in my own local area alone which saw people facing the hostile prospect of having to pay more for aged care because of the failure to invest in aged care by that previous government. They were too busy clocking up enormous amounts of government debt and too busy dedicating too much government expenditure to the repaying of that debt, with a $10½ billion interest rate bill in 1996-97. They were too busy putting Australia into debt to actually concentrate on investing in Australia's long-term future. When you think about the numbers, you realise that this country is ageing quickly. Within 50 years the number of people aged 65 will almost triple, from 2½ million today to around 7.1 million by the year 2051-that is when I will turn 91, so I will be stuck in that particular category-and it will go from about one in eight in the population to about one in four. You then realise that we have to gear this sector up for the long term. We have to make families understand that it is not a matter where, when someone reaches a certain age, they are flicked off to aged care. Families have to take primary responsibility, as they should, for the older members of their family. They should indeed be the first port of call. We have helped to resource that with increases in respite for carers, increased carers allowance and increased investment through community aged-care packages. But, when the day does come that someone loses the physical or mental capacity to look after themselves, and when a doctor decides that they actually now need the professional caregivers, we have to make sure that those professional caregivers are well trained and well resourced. To me it is always a no-brainer. There is a no-brainer in this allocation of government resources question. The first place that the resources should go is always to the patientcaregiver equation. It should not be filtered through massive bureaucracies, choked off and used for paying off a whole pile of people in the process before that care is given, like that fabled episode of Yes, Minister in which the most efficient hospital was the one with no patients. We do not want a system that operates like that. We want something that recognises and resources first and foremost that professional caregiver equation with their patient. That is why this legislation is in fact so important. While those opposite have been promising an aged-care policy for over two years, but have failed to produce it, this government has recognised it cannot just rest on the great achievements to date and be satisfied that the last 10 or 11 years is good progress; it also has to make sure that the progress to come will set Australia up for the long term. That is what this government is about-responsible economic management delivering the dividends to everyday Australians where and when they need them. Therefore, I absolutely recommend this legislation to the House.",133
216,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Aged Care Amendment (Security and Protection) Bill 2007. In doing so I feel compelled to digress for a moment, if I may, in following the member for Moreton. There is absolutely no doubt that we have in the aged-care sector some of the most dedicating, hard working and committed people at that coalface he talked about, giving wonderful service to our aged members of the community who need to be in aged-care facilities for one reason or another. The little caveat I would put over that when he talks about the extracurricular activity that they undertakethe overtime without pay and the extra things they do-is that, whilst not wishing to rain on his parade too much, one of the biggest questions in aged care now and for some years has been how we actually attract those people into the sector, how we maintain them in the sector and how we actually pay them appropriately within the sector. Maintaining and paying are two of the big questions. I am virtually agreeing with the member for Moreton but putting a bit of a warning around his words. Whilst some of those hard working staff do in fact go that extra mile, they really should not be required to. There should be sufficient numbers of them in there and they should be getting paid sufficiently so that, when they get in there, we actually hang onto them. That is a very big thing that government, no matter what their colour, needs to attend to. Another thing that both the member for Moreton and the member for Blaxland mentioned-again a bit of a digression-was the comment about elderly people who, in their later years and with a little bit of dementia, can sometimes resort to a native language other than English. I want to mention briefly a program that I came across in my electorate late last year. Communities@Work, a community service organisation in the southern end of my electorate, decided to try a program giving access and guidance on computer skills to some of those very people. They got a number of laptops and they went along and engaged with some elderly folk, some of whom had a little bit of dementia, in aged services. Not only did those people graduate-I had the pleasure of presenting graduation certificates to these folk-but those who had retained or regained their mother language suddenly had access, through the internet, to the newspapers of their country of origin. Many had not seen newspapers from their home country in their local language for 30, 40 or 50 years. A side benefit that the people who were running the program were delighted to see was that all of a sudden this dear elderly soul with dementia or with a bit of nostalgia suddenly found he or she could read, via the internet, the newspapers in their mother tongue from their home country. They were delighted. It was a very good program and I hope we will see more of those programs. But, as I said, I gress. The Aged Care Amendment (Security and Protection) Bill 2007 will introduce new compulsory reporting arrangements, with requirements for aged-care providers to report suspected or alleged sexual abuse and serious physical assaults of residents. It will also require providers to ensure there are internal processes in place for the reporting by staff of all incidents of suspected or alleged sexual or serious physical assault and that the identity of staff who make those reports is protected and that staff who report are not unfairly treated as a result of making a report. The bill also gives the Department of Health and Ageing greater capacity to investigate complaints and to require aged-care providers to correct failures to meet their responsibilities. A new Office of Aged Care Quality and Compliance within the department will be responsible for this. The bill replaces the current Commissioner for Complaints with a new Aged Care Commissioner to provide an independent mechanism to hear complaints about how the department has responded to complaints and about the conduct of the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency and its assessors. The Aged Care Commissioner will also have the capacity to initiate their own reviews. This bill provides solutions for the protection of residents in aged-care facilities from sexual and physical abuse. It is a sad reality that this legislation is needed. It is a fact that abuse has occurred. I must at this point recognise the absolute courage displayed by family members of victims of abuse in these sorts of circumstances. I clearly recall the that ABC Lateline program of 20 February 2006. The story revealed by the family-from memory, I think it was the granddaughtersof an aged-care resident, talking about the abuse suffered by their grandmother in an di- aged-care facility, was both extremely confronting and most disturbing. I understand, from my knowledge of my community, that in the past incidents of abuse have occurred within my community of Canberra-few and far between but they have occurred. There have also been allegations of less serious, but nonetheless equally disturbing, abuse and behaviour affecting some residents in aged care. This legislation is part of the government's response to these types of events In my experience, the majority of agedcare providers give care and security to their residents in a highly professional and highly competent manner. I recognise this and I commend them for the contribution they make to our society and to the lives of those in their care. I understand the aged-care sector has been involved in consultation processes leading to this legislation and is reasonably comfortable with the bill's intent. The sector, however, is also supportive of a detailed inquiry, which may result in some technical amendment. As I said earlier, the major elements of the bill are the requirement for compulsory reporting, the protection of those who report, the establishment of ‘investigative principles' by regulation and significant changes to the aged-care complaints process. I welcome the elements of protection of those who report. The legislation requires that staff members who make disclosures must have their identities protected and must not be criticised. It further protects disclosers from civil and criminal liability. I also note the inclusion investigation principles. The bill proposes changes to the departmental section of aged care quality and compliance which will be established as the Office of Aged Care Quality and Compliance. The Office of Aged Care Quality and Compliance will have the power to investigate all complaints. In the case of a breach, the office will have the power to require the approved provider to remedy the situation and apply sanctions if necessary. I note the significance of the change to the way complaints about aged care generally will be dealt with under these new provisions. I am very aware of the frustration of people who make complaints under the current system, which has called merely for mediated resolution. This has plainly not worked, and I am only sorry to see how long it has taken to come up with an alternative approach. A further change is the insertion of a new part into the act to establish the Aged Care Commissioner. The Aged Care Commissioner will replace the existing Commissioner for Complaints. They will have the powers to investigate complaints arising from action taken by the new Office of Aged Care Quality and Compliance with regard to investigations and conduct of that office. I understand the commission will also be able to examine certain decisions and complaints that may be made by the office, and make recommendations accordingly. Further provisions in the bill on the role of the commissioner include the commissioner having the capacity to undertake ‘own motion' reviews. The commissioner will advise the minister, at the minister's request, about any matters that may arise from examinations undertaken. In general terms, I welcome the provisions of the bill. I must point out, however, that the process has been far from satisfactory. The of bill has come into the parliament without the shadow minister being able to see it before the government recommended that it proceed to a Senate legislation committee inquiry. The investigation principles that support this bill are still in draft form and have not been sighted. They are being implemented two years after the Senate inquiry report Quality and equity in aged care found deficiencies in the operation of the current complaints resolution scheme and made recommendations to improve the system, including a recommendation for whistleblower protection. I understand the bill is now with a Senate legislation committee inquiry, through which we will be able to examine the workability of the proposals. It is quite possible that amendments may be required after that inquiry. The calls for reformed legislation in this area are nothing new. I believe it is fair to say that the horrific stories that appeared early last year, in particular, prompted the government to finally act. But why has it taken them so long to hear, believe and understand the calls for action over a much longer period of time? I am sure I am not the only member in this place who has talked about these issues in debates in this House in the past. The minister announced that the government would introduce this legislation in July last year, with a start-up date of 1 April 2007. I think it is pretty poor to see the government then rush a bill of this kind into the parliament while virtually admitting amendments will be needed by sending it straight off to a Senate committee. I understand that the committee must report by 1 March. That is a very tight timetable indeed. Yes, these changes are needed and, yes, they have been slow in coming. Our older citizens and their families should feel secure in the accommodation choices they face and make. However, we must note that most abuse of older people actually occurs in the community. Elder abuse is a topic we should all be pursuing and paying greater attention to. Some of our states are conducting programs to support older people and provide community education about combating elder abuse. I believe this government could learn from those projects. This bill does nothing to address the sad reality of elder abuse broadly within our community. I will conclude by again saying that, yes, we need these changes. I am really sorry it has taken a while for them to come. The deplorable situations that became headlines just on a year ago, I believe, were the catalyst for action suddenly occurring. I applaud the fact that action has been forthcoming, and it should not have taken those shocking abuse cases hitting the headlines. They should not have happened but they did. The community deserves to have seen this sort of action long before these cases occurred. I know from my involvement in the aged-care community over a large number of years that there has been discussion about ways to change the complaints mechanisms and the reporting mechanisms, and about ways to handle any situations that occur within facilities. What we have not talked about here, and maybe we should, is what sorts of mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that elderly people within their own homes are equally safely protected. With the greatest of good intent by all the wonderful people out there giving services, if we believe this sort of behaviour and action is required within facilities I would ask whether we need to look carefully at what we are doing outside facilities, where there has been a growth in the uptake of people choosing to receive aged-care services within their homes. On that note, I would like to add that I also strongly support the option for the provision of aged-care services in people's own homes, but only in cases where it suits them, where they need it and where the support structure around them can encourage and endorse it. Families are not to be made to feel bad about the fact that facility care is occasionally needed, and when it is needed we should equally support those people as well. I have been happy to speak to this bill, and I look forward to seeing the outcome of the Senate inquiry.",137
217,Mrs HULL,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"It is a great pleasure to rise to talk on the Aged Care Amendment (Security and Protection) Bill 2007 and to finally see addressed a very vexed and difficult issue that we have been looking at for some time in order to see the very best way that we can put in place productive and protective measures that give security for residents, security for families and security for aged-care workers and professionals. I was interested to hear the previous speaker, the member for Canberra, talk about how the federal government should have addressed in this bill elder abuse and the abuse of older people living within the community. It is quite vexing because I cannot understand how the she would suggest that the federal government can do this. It is a law and order issue for the police. How can the government know about the types of abuse that the member was alluding to if it is happening in the home, where there are absolutely no controls by the federal government? These are primarily law and order issues for the policing of communities under the state governments. Perhaps the member was only considering possible or potential abuse by home and community care package service deliverers. I could not quite get the relativity of the criticism that she was making of this bill. This bill will provide greater confidence to the people of Australia about the already high-quality aged care provided in our nursing homes today and every day of the year. It is true that most older Australians would want to remain as long as possible within their homes, close to family and friends and the shops, clubs, churches and community activities that they are familiar with. It a difficult time for people to have to relocate to an aged-care facility. This is often the case in my electorate of Riverina. Many older rural people have to not only enter into aged care but travel to another town and community to find suitable residential aged-care beds, thus leaving their family and friends behind. In many cases, because of that tyranny of distance, they will very rarely have contact with those people in the future. For this reason, many of the people I represent in the Riverina choose not to enter a residential facility until they require very intensive support services. That, I guess, is the key statement: they do not enter until they require very intensive support services. These people need support and they become extremely vulnerable. This amendment bill will give new protection and added protection to aged-care residents. The protection will include compulsory reporting of abuse, protections for those who report those abuses and improved arrangements for investigating the complaints. I cannot imagine how distressing it would be to experience any sort of abuse or unsatisfactory care in an aged-care facility. My strong support is behind this bill. One could use the analogy of a baby who has been put in a childcare centre and who is being abused, who has no voice, who is vulnerable but who has to rely on the carer who is giving them the support. They need to rely on that person in order to have their day-today needs fulfilled. A baby has to have nappies changed and meals provided. A baby has to be fed and needs general nurturing, hugging and comfort when they are hurt or sad. Those are exactly the same types of requirements that you have as an aged person. An aged person becomes vulnerable and frail and in desperation sometimes has to rely on the support of the very person who may abuse can be them. What a sad situation to be in. In some conversations I have had about needs in aged-care facilities it has been raised with me that if you are simply a frail and aged person, you are able to illustrate or voice your concerns or speak about the inappropriate behaviour that might be happening to you. That would be just fine if that were the real case. But frail and aged people are people needing supportive care seven days a week, 24 hours a day, 12 months of the year and they have to rely on their carers. So they are sometimes afraid to speak out about different abuses that they may encounter simply because they are so reliant on the abuser. It leaves me cold with despair and anguish to think that you may be in a situation such that by needing the services of somebody, because your immediate family is not near or you do not have immediate family, you would have to accept physical, emotional or verbal abuse. This is extremely distressing for all of us to think about but some people are in this position. That is why I genuinely welcome the amendments that we have before us in the House that begin the process of addressing, treating and overcoming any of the things that may be happening. Offering protection for those people who complain enhances the workplace of the aged-care worker and professional. It provides them with protection, and the will and the desire to continue working in this very worthwhile industry. It is a very low-paid industry. I think every worker in the aged-care industry deserves a much higher level of remuneration than they currently receive. But it is a lifestyle choice; a choice of career. It is a choice of how you want to spend your working life because you are absolutely committed to the care and well-being of our older Australians who, for the majority, have committed to and done so much for this nation and for its people. When you talk to those in the aged-care sector, it is staggering how absolutely committed to and involved they are with their charges in those facilities. There were reported cases in April and July 2006 of physical or sexual abuse within aged-care facilities. This package of measures addresses those very real concerns and allegations of last year. In his consultation about and determination of what should be in this bill and how it should be delivered, the Minister for Ageing has met with as many people involved in the aged-care sector as possible. He has met with nurses in and managers of aged-care facilities, caseworkers and care workers. He has met with the residents and the very important family members as well. Most importantly, this minister has heard first hand from those people who have been victims of abuse. That is the key area, having it hit fair between the eyes. This cannot be acceptable; under no circumstances can it ever be acceptable that anybody is in this position. So the minister will implement these conditions and guidelines in order to offer protection to our aged-care residents. The minister has also received and responded to emails from the public and has continued, as I said, to hold face-to-face meetings with a wide range of people. I really do support the continuing and ongoing requirement for police background checks for aged-care workers and certain volunteers in the Australian government subsidised aged-care services. There have to be sensible and reasonable views on these police background checks in order that somebody who is absolutely committed to their it is work and who would never inflict abuse is not inappropriately dealt with. Those requirements came into effect on 21 December 2006 and will be implemented progressively from 1 March 2007. We have to have this important inclusion because it will continue to build on the already high level of care we see in and around our electorates-certainly in my electorate of Riverina. I am very, very blessed-I know that I have raised this before and that I continually comment on this in the House-to visit my aged-care facilities on very frequent occasions. In doing so, I have become very familiar with staff and the absolute commitment that they have. Even the accreditation process that was implemented by this government has been an absolutely awesome experience. Yes, it is hard on the staff, but it is security for the residents and their families. have listened to some discouraging remarks and discussion from the opposite side of the House during this debate, but there was no protection for aged-care residents prior to this government coming in in 1996. There was no accreditation required to ensure the quality and standard of service provided to residents. There were no provisions for fire safety and a whole host of other areas. There was no reason to fill in paperwork and forms because they simply were not in existence until such time as this government put in those very strong accreditation schemes, and made them quite rigorous and transparent. It has been a learning process for the facilities, but I can guarantee you that, whilst it is an arduous task, each and every facility absolutely supports it. They absolutely recognise that this has to happen. They have grown and learnt enormously about themselves-about their delivery of service, about the care, comfort and quality they offer the residents and about the very requirements and needs of an elderly person that may have previously been taken for granted and not overly considered in the delivery of these services. So I am very happy to see those frequent, unannounced inspections of agedcare homes by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency to ensure that everyone is complying with care and safety standards for residents. I welcome the increase in spot checks; that simply has to happen. That will ensure a resident's well-being, day-today care and hygiene are looked after. Unless you are doing this you are at risk of being caught out by these spot checks. We have a more robust aged-care complaints-handling process, with investigative powers, and the establishment, thankfully, of a new Aged Care Commissioner. I congratulate the minister on this. The Aged Care Commissioner will provide an independent mechanism for the examination of decisions I made by the Department of Health and Ageing in relation to complaints investigations. I will use my last few minutes to sum up on the compulsory reporting of incidents of sexual and certain physical assaults in residential aged care. I reiterate my support of the protection for those who report. Without that protection-without the ability to speak freely without fearing recrimination and reprisal, of being treated in that whistleblower way-we will not be able to overcome many of the issues that confront our frail and elderly people. The bill establishes the requirement for approved providers to report to the police and to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing incidents involving alleged or suspected reportable assaults. I am very supportive of this. In addition, the approved providers of residential aged-care homes must also take reasonable measures to ensure that staff members report any suspicion or allegation of reportable assaults to the approved provider and to protect the identity of any person who makes a report of a reportable assault within 24 hours of the event. Failure to have the necessary systems and protocols in place and failure to report such incidents will indicate regulatory non-compliance, leading to the possible imposition of quite severe sanctions. I believe that the vast majority of agedcare providers, as most of the speakers in this House have indicated, give excellent care. I believe that the vast majority of aged-care workers regard their duties of care to vulnerable, frail and older Australians as absolutely sacrosanct. But when something does happen that has compromised the health and safety of one of our beloved elderly then we need to have the provisions to ensure that that situation can never happen again, and that it is remedied immediately. I imagine that many families and aged people in aged-care homes who may have been listening to this debate or reading the newspapers to get information on the impending legislation, guidelines and rules will at last feel that aged people will truly and genuinely be protected if they are in the position of being abused. The majority of Australian people would be absolutely filled with repulsion to even contemplate that somebody could molest or abuse any older person. That kind of person and that kind of activity fill us with abhorrence. I say to anybody who may be a perpetrator of this type of behaviour in an aged-care facility or in the community: we are out to get you. You will no longer be able to inflict your insecurities or your viciousness on another person. In the long run, we are going to find those people and they are going to be dealt with. They should never stop recognising that they are under the watch of many Australian people and that their actions will not be tolerated now or in the future. If we can strengthen these bills in the future then we should. I commend the bill and I congratulate the minister.",140
218,Mrs ELLIOT,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Aged Care Amendment (Security and Protection) Bill 2007. Let me say from the outset that Labor supports this bill. However, there are very real concerns, particularly with the timing of this bill. Indeed, these measures are very long overdue and, I believe, should have been acted upon after the Senate report two years ago. One could be sceptical about the motivation behind introducing this bill at this late stage. It does seem to coincide with recent media coverage and it certainly does seem typical of this government's often knee-jerk reactions to any major situations in the community-as opposed to the long-term planning, assessing of situations, making decisions and putting forth legislation that needs to occur. There often seems to be a knee-jerk reaction to media reports in relation to incidents. For the issues that this bill deals with, which are so very important, we should have seen the government acting earlier than this and not just as a knee-jerk reaction to the media. Whilst this bill is supported by Labor in principle, this government could be doing a lot more to address so many of the underlying issues within aged care. There are a whole variety of aged-care issues that need to be addressed. I have raised a lot of issues in the House on many occasions and I will discuss those in further detail later on. This bill introduces new compulsory reporting provisions with requirements for aged-care providers to report suspected and alleged sexual abuse and serious physical assault of residents. This is supported by Labor as it is a very necessary step towards protecting our seniors. Our seniors built this nation and I believe wholeheartedly that it is absolutely right that they be treated with dignity and respect. It is certainly important that these provisions are in place. Unfortunately, as many speakers have commented in relation to this bill, elder abuse does exist within our community. So I am pleased that, after years of lobbying by various groups, these protections are finally being codified. The people they refer to are often the most vulnerable in our community and they are often in the most vulnerable of situations. They certainly deserve and need to have these protections in place. This bill also contains important whistleblower protections so that the identity of staff who make reports is protected and to ensure that staff are not unfairly treated as a result of making such reports. Labor supports the whistleblowing provisions of this bill and I understand that they have also been supported by the union. Provisions such as these protect our valued aged-care workers when they seek to protect their clients. The union has called for provisions such as these for over two years. Whistleblower protection is vitally important in many instances, but certainly in cases such as these it is portant that adequate protections are in place so that people are able to come forward with the issues, action can be taken and they can be protected. I am also pleased that the bill includes the establishment of the Office of Aged Care Quality and Compliance. This will give the Department of Health and Ageing greater capacity and scope to investigate complaints. It is important that complaints are fully investigated and that the processes are in place for that to be able to occur. The appointment of a new Aged Care Commissioner should provide an independent voice in hearing complaints and also assess the department's responses to these complaints. The establishment of the Office of Aged Care Quality and Compliance and the appointment of an Aged Care Commissioner are certainly welcome. As I mentioned earlier, the timing of this bill is somewhat suspect. If one were cynical one might suggest that this bill was rushed through by the minister on the tail of many media reports of abuse in residential aged care. This might explain why the bill was sent to a Senate inquiry even before the shadow minister was provided with a copy of it. I agree that this bill deals with some very urgent issues. However, it simply does not wash that this problem was only recently discovered. Indeed, two years have passed since the Senate report Quality and equity in aged care, which outlined the deficiencies in the current complaints resolution process, was handed down, so one could certainly ask how many of our seniors have had to endure under a system the government was told needed to be fixed and action taken. The Senate report also looked directly at the issue of protection of whistleblowers within the industry. In fact, recommendation vitally im- 17 of the Senate report was: That the Commonwealth examine the feasibility of introducing whistleblower legislation to provide protection for people, especially staff of aged care facilities, disclosing allegations of inadequate standards of care or other deficiencies in aged care facilities. That Senate inquiry was some years ago, but nonetheless these changes are welcome, as is any progress on aged care no matter how large or small, no matter how overdue and no matter what the motivations are. As I have said, Labor does support this bill in principle, and I understand that the aged-care sector is also in broad agreement with the principles of the bill and the outcomes that it will attempt to achieve. Any attention the government pays the aged-care industry is welcome, however belated it may be. So, whilst we may criticise the government for coming so late to the party, I guess we can console ourselves with the fact that they even showed up at all, especially on an important issue such as this. The contribution of aged-care workers to our communities is unparalleled. In my electorate of Richmond 20 per cent of residents are aged over 65, so we have many aged-care workers and we certainly know the value of aged-care workers in our community. I have had the pleasure of attending many aged-care facilities in my electorate, because there are many in Richmond due to the many elderly people who move or retire there. I have been very fortunate to meet with many aged-care providers and workers. I have seen first hand their dedication and devotion and the often difficult circumstances under which many of them work. But what I find really astounding about aged-care workers is that, no matter how many facilities I visit to speak with workers, I usually find that they are people who have been working in the industry for 10 or 20 years or even longer. These people are truly committed to the job that they are doing and it is very common for them to have been there for many years. It really shows the level of dedication that these people have. I will certainly always take time to commend them because they do a very difficult job at times but do it with such compassion and professionalism. This is certainly an industry which has been underfunded, underappreciated and, I believe, a low priority of this government for the past 11 years. And, of course, we need more aged-care workers in Richmondindeed, throughout the country-and we need more adequate training and resources for them in what is obviously a growing industry. Unfortunately, this is not the only area of aged care where the government has fallen behind. Across the board the government has been cutting services for older Australians, from those needing access to specialist health services, to those who are literally begging for home care provisions, to those older Australians needing full-time care in nursing homes. All have suffered under this government. The first sign of contempt the government showed for older Australians was the slashing of the Commonwealth Dental Scheme in 1996. In its haste to foist this responsibility onto state governments, the federal government conveniently forgot the tens of thousands of elderly Australians who relied on the Commonwealth Dental Scheme and now have to do without, often waiting years for treatment. I have said before in House-and I will continue to raise this point-that it is in fact a constitutional responsibility that the federal government fund dental health, but it often seems that those the other side of the House forget this. Perhaps they need to brush up on section 51 of our Constitution, which affirms the federal government's responsibility when it comes to dental health, which is a major issue within my electorate and indeed throughout Australia. My electorate of Richmond is particularly affected by this government's failings in aged care. As I mentioned, 20 per cent of Richmond's population is aged over 65, which I believe makes it one of the oldest electorates in the country. Richmond now stands as a model for the future demographics of this country because it is predicted that, in 40 years time, 20 per cent of this country will be over 65. Richmond really is a snapshot of what our nation will look like in 40 years, so it represents an opportunity to get aged care on the ground right. We recently had an announcement from the government of $1.5 billion in funding for aged care over five years. Whilst this is very welcome, the community have had to wait since 1997 and until the sector was facing an absolute crisis for the government to act. In his Review of pricing arrangements in residential aged care, Professor Hogan said three years ago that funding increases had to happen, and yet it has taken the Howard government till 2007 to make a decision and take some action in relation to that. In the past 11 years the Howard government has presided over a decline in the numbers of aged-care beds available. When Labor left government in 1996 there were 92 beds for every 1,000 people aged 70 years and over, compared with only 85.6 now. In 1996 there was a surplus of 800 beds compared with a shortage of nearly 5,000 now. this Whilst we see in these measures provisions for community aged-care packages or home care packages-which are very welcome because it is a major issue and of course on most people want to be able to stay in their homes for as long as they can; we all understand that-the people of my electorate are specifically interested in how many CAC and EACH packages we are going to see in Richmond. We need to know specifically how the measures are going to translate into the actual CAC package that will be available to people. With the aged-care needs in Richmond, firstly we do not have enough beds in nursing homes. When it comes to home care services, on some occasions there can be a sixor seven-month wait-and that is once people have been assessed. Being assessed is the first stage, and in some cases it can take up to 12 weeks just to get the assessment, and then there is the wait for the provision of those home care services. Again, the people who work in that industry are true community champions. Their dedication and compassion are absolutely fantastic. Yet they have been severely underfunded by the federal government. I want to see a lot more CACPs and EACH packages and a lot more funding for the ACATs so that they can adequately make provisions for home care. I regularly hear from local families desperate to find residential aged care, home care or simply health services for their loved ones. It is not good enough; these Australians deserve our respect, not the contempt that they have had to endure under this government. As I said, our seniors built this nation, worked hard, paid their taxes, contributed to the community and raised their families, and here they are desperately needing some assistance and often being turned away by this government. Looking after our seniors should be one of our first priorities; it is where our attentions should lie. That is where our focus and the funding from this government should lie. We have the opportunity to put in place sufficient resources for aged care, but we must act now, particularly with the ageing of the population. We need to see a lot more action being taken by the government now. In last year's budget the Treasurer failed to address the ever-increasing demand for aged-care services across Australia, particularly in electorates like Richmond. I urge the Treasurer not to be complacent again this year and instead to focus on the needs of elderly Australians and provide funding for the whole variety of services that they need. As the population ages, the need is obviously going to increase dramatically, so we need to have something in place because we truly are at crisis point. As I have said, the problems facing seniors in Richmond are a sneak peek into the future. It is not good. If the government continue with their lack of commitment to agedcare services then we are going to see the same situation of desperate need for greater funding right across the country. It is in the best economic interests of the country to deal with the problems in aged-care services and funding now. They need to be addressed now. The lack of healthcare services, agedcare beds and suitable home care arrangements for our seniors create problems in the wider community. I hear about many cases in my electorate. Many locals tell me about elderly people being forced to stay in hospital because there are no aged-care beds available, and some are going into the emergency ward because they cannot afford to see their GPs. This places greater strain upon our hospitals and is obviously very distressing for the people involved. They often have to wait, particularly in hospitals, for long periods of time before they find a bed in a nursing home. Often those hospital beds and services could be used for others who require more urgent attention. The everyday healthcare needs of our seniors should not be dealt with in emergency rooms. That is not the role of emergency rooms. It places a strain on our wider health community. It causes such unnecessary distress for both the patients and their families. have spoken with many locals who are very depressed because they want to assist their parents or grandparents-their relatives-at this time, and they can see that they are distressed in those situations. It affects whole families and whole communities and has to be addressed urgently. Aged care is one of those areas in which we see the government playing the blame game, as we often see them do. It is issues like these where we need to see national leadership and would like to see the federal government working with the states to improve all areas when it comes to the provisions of aged care particularly, but health care and education as well. Yet it often seems very convenient for the government to play the blame game yet again, rather than saying: ‘We'll take responsibility for this. We'll up. That's what we're here to do.' It is easier for them to say, ‘It's somebody else's fault and we won't worry about it.' It is actually their responsibility and they need to take a lot more action. As I have said, Labor supports this bill. It is welcome, as any improvement in aged care, large or small, is welcome. As a nation we need to prioritise aged care and put in place resources and funding to ensure that there is appropriate aged care in the future, and we need to have the foundations of that now for our ageing population. As I said, the predictions are that in 2040 we will have 20 per cent of the population aged over 65. When we look across the country, the needs of nursing homes and home care packages will be very extreme. I support the protections that this bill will afford those within nursing homes. It is vitally important that that is in place, along with the whistleblower provisions. It is very important that those staff are protected. Ultimately those provisions are to protect resiI dents of nursing homes, who are often the most vulnerable within our community and need to be protected because of the situations that they are in. There are many issues in relation to aged care that I have raised previously and will continue to raise, and I call upon the government to invest more funding in these vital areas. Whilst this bill is very welcome for the protections that it provides, there is still much more that has to be done right across the board. It is a very complex issue and has to be tackled and dealt with effectively. We need to see national leadership on this issue and see the government working with the states, with the community and with the providers to make sure that as a whole we are providing a great degree of support for all of those who require this assistance in their fix it later years. We have many nursing homes within Richmond and I will continue to fight for these issues on behalf of the constituents of Richmond. (Time expired)",144
219,Mr GEORGANAS,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"I am very glad to be in this place giving support for the greater protection of some of our community's most vulnerable members in the form of the Aged Care Amendment (Security and Protection) Bill 2007. I am happy to give in-principle support at this time. Last week the Selection of Bills Committee referred this bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for inquiry. I look forward to reading the thoughts of people in the community on the detail of this bill and to perhaps making further comment after the report is made available in approximately one month's time. I am aware that allegations have been made by members of the community in the past of mistreatment of our elderly citizens within nursing homes. That prospect disgusts me, as it would all members of this House. The notion that adult people can stoop so low as to physically and/or sexually abuse these people is abhorrent. It is absolutely beyond belief that this can happen to the very people who have nurtured this generation and raised probably most of us here, the very people who have served this nation so substantially and selflessly in times of war and crisis and through depressions, paid their taxes and worked all their lives, the very people who have turned this country into the modern, democratic success that we all have the benefit of. The least that we can do for these people is to allow them to live in dignity in their twilight years. So I totally support the full authority of the Commonwealth of Australia being harnessed and directed to protect those Australians who are residents of aged-care facilities and to investigate alleged instances of abuse. It is not just physical and/or sexual abuse involved. There are lots of other forms of abuse, such as financial abuse. Financial abuse of the elderly-that is, taking advantage of the elderly or, for that matter, others in the community-has only been drawn to the public's attention for a relatively short time. With more people saving greater amounts for their retirement, the bigger bank balances simply make them bigger targets for the grubbier thieves and snake-oil merchants that, regrettably, are amongst us. Interest in the physical and/or sexual abuse of elderly Australians has rarely received attention in the past, other than through the very occasional home invasion that we hear about on the nightly news where, against someone of senior years, the most pathetic of all cowards throws away his soul, beating and raping his helpless victim. It is very difficult to even approximate the incidence of abuse within aged-care facilities around the country. It has been suggested that, after applying the ratios from the United States-where mandatory reporting is necessary in law-to the Australian context, there could be as many as 80,000 instances of elder abuse occurring throughout Australia each year. Any incidence of elder abuse is abhorrent, as I said earlier, to all of us in this House, to the majority of Australians and to Australian society. The current federal government did note allegations of rape within Victorian nursing homes in 2005, and I expect they noted similar ones in Queensland sometime later. In the Victorian case, charges of four rapes and two indecent assaults were laid against a former personal care attendant. According to reports, one alleged survivor's grand-daughter described the situation as ‘distressing and horribly sad'-as it would be. The Prime Minister himself reportedly expressed ‘horror, disgust and almost disbelief' at the allegations. This was only six or so months after the damning Senate report of June 2005 identified the limitations of and discouragement within the complaints resolution scheme. So we have a Senate report drawing attention to the unsatisfactory nature of the complaints resolution scheme, six months later the Prime Minister expressing his deepest and most sincere regret that such depravity occurs, the media being fed the line-this is in February last year, mind you; almost a year ago-that ‘new laws loom on nursing home rape', and the minister pledging to stamp out elder abuse in such homes on 13 March last year. Now, in February 2007, some 12 months after the PM expressed his disgust and the honourable senator pledged to stamp out abuse, the government sees fit to throw up this bill, referring it straight off to a Senate inquiry which is only going to report on 14 March, and then the government is expecting the bill to be implemented as early as 1 April 2007. I have never heard of or seen such a serious issue receiving no apparent attention for so long and then, within the space of seven weeks, we hear of a bill racing its way through the system to become law before we know it. My question to the Prime Minister and to the minister responsible is: why for heaven's sake have you taken a whole year to progress notionally satisfactory arrangements, when it only looks like taking you a couple of months to make the changes? Why has it taken a whole year to try to implement this? Why wait a year from the conviction demonstrated in the media before acting? Why wait almost two years from the Senate report's identification of the need to act? I hope the minister has not simply cobbled this together as a part of his homework-as a part of his late-night, last-minute crambefore heading off to his electoral examination. He may have been aware of the problem since becoming minister and he may have been speaking with industry and consumer groups, but to drop a bill on the parliament, send it off to a committee and take as read that it will be law within seven-odd weeks does diminish one's confidence. Whether or not this has gone to cabinet, I do not know. You cannot put much faith in anything coming from certain sectors of the current administration. They did not even seem to be aware of the fact that the Murray-Darling system is not, in fact, within Western Australia. The issue of aged-care abuse deserves serious consideration and sound legislative practice-I hope that is what we have evidence of here, despite the peculiar timetable that this government has selected-but it also deserves attention more urgent than the government has appeared to be prepared to give it. The minister has had the unfortunate task of saving the government from itself on aged care. Only given some 12 months to resurrect the government's pretence of caring about aged care, after 10 years of aged care sector neglect, reliance on phantasm and delivering little more than deep concern within the aged-care sector, the minister has just announced a sum of money to be delivered over five years-in an election year. That is most surprising. This, after allowing the aged-care sector to starve for funds to the point of dropping to its knees. The government created, through its own lack of interest in the sector and its obsession with playing to interest groups, a funding system that never worked. Remember the time of the kerosene baths? Mr Murphy-That was a disgrace.",148
220,Mr GEORGANAS,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"We all remember that. That was some years ago now but, at that point in time, the government had the bold introduction of a bond for all aged-care residents. It was dropped at the first whiff of electoral backlash. We all recall that from back in 2001. Professor Hogan's review of pricing arit rangements in residential aged care three years ago said that funding had to be increased. In a typical response, we have seen the bravado, bluff and bulldust we are so used to from this government. They have dropped the number of aged-care beds from the high-water mark of 92 beds per thousand people aged 70 years and over in 1996 to the current 85.6 beds. In 1996 there was a surplus of 800 beds in this nation. Today, the government is running a most serious and damning deficit of some 5,000 beds, if you use the government's own formula and quota. That is quite a turnaround in the attention paid to, and care made available to, some of our most needy and dependent Australians. As I said earlier, these people have gone through world wars, they have worked all their lives and they have built the foundations of this nation. The least governments can do for them is to offer them some dignity in their twilight years by giving them the care that they require. Within the electorate of Hindmarsh, which covers suburbs of Adelaide's west and south, the deficit has been growing steadily. The last numbers to come out indicated a 10 per cent increase. It was a 10 per cent increase not in beds but in-wait for it-the shortfall of beds within aged-care facilities. And that was in a very short period of time. The government is running an aged-care deficit of just over 300 beds within my area, and that is according to the formula that the government uses to put out beds. Waiting lists are phenomenal. I do not know how many people contact my office wanting help to find a nursing home bed for their parent or elderly relative, but there are many on a constant basis. Most of them cannot find something within the immediate area, but they do find the odd bed. One elderly person was asked to go to Port Augusta, 300 kilometres north of Adelaide. How can you expect someone to move 300 kilometres away from their whole family structure and their whole community? Mr Murphy-You can't.",150
221,Mr GEORGANAS,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"I do not think that is good enough. According to the Productivity Commission report in 2005-06, over 28 per cent of people assessed as requiring a bed are forced to wait three months or more to actually receive a bed. As I said, it is worse in my area. I had a case of an elderly woman who was a volunteer within the electorate of Hindmarsh. She was a very active person within the community all her life. When she needed a nursing home bed, one could not be found for her, so she spent three months in the Flinders Medical Centre, in a public bed in a public hospital, until a nursing home bed was found. There have been other cases. Recently, a gentleman was in the Royal Adelaide Hospital for nine weeks because a bed was not able to be found for him within the southern or western region. This is a pretty phenomenal issue that is affecting a lot of people. People do not need that sort of hassle at that point in their lives. As I said earlier, they need to be treated with dignity and they need to be given the care that they require and not just be shoved off into a public hospital bed with a shrug of the shoulders while saying, ‘We can't find anything for you.' And if the department does find something it can be 300 kilometres away and they will tell my office, ‘We did find something for them.' I do not think that is good enough. This shows the little interest in the plight of aged care within my electorate and around the country. It also demonstrates that the government is full of rhetoric but fails to deliver. I hope that the debate around the bill currently before us leads to a more successful and beneficial outcome for the people it is meant to serve, as they have served us for many years.",151
222,Mr MURPHY,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"I begin by congratulating my colleague and friend the member for Hindmarsh for his thoughtful and erudite contribution to the debate. The purpose of the Aged Care Amendment (Security and Protection) Bill 2007 is to introduce new compulsory reporting arrangements with requirements for even aged-care providers to report suspected and alleged sexual abuse and serious physical assaults of residents. It also requires providers to ensure there are internal processes in place for the reporting by staff of all incidents of suspected or alleged sexual or serious physical assault, and that the identity of the staff member who reports them is protected and that they are not unfairly treated as a result of making a report. The bill also gives the Department of Health and Ageing a greater capacity to investigate complaints and to require aged-care providers to correct failures to meet their responsibilities. It also provides for the new Office of Aged Care Quality and Compliance within the department, which will be responsible for this. The other important element is that this bill will serve to replace the current Commissioner for Complaints with a new Aged Care Commissioner to provide an independent mechanism to hear complaints about how the department has responded to complaints and about the conduct of the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency and its assessors. As we know, the Aged Care Commissioner will also have the capacity to initiate its own reviews. The debate on this very important bill before the House tonight is timely indeed. Its passage through the parliament comes when we are hearing new horror stories about the abuse of patients in aged-care facilities across Australia. An article titled ‘Aged care abuse', published in the Adelaide Advertiser on 7 February 2007 refers to new allegations of degrading treatment of aged residents. The article refers to shocking allegations of a patient sitting in a urine-soaked bed while eating her breakfast. In this day and age, that is a disgrace. It refers to an allegation that patients' pressure sores were left open for more than an hour because of staff shortages. That is a disgrace too. It also refers to allegaand tions of severe rashes developing on patients who are incontinent. That, too, is a disgrace. Mr Brendan O'Connor-Indeed!",151
223,Mr MURPHY,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"The member for Gorton knows. These allegations are not without substance given the bona fides of the two Flinders University academics who made them. I am referring to Ms Anita De Bellis and Ms Maree Khoo. Should these serious allegations not prick the conscience of the Minister for Ageing, perhaps figures from the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency will. It found that almost 550 agedcare residents were not fed properly and more than 1,000 were not given proper medication-again, a disgrace. It also found that 14 nursing homes fell down on clinical care, 17 on medication management and six on medication-again, a disgrace. The minister would do well to take heed of the numerous other reports of substandard care being afforded to one of the most vulnerable groups in our community. We well remember, in the 39th parliament, a former coalition minister coming to this dispatch box in relation to that disgraceful episode referred to by the member for Hindmarsh, the infamous kerosene baths case. If memory serves me correctly, it occurred in the seat of the former member for Isaacs, the late Greg Wilton. He was one of the most prolific speakers and interjectors in this place, and I can remember him shouting out on many occasions, as the then Minister for Aged Care kept coming to the dispatch box, what a disgrace it was that patients had been bathed in kerosene. This was only a matter of five or six years ago. That was a monumental disgrace and we had the unedifying experience of the then minister defending it. I remember the minister coming to the dispatch box, if memory serves me correctly, on three separate days taking the total 10 questions from our side-so she would have had to answer 30 straight questions-and each time she came to the dispatch box she was more unconvincing than the last. She took absolutely no responsibility for that disgraceful experience. I felt we were witnessing someone who could have been labelled ‘the mistress of projection', because everyone got blamed for that disgraceful episode-it was the accreditation agency or it was the public servants working in the department. The member for Macarthur, who is at the table, appreciates this. It was a monumental triumph for projection. The former minister blamed everyone else and took no responsibility. I thought, ‘I am witnessing the mistress of projection,' because there was no accountability and no acceptance of what had happened in that nursing home. It was a very sad chapter in our history that people could be treated in such a manner. Our frailest Australians deserve the highquality care that they are demanding, yet, despite the Howard government sitting on record billion-dollar surpluses, many residents have suffered from its reckless and lackadaisical approach to many allegations of maltreatment. The Prime Minister has previously stated that he, like any other person, is distressed by individual stories of people not being treated well. The Prime Minister stated, on 30 March 2000: I don't believe for a moment, no matter what tem you have, you wouldn't occasionally have some abuses. I do not doubt the Prime Minister's sincerity when he made that statement. In fact, I am inclined to agree with him. However, the point should not be lost that the government at the very least needs to have these systems in place. This point is most relevant to the bill before the House tonight. It should not take incidents like the disgraceful incident of kerosene baths being delivered to people in aged-care centres for the government to look at toughening the accreditation processes. Nor should it take horrible, disgusting reports of the abuse and assault of elderly people in nursing homes before a government will get around to doing the right thing, as the Howard government has tried to do with this bill. We have a right to expect that our parents and grandparents, some of the most vulnerable members of the community, will be well cared for in nursing homes without the spectre of kerosene baths. We have a right to expect that our parents and grandparents can live in comfort and security within residential aged-care facilities without fear of attack or abuse. The majority of Australia's agedcare facilities offer caring and compassionate service to the elderly. However, there is clearly a minority of aged-care facilities and the rare aged-care staff member that fail to meet minimum decent standards. Systems need to be put in place to protect our parents and grandparents from them, however rare they may be. Members will recall the ABC Lateline program which aired on 20 February 2006. Many Australians were understandably repulsed by allegations of the sexual assault by a male staff member on a 98-year-old woman and three other dementia patients in a Victosysrian nursing home. How could such an assault take place? It is just unthinkable. Further allegations of less serious though equally unacceptable behaviour were aired that evening. They included the allegation that an elderly woman was squirted in the face with a water bottle apparently on three separate occasions. It is a very sad indictment of the nature of human beings that some people will be abused simply because they can be. The assault by so-called aged-care providers on the aged or the frail is an assault on all of us. Unfortunately, evidence of the abuse of the elderly in aged care continues to mount. Questions to Senate estimates reveal that from July 2006 to November 2006 there have been 23 allegations of abuse in agedcare facilities. Four of these allegations have already resulted in charges being laid. Yet the government's moves to tighten regulation of the industry have remained lethargic at best. A more proactive approach to aged care and the need to tighten the seriously inadequate levels of regulation is taking on even greater impetus. In the coming 20 to 30 years members of the baby boomer generation-that is us-will be making the transition to aged care. Mr Byrne-I could say, ‘Speak for yourself,' but I won't.",152
224,Mr MURPHY,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"I am speaking for you too, I think. We must have proper systems and proper standards and greater protections in place to make life a little easier for Austrasupportive lians entering their twilight years. I am sure that every member of this parliament and everyone who works in this place would be horrified if things did not improve. Fortunately, these instances are in the minority, but there should not be any instances. That is the truth of the matter. After years of hard work, the baby boomers will certainly deserve a comfortable retirement and accommodation in aged-care facilities provided by the government. This legislation is part of the government's attempt to use the problems of the past, however belated this response may be, to protect residents in the future. Many aspects of this bill are being implemented two years after the Senate inquiry and report titled Quality and equity in aged care. The inquiry found deficiencies with the operation of the current Aged Care Complaints Resolution Scheme and made recommendations to improve the system, yet here we are debating a bill two years later, and it is now being rammed through parliament without following proper processes. I ask again: why has it taken two years and media reports of sexual abuse in residential aged-care facilities to kick the government into gear? Why does it take the alleged rape of an elderly patient before the bill is presented to the parliament? While Labor supports the bill, the process, as I have indicated, has been far from acceptable. It is completely unacceptable to feign concern that the important measures in this bill have a timely passage through parliament, when the government sat on some important recommendations for two years. I will say it again and again: that is a disgrace. The government has certainly not earned the right to be above scrutiny and accountability in this parliament. I will preface my comments about specific aspects of this bill by saying that, while I am of it, it is only part of a much greater package that is needed if we are to tackle seriously the abuse of older people in Australia. The truth is that most abuse of older people occurs in the community, and, perhaps unsurprisingly, this bill does nothing to address that reality. Had the government pursued a proper timetable with this issue, we could have carefully considered some very important policy measures in much greater detail. We could have analysed other forms of abuse, including but not limited to psychological, financial and emotional abuse or neglect. We could have taken the opportunity to learn a lesson or two from some of our state governments. Rather than looking at a bill which is extremely limited in its scope, we could have looked at some very worthwhile initiatives that support the aged and provide community education about combating abuse. Victoria's swift action to raise community awareness of elder abuse-which I know the member for Gorton is well aware of-the implementation of a new legal and advocacy service for the elderly in community legal centres, and police checks for employees in Victoria's aged-care sector are cases in point. I know that the member for Holt, who is sitting here listening to this debate, is also aware of that. Good on Victoria in relation to these matters. The government could have taken a leaf out of its book. If the government had any further, serious reforms to safeguard older people it ought to have presented them to us today. It cannot rely on the flippant statement in the explanatory memorandum, which states, inter alia: ... the new initiatives that are implemented through this bill are part of a $90.2 million (over four years) package of reforms aimed at further safeguarding older people in Australian Government-subsidised aged care from sexual and serious physical assault. It is no surprise that details are sketchy. Do the details actually exist, despite years of inertia? If they do, the community is entitled to know how much is being expended and on what, as belated as the case may be. The specific elements of the bill I have alluded to deal with: the requirement for compulsory reporting of suspected and alleged sexual abuse and serious physical assault of residents; the protection of those who make such reports; giving the Department of Health and Ageing greater capacity to investigate complaints; the creation of a new Office of Aged Care Quality and Compliance; and the creation of a new Aged Care Commissioner to provide an independent mechanism to hear complaints about how the department has responded to complaints. While concurring with my colleagues on all aspects of this bill, I only make the following observation on the new protections afforded by the bill to those who report an assault. This is a most important protection, and one that will go some way to redressing the situation where witnesses to a vile rape or assault of an aged-care resident only come forward with some trepidation. It is worth noting that there has been at least one occasion where a staff member has failed to report an assault against a 95-year-old grandmother, despite witnessing it. I again draw the attention of members to the Lateline program broadcast on 20 February 2006 in which an unnamed aged-care worker said: You have no recourse to say anything, because if you do say anything, you are then bullied by management, from right up, the head office right the way down. You have no recourse. There is nowhere-you put in reports and say that this is happening. Nothing is ever done. It disappears never to be seen again. That is a disgrace. This can never be allowed to happen again. Staff members, such as the one I have just quoted, should not have to be in the insidious position of knowing what is happening but feeling helpless at instigating change. The legislation requires that staff members who make disclosures must have their identities protected and must not be criticised. Further, it protects disclosers from civil and criminal liability. Unions, knowing better than anyone else the helplessness felt by many of their members, have been calling for whistleblower protection for some time. I ask on their behalf tonight: why have their calls been ignored? Why have staff had to endure feelings which oscillate between trepidation and helplessness? This has been most unfair to the aged-care residents who have suffered from maltreatment, and, to a lesser extent, the staff who have witnessed such maltreatment. I hope that staff will feel empowered by the provisions in this bill and never have to endure a sense of helplessness ever again. It is with this in mind that I will support this legislation, bearing in mind the need for far more comprehensive reforms in the future.",154
225,Mr BYRNE,AGED CARE AMENDMENT,"I commend the member for Lowe for his very passionate and eloquent contribution on an issue that concerns many in my electorate, where I have a large and growing number of people who are 55, 65 and over. They are very concerned about their security and protection when they go into a nursing home. Labor supports the Aged Care Amendment (Security and Protection) Bill 2007 as a step in the right direction. I would like to mention a particular case that someone contacted my office about to highlight the point that this a step in the right direction but that more needs to be done. I have contacted the gentleman concerned and he has allowed me to mention his name. His name is Alan Rogers and his mother lives in a nursing home. Alan is concerned because his mother is elderly and frail-just the sorts of preconditions that the member for Lowe was talking about. In his mother's nursing home there are 30 elderly people in high care. I will not name this nursing home. They are looked after by two people during the evening-two people looking after 30 people with high-care needs. He was very concerned about this. For example, what would happen if one person was sick and there was only one person looking after those 30 people, including his mother? As I said, his mother has high-care needs. He contacted a federal member of parliament to get the ratio of carers to people because, being a reasonable individual, he thought that the government would have established guidelines for looking after elderly people at night in a nursing home that would have said that there should be, for example, three nurse carers for 30 people, or four because of their high-care needs. What Alan found was that there were no guidelines. There is nothing in the regulations that effectively says that there has to be a set number of carers. There is no set ratio. He found that quite staggering. In fact, when he contacted my office I basically disbelieved him-I did not believe that there would not be a ratio. You would think that, in terms of the care of patients and some of the most vulnerable people in our community, there would be a stipulated standard-a minimum number of people-but there is not. To confirm that, we checked with the minister's office and we were told that there is no stipulated ratio. That does not provide a measure of comfort to people like Alan, and he has asked that I is raise his concern in this place tonight. This government has not mandated a specific number of carers to look after elderly and frail people like his mother. And I support him in this because I do think he requires that information. Vulnerable and elderly people feel disempowered, particularly with management of nursing homes. I say at the outset that most management and staff of nursing homes look after their charges with a great deal of care, concern and compassion. This is not an attack on the nursing home system per se. What we are trying to do is afford a very vulnerable group of people maximum protection. This could be your mother, your father, your sister or your brother. So it is very important, considering the contribution they have made to the community, that they are afforded maximum legislative protections to ensure that you can leave someone like Alan's mother in a nursing home late at night knowing that she is going to receive the maximum standard of care available and all of the protections that she deserves. My time is running short but there is another example of a nursing home in the Dandenong area where an elderly lady was becoming increasingly incapacitated. She could not speak English and required the help and care of two fantastic daughters to assist her throughout the day, particularly when she was being washed and showered. There was a change in the management of the nursing home and the management said that they could not be present during these times. This caused the over-80-year-old woman great distress and she was very distraught at her rights being taken away from her. It was only through a very long complaints process that this matter was resolved. So, whilst this legislation moves in the right direction, I do not think it is the panacea that the minister's second reading speech would have us believe. This legislation is a step. Elderly people do not deserve to continually be living in fear. Because we have more and more people, particularly in my electorate, shifting into nursing homes and aged-care facilities, it is the responsibility the government and us, as legislators, to offer the maximum form of protection and to ensure the reporting of suspected and alleged sexual abuse and serious assault of residents. We also want to make sure that the staff feel protected and supported when coming forward with such allegations. This legislation takes that step forward and therefore we support it. I know we are moving to the adjournment very shortly so I will finish on that note. Debate interrupted. NA",155
226,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Ipswich Motorway",157
227,Mr RIPOLL,ADJOURNMENT,"I am pleased to stand here today to speak about a milestone in the long-running saga which is the Ipswich Motorway in south-east Queensland, one of the biggest issues for that whole region in Australia's fastest-growing state. Work has finally begun on the Ipswich Motorway upgrade after nine years of consistent and constant lobbying from me and the community. I have to say, it is much to the chagrin of the member for Blair who, for that whole period, has actually opposed it, but somehow now he manages to smile as the minister turns up in my electorate to launch the first phase of the Ipswich Motorway upgrade, an upgrade that I welcome wholeheartedly. The upgrade of the Gailes-Logan interchange was urgently needed due to ongoing problems and it is arguably the most complex part of the Ipswich Motorway upgrade. This interchange, together with the DarraWacol upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway, means that the Oxley electorate now has 100 per cent funding commitment, and work has of started on the Oxley section of the Ipswich Motorway. That is right-as an opposition Labor member of parliament, I have managed to secure full funding for the Ipswich Motorway in my electorate. But the member for Blair in his electorate has achieved a total net result after nearly nine years in parliament of zero dollars. Why? Because he opposes the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway in his electorate. However, the job is not done and I will not be satisfied until we get 100 per cent of the whole motorway, not just in Oxley but in Blair as well, for all Queenslanders and everybody else who uses that road. The government has capitulated on this issue. Imagine if we had started nine years ago. I see the member for Moreton, the brains trust of the Liberal Party, walking into this place-or should I say dragging his tail into this place. He is somebody else who has opposed the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. How does he justify now that his own government has actually paid for half of that upgrade? Mr Hardgrave interjecting",157
228,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order, the member for Moreton!",157
229,Mr RIPOLL,ADJOURNMENT,"I stand here very proud today to say that I have achieved full funding for the Ipswich Motorway in the Oxley section. But the Liberal member for Blair has achieved zero dollars. The member for Blair has thrown up instead this half-brained impossible scheme that is the Goodna half bypass loop, which, if built, would be eight kilometres of wasted bitumen and part of a $2.6 billion white elephant road. It will do nothing to alleviate the current traffic problems and would be forever labelled the most expensive stretch of road in Australia. But I am not too concerned about that, because I know that it is impossible. This government will not spend $2.6 billion-and that is just the first estimate. Wait until we get to the real estimates when they start doing more reports and waste more money on reports! We will see how we go with that in the future. If the member for Blair is keen to talk about bypasses as some alternative to the Ipswich Motorway, I am prepared to have the debate. In fact, since 2000 there has been a report on the table from the state government regarding the Ipswich Western Bypass, a much more sensible approach-a real bypass that would actually do something for the real traffic problems experienced in southeast Queensland-than some half-baked scheme, an eight-kilometre loop road between Dinmore and Gailes. I can see government members are very anxious for me to finish, but I have got a little bit more time yet. I and the federal Labor Party remained 100 per cent committed to the full upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway and that priority will happen. It is south-east Queensland's No. 1 priority. It will go ahead. Of course, half the job has been done because the government has finally capitulated-it had to be dragged kicking and screaming all the way to the funding table, but it has finally done it. This government should very seriously look at its funding responsibilities in terms of federal roads and look at real solutions, not half-brained schemes with eight kilometres of road worth $2.6 billion. The Ipswich Motorway, as I have said, is currently half done and we need to get on with the job and fix the rest of it. This ernment ought to stop blaming everybody else and look at what its own real responsibilities are in terms of infrastructure in Australia, in Queensland, in particular in southeast Queensland. It should look at the people that it is actually hurting. It is certainly not about hurting the people of Oxley-I am sure that has crossed their minds. This is about everybody who uses that road. It is time they got on with the job of fixing all the roads that are their responsibility and it is time they got on with the job of fixing the Ipswich Motorway. It is time they stopped neglecting the people of Ipswich. The irony of Oxley getting 100 per cent of funding and Blair getting zero dollars, I think, is not going to be lost on the good constituents of Blair. My challenge is simple: get on with the job. Give us the rest of the money. If the member for Blair cannot get the dough, I will be working hard to make sure that they do get it. I will make sure that they get the money, just like I did for the Oxley section of the Ipswich Motorway, because the people of Ipswich deserve it. (Time expired) MCPherson: Green Corps Project",157
230,Mrs MAY,ADJOURNMENT,"The Tugun Bypass is the more important road, Bernie! On 2 February 2007 I launched a Green Corps project at Merrimac and congratulated a team of 10 volunteers who are taking part in restoring and beautifying part of the Merrimac State School grounds. Alex, Cameron, Clayton, Gavin, Jayson, Jo, Jess, Johnson, Rick and Victoria are led by team leader Ed Groweg, who is passionate about youth development and the environment. Ed's enthusiasm is rubbing off on the volunteers and he is excited to see them developing as a team. The project is officially called the Riparian and Environmental Area Restoration, Merrimac Green Corps Project, and the volgov- unteers are currently in week 14 of a sixmonth project. To date they have cleared a significant area of weeds, mulched the area and planted approximately 3,000 native trees and shrubs. Repairs to the boardwalk are planned for the next stage. At the launch two members of the Green Corps program, Victoria and Clayton, spoke about the program saying it was a ‘unique opportunity to make a difference to the environment, community, to themselves and to each other'. Teamwork is a strong factor in making this project successful; however, each individual's strengths are encouraged and developed as they are discovered. The enthusiasm of the team and their pride in their achievements to date were obvious at the launch, but what is quite unique about the project is that the team have joined forces to form a band playing the drums. One of their members, Victoria, an aspiring teacher, taught them the basics. They had only been practising together for two days and they put on a fantastic show. They have natural rhythm, and so impressed the young students watching the launch that the students requested the school principal to ask the band to play at one of the school assemblies. Their appreciation at being involved with such a great team was apparent when they presented chocolates to Ed's wife, Di, who sewed the patches onto their uniforms. Randall Pointing, the principal of Merrimac State School, is delighted with the results so far and very grateful for the funding of this project. Dr Pointing said the federal government helped out the school in 2000 when they were given a federation grant to do some basic work on clearing a small area and a track. Ian and Ross, the groundsmen, do a great job, but they have their hands full with work around school buildings. It was only in 1998-99 that the land was discovered to belong to Education Queensland-the school, too. It had been difficult to make proper use of the area before then. Together with Gillian Ainscough, the project development officer from Job Futures, the school put in a submission to be part of a Green Corps project. Job Futures are doing a fantastic job with the ongoing coordination of the project, and Jaime Clark, coordinator of Green Corps at Job Futures, said they have had no trouble finding kids to take on positions in the team when changeovers have happened. It is a shame that due to the classification of the Gold Coast as an urban area we are restricted to approximately six Green Corps projects each year. Halfway through the project, the benefits are clear. The kids from the school hardly recognised the area and were excited by the potential they saw for utilising the space. Ed and the Green Corps team have developed a resource and facility not only for the current students at Merrimac primary school but also for visitors, future schoolchildren and the school's neighbours-users of the Lakelands golf course and the residents of Hill View House, who take daily walks through the area. Hill View House is an aged-care home, and the project has provided a secure area for recreation for the dementia and aged-care patients, who can be escorted down to the peaceful clearing. The children of Merrimac primary school visit the residents of Hill View House on a daily basis and have their favourite ‘oldies'. The project has the support of the local Indigenous people of the Gold Coast, and an Indigenous trail to celebrate Gin House Creek's historical importance as a place for food-gathering will be built as part of the project. I am amazed at the achievements so far and certain that many other local schools will want their own Green Corps team. Green Corps is one of the most successful Commonwealth government programs ever, with more than 16,000 young Australians participating since 1997. It is great for building skills, confidence, self-esteem and pathways to future careers. For example, some of the Green Corps members are considering taking up landscaping training and others are off to university. In addition, participants receive an allowance of $283 per week-that goes down very well. It is great to hear of young people doing so well when usually we only hear about what young people are not doing. I commend all those involved in the project. I know that at the end of six months we are going to have something that will last forever.",158
231,Mr MCCLELLAND,ADJOURNMENT,"The approach of both the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Downer in question time today was to warn against a ‘precipitate withdrawal of troops from Iraq'. But no-one is recommending that. Even Senator Barack Obama, who was personally attacked by the Prime Minister over the weekend, did not. Senator Obama makes it clear that his proposed plan for a phased withdrawal of troops could be temporarily suspended if circumstances required. His plan also provides for a residual United States presence in Iraq to provide training and to pursue international terrorists. The proposal for a phased withdrawal of American forces is entirely consistent with the Iraq Study Group recommendations. These were not referred to by either the Prime Minister or the foreign minister. The ISG report noted: … an open-ended commitment of American forces would not provide the Iraqi government the incentive it needs to take the political that give Iraq the best chance of quelling sectarian violence. The report therefore recommended, in recommendation 40: The United States should not make an open-ended commitment to keep large numbers of American troops deployed in Iraq. Again, in recommendation 41, the report said: The United States must make it clear to the Iraqi government that the United States could carry out its plans, including planned redeployments, even if Iraq does not implement its planned changes. America's other security needs and the future of our military cannot be made hostage to the actions or inactions of the Iraqi government. In direct defiance of those recommendations, Mr Howard said ‘it was unwise to be nominating benchmarks' in respect of ending the Iraq presence of allied troops in Iraq. The bottom line is that the war in Iraq has made us less safe because it is actually attracting and motivating our terrorist enemies around the globe. As Lawrence Korb, who served as Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan administration, has noted: The extended US presence in Iraq has fostered new alliances between secular nationalists and Islamist extremists who are traditionally opposed to each other but who have found common cause in their opposition to the American occupation of a Muslim-majority country. Published intelligence advice has confirmed that the presence of foreign troops in Iraq has served as a catalyst, a lightning rod, to the recruitment of extremists by fundamentalist Islamic organisations around the world. As a result of being able to rely on the security blanket provided by allied troops, the al-Maliki administration in Iraq has tolerated if not actually sponsored some of the worse acts of sectarian violence that have occurred there. That was confirmed in a report of 8 actions November last year by White House National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley to which I referred in the House earlier in the week. Clearly, as long as Iraqi leaders feel that foreign troops will remain in large numbers in Iraq, they will have no incentive to make the necessary compromises to resolve the underlying political, religious and sectarian tensions that are giving rise to the worse of violence that we see there. Clearly, the time has come to set a limit on our involvement in the war in Iraq in order to send an important message to the al-Maliki government: take charge or lose power. Effectively, the strategy being adopted by the Howard government is to make the safety of the young Australian men and women of our troops serving in Iraq hostage to the action or inaction of the al-Maliki government in Iraq, a government which has been described as being at best inept, if not corrupt, with sections clearly implicated in intelligence reports as actually fomenting the violence in Iraq. It is quite immoral and, worse that that, irrational and completely contrary to our national interests to give an unconditional, open-ended commitment to such a regime. Deakin Electorate: Australia Day Awards",160
232,Mr BARRESI,ADJOURNMENT,"Deakin) (7.44 pm)During the summer parliamentary recess many of us went back to our home states and took the time to reconnect with our family, friends and the electorates we serve. But while we were doing this, thousands of Australians were once again dropping all personal and work commitments to fight bushfires, save lives and deliver welfare support to the needy and disadvantaged in our community. Essentially, thousands of Australians were doing what they do best: volunteering their services for the benefit of their local community. On January 25, the day prior to Australia Day, I got a chance to pay my respects to some of the hardest-working volunteers and community group leaders in my area and thank them for really making a difference to the lives of others. Since I started the Deakin Community Australia Day Awards back in 1997, I have sought to acknowledge the hardest-working volunteers and community acts leaders in my electorate through these awards. Whether it is through helping a local church or school or helping people from other nations make the transition to our way of life, these recipients each contribute to the building blocks of our community and as a result make the bonds that bind us together as a society stronger. The Deakin Community Australia Day Awards are a way of publicly and respectfully recognising the great efforts of our unsung community heroes, which in turn may inspire other people to do more for their communities too. The people we honoured that day came from a diverse range of backgrounds and ages, yet they each shared the same values of compassion, hard work and a tireless attitude to community involvement. These are people such as Sai Kit Chan, who arrived in Australia with few English language skills and went on to become a director of one of eastern Melbourne's best multicultural learning centres and who now devotes much of his time tutoring and assisting new migrants to integrate into the Australian way of life. These are hard working and inspiring youth leaders such as Faye Monkhouse, who, through 22 years of service to the Girl Guides movement, has taught young women valuable skills and positive reinforcement which will imbue them with confidence for many years to come. My thoughts today are with the family of another recipient, Diego Novella. Diego, better known as Dick, who passed away last night after a long illness, founded, ran and spent countless hours organising events for the Maroondah Italian Senior Citizens Club so that many members of the local Italian community would not remain isolated and alone in their latter years. I am sure his memory will live on through the hard work and commitment he devoted to the people he served for over 20 years. My thoughts and prayers are with his family this evening. Then there are those, such as Allen Maher, who overcome their own disabilities and challenges to help others. Allen, a long-time sufferer of MS, and his wife, Betty, have for the past six years acted as foster parents to eight children fleeing from abusive homes. He has also taught classes for the past 12 years on how to live with a disability, imparting valuable skills with great empathy and passion. This is only a sample of the 37 recipients I was honoured to meet and acknowledge that day. These 37 local heroes-often you only have to look over your back fence to find a local hero rather than trying to seek that hero through the media-in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne who work or live either in the municipalities of Whitehorse and Maroondah were recognised for their great deeds. The table read as followsName Suburb Sylvia Abbott Nunawading Colin Browne Mitcham Dorothy Browne Mitcham Andrew Brownlie Ringwood East Pam Chambers Nunawading Sai Kit Chan Box Hill Valerie Charnock Blackburn South John Coulson Blackburn Michael Dwyer Blackburn Nola Fairbairn Ringwood Cecily Falkingham Mitcham Alec Fuller Forest Hill Bill Green Heathmont The Deakin Community Australia Day Award winners know what strong communities mean and how to make them stronger. They are the backbone of the area, acting as a rock of support and often being the first to lend a helping hand to those in need. The awards are, as I say each year, not meant to be rewards for their work but simply an acknowledgement of their service and an opportunity for me, as their representative, to say thank you. In most cases, they are very reluctant recipients of the awards because, as they say, they do not do it for the reward; they do it for the love of it. I started these awards to bring attention to the often thankless tasks of these people. I know that through their efforts they inspire others. It was a great honour to meet these people and to give them their awards. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table of the recipients and the deeds and activities for which they were rightly recognised. Leave granted.

233,Mr WINDSOR,ADJOURNMENT,"In question time today the Prime Minister answered a question in relation to payment of compensation to groundwater users in six valleys across New South Wales. I think we saw a quite blatant admission today-it is quite disturbing actually, given that the Prime Minister is trying to engage the trust of water entitlement holders and irrigators et cetera across the nation in terms of the 10-point plan that he is attempting to put in place-of a breach of trust with Organisation Reason for Award HCAG Inc Local support and advocacy Apex Assisting with community healthcare access Lions Club Environmental advocacy & protection Ringwood Community Services to local community Centre ROK Assisting youth and community Anglican Church Supporting church activities and providing assistance to the needy Maroondah Italian Providing a cohesive and culturally sensiSenior Citz Club tive outlet for elderly MS Australia Assisting others to live with a disability St Vincent De Paul Support services for disadvantaged Girl Guides Providing leadership to young people Rotary Fundraising and charity work Rotary Leadership and services to youth Whitehorse Italian Services to elderly/aged Seniors Club Maroondah Italian Social activities for elderly and aged with Senior Citz Club cultural connections CRISP Nursery Environmental protection Blackburn Sporting Services to establishing football and Club cricket locally Blackburn North Bowls Maintenance of facilities and voluntary Club work for commonwealth games Scouts Youth Leadership RSL Support and advice to Veterans Girl Guides Youth Leadership Scouts Youth Leadership St Marks Community Services to disadvantaged and local sports Centre groups Cambodian Community Care and compassion for Cambodian Welfare Centre community and counselling services War Widows Services Services to returned servicemen and widows. Water groundwater users within the six valleys that I have referred to in New South Wales. The Prime Minister confirmed today in question time that the intergovernmental agreement signed by the Commonwealth and the New South Wales government under the hand of the Australian Government Solicitor: ... had been structured and made in an environment where they were not intended to provide compensation for any perceived loss to farmers. In those circumstances they fell to be taxed as income. This admission today verifies the various statements that I have been making for quite some time. The signatory to this intergovernmental agreement-which took place back in 2005 under the hand of the Australian Government Solicitor-the Prime Minister, knew that the irrigators concerned would be taxed when that document was put in place. To see that sort of behaviour openly admitted to by the Prime Minister when he is trying to establish trust with other irrigators across the nation, I think is quite disgraceful. I alleged today that the Prime Minister had misrepresented himself and actually misled the parliament in question time. He danced around that particular issue but he also demonstrated that he misled the parliament again today. In fact, there are five instances in terms of confirmation of the determination of the compensation payments. There are three letters from the Prime Minister, two to me and one to the Narrabri council. The minister for revenue at the time, Mal Brough, the current Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Peter Dutton, and Helen Georgopoulos, a senior adviser in the Prime Minister's own office, have all made statements over a period of time-19 December 2005, 8 June 2006, and through that period-that they believed that the adjustment assistant payments are a ‘matter for determination by the Australian tax office, consistent with existing law'. In a letter to me the Prime Minister said: All grants under the Water Smart Australia programme are treated in a manner that is consistent with tax law. I am advised that assistance payments are generally assessable income for taxation purposes, subject to the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act (1997). For the sake of equity and consistency the government will the altering these arrangements. The government has gone into a deal with the New South Wales government knowing full well, but not informing the water entitlement holders through the tax office, that they could be taxed 47 per cent on the compensation payable for giving up their legal entitlements for the greater good of the community and for the sustainability of the resource. I think it was a clear admission by the Prime Minister today that he has breached faith with those six valley groundwater users and that there is a need now for a tax ruling. If we are to get serious about addressing the natural resource issues in this country, there has to be compensation. The Prime Minister actually says in the document: ... if we are ever going to settle this water thing, we will have to take back entitlements and people will be entitled to some compensation. The other issue that has come out of question time today is that the Prime Minister is actually flagging compulsory acquisition of entitlements and not voluntary relinquishment, as has been discussed by Malcolm Turnbull and others. ‘We will have to take back entitlements,' the Prime Minister said in question time today. I say to the Prime Minister: if past legislation demands that any future compensation arrangements be treated in terms of the capital gains provisions, and not under the Income Tax Act, as is the current case- (Time expired) Western Australian State Government",163
234,Mr HENRY,ADJOURNMENT,"In the suburb of Hazelmere, in my electorate of Hasluck, we have a local business that has been operating for some 50 years. It is Talloman's, WA's largest service rendering plant. Beef, sheep, pig and poultry producers are dependent on this facility, as are numerous abattoirs that deliver by-products from not the slaughter of animals for human consumption. In addition, Talloman's employ some 50 local people dependent on this business for their livelihood. These by-products include offal, fat, bone, feather and other materials. Talloman's process these waste products, turning them into tallow, meat and bonemeal, feather meal, blood and bone et cetera, which in turn support the aquaculture, farming, nursery, horticultural and other industries, with around 50 per cent of these products being sold on the export market. Like many former rural areas surrounding Perth, Hazelmere has succumbed to the pressure of a growing population, with much of the area now zoned industrial or urban to accommodate many new homes, thus putting significant pressure on businesses such as Talloman's to modify their operations or consider their location. Talloman's have done both. Almost three years ago the company held talks with state government representatives to seek alternative sites. Two years in consultation with the Department of Environment and Conservation, Talloman's invested $8 million upgrading the facility and to reduce odours. Early in the new year their wastewater treatment plant failed. The site was closed for some weeks whilst repairs were carried out at a cost of half a million dollars to the company. The cost to the surrounding community was significantly increased too in rancid odours over this period. This is another wasted opportunity by the state Labor government to take a positive leadership role ensuring: a positive future for this business and its employees; a positive future for a number of abattoirs already under duress and adversely affected by the current disruption to Talloman's operations; a positive future for beef, poultry, sheep and pig producers supplying these abattoirs; and a positive future for the many thousands of homeowners adversely affected by these odours. There are positive solutions. The state government could allow Talloman's to access the sewer connection without the proposed $1.5 million demanded for headworks or, alternatively, provide a viable site with the necessary services and assistance to Talloman's to meet the cost of relocation. Offal going to landfill is not the answer as this has serious implications for local groundwater, residents and the environment, as demonstrated when over 2,000 tonnes of this waste was dumped each week, at the Inkpen Road tip in Wundowie. It took only three weeks before the complaints from local residents about the odour stopped this process. Rather than solutions, what we see is the Labor Minister for Planning and Infrastructure sitting on her hands doing absolutely nothing about ensuring adequate and appropriately zoned land is available for such industries. She is well supported in this handago, sitting exercise by her colleagues the member for Midland and the member for Belmont, both senior ministers in the Labor government, both yet again demonstrating their disdain for their constituents, doing absolutely nothing about the concerns or needs of residents, employees of Talloman's or, indeed, the needs of Talloman's. Who pays for this in the end? Let me tell you. Not the Labor government, as they are busy making money from stamp duty and other charges on new housing and urban development, employing even more public servants-around 18,000-but no policemen, no teachers and no nurses who can provide services for the community. I can tell you it will be the WA community who will suffer as a result of increasing meat prices because of the extra costs associated with dumping this waste material rather than seeing it processed and, in turn, creating local employment and opportunity. This is just another example that demonstrates the total lack of vision of the state Labor government for the future of industry in Western Australia, the future of employment and employees in Western Australia, the future of new homeowners in Western Australia and their needs, and the concerns of residents in Hazelmere, Guilford and surrounding suburbs. This is a very serious concern and the state government needs to grab this issue by the horns. The people in Hazelmere and surrounding suburbs should no longer have to pay the price for the state government's lack of action, lack of vision and their apathy.",164

The challenge for Australia, however, is to get rounding extraction of monopoly rent by infrastructure for investment in infrastructure, particularly many occasions, if Australia cannot keep up portant expansion of our export industries, plenty of opportunities in other parts of the and Australia will be left behind. I raise these issues today because, unfortunately, ernment is bereft of leadership, out of touch There is no better example than the Treasurer's the National Competition Council's recommendation way under the Trade Practices Act was deemed came about only because Peter Costello was too and now, after appeal, it is set to be overturned herence to doctrinaire competition policy.

These are just two examples of competition pansion of Australia's export industries and would argue against an effective and efficient iron ore producers.

I therefore suggest to the House this morning Treasurer to implement the recommendations established by and reported on in this parliament. with it-the answer to the problem is to introduce the declaration of export related facilities under force goes on to say-and this is important-that report in June last year, said: supporting Australia's exports has elements of natural no economic sense, to have multiple systems. monopoly, infrastructure owners could provide too the process of extracting monopoly rents if left unreguthe balance right between managing issues surowners and maintaining the incentive to prevent underinvestment.

I say that because coal is our billion a year. But the competition purists, with set hypothetical limits on export infrastructure properly secure the future of our major export policy gone mad, which is threatening the excreating disincentives for investment.

Indeed, the surpluses are lower than the surpluses that were recorded So when the Treasurer says, as he did at the surplus, he is completely wrong.

The fact boom but it has wasted the opportunity it has preon three important areas. The first is in relasecond-and it follows on from what the member NA for Rankin has been talking about-is our failure there is time, the fiscal ill-discipline On the trade front, there are some pretty revealing The Howard government has racked up the worse December, the most recent figure, a monthly trade was the 57th consecutive trade deficit. This is on record. When Labor were in office-in every year age on an annual basis eight per cent growth current government has achieved? Despite a of only four per cent if you take the whole 10 records apply, and just one per cent over the woeful. If Australia had maintained the rate of growth deficit of $12 billion, we would have today a opportunity. That is a huge difference. They are our rate of growth was 13 per cent per annum; three per cent: little wonder that we have seen over the last decade, 60,000 of them since the port volumes averaged 10½ per cent under our to the last five years where they have averaged backwards in service exports. This poses the question as to why we were sources boom than this government have been of reasons for that. One is their fundamental have a strategic approach to trade, whereas when per cent per annum growth, we concentrated guay Round. We formed the Cairns Group. We est broker between the Americans and the But not content simply to settle on a successful guay Round, we persisted with the agenda through which was an enhancement of the WTO outcome-if of that, we then used the bilateral free trade again-WTO plus plus. But what has this government done? It has trade policy on the basis of securing bilateral trade agenda but as trophies to be obtained to something. In all three free trade agreements tion has gone backwards with all countries-including, the United States. In all cases, this reversal of order not tracted from our trade performance. It has the Doha Round. It has not seen any creativity on the productivity front, and the third, if of this government. statistics that we need to set the scene. trade performance in Australia's history. In deficit of $1.3 billion was recorded and this the longest uninterrupted period of trade deficit between 1983 and 1996-we were able to averin exports. How does this compare with what the record resources boom, it has averaged a growth years that it has been in office and for which the past five years. That is why the performance is that we had set in place, instead of a trade trade surplus of $14 billion. That is the wasted the overall figures. If you go to manufactures, theirs just three per cent. Thirteen per cent to 145,000 jobs lost in the manufacturing sector last election. On the services front, service experiod of government in every year compared a decline. In this prosperity we are going able to achieve better outcomes without a reable to achieve with one. There are a number failure on trade policy.

Trade policy in this country is a NA disgrace, and the figures are a demonstration mance in terms of where this nation could be. I turn now to the question of productivity. I think this is where the government argues that Work Choices is not good for the economy. Quite Choices, the title of the legislation is really into this parliament. It is no choices, it is take lective bargaining, it is a diminution of the an eradication of the independent umpire. But it is not only bad on the fairness front, assertion that Work Choices is responsible for great bulk of job increases have come because on the record.
