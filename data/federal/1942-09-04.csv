NA ASSESSMENT BILL 1942. Motion (by Mr Chifley) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to provide for the imposition, assessment and collection of a tax upon payments for admission to entertainments. Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND EEADINO.",11
3,Mr CHIFLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Macquarie-Treasurer ) [10.34] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The Government intends that some portion of the present spending of the people on amusements should be diverted back to the Commonwealth Government in order to help to finance the war. Despite the curtailment of many forms of sporting activities, attendances as a whole at entertainments show a tendency to increase. A great deal of the resources upon which people draw to meet thoir costs of entertainment are to be found in the war expenditure of the Commonwealth itself. The Government does not wish to impose undue prohibitions on the people, but it considers that whilst many of our men are absent from their homes on active service, and whilst many others are working long hours in essential employment, those who still have the leisure to frequent places entertainment should be prepared when they do so to make a contribution to the war effort. The rates of tax proposed are heavy. They will serve to bring significantly to the notice of people who attend entertainments the fact that the nation is fighting for its existence. When the Government decided that it was necessary to enter this field of revenue it found that in five of the States there existed an entertainment or amusement tax. In the sixth State there was no such tax. The rates of tax varied considerably, as did also the incidence of the tax. It became obvious that if a tax which would achieve the objectives sought by the Commonwealth were to be imposed it was desirable that the varying taxes of the States should be suspended. The Government, therefore, decided to approach the State Governments with a proposal that they should, upon payment of compensation, vacate the field entirely and leave it to the Commonwealth. The first approach was made at the Premiers Conference, held in Melbourne during August. One State only, namely, Tasmania, indicated at the conference that it was willing to agree to the suggestion of die Commonwealth. The other four States, namely, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, desired to give the matter further consideration and requested that the Commonwealth should put its proposals in writing. The Prime Minister, therefore, wrote to the Premiers of the States, and they have in reply signified their willingness to vacate the field in favour of the Mr Ghificy. Commonwealth for the duration of the war and one year thereafter. The States are to be compensated upon the basis of the revenue formerly received by them from this source. I desire here to record the Government's appreciation of the co-operation of the State governments in the matter. The bills contain clauses which will cause the tax automatically to cease on the last day of the first financial year to commence after the war ends. This bill, if accepted, will represent the second occasion upon which the Commonwealth has imposed an entertainments tax. Honourable members will recall that the Commonwealth entered this field of during the last war, and the tax was imposed on the 1st January, 1917. After the war' the tax was gradually lifted until in 1924 it applied only to admission charges of 2s. 6d. and upwards. In 1933, the Commonwealth vacated the whole field in favour of the States as a part of the financial arrangements made to enable them to recover from the effects of the depression. The proposed Commonwealth legislation in. substance follows on the lines of the previous Commonwealth act. The tax is payable upon the price of admission to the entertainment. The tax commences at 3d., which is levied upon admission prices of Is., and increases with each 6d. increase of the price of admission. No tax is payable on admission prices of less than Is. The Government has decided that the legitimate stage and other entertainments in which artists appear in person should receive some concession in rates, and accordingly has provided for them a special scale in which the rates are approximately 25 per cent, less than the general rates. I shall explain the rates of tax in more detail when I introduce the rates bill. It is estimated that the gross revenue that will be collected from this source for a full financial year will be £3,250,000. Compensation payable to the States will amount to approximately £765,000, leaving a net revenue to the Commonwealth of £2,485,000. For the balance of the present financial year it is expected that the Commonwealth will collect about £2,430,000, out of which compensation will be payable to the States of approximately £575,000, leaving a net revenue to the Commonwealth for the current financial year of £1,855,000. The bill provides exemption for entertainments where all the proceeds, without any charge for expenses, are devoted to public, patriotic, philanthropic, religious or charitable purposes. If the entertainment is wholly of an educational character, or is of a partly educational and partly scientific character, and is conducted by a society not established or carried on for profit, or all the net proceeds are devoted to the erection, maintenance or furnishing of memorial halls for the use of returned soldiers, sailors and airmen, it will be exempt from tax. Where the net proceeds of an entertainment are devoted to public, patriotic, philanthropic, religious or charitable purposes, and the expenses do not exceed 50 per cent, of the receipts, it will be exempt. If the attendance at such an entertainment, owing to inclement weather or other unforeseen circumstances, is so reduced as to cause the expenses to exceed 50 per cent, of the receipts, the Commissioner has power to grant exemption. During the operation of the previous Commonwealth Entertainments Tax Act, dinner and supper dances were a continual source of difficulty. The proprietors of some of these functions maintain that the whole of the payments made by tie patrons have been for the dinner or supper and the dancing is merely incidental. This claim has been successfully maintained even in those cases where a first-class dance band has In Committee of Ways and Means:",11

That the rates of the entertainments tax be(a) where all the performers whose words present and performing and the following items, namely, a stage instrumental), a lecture, a recitation, or a travelling show-as set (6) in all other cases-as set 3. That the Act to be passed to give effect to of the first financial year to commence after the present war and no longer. been in attendance and dancing has proceeded from about 8.30 p.m. until 2 a.m. A provision has, therefore, been inserted in the law to enable such entertainments to be taxed, whilst at the same time ensuring that the meal at which merely incidental music is provided is not taxed. The bill contains provisions for the registration of all entertainments and, to ensure that the casual entertainment does not escape, provides that a liability shall rest upon the owner or lessee of the premises in which the entertainment is held to see that no unregistered entertainment is held on his premises. The tax is to be collected by the proprietor of the entertainment and paid over to the Commissioner of Taxation, either prior to the entertainment being held by the purchase of stamped tickets of admission or within seven days of the holding thereof where a guarantee has been lodged. The usual provisions are included for the imposition of penalties for offences against the provisions of the act. The bill provides that the tax shall operate on and from a date to be proclaimed. The intention is that the date of operation of the tax shall be the 1st October, 1942.",13
5,Sir CHARLES MABK,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Will provision be made to prevent an admission charge of Is. from being slightly reduced in order to obviate payment of the tax?,13
6,Mr CHIFLEY,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Yes, provision against that will be made later. Debate (on motion by Mr FADDEN) adjourned.

This motion is, therefore, complementary to the measure which has already been introduced and explained. It provides for the imposition of the tax, and sets out the rates at which the tax will be paid. Honourable members will observe that the schedule to the motion sets out two scales of rates which, for simplicity, might be referred to as the full rate and the reduced rate. The full rate is set out in the third column of the schedule, and, briefly stated, is 3d. on admissions of Is., increasing by .2d. for every 6d. or part thereof, by which the price of admission exceeds Is. up to 5s. and thereafter increasing by 3d. for each additional fid. or part thereof. At 10s. the rate is 4s. Id. This scale of rates will apply to all entertainments held on and after the date Mr Ohiflep. THE SCHEDULE. Second Column. Third Oolunin.

To this latter class of entertainment, which is more particularly referred to as an entertainment consisting of a stage play, a ballet, a performance of music, whether vocal or instrumental, a lecture, a recitation, a music hall or other variety entertainment, a circus or a travelling show, the reduced rates will apply. They are set out in column two of the schedule, and represent as near as could conveniently be arranged without splitting pence a reduction of 25 per cent, from the full rate. It, has been thought desirable to avoid halfpence in order to obviate difficulties which would occur at the boxoffices if they were adopted, - and also to lessen the drain on copper coinage. Where the actual calculation resulted in an odd farthing or halfpenny the fraction has been dropped, and where the fraction was three farthings the tax has been taken at the next penny. Honourable members are well aware of the difficulties which have been experienced by what is popularly known as the "" legitimate stage"" since the advent of motion pictures and "" talkies "", and will , I am sure, welcome the preference which has been accorded to it in the matter of rates. Despite the concession, the contribution which will be required from the legitimate stage because of the generally higher charges for admission w 5 l be substantial, and will be sufficient to keep before the patrons thereof the facis that. I have previously referred to, namely, that this nation is fighting for its very existence, and that those who have the leisure and means to Httend entertainments should on those occasions make a contribution to the funds for waging war. - The tax will come into operation on a ilale to be vyyoclaimed, and it is expected thai all State entertainment taxes will cease as from that date. arrangements arc being made with the State governments for the vacation of this field of taxation, and I shall pxplain ilie details of those arrangements when flit* hill tn providp compensation to the States is introduced.

BAUXITE ",15
9,Mr FRAKOIS,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"the Minister for Supply and Development, upon noticePAPER, 1. Has the Government yet devised and was pre- voinpleted any plans for the development of Australian bauxite deposits for aluminium production ? Jf so, what are the nature and details of the plans to be undertaken and what progress has been made in putting them into effect? 2. Will the Government take into consideration the fullest possible utilization of th<extensive bauxite deposits at Tambourine Mountain in Queensland in their plans foi the development of our bauxite deposits for aluminium production? Mr BEASJ.BY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Commonwealth Copper and Bauxite Committee has made an extensive survey of Australian bauxite resources and has furnished the Government with full information in this regard. The committee has established that there are ample supplies of sufficiently high grade haiixite in Australia upon which to base an aluminium industry. In order, however, to establish the industry it will be necessary to procure essential jplant and equipment from America. Negotiations with the object of obtaining this have been in progress for some time and arc continuing. 2. Full consideration will be given to the question of utilization of bauxite deposits at Mount Tambourine in Queensland as plans for Che establishment of the aluminium industry are advanced. DIVORCE LEGISLATION.",15
10,Mr BLACKBURN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"the Attorney General, upon notice I. Has he read in the judgment of His Honour Mr Justice Rich delivered oh 4th February, 1942, in WaQhorn v. Waghorn (85 C.L.R. p. 294) the following passage:Before parting with the case I venture to suggest that the legislature, under the express power contained in sub-section 22 of section 51 of the Constitution, might take into consideration the question of passing a Federal Divorce Act. It appears to be a matter of some importance that the residents of the six States of the Commonwealth should live under corresponding conditions so far as divorce is concerned. The legislature would not be originating a system of divorce, but merely passing a uniform act in substitution for the divorce acts of the States, and thus, "" To heavenliest harmony Reduce the seeming chaos "". ? 2. Will he favourably consider the introduction of such a bill as His Honour has urged?",16
11,Dr EVATT,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"The answers to the honourable member's questions follows:1. Yes. 2. The question is one for consideration by the Cabinet as a matter of Government policy, and I shall bring the suggestion of the honourable member before my colleagues.
