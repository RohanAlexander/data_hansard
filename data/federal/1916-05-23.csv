1,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Has any action been taken to give effect to the finding of the Committee.of Public Accounts connection with the Cockatoo Island docktional yard?,4
2,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Yes . The recommendations of the Committee are under the consideration of the Navy Board. Wherever the Board can put those findings into operation, as, in their opinion, are practicable and advisable, they intend to do so.",4
3,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I hopo the Bonorable memher for Hunter is satisfied with the answer! FEDERAL CAPITAL.  ister of Home Affaire has taken the whole of the papers relating to the Federal Capital site, and locked thera up in his room 1 If so, what is the reason ? Does the honourable gentleman intend, to keep the papers there? Mr KING O'MALLEY - This is one of those half-truths that get out and create a sensation.",4
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Half-truths ? Then it is half true? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member for Maranoa told me it was hi* intention to ask this question, and I have brought with me the order. I issued, as follows: T desire that thofilesin regard to the Federal Capital operations now being got together for my 'inspection be handed over to the exclusive custody of my private secretary. Officers will retain all the copies they require, or which are necessary for the operations which I do not desire suspended. That order is dated 19th May. I Bhould like to know who is to take control but the Minister. CAPTAIN C. C. BAILLIE U.",4
5,Mr HAMPSON,Unknown,Will the Minister for the Navy ask the Minister of Defence whether he will lay on the table of the Library all the papers in connection with the extraordinarily rapid promotion of Captain C. C. Baillieu?,4
6,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I shall bring the question under the notice of the Minister of Defence, and I do not think there will be NA OFFICIALS.",4
7,Mr THOMAS,ENLISTMENT OF BANK,"Is the Minister of in Trade and Customs aware that the NaBank directors are not paying any portion of the salaries of their employees who have gone to the front, and that they - have notified all who have enlisted that they w'ill not be able to regain places in the bank when they return unless they pass a medical examination as tofitness? Mr ""TUDOR - I have not heard of such a thing, and I candidly say that I can hardly believe that an Australian institution would take such action. I trust that the honourable member for Barrier has been misinformed. LETTER CARRIERS AWARD.",4
8,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ENLISTMENT OF BANK,"I am informed by members of the union that Mr Justice Powers, in his award in connection with the letter-carriers, made provision for men who have passed the sorting test prescribed under the Public Service Regulations, to entitle them to advance to £168. Has that award been given effect to, and, if not, why not?",5
9,Mr WEBSTER,ENLISTMENT OF BANK,"I should be glad of notice of the question. No one can expect any Minister to be sure of the many details embodied in an award, and to give a responsible answer on the spur of the moment. MENINGITIS.  vernment taking to stamp out meningitis which is so prevalent ? ",5
10,Mr KELLY,ENLISTMENT OF BANK,Will the Minister refer the matter to the Commission presided over by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports ?,5
11,Mr TUDOR,ENLISTMENT OF BANK,"If I may be allowed, I should like to say that, in my opinion, the Commission or Committee presided over by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is doing really good work at a very small cost; indeed, I regard it as one of the best Commissions we have in operation. I shall refer the question of the honourable member for Calare to the only health officer we have in the Commonwealth, namely, the Director of Quarantine; but I must point out that we are powerless to take any action in Australia unless the disease comes from outside. BUTTER EXPORT: EMBARGO. decided",5
12,Mr SINCLAIR,ENLISTMENT OF BANK,"Is the Minister of Trade and Customs still determined to prevent the export of butter, seeing that there is a large accumulation.",5
13,Mr TUDOR,ENLISTMENT OF BANK,"I went into this matter fairly fully on Saturday afternoon, when I stated that honourable members would see by Monday evening's papers, or Tuesday morning's papers, the position in Victoria at any rate. I see by this morning's newspapers that it is proposed to make a further increase in the price in Victoria, which State practically governs three other States in this connection, and that the price is 14s. per cwt. more than could be obtained if the butter were exported. I have no intention to relax ""the regulation.",5
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENLISTMENT OF BANK,Has the Minister ascertained whether there is a market for the butter referred to by the honourable member for Moreton ? It is no use fixing the price of butter if it cannot be sold-that is the point.,5
15,Mr TUDOR,ENLISTMENT OF BANK,"I have every reason to believe that the whole of the butter in Australia at present can find a market here; and, in view of the threatened shortage, I do not think it would be wise to allow it to be shipped away. NA AMERICA.",5
16,Mr FENTON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Is the Treasurer aware that American bankers are making liberal allowances to Australian purchasers of American merchandise, &c, with a view to encouraging trade between the two countries. Further, can the Treasurer inform the House whether British bankers are making similar arrangements in order to encourage trade between Australia and Great Britain?",5
17,Mr HIGGS,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"I am not aware of any such arrangements. I shall, however, make inquiries, and let the honourable member know. ' MILITAR Y PAY OF PUBLIC SERVANTS.",5
18,Mr JENSEN,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"On the 11th inst., the honourable member for Parkes asked a question with reference to the military pay of public officers who had been allowed to enlist, and were subsequently called back to their posts. The Minister of Defence, to whom the inquiry was referred, now states that this matter was at a conference between the Federal and State Governments after the outbreak of the war, when it was determined that only military pay should be drawn in such cases. The following papers were presented: Royal Australian Naval College-Repor t for 1915; together with an abstract report for the year 1914. Ordered to be printed.

19,Mr JENSEN,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"On the 11th May the honourable member for. Wimmera asked the following question, upon notice I. The number of factories making war munitions in Australia ? 2. The number of women employees at such factories ? PAPERS. I am now in a position to furnish the following replies: 1. Factories 29. 2. No women are engaged in the manufacture of shell, but 750 women are employed in the Colonial Ammunition Company's works in the manufacture of small arm ammunition. WHEAT POOL.",6
20,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"the Minister representing the Prime Minister, upon notice I. When the additional 6d. per bushel already promised the wheat-grower from the Government Wheat Pool will be paid? 2. Whether he can inform the House of the result of the Prime Minister's negotiations with the Imperial Government and the shipping companies in London for additional shipping space for wheat cargoes from Australia ?",6
21,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow: 1. No promise as to the payment of an extra 6d. was authorized by the Australian Wheat Board. 2. For some time Mr Hughes has been conferring with the British authorities as to the possibilities of securing additional freight. A 'reply is expected daily. FEDERA L CAPITAL.,6
22,Mr KING OMALLEY,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"DarwinMinister of Home Affairs) [10.44] - I move That the adopted plan for the Federal Capital be referred to the Standing Committee on Public Works for the necessary authority to proceed with the execution of the work from time to time as required by the Government. My desire is to refer the entire plan of the Federal Capital to the Public Works Committee so that they may deal with it at their leisure. Hitherto the plan has been handed over to them in sections, but I now wish to refer it to them in globo.",6
23,Mr FOWLEE,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,How many years will they occupy in considering it?,6
24,Mr KING OMALLEY,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"It may take a thousand years to build the Capital. The city of Washington has been building for a hundred years, and it has only just been started.",6
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Parramatta) [10.45] - I do not know exactly what is intended by this motion. If it means that the Public Works Committee are to approve of the entire plan of the Federal Capital with the implication that they may reject any portion of the plan,6
26,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Surely not.,6
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Then why should the Minister desire to refer it to them for their approval? I take the liberty of saying with the very greatest respect that the Committee are totally unfit to judge of this plan as a plan. I hope that the motion will be withdrawn. The plan was adopted and paid for. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The plan is not to be submitted to them for their adjudication.,7
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,I have only the motion of the Minister before me. The honourable gentleman proposes to refer the adopted plan for the Federal Capital to » the Committee for. the necessary authority to proceed with the execution of the work. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is the plan which the honourable member's Government adopted.,7
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"I am not speaking of the inquiry into the way in which the works are to be constructed. There is a very clear line of demarcation to be drawn. If brick works at the Federal Capital were in progress, the Committee might very well say whether those works were being erected according to the most modern method. But as to whether those works should go on the plan, I take it that that is a matter for Mr Griffin to decide. I suggest that the motion should be postponed for a little while. I think that we shall then be able to fix it up all right. I ask leave to continue my speech at a later hour of the day. Leave granted; debate adjourned. REPRESENTATION BILL . Bill read a first time. SECOND READING.",7
30,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.48] - In movingThat this Bill be now read a second time. I wish to say that the Representation Bill which was passed in 1905 made it mandatory that a census, or rather an enumeration, should be conducted every five years. That five years' period will expire this year. The Government have considered the question, they have consulted the Chief Electoral Officer; they have gone into the latest statistics available; and they feel that, in view of the absence of so many of our men at the war, it would not be wise to proceed with the enumeration this year. We intend to allow things to remain exactly as they are, and, according to the figures which have been submitted to the Cabinet, no State will thereby suffer any injustice. In all the circumstances, the Government think it would be wise to pass this Bill so as to avoid the necessity for making an enumeration this year, as would otherwise be necessary under the Representation Act of 1905. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - When will the enumeration take' place?",7
31,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"The ordinary census which is prescribed by the Census Act will take place in 1921. If we leave this enumeration over it will be possible by legislation to undertake an enumeration at some time between the period marking the termination of the war and the time appointed for taking the ordinary census. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. tn Committee: Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to Clause 3Notwithstanding anything contained in section 3 of the Bepresentation Act 1905, the Chief Electoral Officer shall not appoint an Enumeration Day at the expiration of the fifth year after the first census taken after the commencement of that Act. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [10.51] - I am not quite sure about the wisdom of passing this clause as it stands. It makes provision merely for the abolition of the Enumeration Day, which was decided upon by this Parliament in the principal Act, but it makes no provision whatever for the fixing of an Enumeration Day at any particular time, and it seems 'to me that, under the clause, the (next Enumeration Day might be fixed at the discretion of the Government.",7
32,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"They would have to bring the matter before Parliament. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I am afraid that the whole purpose of the original"" Act will be not merely suspended but defeated altogether.",7
33,Mr WATT,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Is it not merely proposed to skip one quinquennial period ?,7
34,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Yes ; because of the war, and the unsettled state of the population at the present time. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Unde r the clause as it is framed, no Enumeration Day could be fixed until after the next census, and, in the meantime, through variations of the population in the different States, great inequalities of representation might arise, and have to be continued for an unreasonable period.",7
35,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Yarra - Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.53] - B y section 3 of the Representation Act of 1905, to which this clause refers, it is provided that- 1. The day on whioh any census of the people of the Commonwealth is taken shall Be an Enumeration Day within the meaning of this Act. 2. The Chief Electoral Officer shall appoint other Enumeration Days as follows :(o) The first Enumeration Day shall be appointed as soon as practicable after the commencement of this Act; (b) After the first census taken after the commencement of this Act, an Enumeration Day shall be appointed at the expiration of every fifth year after the then last preceding Enumeration Day. If that section had been complied with there would have been an Enumeration Day fixed for the 3rd of A p r i l of this year. Parliament was not then sitting, and this Bill is necessary to validate the omission to take an enumeration on that day, and to avoid the necessity for taking it this year. The following figures supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician show that no State will lose anything by the passing of this Bill . On the 30th of June, 1915, the population was 4,951,077. The quota would therefore be 68,665, and, dividing the population of each State by the quota, New South Wales would be entitled to 27 l - 5 th members. Honourable members will be aware that the remainder, when the population of a State is divided by the quota, must be either over or under half the quota to effect an alteration of the representation of a State. There would, therefore, be no alteration in the representation of New South Wales. Victoria, according to her population, would have 20 and over three-fourths, but as that State has 21 representatives at present, there would be no alteration tliere. Queensland would have 10.4, which is practically exactly the representation the State has today. South Australia would have barely 6£. quite possible that if there was an enumeration at the present time, that State might have to lose a member. Tasmania and Western Australia are guaranteed by the Constitution their present representation as a minimum. They are entitled to 5 members each, but Western Australia, on population, would have only 4.69, and Tasmania 2.88. This Bill would only postpone the Enumeration Day over the present quinquennial period.",8
36,Mr WATT,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Balaclava) [10.58] - I think that the object of the Bill , as defined by the Minister of Trade and Customs, is perfectly understandable, and quite laudable. It should not be necessary, and is not advisable, to have an Enumeration Day at this time, when all the circumstances of our life are so thoroughly disorganized and disturbed. W h at is proposed is really to skip a quinquennial enumeration, but still the suggestion of the honourable member for Lang is worthy of consideration by the Minister, and upon consultation he might do well ° to propose here, or elsewhere, to add a proviso to this clause giving the Governor General in Council the power to establish another quinquennial period before the year 1921.",8
37,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,That would cut across the census which must be taken in 1921.,8
38,Mr WATT,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"No ; the census to which the Minister refers is obligatory. If between 1916 and 1921 there is a violent fluctuation in population, then, instead of introducing a fresh Bill to deal with it , all the necessary elasticity could be given to the measure if the Governor General in Council was given power to direct the taking of an enumeration in between the ordinary ones.",8
39,Mr FENTON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Maribyrnong) [11.2] I trust the suggestion of the honourable member for Balaclava will not be adopted. If we are to consider an enumeration period between 1916 and 1921, it is essential that all the latest facts should be before the Committee. The Government will be badly advised to allow any power to pass from this House in that regard to the Chief Electoral Officer.",8
40,Mr SINCLAIR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Who is in a better position to judge as to the necessity ?,8
41,Mr FENTON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"An enumeration between now and 1921 might result in some State losing a member, and the figures point at present to South Australia.",8
42,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Do you not It is believe in equality of representation ?,8
43,Mr FENTON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Yes ; but the House will be in a better position to judge if a special Bill proclaiming a special Enumeration Day is proposed. Clause agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Bill read a third time. BILLS RETURNED FROM SENATE. The following Bills were returned from the Senate without amendment or request : Appropriation Bill 1915-16. Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill 1915-16. War Loan Bill (No. 3). War Loan (United Kingdom) Bill (No. 4). Public Service (Acting Commissioner) LANDS ACQUISITION BILL . Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS' REPATRIATION FUND BILL . SECOND READING.",8
44,Mr JENSEN,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Bass-Minister for the Navy) [11.7] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. It has been introduced by the Government because of certain action taken by the Parliamentary War Committee with the State War Councils, who have recognised the usefulness of a national Repatriation Fund. The Committee and the Councils have promised the Government to do all they can to make the fund a huge success, so that assistance may be given to returned soldiers when required.",9
45,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Is that the £250,000 fund 1",9
46,Mr JENSEN,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"No . That is simply the amount contributed by the Government to the fund with the sanction of Parliament. The fund is a national one, to be subscribed by the people, and to be absolutely under the control of trustees, for giving assistance to soldiers and sailors who have served at the war. Six trustees are appointed from the War Committee, and eight business men who have made a success of their life, and who have consented to act free to make the fund a success, are nominated by the Government. It is a matter for regret that the same amount of administration cannot be exercised in regard to other funds that have been raised in Australia in connection with the war. There is no Statute whereby the proper control of those funds can be compelled. The Government will not interfere with the Repatriation Fund except that an annual audit is required for presentation to Parliament. The trustees will treat every portion of Australia in the way it deserves, and will apportion the fund according to the districts in which soldiers have enlisted. The Government have asked Parliament to provide £250,000, in order to make the fund a huge success and give relief to returned soldiers. We do not say thatjthis will be the only money given for the same purpose.",9
47,Mr KELLY,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Will any sums given to this fund be allowed as a set off against Bill. the war-profits taxation 1,9
48,Mr JENSEN,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"The matter has received the attention of the Government. I do not think that any such proposal will be entertained. Many persons whose health will not permit them to go to the war, and others whose age prevents them from doing so, feel that they would like to make some sacrifice in order to show their sympathy with the soldiers who have gone to fight, and they prefer to show that sympathy in a financial way. Already gentlemen who are too old to go to the front have subscribed as much as £25,000. I refer to the very laudable action of Messrs. Baillieu, but I believe that there are thousands of people who will view this fund from the same point of view. As many people will"" be prepared to give in kind instead of cash, the trustees will accept gifts in the shape of cattle, sheep, horses, and so on; in fact, anything of any value that will assist returned soldiers, and thus those who are placed on the land will be able to secure a certain number of stock. The trustees will also be empowered to lend or give money to any soldier who is anxious to open a small business. When the measure is passed a general secretary will be appointed, and also a publicity agent- a smart man, who will see that the fund is properly advertised and organized throughout the Commonwealth, but the Government will not interfere in these matters. The whole control of the fund will be in the hands of the trustees, except that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth will be ex officio their chairman. The' Commonwealth Bank has promised that any moneys lying in the bank to the credit of the fund will earn 3 per cent. The trustees will also have power to deposit their funds in private banks. The Bill is a machinery measure, and I trust that it will pass without much comment, but before I sit down I wish to say a word of commendation in regard to the honourable member for Wannon. He deserves the highest praise for what he has done in his own electorate, and that of Corangamite. He has applied himself to his scheme in a laudable way, and hardly a week passes without our reading that large contributions have been made to the fund he is raising. I do not know whether the honourable member will yet see his way clear to place his scheme under the control of the trustees to be appointed under this Bill ; that is ter for the consideration of himself and the other gentlemen associated with him. The scheme contained in the Bill is the same in character as that of the"" honourable member, but it is a national one, whilst his relates to only a small portion of Australia. I trust that this national scheme will be of much benefit to returned soldiers in the future.",9
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"""Parramatta) [11.22] - As the Minister has correctly stated, this is a machinery Bill , and its passage should not occupy many minutes. Every one is in favour of the broad outlines of the proposal, and the Bill embodies the machinery necessary for carrying the scheme through to a successful issue. I hope the result will be to let loose the springs of generous feeling in the community, and that we shall all be stimulated to do our best to make the f u n d an abiding success.  Minister spoke in commendation of the work done by the honourable member for Wannon in connection with the repatriation of our soldiers. We all endorse those remarks. In consideration of the wide experience which the honourable member has had< does not the Minister think that the scheme would benefit greatly by including the honourable member amongst the trustees of the national fun d ? I do not think that a gentleman could be found in the Commonwealth who is better versed in this proposal, or who, by his energy and influence, could do more to make the scheme a success.",10
50,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Wimmera) [11.241I am glad that the Government have seen fit to introduce a machinerv Bill to deal with this great duty which is cast upon the people of Australia. Than the proposal contained in the measure I can hardly conceive of a better foundation on which the whole organization might rest, but I am disappointed that the Government have not assumed a greater responsibility in providing the money necessary to make the scheme a success. The Government have undertaken the whole organization in connection with the war, including the payment of our soldiers and of pensions to them' and their dependants. Those are national schemes, provided for by Statute, to be paid for out of the Consolidated Revenue and from special taxation, which is designed to fal l equally on all sections of the community. I do not say that a great scheme of this kind, a matwhich requires so much time and ability, individual assistance, and organization of a voluntary character, can be carried out exclusively on the lines of the War Pensions Bill . But I think that the primary obligation to find money for the scheme should rest upon the Government. The right note has been struck in appointing men of experience to be an independent Board of Trustees, who will be the centre of all the radiating organizations. They will deal with the State Committees, which, in turn, will deal with the local bodies throughout their respective States. I can conceive that good use might be made of the municipal bodies throughout the Commonwealth as the basis of local organization. There are great possibilities in the country districts for this scheme, and in that respect the work of the honourable member for Wannon is an example to the people of the Commonwealth. He has pointed out that probably 100,000 soldiers will require to be dealt with. They will not need to be assisted by direct financial contribution, but means will have to be provided which will enable them to help themselves. The main object of a scheme of this kind will be to train men in the occupations for which they are best fitted, especially those who have been maimed, so that they may earn a living for themselves. We must bring back to health those whose constitutions have been undermined, and ensure to all who have suffered in the war training in some occupation which will provide them with a livelihood. The organization is so vast and complex that it can be properly worked only by bringing the whole of the sociological forces of the community to bear, so that each individual, according .to his temperament and ability, may be trained in the avocation for which he is most adapted. The organization will necessarily include certain forms of technical schools. There are also great possibilities in the fitting up of men. The cablegrams this morning state that in the University of Zurich, Switzerland, experiments are being made at the military hospital to train the muscles of amputated stumps to control the motion of artificial hands. But more particularly might this organization operate in regard to land settlement. In Australia we have only menced the work of land settlement, and we have sumcient ohject lessons to show that by a proper co-ordination of the efforts of this Committee, with those of various States, we can settle a very large proportion of the men on the land if money is made available for that purpose. If only 25 per cent, of the 100,00(3 returned soldiers show an inclination to go on the land, the matter will primarily rest with the States, who have land enough to absorb all who, after a certain probationary test, show they are fitted for country life. Irrigation has been successful in the northern districts, and there are large areas of Crown lands in the Swan Hill district, towards Mildura, and along the Murray generally-where , I believe, the honourable member for Balaclava is fruit-growing-wher e the men could be profitably settled. Then thero are fruitf rowing areas in almost all the States, n Tasmania there are areas that are so far undeveloped, and in Yictoria we have auriferous land, not altogether suitable for any other form of cultivation, but on which fruit-growers are now making a good living. It will he seen that there is any amount of scope, so far as the land is concerned; but if the scheme is to be a success it will be the duty of the Commonwealth to provide the necessary money. An allowance of £500 to each of the soldiers who may be disposed to go on the land will mean £12,000,000 or £13,000,000, which can be found only in the form of loan moneys; hut this is an obligation which rests on the National Parliament. A Committee is to be appointed, and the States asked to undertake certain work, but there is no provision made on which the Committee or the States can rest assured that there will be suflicient funds to successfully carry °n this colossal work throughout the Commonwealth. I can quite understand that those who believe in the pure voluntary system of enlistment will favour our depending on voluntary contributions, but we ought to know whether the Government have looked into the financial aspect °f the case from their point of view. Great work has been done by the honourable member for Wannon in his electorate and in the adjoining district [300] of Corangamite; but we cannot expect a scale so generous to be realized over the whole of the Commonwealth, because there are some districts com- that are by no means wealthy. We can expect only a few hundred thousand pounds; probably not more than £1,000,000 or £1,500,000; and the money the problem will have to engage the attention of the Government either now or when we meet again some weeks hence. The sum set down in the Estimates is altogether inadequate to meet a great national obligation of this character. We have already borrowed £35,000,000 locally, and propose to borrow £50,000,000 more; and the Treasurer told us yesterday that by the end of June, 1917, we shall bave a war debt of something like £110,000,000. Although a proportion of this is flowing hack, and being circulated, we musfhot forget that the loan moneys are drawn very largely from the accumulated deposits of the community, or, in other words, taken out of the national reserve. The war income tax is supposed to be fairly substantial; yet it is no£ yielding more than about £3,000,000 this year; and with a view to raising more revenue the Treasurer has very properly introduced a Bill to tax war profits. As yet we have no estimate of the yield from this impost; and though it ought, however, to he a fairly substantial sum, we may find it necessary, before long, to have additional taxation in order to meet the interest on the loans. The heavy taxation consequent upon the war, and the loans, mean the depletion, to a great extent, of the money resources of the people, who, after contributing liberally to the various patriotic funds, may find it dimcult to subscrilie on any princely scale to a repatriation fund. In any case, the aggregate result of voluntary contributions must be found totally inadequate. Before the measure for repatriation passes, wo ought to have some statement as to what is in contemplation by the Government in the way of raising the necessary money. The foundation of the scheme is land settlement; and I should like to know how far the Government are calling on the States to undertake serious and important work in this connection, and whether the States will have any guarantee that' the money will be available. I have already said that £12,000)000, and more, will be required to settle the reasonable proportion .of 25 per cent, of returned soldiers who will, doubtless, 'look to the authorities to show them how to make a living on the land; and if, say, £200 is allowed for each of the remaining 75,000 soldiers, - we shall require £25,000,000 to £30,000,000. Yet the only guarantee given by the Government that the scheme will run no risk of financial failure is the sum of £250,000 set down in the Estimates. This indicates a lack of appreciation on the part of the Government of the real obligation that rests on them. Voluntary contributions should be encouraged, and whatever scheme is adopted should have the hearty co-operation of every member of the House, and of every patriotic member of the community. It is the duty of the Government to lead the way, giving an assurance to the returned soldiers that their interests will be conserved, and that the scheme-o n which I congratulate the Committee-wil l be a success. There is a danger of depending entirely on voluntary contributions. The result of such a method is that the generous members of the community do.their share, while mean peopio escape their responsibility, the former performing a duty thatshould fall on the community as a whole. I hope that the Government will look into the financial side of this scheme, and realise more seriously their responsibilities under it.",10
51,Mr HIGGS,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Touchin g the £20,000,000 or £40,000,000 to which the honourable member has referred, how does he suggest that that money should be expended?",12
52,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"We have already passed a Bill authorizing the Government to borrow £25,000,000 from the Imperial Government. I see no reason why the unexpended portion of that loan should not be car-marked and made available to the State Governments for the settlement of returned soldiers on the land.",12
53,Mr HIGGS,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"What does the honorablo member mean by "" settled "" ? Does he mean that estates should be purchased?",12
54,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"No . This scheme of land settlement is not an Australian scheme only; it is Imperial. I probably -.have to be worked later on in co-ordination with the Imperial - Government, on the lines laid down by Sir Eider Haggard during his visit to this country. The State Governments have promised him that British soldiers will receive the most sympathetic treatment. The State Governments, in co-operation with the Imperial authorities, can well manage the land settlement portion of this scheme. But the obligation of finding the money requisite to put from the scheme into operation will rest on the Commonwealth. Instead of borrowing money from the Imperial authorities duir ing this war, we ought to be able to finance this matter for ourselves. Any money that may bo borrowed from the Imperial Government should be made available to the States for the settlement of soldiers on the land from time to time. I do not for a moment suggest any big scheme for the purchase of landed estates. I do not think we have utilized our Grown lands to the best advantage, because we have not made water available for irrigation purposes. We all know that the biggest production per acre and the most successful settlements today: are to - be found in our irrigation areas. Plenty of land is available in all the States. If the necessary money were forthcoming, it. would be quite possible to settle upon the Crown lands of Victoria all the returned soldiers who will desire to go upon them from this State. Any money that may be advanced to the settlers should be advanced for the purpose of assisting them to make homes . for themselves and to render their holdings profitable. I commend these few observations to the serious consideration of the Government. While I believe that a > great work will have to be done outside of laud settlement, I can see a big opportunity, in connection with this scheme,, to make use of all our various interests in order that we may not only provide employment for our returned soldiers, but provide it in the country districts. 1 know that the honourable memher for Wannon can speak of enterprising landowners, who, though they are unable' to supply largo amounts in cash, are in - a position to offer soldiers very favourable opportunities for settling on the laud; Only yesterday Mr Agar Wynne spoke, to ine about an offer which .he «; prepared to make. He said that he. t will is willing to allow four soldiers to cultivate 100 acres each. All tna*.' they would require at the outset would be a few implements and a house in which they could live togethor until' they were in a position to strike out for theiosel*eBw The scheme devised hy the honourable member for Wannon is a most instructive object-lesson to this House, and sbould furnish valuable information to the executive body which - will Bfc appointed under this Bill.  one of the trustees.",12
55,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,That wouid be a very good idea.,13
56,Dr OAETT SALMON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Does the honourable member think that his scheme is better than the Government scheme?,13
57,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"As soon as the Oommittee receives statutory authority under this Bill, and trustees are appointed, I think that every endeavour should be made by negotiations with the honourable member for Wannon to co-ordinate as far as possible all these schemes, and to place them under one central-authority.",13
58,Dr OABTT SALMON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Does the honourable member think that the scheme devised by the honourable member for Wannon should be subordinated to this scheme 1,13
59,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,I ant not going to pit one wsheme against the other.,13
60,Dr CABTT SALMON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Does not the honourable member see the difference that exists between them?,13
61,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"The only way that difference can be reconciled is by negotiation. These trustees - will be appointed to control a scheme operating over the whole of Australia, and one of their first duties will be to reconcile the differences .which exist between all the schemes which are in operation and which have the same object in view. The central body in each of the States is not likely to make a success of the scheme unless it provides in its organization local opportunities for - returned soldiers to settle upon the land.",13
62,Mr CARR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Macquarie) [11.50] Whilst one may admire the provisions of the Bill for the disbursement of this fund, it seems to me that there is a legal defect in the measure in so far as it contains no clauses providing for the receipt of contributions and maintenance of the fund, the existence of which, so far as the Bill is concerned, is merely presumptive.",13
63,Mr RODGERS,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,This Bill will be administered practically by regulation.,13
64,Mr CARR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"I am reminded by the honourable member's interjection that, whilst in the list of trustees of the fund [300]- 2 we find a number of estimable gentlemen, I do not think that there are many hustlers amongst them. They are all, no doubt, men of stability, and would be decided acquisitions for the administration of such a measure; but I think that the honourable member for Maranoa is about the only man of very vigorous type amongst them, and possibly, in consequence, the bulk of the work will fall upon his shoulders. I should like to see the name of the honourable .member for Wannon added to the list of trustees. We are told that Mr Baillieu contributed £25,000 to the fund, and consequently should have been, and has been, included in the list of trustees. We are told that the honourable member for Wannon hag succeeded in establishing a fund, for which he has received the sum of £60,000, for the same .purpose, and I suggest to the Minister in charge of the Bill that the most effective way to secure the fund established by the honourable member would be to place him on the list of trustees. I am not in any way authorized to make this suggestion by the honourable member for Wannon. I do. not even know his views on the subject; but, as a matter of policy, I should not hesitate to give a gentleman like him a seat on the board of trustees. I scarcely like the idea of permitting two members of the executive committee to form a quorum. There is a decided tendency in the working of committees of this kind for the executive to resolve itself into the least number possible. Under .the Bill the number in this case would be two. While they would be enthusiastic men, and would do their best to bear all the burden, they could not supplement the loss sustained by the fact that other members of the executive committee would refrain from taking an active part in the work. I think that the quorum of the executive committee should be increased at least to three, and the Minister would do well to seriously consider the advisability of adding to the number of trustees the honourable member for Wannon.",13
65,Dr CARTY SALMON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Grampians) [11.54] - I should like to say, with regard to the scheme proposed under this Bill, that where it adheres to that formulated by the honourable member for Wannon it is on safe grounds, and where it departs from that scheme it follows a course which we have traversed before in different parts of Australia, and which I hoped would be avoided in dealing with this matter. It seems to me that the vital difference between the two schemes is that that formulated by the honourable member for Wannon is a local scheme, with local control and supervision, whilst the other, called a national scheme, will mean the establishment of a central authority at tremendous expense, and involving a waste of effort. I am pointed at the result of the deliberations of the War Committee on this question, which, I suppose, was the only question of any magnitude that that Committee had to consider since it was appointed. They had an opportunity to propose a scheme that would do what the whole of the people of Australia desired 'should be done, that is, to provide means whereby the men who have gone abroad to fight for the integrity of Australia should, on their return, be absorbod in the general community as producers. Ou reading the provisions of the two schemes, I have been astonished at the lack of candour and of appreciation shown by the War Committee. One is struck with the great similarity, not only in sentences, but in whole paragraphs, between the War Committee's scheme and that formulated by the honourable member for Wannon. It seems to me that what the War Committee did was to take a scheme which had already been put into operation by the honourable member fnr Wannon and graft upon it the most objectionable feature of centralization, involving loss of efficiency and waste of money. I have not a single word bo say in regard to the personnel of the proposed trustees. The Government appear to have done what any other Government would have done in their place. They looked around amcngst the public men of Australia, and endeavoured to secure from each State a representative body. I do not know that they have been extremely happy in the selections they have made, considering the work which the committee controlling the fund will have bo do. The fact that the trustees will appoint an executive may diminish the dangers. 1I have suggested. I feel, with honorablo members who have already spoken, thab the honourable member for Wannon, who has attracted public attention by the'formulation of a scheme which is now in working operation, and is capable of extension, was entitled to greater consideraVr. Oarty Salmon. tion than he received from either the Government or the War Committee. 1 do not know to what extent he was consulted, but I do know that his scheme was utilized because of the evidence that portions of it have been incorporated in the scheme proposed by the War Committee. I express my very great disappointment thab this-work of showing our appreciation of the sacrifices which have disap- been made by those who have left Australia to defend it is being placed in the hands of a board or commission, and the Government of the day allowed to escape what I believo bo be bheir jusb responsibility. I fear that the men who have done, and are doing, so much for Australia may have held out to them as an inducement to continue theirsacrifices a very illusory benefit. The cost of administration under the proposal of the Government would outweigh altogether the advantages . that otherwise would be gained. Even at bhis late stage we ought to reconsider the whole matter, with a view to having local instead of central control, thus spreading over the whole continent the responsibility, nob only of providing the means for carrying out this greab work, but for the proper administration of the funds which will be collected. That is where I foel the whole scheme is going to break down. In the future, when the 'private contributions to the fund are nob sufficient, the House will be asked to vote large sums in order that the work may be carried on. We ought at this juncture to assure those who have the means that if they will only contribute to this great purpose the maximum of benefit will be secured for those whom we desire to help. If we can. do that we need have no fear of the result, but this Bill wiil do the very opposite. It will give persons who desire to escape their responsihilities' a further opportunity of doing so. I am astonished that those who have been so strongly urging what they call the conr scription of wealth should so rapidly have changed their views, and be so inconsistent .as to support the voluntary system. They are making a great mistake, and will find themselves called on at no distant date, when the demands which will be inevitably made on us become more apparent, to support the conscription of^ wealth, which they have so far advocated,., but which they seem disposed at presentto repudiate. I have been with the honourable member for Wannon when he .has advanced his proposals, and have Been how they have been received. The very heart of his method has been taken out of it by the Government, who have substituted officialdom and bureaucracy for that personal appeal and personal administration which undoubtedly forms the vital portion of the honourable member for Wannon's scheme. Those who have promised him support are saying that if he decides to throw in his lot with the Government scheme they will withdraw. They have been prepared to provide the land and the money on the distinct understanding that there is to be local control. I trust that when the men return we shall endeavour to place them hack in the districts from which they were drawn, and not congregate bhem in centres of population, where they may become a constant charge on the community. This scheme has been evolved by on« man, to whom the Bouse and the country are very much indebted, and to whom the War Commitbee are admittedly very much indebted also, because they have shown a left-handed appreciation of his work by adopting the better portion of the scheme, which they should have adopted entirely. If later on it was found thab the local obligations were not properly met,, it would be easy for this or any future Government to reverb to the proposals now being made; hub I can assure the' Government that if people in the country districts, from which the greater parb of the help will be obtainable, see that this is to be a Government measure, to be. administered from the greab centres of population, they will lose interestin it , and there will be a diminution in .the contributions which, we have a right to expect. Those contributions will be ours if the Government can only give the probable donoTS a guarantee that there will nob be wastef u l expenditure, or divided and dissipated effort. What we wanb is emulation between different districts, and local control, enabling ihe men bo he placed under the besb conditions, where they can make themselves independent, valuable assets to the community, and continuous producers.",13
66,Mr WISE,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Gippsland) [12.8] --The success of the measure seems to depend on two things-thj p finding and distribution of the monpy. ' The Bill deals wibh the fund and its distribution, bub does not say how it is to be raised, and I quite agree that Parliament oughb to foob the bill straight oub from beginning to end. The result with voluntary giving will be just the same as with voluntary enlistment. The willing person will give, and the mean man refrain. I have Been many instances of bhis, and it is a piby we do not recognise the' fact sbraight out. We Bhall have to do ib sooner or later, for it is our duty to see that the money is raised. If we raise it by taxation everybody gives according bo his wealth. I was surprised that the Minister for the Navy was nob ready bo say, in connection wibh a voluntary scheme like bhis, that every gift io the scheme would be exempb from taxation.",15
67,Mr JENSEN,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Any money gift is exempt, bub not gifts of cattle, horses, or land. It is hard to follow the value of gifts in kind.",15
68,Mr WISE,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Not ab all ; they are followed very quickly when a settlement for probate is filed. In this case the value can be followed out on all gifts of property, personal or real. The whole Bysbem, however, as proposed by the Governmenb is wrong. The responsibility lies on the whole people, and they should foot the bill according to bheir own individual share. There musb necessarily be a central body. Bub the Bill proposes bhat the central body should dispose of its funds to various Sbabe central bodies and then under the power given in clause 9 to the Governor General"" bo make regulations for carrying out or giving effect' to any obher. matter arising under the Act,"" it is quite possible that local bodies under the control of the State War Councils may be provided' for the final distribution of the money. It appears to me that we musb make one alteration in regard to our power of control. The body which the Bill appoints and' for which we are responsible is authorized bo hand over the money for distribution by the State War Councils. Now a State War Council is defined as meaning, "" in regard bo each State, the body appointed or recognised by the Governor in Council of that State as the Sbabe War Council."" The Commonwealth will have no' power of control over the appointment of the bodies which will be responsible for the distribution of the funds either directly or through local' committees.",15
69,Mr JENSEN,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,It is anticipated that the State Governments will combine with the Commonwealth Government in making certain grants.,16
70,Mr WISE,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"That may be the case, bnt when we reach clause 2 I shall move an amendmenb for the purpose of adding bo the definition of State War Council the words '* and approved by the Governor General."" In that way the Commonwealth Parliament, through the Government of the day, will have some conbrol in regard bo the appointment of these War Councils.",16
71,Dr CARTY SALMON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,-We do not see name of any country representative on the list of trustees.,16
72,Mr WISE,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"The trustees represent the various States. It would be impossible to Belect men to represent country districts in each State and add them to the list of trustees in the Bill . It would be too unwieldy a body. As it is men have been selected irrespective of parby. They are men in whom all can have confidence, and I think that we can look to them to do justice to the matter entrusted to them. We have power over the regulations, and if the amendment which I suggest is adopted we shall have some control over the bodies which will be immediately responsible for the actual distribution of the money. Ib was a mistake to invite private donations.",16
73,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Would the honourable member exclude them?,16
74,Mr WISE,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"I would exclude no one generous enough to give, hut at the same time the proper way in which to regard the question is to consider it as one for which the country as a whole is responsible, and for Which the necessary money should be raised by taxation.

How can we have - responsibility for the f u n d if we vest the actual expenditure of the money in local bodies over which we have nocontrol ? If we do nob accept the amendment we can have no real conbrol over the fund. The amendment does not seek bo hamper the State War Councils in their formation.

77,Mr RODGERS,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Wannon) [12.17] - I . oppose the amendment. Does the Commonwealth Parliament think that it has the right, to control the work of repatriation because of a grant of £250,000, while the whole burden' of administration is left to the States?",16
78,Mr KELLY,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,The States have contributed nothing so far.,16
79,Mr RODGERS,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"If the State W a r Council is bo conbrol the distribution of the funds, to be responsible for organizing and devolutionizing the whole of thearrangements and passing down control from - the principal to local committees, how can it allow the Commonwealbh Government bo dictate as to their composition. As a matter of fact, how can bheCommonwealth Governmenb judge as to the membership of these State bodies 1 The scheme was first established to be run by the Eederal War Committee in conjunction with the Sbabe War Councils, which were created for the very purpose. Now, because the Commonwealth has granted £250,000, ib is proposed bo ask the States to make a success of the scheme, and yet allow the Commonwealth to step in at any time and say who shall be members of a State Council and who shall remain off that body. Can the honourable member for Gippsland indicate in what respect there is danger or difficulty in making the State supreme within its own territory ? ) pro- The State controls the land; there-will he gifts of service and gifts of Statelands; the State will dominate the whole position; yet the Commonwealth wishes to determine who in the State is the best authority in whom to vest the control.",16
80,Mr KELLY,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Does the honourable member agree with the contention that the Commonwealth should he responsible for - the money ?,17
81,Mr RODGERS,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Bein g associated with another scheme, I find myself necessarily subject to'certain limitations in discussing this proposal. There are phases of it which I do not like. The feature of 'the other scheme with which I am associated is the possibility of having local, - quick, direct, and sympathetic administration. If the State War Committee are to go cap in hand to the Eederal Board every time they desire to make a change in the management, there will he trouble and confusion. The appeal, in the first instance, was made by the Minister of Defence in cold language in the press.. It was responded to by the one family very generously, but in Victoria there has been little further response. Do honourable members mean to say that if the State War Council had. had control cf the first appeal they would not have proceeded in a different . manner ? After canvassing the financial institutions and big industrial and commercial - firms, and explaining to them the scheme, they might have held a great inaugural demonstration in the Town Hall, and probably the scheme would have received a flying start with contributions amounting to £600,000. Now the State War Coininittee are committed to the initial failure caused through their not having been consulted in connection with the first appeal. This Committee will make a great mistake if, while placing on-the States the responsibility for working the scheme, they desire to keep the control in the hands of the Commonwealth .Parliament. .

83,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,That is for land settlement. Such a proposal has been made in different parts of Australia ,17
84,Mr FENTON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"If we are to have a scheme, that is under the general supervihave sion of the Commonwealth, and independently of that, the State Government launch out on schemes of their own, there will be confusion. Presumably the scheme mentioned by Mr Ashfield emanates from the State Government, and not from the State War Committee. Some central authority ought to be able to step in and arrange an amalgamation of all the schemes. Unless we have some such central authority, the whole endeavour will result in chaos.",17
85,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"We must have a strong central authority, but that authority may be delegated to the States.",17
86,Mr FENTON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"The honourable member seems to argue that, although the States should be called upon to carry out the scheme, the Federal Parliament should provide the funds.",17
87,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Hear , hear! That is the responsibility of the whole people.",17
88,Mr FENTON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"I agree. So far as money raising is concerned, except in regard to voluntary contributions, this Parliament is responsible. That being so, we must-have some kind of control over the State Committee. The' proposal, of the honourable member for Wimmera is that the States should form Committees and be allowed to administer the scheme with money provided by the Commonwealth. But I think he should ask for some right to exercise a general oversight of the Committee in order to know how the money is being expended.",17
89,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,I admit that there must be some supervision.,17
90,Mr FENTON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"I agree .with the laudatory - remarks that have been made concerning the efforts of the honourable member for Wannon. They are worthy of the emulation of all of us, and the success with which they met is in itself a sufficient commendation of them. In the same way, any scheme launched by the New South Wales Government would help, but. I am afraid that if all these schemes are to be carried on separately there will be chaos. All the funds must be drawn in together before the money can be sent out. I notice that the Premier of Victoria objects to the scheme outlined by the Premier of New South Wales to give £1 per week to every returned soldier.",17
91,Mr JENSEN,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Can you prohibit the State Governments doing thati,17
92,Mr FENTON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"No ; but if we are to duplication of efforts, and the New South Wales Government intend to proceed with their scheme, the Federal proposal will fail.",17
93,Mr JENSEN,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,All the State Governments have consented to fall in with the proposal contained in this Bill.,18
94,Mr FENTON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,That is all I desire to words know. But. Mr Ashfield is reported to have said that the New South Wales Government intended to provide every man rent account? with £500.,18
95,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"That is for men going on the land, but it does not reduce the sponsibility of the Commonwealth to find money for the States. Mr rENTON - I do not say it. does, but it would be much better to have the scheme'combined, and all the local bodies subject to a central committee, in order to secure uniformity in administration. If there are separate organizations fusion must follow, but otherwise this patriation scheme ought to prove a success.",18

Suppose, for argument's sake, totbat one State gave a very handsome weekly pension to any returned soldiers, thero would instantly he a tendency to migration in the direction of that parWill ticular State, with resultant dislocation the industries and energies of the States from, which they come. Really this is purely a State matter. If , for instance, .such a magnet wero created in New South Wales, aud soldiers from the front insisted on living in that State, the employa ment of Australia would be disorganized; and from that point of view I suggest, a preliminary way, that the matter is States. worth the close attention of Ministers.

102,Mr RODGERS,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Wannon) [12.44] This Bill will be mainly administered by the regulations. I am satisfied that the scheme for which it provides can be made a success only if there is removed fro m the minds of the people the feeling that if they contribute voluntarily to it today I they will also be compelled to contribute to it later on. Public opinion is confused as to whether the whole of the repatriation funds are to be subscribed voluntarily, or whether they are to be obtained by means of taxation. My view is that they should be raised in both ways. A certain amount should be collected by means of taxation, and the balance should be made up of voluntary contributions. Just as in the early ""days of this country there were selectors' rights, so our soldiers upon returning from the war will have earned new citizen rights. The private wealth of this conntry is estimated at £1,000,000,000"", and there is a growing disposition on the part of the owners of that wealth to recognise what our soldiers have done by opening up to them on their return more profitable avenues of employment. But this growing public spirit will surely be killed in the absence of a declaration by the Government that volunv tary gifts will be exempt from taxation. Upon the whole, the public spirit vhich has been exhibited in this matter is good, but there are many individuals who are withholding contributions simply be made cause they do not know whether taxation copy will be subsequently levied upon them. each The Government should at once declare that every g if t to the fund shall be r for the exempt from taxation.  subvery pleased that the honourable member in for Wannon has brought this matter Treaunder the notice of the Committee - T may tell him that it was discussed at some length by the trustees of the f u n d when this Bill was under consideration by The Acting Prime Minister then the promised that if any legislation were brought forward during the life of the present Government with the object of imposing special taxation for the purposes of the Repatriation Fund, the volunsubscribers to the f u n d would be protected up to the amount which they which a State had contributed. ' Mr KELLY (Wentworth) [12.50] - I do not think that the honourable member for Maranoa has quite stated the position. It has to be remembered that there is a War-time Profits Bill to be introduced which is likely to affect the measure now under consideration more than any other, because people do not know what they may have to pay under that Bill. It will help the fund enormously if the Minister can make some statement with regard to the War-time Profits Bill. That will deal not with war profits but with war-time profits, and some of the biggest profits made will be deliberately excluded from the operation of the Bill. I realise the Minister's difficulty in giving undertaking with respect to gifts in kind, but I think he should make some effort to surmount it. Gifts in kind do not differ in principle from other gifts, and no gifts but cash have a fixed value as at the date of gift. If we take the case of a man who gives £10,000 worth of scrip, it will have a certain face value, and if sold in small parcels may realise that value, but if an attempt be made to realise the value in one lot, it will be depreciated the law of the market. I think the Minister should be able to say without any servation at all that, so far as gifts in cash are concerned, there will be an exemption made from the operation of the War-time Profits Tax, and he should be prepared to announce that he'will take into sympathetic consideration the possibility of making provision for an exemption in the case of gifts in kind, &c.",19
103,Mr JENSEN,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Mone y gifts are free from income tax assessments, and the Government will consider the request for an exemption in the case of gifts in kind later on.",20
104,Mr KELLY,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,The sooner the Minister makes any announcement he has to make the better it will be for the Repatriation Fund.,20
105,Mr ARCHIBALD,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Adelaide) [12.54]. --The Government, in my opinion, should be very careful in dealing with this matter, as they may require to make proposals for further income taxation. If what some honourable members have proposed were agreed to,, the practical result would be that a premium would be offered to a man to make a gift to the fund to avoid income tax.",20
106,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,There would be nothing to be gained by that..  ber think that he should tax a man for giving him money!,20
107,Mr ARCHIBALD,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"If a man has asurplus of income after payment of income tax and other liabilities, he may throw it away, or waste it. A man with a very small margin after he has met hisliabilities, including income tax, may feel acutely his inability to contribute to the> fund, whilst another man with a large Bill surplus of income may make a generous contribution to the fund, and so escape; the payment of income tax which he would otherwise have to meet.",20
108,Mr CORSER,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Wide Bay) [12.56] any There is a great deal more in this matter than some honourable members appear to recognise. A very large number of people may feel thab they can afford to> contribute a sum of money to this fund, but they are uncertain as to what their taxation will be, and they will wait to ascertain that before contributing to the fund. We may, in consequence of thisuncertainty, lose many contributions which would otherwise be made to the-by fund. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has said that by contributing to< re- the fund a man would be able to evade income tax, but the honourable member overlooks the fact that he must pay the> tax upon what his income is shown to he unable to see the reason for the discrimination made by the Minister between contributions in cash and in kind. If I desire to give a returned soldier 150 sheep toassist him to stock up a property, every one in the district will know the value of those sheep, but the Minister proposes that the sheep should be sold, and the amount realized handed over to the trustees of the fund. The result would only be that the trustees would have to re-invest the amount in the purchase of the sheep again. Clause agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported with amendments. Standing Orders suspended, and Bill passed through its remaining stages. WAR PENSIONS BIL L (No. 3). Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of a Message from the Governor General recommending a further appropriation for the purposes of this Bill. Ordered That the message be taken into consideration in Committee forthwith. In Gommittee (Consideration of Governor General's message): Motion (by Mr HIGGS ) agreed toThat it is expedient that a further appropria-. tion of revenue he made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to amend the War Pensions Act 1914-1915. Resolution reported and adopted.",20
109,Mr HIGGS,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Capricornia-Treasurer ) [1.0] - I move That the Bill be now recommitted to a Committee of the whole House for the consideration - of a proposed amendment in clause 4. 'The object of this recommittal is to make the alterations rendered necessary as the result of the amendment made in the Bill last night, having reference to parents who are in need five years after applicati on is made. It is desired only to make a consequential amendment. Question resolved in the aflirmative. In Committee (Recommittal): Clause 4Section 3 of the principal Act is amended . Section proposed to be amended-(Pensions - upon death or incapacity in consequence of - warlike operations). Amendment (by Mr HIGGS ) agreed toThat after the word.

Clause, as amended, agreed tp. Bill reported, with a further amendment. Standing Orders suspended; report adopted.",21
110,Unknown,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Sitting suspended from H to 2.15 p.m. Motion (by Mr HIGGS ) proposed- That this Bill be now read a third time.,21
111,Mr WEST,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"East Sydney) [2.22] - No Hill has passed through Parliament with - such rapidity, though it is a measure that should have received the most serious - consideration from every honourable member. In my opinion, a serious mistake has been made by the Government in their anxiety to meet the wishes of honourable members in fixing a differential rate in the case of children. For the first child 10s. is to be allowed, for the second child 7s. 6d., and for each other child 5s. The mistake lies in providing a smaller sum for the children who will be for the longest period with the mother, and dependent on her. They should ge. . 1 more than 5s. a week after the elder children have come of age. I do not think that it was intended to differentiate in favour of the small family. If steps are not taken to remove the error the measure must be soon amended by a further Bill. The adoption of a flat rate would be the most equitable system. This principle of differentiation may be copied into otlier legislation, though it is quite contrary to the teachings of the party to which I , and to which Ministers belong.",21
112,Mr HIGGS,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Capricornia) [2.25] This is the first intimation that I have had as to the honourable member's construing of the provision. I do not think the honourable member is correct. I had the assistance of one of our Crown Law advisers in drafting the amendment, and the spirit of it is that when the first child reaches the age of sixteen years and ceases to draw the allowance the second child drops into the place the first child has vacated. The matter can be made clear by a regulation, or, if necessary, an' amendment will be made should the Crown Law advisers recommend such action. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",21
113,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Owing to the splendid reports of our speeches by Hamsard I do not peruse proofs of my speeches as I should, hence an error occurred in some remarks I made while speaking on the Budget. Speaking of the hydro-electric scheme in Tasmania, I am reported as having saidThere is a current from the generating station 63 miles from Hobart having a voltage of 83,000 electric horse-power. "" Electric horse-power"" should read ""volts."" Further, I am reported to have saidThe enormous power of the currentI t should be "" pressure""can be understood from the fact that the tramways in Hobart arc run with a voltage of about 410 volts as compared with this high potential current from the hydro-electrie scheme of 83,000 electric horse-power. There again ""electric horse-power"" should he ""volts."" I make this correction simply that my speech may read intelligibly. WAR PRECAUTIONS BILL No. 4. SECOND READING. Motion (by Mr JENSEN) proposed - That this Bill be now read a second time. ' Mr FINLAYSON (Brisbane) [2.28]. - I desire to get an assurance from the Minister that there will be some modification of policy in regard to the administration of the War Precautions Act, which at present is putting a limitation on free speech and a free press in such a way ae was never authorized by Parliament, or suggested by the Government when the measure was passed. I further wish to know whether there is to be any change in regard to the prosecution of men such as Percy Mandino, of Brisbane; Thomas Barker, of New South Wales; Skurry, of Melbourne; and others? If it is policy of the Government to use the War Precautions Act for the purpose of interfering with the expression of free opinion at a time when ordinary criticism would be quite in order, and special criticism not out of place, it is a degradation of the powers of the Government, and an unfair use of the measure. The Minister is quite well aware of the dissatisfaction that these prosecutions have occasioned in the public mind. Last week I referred to these limitations on free speech, and a free press, as being a great hindrance to recruiting. One of the most serious hindrances we have to irecruiting, especially to the working classes offering themselves, is the tyrannical administration of the War Precautions Act. If the Minister will give the House some assurance that there will be a reasonable modification in regard to the administration of the measure, I shall withdraw any opposition to this Bill, but if he cannot give that assurance, we must find some better means for applying the Act. There can be ""no justification for the prosecutions. It is a farce and a comedy of government to imagine that what a man says, even a Minister, can have the effect that it has been claimed has been caused by Messrs. Barker, Mandino, and Skurry, whom I quote merely by way of illustration. In the Argus the other week, it was said that a statement made by Senator Pearce would be most prejudicial to recruiting. If that was the case the Minister of Defence should have been interned. I wondered at the time whether there was a hope of the Act being applied to him. Why should it be applied to Mandino's statement or Barker's cartoon, and not to the Minister's statement? The law should not know any difference between the Minister and Barker. Barker's cartoon had not the slightest effect on recruiting. How can the publication of a cartoon in an obscure paper, or the expression of an opinion conveyed to a few individuals on the Domain or the Yarra Bank, affeci the patriotism of those people? These prosecutions amount to foolishness, almost to stupidity. There is more reason today, in the time of war, for having a free expression of opinion, and an unlimited opportunity of expressing that opinion, than there is in ordinary times. Mr Justice Higgins has said most the correctly that acts of Government are always open to criticism, and as war is one of the most important acts of Government it is particularly a subject for criticism. No one believes in his inmost heart that the man on the Domain or the Yarra Bank, or speaking from a soap-box at a corner of the street, or even giving his opinion at a public meeting, will affect the' policy of the Government or the conduct of the war. The best guarantee for the protection of responsible government is the free expression of opinion. This party, of all parties in politics in the world today, has had to fight opposition of the most strenuous kind, misapprehension, abuse,, lies, and false reports, and we have always claimed liberty of conscience and freedom of speech, and that under a Labour Government tliere should be such an exercise of the powers of government as I have referred to is altogether unreasonable. But if the Minister will give the House some assurance of the kind I have indicated, I shall be content to give him another chance to see what he can do.",21
114,Mr WEST,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"East Sydney) [2.36] - I have attended the Sydney Domain and the Yarra Bank in Melbourne .on many occasions, and for the life of me I cannot understand why the Government should object to what has been said there. I wason the Yarra Bank last Sunday with other honourable members, and a more orderly crowd I have never seen. What surprised me most was the presence of about twelve or fourteen of the biggest policemen I have ever seen; some of them must have weighed about twenty-two stone. about the second or third Sunday in A p r i l there were six gatherings on the Yarra Bank, and at five of them the subject under discussion was religion. One speaker affirmed that there was a God and another said that there was not. The only meeting at which an address of an intellectual character was to be heard was that at which the speaker was an A.W.TJ. member. Hewas addressing the crowd on the history of the war, and the speech was so good that if it had been delivered in this House it would have taught honourable memberssomething. I ask the Government to use a little discretion in regard to the meetings both in the Sydney Domain and on the Yarra Bank. I should say that for every one man who attends the Yarra Bank meetings 500 or 400 attend the meetings in the Sydney Domain. Yet the Government in New South Wales do not consider the gatherings of sufficient importance to warrant the attendance of a large number of policemen. Federal Government would be wise if in the operation of the War Precautions Act they allowed orderly discussion and criticism. A good deal of the criticism has reference to members of Parliament, and I for one like to attend and hear what is said about me. I hope the Government will allow the meetings to continue. There are certain people in the community who are noted for their exceptional ideas, and they think they can make the world a better place. They do no harm. Let it not be said that a Labour Government are desirous of smothering free speech. My own experience, on Sunday after Sunday, is that no harm is done by allowing these persons an opportunity to ventilate their views. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2Section.4 (""Regulations"") of the principal Act is amended Amendment (by Mr JENSEN) agreed toThat after the word "" amended,"" the followthe ing words be inserted :""(a) by inserting after sub-section (1) lowing sub-section :"" (IA) The Governor General may make such regulations as Ee thinks able for the more effectual tion of the war, or the more effectual defence of the Commonwealth or of the realm, prescribing and regulatingOn (a) any action to be taken by or in regard to alien enemies, or persons having enemy associations or connexions, with reference to possession and ownership of their property, the continuance or discontinuance of their trade or business, and their civil rights and obligations; and (b) the conditions (including times, places, and prices) of the disposal or use of any property, goods, articles, - or things of any kind.""; and (c) the requisitioning of any goods, articles, or things of any kind""; and (b).""

Title agreed to. Bill reported with amendments. Standing Orders suspended, and Bill passed through its remaining stages. PATENTS ACT (PARTIA L SUSPENSION ) BILL . SECOND READING.",22
115,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [2.44] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will recollect that, when the last Patents A ct was passed, we copied a section out of the British Act, which provided for the working of the patent in the country where it was held, so that patents which were held in Australia by any persons or firms outside Australia should be operated in Australia within two years from the granting of them. That is the present law. But the British Government have found that, on account of such a large number of the holders of. patents being engaged in the manufacthe folture of munitions and in other warlike preparations, they are unable to enforce that section in Great Britain . In order desirto bring our law into line with the British prosecuAct, and so as not to penalize ETitish manufacturers who are engaged in war work, this Bill is introduced to suspend the operation of that compulsory section. There is only one clause in the readsThe operation of section 87A of the Patents Aet 1903-1909 shall be suspended during the continuance of the present war, and for a period of six months thereafter, and in reckoning the period of four years mentioned in that section the period during which that section is suspended by virtue of this Act shall not be taken into account. Of course, this Bill will suspend the patents of everybody, but if we do not make the amendment, American or other neutral holders of patents will be able to operate their rights to the prejudice of Britishers who are otherwise engaged.",23
116,Mr KELLY,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Despit e the Act being brought into conformity with the British Act, individual instances may have arisen in which patents have lapsed.",24
117,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"I have not heard of any having lapsed, but I shall endeavour to obtain information on the point. Our Act was not brought into operation for a certain time, and it is probable that, even after its commencement, some little time elapsed before we had any applications for patents. If any patents have lapsed, it may be advisable to make an amendment dating the operation of the Bill from the commencement of the war. This measure will provide that we shall not enforce what are considered by some people to be penal provisions. They are really not penal provisions in ordinary times-o n the .contrary, they are very just-but , on account of the extraordinary circumstances that obtain, we think it only fair to those engaged' in war work that they should have the advantage which the Bill confers.",24
118,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Kooyong) [2.48]. - I agree with what has been said by Minister as to the desirability of the amendment. amendmenb, but I think that the conditions have been so abnormal during the whole period of the war that patentees have probably suffered serious disadvantage in consequence. I suggest' to the Minister the insertion after word "" suspended"" of the following words:- "" as from the commencement of, and during' the continuance of, the present war.""",24
119,Mr FENTON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Maribyrnong) [2.50] Does this Bill apply to enemy patents?,24
120,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"They are dealt with under another Act, and are suspended. Some people are operating enemy patents at Bill , and it the present time.",24
121,Mr FENTON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"A disgraceful state of affairs was disclosed in Great Britain the other day, when the management of the Technical Museum at South Kensington had to apply to a Court of law for the right to operate a German patent that would be of use in connection with the Government's war-like preparations. The application was opposed by the agents of the German patentees, and the decision of the Court had to be obtained before the Technical Museum could proceed with that necessary war work. . I do not know whether the same position obtains in Australia. Personally, I have no regard for enemy patents - If we can allow our own manufacturers to operate tliem and give employment to our own men, let us do so without any consideration to the enemy patentee.",24
122,Mr KELLY,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Wentworth) [2.52] - I understand that no British patent rights have lapsed up to the present, and that this Bill is merely, for the purpose of protecting British patentees, under the penal sections referred to by the Minister, against the competition of neutrals. The Bill really protects our own people. It does not in any way impinge or touch in the remotest way the question of enemy patent rights, which is dealt with in another measure. I think we might pass this Bill without delay.",24
123,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"B y inquiry from the Commissioner of Patents I have ascertained that no patents have yet lapsed, but the passage of this Bill will ' save certain patents from doing so. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed the through its remaining stages without many INVALIDAND OLD-AGE PENSIONS APPROPRIATION RILL. In Committee (Consideration of Go the vernor-General's message) : Motion (by Mr HIGGS ) proposed - That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a sum for Invalid and Old-age Pensions.",24
124,Mr HANN AN,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Fawkner) [2.56] Many opinions are expressed as to the taxation imposed, on certain sections of the community in connection with the war, but I believe that the most heavily taxed are the invalid and old-age pensioners. The Labour party, when appealing to the country, made a distinct promise that one of the first measures would be a Bill to 'increase these pensions by 2s. 6d. per week.  qualification that it depended on whether the financial conditions permitted.",25
125,Mr HANNAN,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"The financial responsibilities of the war have so far prevented that promise being carried into effect, and thus, I submit, these deserving people, by this deprivation, are really paying a tax equal to 25 per cent. The earliest opportunity should be taken to remove the injustice. The blind, by dint of much tuition, are enabled to follow certain trades, and the only reward they get for trying to better their position is to be deprived of an invalid pension. Immediately they have sufficient skill and ability to earn £1 per week they lose the right to a pension, so that, instead of their being assisted, as this worthy section of the community ought to be in the manner really intended, a hardship is inflicted on them. In the institute in Victoria there are, in the mat shop, a number of married men, four of whom average £ 1 5s. per week, two of whom earn £1 5s. 6d. each, two of whom earn £ 1 6s. 6d. each, while one earns £ 1 7s., and another £ 1 7s. 6d. Because of these earnings they are denied an invalid pension; and the law ought to be amended to permit these unfortunate men, and some women, to obtain the benefit of the Act, quite irrespective of their small earnings. I trust that the Treasurer, who is naturally sympathetic in regard to such people, will take the matter into consideration, and at the earliest opportunity introduce a measure which will have the effect of giving to these people that to which the majority of honourable members believe they are entitled.. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended. Resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr Higgs and Mr O'Malley do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Mr HIGGS, and passed through all its stages without amendment. WAR CENSUS BILL (No. 3), Mr KING O'MALLEY (D a r w in Minister of Home Affairs) [3.5] - I moveTbat the Bill be now read a second time. The object of this Bill, which has come a down from the Senate, is simply to strengthen the Act of 1915, and facilitate proof of the offence of omitting to send in cards. Thousands of people take no notice of the official intimation, and theCrown, as the law stands at present, is unable to prove the offence. The Bill provides that, in any proceedings, the averment of the prosecutor shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of iproof to the contrary, and a certificate in writing, signed by the Statistician, will be prima facie evidence that the defendant has failed to transmit the necessary form. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment. RULES PUBLICATION BILL . SECOND READING.",25
126,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.10] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The object of the Bill is to avoid the necessity of making rules and regulations when once these have been provisionally published. The Act of 1903 provides that at least sixty days must elapse between the publication of the provisional rule and the publication of the statutory rule, and, although that Act has been in operation for thirteen years, hardly one of these provisional rules has been questioned. The provisional publication was for the purpose of allowing any outsiders to suggest amendments, but, as I say, hardly one has been suggested, and the Bill will make the provisional rule the rule itself, thus saving much expense in printing and distributing. The rights of honourable members will not be jeopardized in any way. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passct through its remaining stages without amendment. BILLS RETURNED FROM SENATE. The following Bills were returned from the Senate without amendment: War Loan (United Kingdom) Bill (No. 3). States Loan Bill. Representation Bill. ACTS INTERPRETATIONBILL . solidation "" was an error. SECOND READING.",25
127,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.12] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a purely legal measure. It provides that where, in any Act, reference is made to any other Act, and that other Act is subsequently amended, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the reference shall, from the date of the amendment, be deemed to be to that Act as so amended. I have not had time to look into the Bill very closely, but. I understand that when an Act-say , the Electoral Act-is referred to in another Act, the reference shall be deemed to include any amendments to the Electoral Act.",26
128,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,Is the B i l urgently required now?,26
129,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"The Bill has been passed by the Senate, and I understand that it will be of convenience to the Law Department.",26
130,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Parkes) [3.14]. - The Minister of Trade and Customs has drawn attention to a practice, think, is a good one, of saving - people the trouble of going back and looking over a whole series of Acts; if the Government are going to adopt this amendment. plan generally, a great deal of care will have to be exercised, because in all the States and in England, where there is consolidation of Acts, the certificate from the Chief Justice is always required to assure Parliament that no fresh law has been incorporated in the Statute which has been brought down to date. It is easy matter for a legal officer of the Crown to alter the law when adding slight phrase, or even a - word, to an or a series of Acts in order to give i modern interpretation. In New Wales, where Judge Heydon spent several years in consolidating the Statutes, cases he had to receive a certificate from the Chief Justice to show that no fresh law or alteration of the law had been corporated.",26
131,Sir ROBERT BEST,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,I understand that this is merely for the purpose of citation.,26
132,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"The Minister used the word "" consolidation."" If it is merely for citation purposes there is no objection, to the measure.",26
133,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"The use of the word "" conThis Bill merely provides that the last amending Act shall be the one to be cited as the title. Question resolved in the aflirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through - its remaining stages without amendment. POST ANDTELEGRAPHBILL . Mr Webster ""(Gwydir-Postmaster General) [3.19] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The Bill is brought forward for the purpose of expediting and economizing the administration of the Postal Department by bringing districts that are distant from the principal centres in one State under the administration that is located in l the central office which is nearest to them. For instance, the administration of Broken Hill from Sydney means expense and circumlocution. We propose to adCrown minister Broken Hill from Adelaide. Places distant from the governing centre of the State will be controlled from the nearest administrative centre, though which, I it may be in another State. Question resolved in the aflirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed but. through its remaining stages without PUBLIC SERVICE BILL .",26
134,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Yarra - Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.22] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a Bill which is introduced for the an same purpose as the Bill just passed. There are certain officers in the Public a Service in districts which it is proAct posed to administer from the nearest t some centre, though it may be in another South State. For instance, we wish to administer Broken Hill from Adelaide,, and in all Port Darwin from Brisbane. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed inthrough its remaining stages without amendment. CUSTOMS BILL .",26
135,Mr TUDOR,TRADE WITH ENGLAND AND,"Yarra - Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.25] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is brought forward for the same reason as the two preceding Bills. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment. NA BILL (No. 3).",27
136,Mr TUDOR,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.27] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This Bill has come to us from the Senate. There are three principles involved: firstly, the provision of a proper custodian of enemy property; secondly, the registration of enemy property and enemy debts; and thirdly,' the winding up of enemy companies. The Bill introduces no new features, but it amplifies the Act of 1914, and, with certain modifications in regard to shares and other things to he handed over to the public trustee, it follows the Imperial Act . The modifications refer to matters that are applicable here and not in Great Britain . For in stance, we have taken over enemy shares and other things, which has not been done in Great Britain. trustee under the Bill is the Comptroller General of Customs, and he is given power to appoint others to represent him. Honourable members who have made themselves conversant with the measure will realise that it is best to safeguard the position of the public trustee. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment. WAR PENSIONS BILL . Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. LANDS ACQUISITION BILL . SECOND READING.",27
137,Mr HIGGS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Capricornia) [3.32] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. Last evening, the honourable member for Richmond asked for information about an item of £102,000 which had been advanced for the purchase of land for a site for the Commonwealth Bank. I in formed the honourable member that the item appeared on the Estimates because the Government had not been able to give the Governor of the Bank a clear title to the land, and that a Bill was necessary for that purpose; but that, as soon as the Bill was passed, the Governor of the Bank would pay the Government the £102,000. In accordance with the request of the honourable member for Maribyrnong, I have perused the history of this transaction. The land was acquired under our powers of resumption, and, as we had to pay the owner 3 per cent, while he was waiting for his money, the Commonwealth Bank is asked to pay 3 per cent, on the money owing by them. The Bill is required to enable us to give the Commonwealth Bank a clear title to this l and ; and, as soon as it becomes law, we shall collect the money.",27

143,Mr CARR,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Macquarie)' [3'.40]' - I was hoping that there would be no necessity for me to say anything on this matter. Unfortunately, I have a good deal to say that I would rather not have to say, but I owe a duty to the people who sent me here, and to the country at large, which I intend to discharge. I have always opposed some of the extravagant propositions of the Government, but, being a supporter of the party in power, I have hesitated to take any pronounced stand against them. The Committee will remember that during last session I strongly combated a proposal to remove the Small Arms Factory from Lithgow to the Federal Capital area. I regarded it as a hare-brained proposal coming from a few enthusiasts "" drest in a little brief author it y , "" who had been skilfully imposed upon by a few designing officials who were anxious to concentrate everything in the Federal Capital area. Lending a ready ear to those designs, they suggested that a Small Arms Factory be established in the Federal Territory. Apart from the inadvisability of concentrating large works connected with war preparations in one place, I had to consider that the proposal meant ruination to a flourishing town, which is destined by nature to become the industrial centre of Australian manufacture, but apparently is to be spoilt by a few unthinking men. The upshot of the discussion that took place was an understanding that the matter was to be held up until Parliament had. an opportunity of deciding whether the proposal was to be carried through or not. Buring the recess, some time in March, the newspapers announced that the Treasurer had hypothecated a sum of £40,000 for the purpose of establishing at Canberra an arsenal:,, including, a small arms factory.. This action cut right across the grain bf the honourable understanding arrived at before the House adjourned, and, as Parliament was not in session,. I had no alternative but to resort to the public June, press, an action which apparently disturbed the serenity of some Ministers. The Government were guilty of a breach of faith in approaching this matter in a circumlocutory fashion, instead of directly. The utilization of the Treasurer's Advance for this purpose was quite illegal, and that is proved by the fact that when the matter came before the House in a formal way the figures were reduced from £40,000' to £20,000, so as to bring the proposition within the law. When the Government are guilty of abuses of that kind, they are not to be trusted; for my own part, I am not prepared to trust them out of my sight. The other day I saw the Acting Prime Minister, and expressed to him my point of view, namely, that it was inadvisable to concentrate all Defence works in one area, and also that the removal of the Small Arms Factory from Lithgow would do an injury to that town, and I told him that contumely was being heaped upon me as an individual who had been a docile supporter of the Labour Government during the past ten years. What else took place at that interview I am not prepared to disclose, but I left the Acting Prime Minister in the frame of mind of a boy who is told ""to shut his eyes, and open his mouth, and trust what God will send him."" I did not wish to have a factious debate in the House, but I find that is unavoidable. To show my confidence in the Government, and to give tliem another opportunity, I left Melbourne and allowed matters to take tlieir course, believing that what I wanted would be conserved to me, and that the town of Lithgow and its people would be protected in every way. When I returned to Melbourne, I found that the Leader of the Opposition, after frequent interviews with the Government, had got a certain amount of satisfaction from the Acting Prime Minister. I feel sorry that it was left to> the Leader of the Opposition to deal with this, and that a mere follower of the Labour party was not to be complimented to the extent of Having that consideration bestowed on him. However, I accepted the position. Later, a statement was read by the Treasurer, and supAlsoported by the Acting Leader of the House, which did not convey all that is desired.",28
144,Mr HIGGS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"When I read that stateThe ment, the Acting Prime Minister was sitting in the Chamber, and the Leader the Opposition raised no objection at the time.",29
145,Mr CARR,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I say that the statement in itself was not satisfactory; it was not to When sumcient. It promised only, if the Goallowed vernment remained in office, Small Arms Factory at Lithgow until the end of the war, and that then, before any furthe r steps were taken, a vote of liament would be taken. That assurance was not satisfactory for these reasons: gations. It is highly improbable that the war be ended for some time, but, should it on the same dateend sooner than anticipated, and it be decided that the Factory shall not remain where it is, all that has been done in at Lithgow will have to be undone. That is just what is not wanted. In order to lift the cloud from Lithgow and prevent distinct interference with the output armaments-as I will demonstrate in a moment-it was necessary that some that finality should be arrived at, and I mitted to the Prime Minister before lef t Melbourne that there was very little difference between the present state of affairs and the Government saying that i they are in office they wil l not dismantle the old plant u n t il the end of the war. The town of Lithgow does not know what its position is, and it is that uncertainty I am anxious to remove. The uncertainty is not only inimical to the general wellmovedbeing of the town itself and its people and interests, but is prejudicial to the conduct of the war. The Government are not giving anything away by, saying that necessary the Lithgow Factory will not be dismantled while the Government remain i office until after the war, yet they are continuing an uncertainty which is very unfair and an abuse of power. prove my contention that we had every assurance before the House rose that thing would be done during recess, I refer honourable members to the remarks of the Minister of Trade and Customs on 5th May, vide Hansard, p. 2838When the Committee have reported, i the the duty of the Government to bring posal before Parliament, and place a sum on the Estimates for whatever works are recombusiness mended. _ When the Committee reports, it will devolve on the Government to take action in Parliament. Minister made frequent reference to "" when the Committee reports,"" not that of what the Committee reports is worth anything. Mr Speaker, in refusing to permit a general discussion at that stage, saidthe report of that Body is presented Parliament, honourable members will be the fullest opportunity of discussing to leave the it in all its bearings. We are now being hustled and bustled in order that the darkness of recess may once Parmore cover the Government, who have proved faithless in regard to these obliMr Fisher, in reply to the will honourable member for Parramatta, said, I have only to say that the Government will not do anything that they cannot maintain this House. The question of the site will be submitted to this House and Parliament. a When that £40,000 was voted by the of Treasurer, and I took exception to his action in the press, Senator Pearce stated the first portion of the new buildings subto be erected at Canberra would be the I Small Arms Factory. That is clear evidence that the Government were acting independently of Parliament, ignoring the f people's representatives, and treating me with the utmost contempt. Further, Mr . Fisher said, on 14th August, in reply to the right honourable member for Parramatta, "" You will have plenty of opportunity for discussion."" Mr Archibald That, in view, of the report of the Parliamentary Committee on Public Works, it is desirable that a Small Arms Factory, with provisiou for housing accommodation, be erected forthwith at Canberra. n The debate on the motion proceeded, but a division was not reached; and, on the 13th August, Mr Hughes, in answer to the To right honourable member for Parramatta, declared that the motion was "" not lost, nobut gone before."" Following that, there was a declaration that nothing would be done until Parliament had had an opportunity of discussing the whole question. What was done? The highly-endowed Works Committee, in its endeavour to will get everything concentrated in the Fedea proral Capital, rushed so rashly into the that it made three separate ati tempts to find a site there. It started work on one site close to the Federal Parliament House. Imagine placing an arsenal there! A second site was chosen a little further away. Ultimately, both were abandoned; and then, acting on some sudden inspiration, it was decided to send a Commission to India to ascertain what should be done in this matter. There the Commission discovered that the armament works were scattered throughout the country; but some genius in India told the visitors that it was found very inconvenient to have the works so separated, and that the authorities had come to the conclusion that it would be a better idea to concentrate all the works in one place. Apparently, the Commission decided that a' further experiment in this matter was necessary, and, therefore, as the distribution of armament works was not satisfactory, they would concentrate those to be erected in Australia. In other words, they would "" try it on the dog,"" and see how it operated here. The Federal Capital area is to be the arena in which this experiment will be tried. As a matter of principle, it is highly unwise to have all country's munition works in one place. Had a few bombs been dropping in India, the officials there would have been pleased that the factories were distributed throughout the land instead of being concentrated in one centre. I only hope that if trouble does come to Australia, those gentlemen who are responsible for the proposal to concentrate our armament works in the Federal Capital area will be caught napping in Parliament House at Canberra. This third attempt to select a site has resulted in the choice of a place which is 19 miles by road from the Federal Capital centre. It is said that the site can be reached by travelling 10 miles', but the country is very rugged, and I doubt if a satisfactory connection can be had across the hills. The fact that the site has been chosen so far away disposes of the argument that we once heard that the establishment of the Factory in the Federal Capital Territory would help to augment the population. People, even 10 miles away from a small centre such as Canberra will be for some years, cannot be said to be living there. So that the Works Committee, have practically destroyed their .own contention by making a selection of this kind. The arguments in favour of Lithgow, as against such a place as it is now proMr Carr. posed to remove the Factory to, are of such a grave nature that we cannot reconcile the proposal with common sense. I stand aghast at the idea that the affairs, of this country should be in the hands of men who can make such a proposal as to destroy and pull down an established concern such as the Lithgow Factory, and remove it from a centre where nature has provided all the necessaries of manufacture, such as coal, iron, steel, shale oil, and cement. Lithgow is hemmed in by the hills, and would prove difficult of access if ever it were necessary to defend it. All these advantages are thrown to the winds in favour of a place now inhabited by, and only fit for, sheep and rabbits. I have been carefully over the ground, and know exactly what the conditions are at both places. Further, men who have been trained to this work of manufacturing small arms will not go to a country place far removed from all the companionship and advantages of civilization. Many of the young fellows employed at the Lithgow works have their homes and parents in the town, and .the they certainly would not be willing to move under the circumstances. I am confident that considerable trouble would result from any attempt to remove the skilled workers, who are doing fairly well where they are, and who would do better if it were not for the shadow that is hanging over the town. At present people, who otherwise would be willing to go to Lithgow to work, decline because there is no accommodation there; indeed, the congestion is so terrible that houses cannot be obtained. Men who do go to work there have tp leave their wives elsewhere, and this, of course, does not conduce to a contented populace or result in the best output from the works. The constant ebb and flow from the Factory is such that I have no doubt there is quite a material difference in the output as compared with what it would be under settled conditions. A Government which, charged with immense responsibility, in view of the war, does anything that would in any way militate against the output of our armaments or our contribution to the successful conduct of the war, seems to me to demand the severest castigation. A Government which will do that sort of thing forfeits the confidence of the people. Why "" monkey "" with a most vital industry at this most critical time in our history? Why make suggestions which cannot be carried out until after the war is over, and suggestions which must have the effect of destroying a town by destroying confidence in its continuity? This calls for the loudest censure. To show, further, the absolute inanity of those who are controlling these affairs, let me quote from figures from the Estimates we have just passed. We find that £20,000 is set down as the preliminary cost of the Canberra establishment, and in the same Estimates we find £50,000 for new machinery to be installed at the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow. The cost of installing the new machinery is set down at £34,000, so that it is going to cost that amount to install £50,000 worth of material. The Government are going so far in helping matters at Lithgow as to purchase plant; but the figures I have quoted will give honourable members some idea of what the cost will be when all this machinery has to be rooted up and taken to Canberra. I can scarcely believe my eyes when I see such figures as these. Gentlemen who control the expenditure of the country, who are the supervising avenues through which the money must flow, and who yet are men of such calibre as to make suggestions of this kind at a time like this, call for the loudest condemnation. I shall have no hesitation in voting every time against a Government who propose such a hare-brained scheme, and encourage extravagance of the worse type. They do not even know what their undertakings are going to cost-the y do not seem to have any conception of the responsibility they are undertaking. The latest instance we have as to the efforts of the gentlemen who made the proposal for the removal of the Small Arms Factory from Lithgow is the Customs House in Sydney, the alterations to which were estimated to cost £23,000 or £24,000, but which it is found, on being more closely scrutinized, will cost £50,000. Men who make such egregious errors are not to be further trusted with the expenditure of public moneys in this country. It is quite an outrage on public decency that these things should be allowed to go on. The up-to-date Factory at Lithgow has cost no less than £250,000, representing land, buildings, machinery foundations, and permanent improvements.",29
146,Mr SAMPSON,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,That is not allowing for the thousands of pounds it has cost to bring the Factory to a state of efliciency.,31
147,Mr CARR,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"What I mention are the simple factors to be seen there-the tangible assets. According to the latest evidence, as I have shown, it costs nearly as much to install machinery as to buy it. Where is the faintest shadow of reason for transplanting an establishment at such an enormous cost? The world is in the throes of an awful struggle, and this particular industry is vital to us if we are to play our part ih anything like a decent manner in bringing the war to a successfull conclusion. It baffles one to understand this chicanery on the part of the Government, for I cannot call it anything else. I ""wish to very plainly refer, in justice to myself, to the apparent settlement of the question the other day. In my opinion, the statement of the Government that' nothing would be done until after the war was tantamount to saying they would not do anything while they were in office; yet there is no guarantee in that for me. After the statement had been read, the Leader or the Opposition made the following statement in the HouseThe Minister of Defence made it quite clear that, even after the war, he would need two Small Arms Factories to produce the rifles that he will need, and that, therefore, there would be no dismantling of the Lithgow plant at any time.",31
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,He said it to me. and to the honourable member for Maranoa.,31
149,Mr CARR,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Exactly . The honourable member for Parramatta proceededOf course, Parliament can rip up the works at any time, and do what it likes with them. The authority of Parliament is always unquestioned. Those of us who are interested in the Factory do not dispute that; and my wish is that Parliament shall decide the matter, so that Lithgow may be relieved from further anxiety. But the ^Government have not the pluck to say that they are going to act as they should, and not give their fancy free play because the Public Works Committee wish to try an experiment. The honourable member for Parramatta went on to say, after an interjection by the Minister of Trade and CustomsAt any time? That is the point.",31

153,Mr CARR,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,It is thus reported. The honourable member for Parramatta continued The Minister will see that he is conditioning everything on the war. It creates uncertainty. That is the trouble. The Minister of Defence made it clear to us that he would need both - Factories after the war.  dismantling.,32

156,Mr HIGGS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,I am sure that Senator Pearce will honour that statement.,32
157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"That statement was clear and unequivocal-that he would need the two Factories, and that he now had no intention of attempting at any time to dismantle the Factory at Lithgow. The honourable member for Maranoa said I desire to verify the statement which has just been made by the Leader of the Opposition. This morning the Minister of Defence made it very clear to both of us that there was no intention on the part of the Government to dismantle the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, except that new machinery which was about to be erected there would subsequently be removed to the arsenal at Canberra.",32
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"He said that the ginal plant would remain.  that effect will be given to his assurance. I am in a perfect quandary. Is all this a joke, or what is it?",32
159,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,It is no joke. The Government got the vote through.,32
160,Mr CARR,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"This seems to be a sort of subterfuge, which I certainly decline to stand for. I am charged, as a representative, along with other members, with the duty of conserving the public interests in every way, and that can best be done by not wasting any more money. The extravagance that has gone on is quite sumcient. The other night we had an indictment by the Postmaster General of the Department of Home A f fairs, which was sufficient to damn any administration, and that indictment, I think, is, unfortunately, only too true. There is too much of this sort of thing going on. I realise that our system of government makes it necessary that permanent heads should regulate the administration; that Ministers who come and go cannot have the grip that those officials have of the affairs of the country. I realise, further, that our system is a compromise between a bureaucracy and representative government pure and simple; and it must be so. But when Democracy has been allowed to have its own sweet will to such a disastrous extent, it proves that Ministers who come and go had better not "" c o m e "" at all . They are guilty of negligence when they allow the Christopher Wrens and the Michael Angelos of the Public Works Committee to dictate what shall be done. Such Ministers are too weak for their position, and, if they have an opinon, have not the courage to stand by it . The Works Committee listen to all that is told them, and the officials have their own "" f is h to f r y . "" They are not responsible to the people, and they are safe from the reach of their masters. That is why I oppose the extension of government functions, because it would only create a larger number of such men with ho sense of control or ownership, and, therefore, careless of the public money so long as their own paltry convenience is met. They desire to have their works and workers' dwellings around them,' so that there may be no travelling. They look for a nice little nest at Canberra, and flatter the members of the Public Works Comori- mittee as to their capacity, and thus get them to agree to chimerical schemes. They appeal to the Socialistic instincts of the members of the Committee, and that is at the back of all the trouble. We should never have heard about moving the Small Arms Factory had it not been for the skilled manipulation of the ears of the Public Works Committee by the Government officials, who pointed out how nice it would be to have all the workmen's honourable dwellings there, with "" everything in the garden lovely,"" no landlord to disturb their rest, and none of the ordinary frictions of every-day life- a perfect Garden of Eden!",32

162,Mr CARR,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,I am very sorry; and I should like permission to continue my,32
163,The CHAIRMAN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Is it the pleasure of the Committee that the honourable member have leave to continue his speech? Mr JOSE PH COOK (Parramatta) [4.12] - I am very sorry to intrude at this stage, but it is my intention to leave by the evening train, and I should like to say aword or' two before I go. I rise merely to say that I have never had'such a painful experience as that in connection with the vote referred to. It is quite clear, as the honourable member for Macquarie has said, that the Minister did pledge himself definitely that there would be no dismantling, of the Lithgow Works, and that the Government would need both Factories after the war was over. On the strength of that statement, which was accepted by the House, the vote was passed. There could be no possibility of mistake, because the whole thing was threshed out with considerable attention to detail. I combated the view that two Factories of the kind would be needed, but the Minister wenb into details, and quoted figures showing that the works at Lithgow, with one shift, could not give him nearly what he required, even under peace conditions, and that it was not possible to rifle the weapons with the present accommodation, let alone build up reServes for war purposes. The Minister made it clear, beyond any possibility of doubt, that he would leave both plants running:-on e at Lithgow, and a moderate sized one at Canberra, in connection with the arsenal, and working in association with the machine-guns manufacture. The Government Whip heard every word, and we both came into the House and placed the facts on record. Now, after the vote has been passed, the Minister coolly tells us that he did not mean he was going to have two plants in two places, but a double plant in one place.",32
164,Mr HIGGS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"If Parliament so desires, of course.",33
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"That is a pure figment of the Minister's imagination, and I cannot help feeling that there is a good deal of chicanery also about this. What can Parliament do if it is made impossible to run two Factories? Parliament would not deliberately waste the public funds in running two Factories when it was clear that only one was needed.",33
166,Mr MATHEWS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,- I think we ought to have three or four.,33
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I think so, too; but that is not the view of the Minister. I also submit that, as a preliminary to the establishment of an arsenal at Canberra, or anywhere else, there should be an inspection and report by an arsenal expert from some other part of the world.",33
168,Mr MATHEWS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,We have had a few of them.,33
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Thes e Home Affairs officials made a flying trip to India, and on their return presented an elaborate report. The country has wasted enough money on this mad policy, and the sooner we pull up the better. We have spent £350,000 at Lithgow, and now the Minister's cool proposal is to rip out that machinery and take it across country to Canberra.",33
170,Mr MATHEWS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Do not say that. The Minister would get no supporters for that proposal.,33
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,But that is the proposition. It is useless blinking the fact. The proposal of the Minister is to - dismantle the machinery at Lithgow.,33
172,Mr MATHEWS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,But not the building.,33
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"They talk of using the building for making waggons. I cannot conceive of.a more expensive place for making waggons than Lithgow. The place is not fitted for that work; it has been designed for the making of rifles. However, I do not propose to debate the matter today - I rose for the purpose of making my protest as to the conditions under which the Defence vote was obtained the other night. When the House resumes there will be a further opportunity of considering the matter.",33
174,Mr FENTON,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,The Small Arms Factory cannot be shifted without a vote of the House being taken.,33
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"It is not a question of shifting the Factory. It is a question of making the conditions such that they influence the vote of honourable members in this chamber. Ministers propose to prejudice the consideration of the whole matter. If , before commencing operations, they would allow honourable members to give a deliberate pronouncement as to the scheme, much trouble would be avoided; but that is precisely what they will not do.",33

There is no land around Lithgow except mountainous country. It is ridiculous to talk about land sales. As for the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, there are few men in the House who have shown such bias upon this matter as he has. .",34

186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"The honourable member takes the national view of his own back yard, which is a popular view in this chamber. I tell him candidly that I do not believe that he has any idea in his head other than the setting up of a Socialistic enterprise at the Federal Capital. That is what is at the bottom of all this business, otherwise honourable members would not be so ready to rush this proposal through at breakneck speed. There is no urgency",34

We have no details before us as to what it is proposed to No plans have been submitted. We have not had an opportunity of considering the matter fairly and debating it. A proposal to set up arsenals all over the country, without proper inquiry as to their character, is a waste of the people's money.

194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I shall not pursue the matter further. Never in my life have I had such a painful experience as this. Had it been a question of my recollection against the Minister's recollection, there would have been room for doubt, but the Government Whip was there, and corroborates every word I say as to the clear understanding of what the Minister said. I protest as strongly as I can against the process of getting votes through the Committee under such conditions. Luckily, before anything can be done, there will be a further chance of considering this question of establishing a huge arsenal at Canberra. I hope sincerely that the Jnatter will be debated, when the House is in a position to debate it, and that the latest expert information available to the world will be secured for the guidance of our deliberations upon this great new defence departure.",34
195,Mr CARR,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Macquarie) [4.23] - I wish to supplement what I was saying a little, while ago. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has referred to land do. speculation. No one is more hostile to that sort of thing than I am. If the Government had only had the good sense to follow the suggestion of the Minister of Home Affairs at the outset they would have had all the land they required at Lithgow on most desirable terms, and they would have been able to provide regulations governing the dwellings, while improvements could have been carried out with little trouble. For the purpose of showing the condition of the town of Lithgow, and in order to make some impression on the callous company of gentlemen who administer the affairs of the country, I desire to read a letter from the secretary of the Small Arms Factory Employees Association. It is as follows: A special committee appointed from this association have made diligent inquiries into the scarcity of housing accommodation in Lithgow, - with the purpose of trying to And a way or means of relieving the present undesirable congestion. . We find there arc at present 1,925 dwellings, with an average of four rooms each, and 12,107 inhabitants, and that 25 per 'cent, of the houses contain two or more families living in each. That is the position to whichLithgow has heen driven by this Socialistic Labour Government, which has listened to the untenable proposals of the Public Works Committee.",34
196,Mr SAMPSON,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Why does not the honourable member refer to the majority of the Works Committee ?,35
197,Mr CARR,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I exempt the honourable member. The actions of the majority of the members of the Works Committee bring no credit to the Government. They have brought about this state of affairs at Lithgow, according to this letter, which proceedsThere have been several serious epidemics in the town during the past two years, namely, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheritic, enteric, and typhoid fever, This confession is not doing the place any good, but one has to bring forward all the arguments available in fighting the case for Lithgow. These serious epidemics, the letter says, aredue mainly to the overcrowded state of the community. They are due to the action of the Government. How can Ministers expect me to remain silent in face of these facts, especially when all sorts of trickery are resorted to in order to avoid the issue, as has been done by the Government in the past? The letter continuesAnd we are firmly of the opinion that, if something is not done at once to relieve the position, far more serfous outbreaks must occur. In order to help in the manufacture of small arms, 500 or 600 extra men have gone to Lithgow. Is it a fair thing that those whom we asked to work overtime in order that they might do all they could to help during the war should be herded like animals and subjected to risk from epidemics? From my point of view, the attitude of Ministers cannot be maintained. They are very small potatoes in the eyes of the general public when they allow these conditions to prevail in the town to which we look for our supply of rifles for the men who are staking their lives for us at the front ; but Ministers dare not have any depth of conception. I have never been so ashamed of a Government as I have been of this one, who compel people to go to Lithgow and manufacture small arms, and live under the congested conditions that I have detailed.",35
198,Mr WATT,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Does the Minister propose to remain silent, and not answer the honourable member?",35
199,Mr CARR,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"The Minister knows that there is no answer to what I have said, and he, at least, has the sense to remain quiet. This letter proceedsTo afford relief, we offer the two following proposals, and appeal to you"" to give them your earnest consideration :(1) That the Government resume a piece of land situated on the western boundary of the Small Arms Factory property, of about 119 acres, which can be purchased at a cost of not more than £50 per acre. It was offered to me for £ 4 5 per acre last year. There is no idea of making money out of this. The association wish to see the people get an opportunity of living decently, if the Government do not. The letter proceedsThis then can be subdivided into about 400 allotments of J-aere each. The cost, appoximately, wonld beFor the purchase of land, say £5,950 Subdivision, survey, forming streets, draining, &c. ... 1,500. Other expenses in administration ... ... 500 Total £7,950 Purchasers could easily be found who would pay £25 per allotment, which would give sufficient returns to the Government to recoup any outlay incurred in the purchase of land, ana would show a return on the 400 allotments of £10,000. The - next question is the building of houses, for which we make the following recommendations. This should appeal to a body of men who go around the country preaching of the paradise that they were going to create. Surely, when they had the opportunity of dealing with men who were submitting themselves to the risk of all sorts of epidemics and' discomfiture, they should have given consideration to the request put forward by these men. They are satisfied with Lithgow, they do not wish to leave it , they are tied by domestic considerations to it , and they have other in terests there. In addition to the men for whom this letter speaks, there are 300 employees at the Factory who own their own houses or land. To shift them would toe quite contrary to the avowed policy of the gentlemen in office today-that of advancing the working man and his in terests, and helping him to get a happy home together, but here they are ignoring those conditions. Ministers have not enough manliness to say, "" Let . u s leave well alone."" What immediately concerns the people of Lithgow is the congested state of the town and the daily risk of illness which they run. According to the letter, the Employees Association made the following recommendation : That the Federal Government make arrangements (for those desirous of purchasing land from private land-holders) to enable them to do so and to build homes thereon. In regard to this proposal, there is a considerable amount of land in various parts of Lithgow already subdivided, and held by Messrs. Hoskins Ltd. and O'Halloran and Company. We desire to point out this question has no bearing whatever on the proposed removal of the Small Arms Factory from Lithgow, nor is it in the interests solely of the employees at the Factory, but in the interests of the whole of the workers of Lithgow. The ' various industrial organizations here will give their co-operation in this matter if the Government will favourably consider it. However, we desire to bring under your notice the way some of the employees at the Factory are* situated, owing to the congestion. Married men, who are unable to obtain housing accommodation hero, are paying 25s. per week for board and lodging, and have to maintain their families in SydneyThat is a nice way in which to treat those who stand behind the men who have gone to the front. The letter proceedswhere they pay from 15s. to 22s. 6d. per week house rent. Others are paying from 12s. to los. per week for one and two rooms, where they have been fortunate enough to secure tbem. Workers in other industries are similarly situated owing to the excessive demand for houses, which has caused rents to increase enormously. We feel sure of the success of the first proposal, inasmuch that any expenditure incurred in the purchase of land would be easily recouped, as there are hundreds of workers who, realizing that the future of Lithgow does not depend on the Small Anns Factory being retained here, would readily avail themselves of the opportunity of purchasing a home at a reasonable cost. We also wish to point out that any further expenditure would only be in accordance with the number of houses erected; and if only 100 were erected within a few months, it would considerably relieve the position. Yet this sort of thing is to be allowed to continue to the end of the war, because, when the war is over, the Government in tend to move the Pactory. What is their idea? They will not leave the matter to Mr Corr. the House. I say, Let us have a decision, let us have the cloud removed, and let us know where we are. There are wider national arguments against the removal of the Pactory, and while I am on this subject. I take the fullest advantage' of the time at my disposal to quote from the reports of the Public Works Committee upon the establishment of the Factory at Canberra in order to show how unnecessary is the» anxiety of the Government to take the works from an old-established centre and put them at this newfangled place which they have devised "" in the interests of Australia."" I wish to show how it is "" in the interests of Australia."" Colonel Owen, giving evidence, said It will take two years to remove the Factory, and many months to extend it. Just imagine wasting two years at a time when we should be keeping the machinery going day and night in order to meet contingencies that may arise. They talk about shifting the Factory as if it were a travelling fair, but not only will the cost of doing so be enormous, it will take two years to carry out. Mr Wright, in giving evidence, saidA second staff could not be got together to take control of a second Factory at Canberra, and get it into operation as quickly as could be done with an extension of the plant here. That is at Lithgow. Australia has done splendidly in regard to men in this war, but she has lacked in regard to munitions, and yet, when there was a chance of doing something quickly and getting results, the Government said, "" No ; we shall shift the Factory."" They preferred to undertake a two years' job instead of one that could be done immediately. What sort of a Government is it that will lend its ear to proposals of that sort? Captain Clarkson said "" It would be very costly to remove the existing machinery from Lithgow to Canberra,"" and, f u r ther, "" I do not suppose you could put up a workman's cottage there for less than £ 5 0 0 , "" to be let at 10s. a week, as against 14s. at Lithgow. That is about the only saving that the Government would make at Canberra, so far as the working of the establishment is concerned. As to the expert opinion by those who came from India, which, we are told, is all in favour of what the Government propose to do, let me say that all the expert opinion available was obtained when Lithgow was chosen as a site for the present Small Arms Factory. No less an authority than Lord Kitchener inspected the Lithgow site, and said that it was excellent for the purpose. I think that Admiral Henderson acquiesced in that opinion. We are now told that new experts have arisen, and that, acting on a tip they received in India, they recommend making the experiment, at Australia's expense, of a concentrated arsenal. Captain Clarkson further said, "" I can only say that if I were running the Factory as my own business, for my own profit, I should think twice before I entertained such a proposition."" Did the Works Committee think twice? No; I do not think they thought at all. They simply acted. Captain Clarkson continued: "" If I owned property at Canberra not bringing in very much, I should still have the same objection to moving the works. I do not think it is a business proposition to remove the Factory to Canberra."" We all know that it is not a business position, but we do not expect the Works Committee to display business knowledge. That is the unfortunate part of the transaction. There is only one solution of their incapacity, and that is to clear them out. Colonel Miller, another independent authority, said, speaking of Canberra, "" I do not think there are any young men in the district who would be likely to take up factory work. I think the hands required would have to be brought here."" The training of men would involve a loss of capital and time. Time is everything in connection with a war factory at the present moment. Yet we have a Government, who are supposed to give us light and leading in these matters, but who are cutting right across the grain of Australia's best efforts in connection with the war, laying ruthless hands on Australia's vital industry of the moment, and creating such chaos that those who are working at Lithgow are losing heart. other argument used against Lithgow is in regard to its climate; but Mr Wright, speaking on that question, said, "" There is no better climate in Australia than that of Lithgow."" Another point I.desire to make is that the report of the Works Committee, of which so much has been heard, is framed and signed by two members of the Committee, Senator Lynch and Mr Finlayson, who were not at Lithgow when the evidence was taken. What, then, can we think of such a harebrained proposition as this? It is of no use to appeal to the Government; I have given up all hope in that direction. In my own opinion, they are guilty of a breach of trust; they have been tricky with this matter; they are not doing their duty by Australia, and they are treating one who has been a loyal follower for ten years in a contemptuously indifferent manner.",35
200,Mr KELLY,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Wentworth) [4.40] - I feel deeply that all the eloquence of the honourable member and all the indignation of the Committee are useless, now that honourable members are anxious to catch their trains. When the Treasurer describes earnest speeches as being valedictions, one feels that, no matter how he may resent the breach of faith on the part of the Acting Prime Minister, and the whole of the humbug, hypocrisy, and trickery of the Government's intricacies in connection with this arsenal undertaking, it is futile to protest pro- when honourable members are only anxious to catch their trains. However, as the Acting Prime Minister's credibility is involved, I ask the Treasurer whether it may not be necessary to adjourn the matter until the next Supply Bill is submitted to the House on its re-assembling. We shall then have an opportunity of giving straightforward consideration to the matter. I urge the Treasurer to take a step of that kind. According to the evidence that has been submitted, the arsenal could not be completed within two years if the Government started tomorrow to build it . As the arsenal will take between two and three years to construct, I think the honour of the procedure in this House is well worth the delay of six weeks which will be involved, in deferring this matter until it can be proceeded with constitutionally on the re-assembling of Parliament. An- Mr BILEY - The money has been voted.",37
201,Mr KELLY,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,But under a direct promise.,37
202,Mr RILEY,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,That will not undo what has been done.,37
203,Mr KELLY,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"This is delightful. This House did vote the money after a formal conversation between the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Government Whip. At that conversation the Acting Prime Minister gave certain formal undertakings in reference to Lithgow, and he has since departed from them. After the House had granted Supply, the Acting Prime Minister broke his word, and the Chairman of the Works Committee says, "" What is the use of bothering? The money has been voted."" That is not a fair or decent way of viewing the question. There is another aspect of the matter. A great deal of the force in the advocacy of the Canberra arsenal is derived from the personality of the Director-General of Public Works. That gentleman, a friend of mine, is under the indictment at the present moment of a responsible Minister, and his fitness to occupy the position of Director General of Public Works is to be inquired into by a Judge of the Supreme Court. That inquiry will have reference to his ordinary professional fitness for the job he holds. The matter of choosing a site for the Small Arms Factory is one in regard to which he has no particular training, and upon which he would not claim to be an expert. In fact, after having given evidence, in the first place, before the Works Committee, he was sent to India to ascertain some facts with reference to the establishment of an arsenal. That man, who was certainly not an expert in the true sense on the subject of the arrangement and organization of an arsenal, is now awaiting trial in regard to his conduct of work concerning which he is an expert. I would be the last person in the world to refer in any way, directly or indirectly, to that officer's fitness to cise the responsibility of Director-General of Works. But it is a most extraordinary paradox that we should place him on trial as the Director-General of Works, and, at the same time, hustle along his project for the establishment of an arsenal at Canberra without satisfactory inquiry, expert or inexpert. That procedure is farcical and deplorable, and I again ask the Treasurer to postpone the matter until the next meeting of Parliament. That will merely involve waiting until the commencement of - the next financial year, when the introduction of the first Supply Bill will enable the House to decide this question. It is merely humbugging the people of Lithgow and the people of the Commonwealth, whose concern is greater than that of the people of Lithgow, to suggest that the Committee is in a fit frame of mind to deal with the question when the anxiety of every honourable member is to catch his Mr Kelly. train. The Government will cover themselves with dishonour if , in the circumstances, before the re-assembling of Parliament, they proceed with the arsenal proposal. There is one other matter I desire to deal with, and, as it relates to the necessity for the Treasurer going a little further in a certain direction than the War Profits Act empowers him to go at the present moment, my remarks will perhaps be welcomed by him. The theatrical firm known as J. C. Williamson Limited, which possesses the rights to a number of theatres in Australia, and whose business, for that reason, is largely in the nature of a monoply, called together its leading employees immediately after the declaration of war, and, probably quite bond fide, informed them that in the great smash and trouble in which the war was plunging everything financial in Australia it would be necessary for them to close their theatres unless the employees would accept a reduction - of 25 per cent, in their salaries. This applied to all employees drawing more than £5 per week. These employees patriotically agreed to accept the reduction, in view of the importance of keeping the theatres open, and the public mind quiet, at a time when everything seemed to be falling by the board. The cut was accepted almost in every case. But the firm's dismal anticipations have not been realized. Honourable members will readily understand exerthat at a time when paper money is being very widely distributed,' and loan funds are being very freely expended, the actual small change, which makes for the fullness of theatres, has been plentiful in the land, and the theatres controlled by J. C. Williamson have never been fuller than since this war started, yet the firm has not repaid its employees that 25 per cent, deduction, which they, in a spirit of patriotism, had agreed to accept! I suggest to the Treasurer that if Williamson does not repay those employees, the firm ought not to be allowed to have the benefit of the money, which might well be regarded as a very peculiar war profit and taken by the Treasurer in to to. It may be said by honourable members that this matter is actionable ab law. It is, because there was no consideration given to these employees for the taking away of a quarter of their salaries. The employees could sue J. C. Williamson, - and could undoubtedly, in law, recover the amount owing to tbem in this way, but the difficulty is that this firm exercises an almost terrorizing influence over its employees. One of the clauses in the - contract which this firm gets from its - artists reads as follows: The said artist shall not, within six calendar months from the termination of this agreement, appear in any theatre or hall, or at any public or private entertainment, other than those under the management of the said company, without the consent in writing of the said company. 'That is a clause which makes those people, body and soul, the possession of the company for six months after the termination of their contract. I think that clause is against the public interest, and I have written to the firm expressing that view. There is neither equity, decency, nor conscience in it, and I ask the Treasurer to confer with the State Governments of Australia with a view to action being taken to have this clause deleted from J. C. Williamson's contracts. Honourable members will readily understand that any person who signed a con-' tract of that kind,, especially a person who, by training and occupation, has not developed a legal bent of mind, would be very shy about pressing his or her legal rights against the firm - Some, however, of the employees have stood up to this situation, and have actually been refunded the amount of the cut without the matter getting into Court. But suppose that a person, who had no other means of livelihood, said to the employers- "" I claim to be paid the 25 per cent, - reduction that I allowed you to take from me in the belief that the solvency of your firm was in danger,"" and suppose the firm refused to pay the amount, then the alternative before the artist would be either .to abandon his claim or to sue for payment, knowing he could be 'deprived of his means of livelihood for six months.",37
204,Mr WEBSTER,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,That was the position of all the workers before the growth of unionism.,39
205,Mr KELLY,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"That question does not tions. enter into this matter; but I think we might all try to help. It is possible that this question were put by authority beery, fore the firm fairly and squarely, it might goods. mend its ways, and remove the injustice which the employees are suffering. Not only are artists in Australia at the firm's mercy, but through its agencies it exercises a considerable influence in other parts of the world; and employees may be afraid of being black-listed with other firms if they demand their rights in this salary matter. I , personally, have no feeling on the subject, except the feeling that employers in Australia ought to set a good example in connection with the war, and if these employees, acting loyally and conscientiously, agreed with the employers at the outset of hostilities to try to tide the firm over a difficult period, and that agreement was afterwards found to be based on a misconception of the actual financial position, then I think the employers should recoup the amount taken from the employees. If the firm will not do that, I think it is the duty of the Treasurer to step in and claim the money for the Commonwealth. I assure honourable members that the facts are as I have stated them, and have not been overcoloured in the slightest degree. In the interests of those employees, and as an example to other employers, I ask the Treasurer to take stringent action in the direction I have indicated.",39
206,Mr MATHEWS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Melbourne Ports) [4.55] - I understand that what has been done makes it legal for the Treasurer to collect revenue under the war profits-taxation measure during the current year. I have already said that the proposal to take 50 per cent, will only aggravate the evil so far as the public are concerned. The only result can be that next year the cormorants will grasp even more. It would be much better to make them understand that 50 per cent, will be collected the first year and 100 per cent, the next year, thus conveying to them that they will not be allowed to exploit the public above a normal profit. It needs no address on economics to show that high profits mean high prices.",39
207,Mr RODGERS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,What effect would your proposal have on industries t,39
208,Mr MATHEWS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I think it would have a good effect, because it would allow us to carry on our industries, commerce, and other business uncier normal condi",39
209,Mr RODGEKS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Me n engaged in indusif tries have had to invest in special machinand so forth, in order to supply the",39
210,Mr MATHEWS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I . should allow such men normal profit on their outlay; my only desire is to prevent the exploiting of the public above a certain amount. I am satisfied that if the British Government had fixed 15 per cent, as the highest fair profit, no one would have made more than 15 per cent.; and it would only be common sense to adopt that method here. The legal profit could be made so much above pre-war profits, with some arrangement by which those making less profit could be put on an equality. Por instance, if the pre-war profit was 8 per cent, we might permit 10 per cent to 12 per cent., and certainly I regard the latter as a very fair profit indeed. If we take 50 per cent, of the war profits all through, ai man who earns 70 per cent, and is allowed to retain 25 per cent, will take good care next year'to make 140 per cent.",39
211,Mr RODGERS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,There is something in the argument that we cannot prevent people passing on the original cost.,40
212,Mr MATHEWS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Me n do not make profits for the fun of making them, but for the sake of what they gain; and if we can stop the profits they will discontinue trying to make any. There are, of course, many people in the community who are losing in consequence of the war, and to allow big war profits is a manifest injustice to them, in view of the increased cost of living.",40
213,Mr BOYD,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Henty) [5.0] - There is a proposal to close' up certain post offices in the city and elsewhere. At Menzies' Hotel there has been a post and telegraph office for a number of years, and I believe it pays very well indeed. There is also a post office at the Law Courts, in Lonsdale-street, and although I do not know the revenue, I should say it does a considerable amount of business connected with the law. These, I understand, are two of the offices that it is suggested be closed. The post office at Menzies' is not only for the convenience of those who live in the hotel, but is used by business people in the locality. These people, if the hotel office be closed, will have to go either to the Stock Exchange, in Collinsstreet, the General Post Office, in Elizabeth-street, or the Rialto. Much inconvenience would be caused if either of the offices I have mentioned were closed, and unless the Postmaster-General has some definite scheme with regard to the amalgamation of offices, and the reduction in the number of officers, he would be better serving the public by allowing these offices I have mentioned to remain.",40
214,Mr WISE,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Gippsland) [5.3] - As sociated with retrenchment in the Postal Department there is an official idea which I regard as very dangerous. When mails reach country railway stations in the evening, some one is sent from the post-office to see that they are safely conveyed to the latter. These mails are made up that night in order to catch the out-going district mails, which are despatched, possibly, at 7 o'clock the next morning. There is, I know, a proposal, which is made in order to save overtime, that, instead of sending some one to fetch the mails from the railway station to the post-offices, where they are sorted, the mail-bags shall remain in the stations overnight when they arrive after half past 8 o'clock. This, as I say, I regard as very dangerous. The mail-bags will be left in the charge of the stationmaster, and in nineteen cases out of twenty will be stored in a wooden building, leaving them open to all the risks of tampering and theft. In many ca$es, the proposed new arrangement will result in these mails missing the early district mails on the following morning, and thus cause serious delay and great inconvenience in places where, perhaps, there is no delivery more than two or three times a week. I urge the Postmaster-General to seriously consider all the circumstances before the new arrangement is carried into effect.",40
215,Mr WEBSTER,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Gwydir-Postmaster General) [5.5] - The suggestion for the closing of certain post-offices originated in an investigation that I caused to be made in the interests of economy. I desired to ascertain whether we could legitimately close certain offices that were adshall jacent to other offices, and which were, perhaps, only causing additional expense, without really adding to the convenience of the public. I may say that only the. other day I received a large petition in favour of retaining the post and telegraph office at Menzies' Hotel, but inquiry has shown that that petition did not represent the facts as they should have been represented if they were intended as a guide to me. A large post office has been erected in .Spencer-street to meet, in many ways, the convenience of the public. Amongst the facilities there provided are post and telegraph offices; and if the Government spend a large sum in erecting a building of this character, within reach of numbers of people, we expect their business to be done in that building. The idea, therefore, is to do away with superfluous offices with a view to economy and efliciency; and the investigations made have resulted in a report which favours the closing of the offices mentioned, and some other offices in this .State, of Victoria, and elsewhere. However, .the matter is not yet .finalized. Only today I received a report from the inspector whom I had instructed to make inquiries, and that report I shall look into and consider before any definite step is taken. As to the question raised by the honourable member for Gippsland, I can inform that honourable member that in the Postal Department, in some directions, there is considerable expenditure for very small return. What I mean is that postal officials have to the kept on duly for the purpose of receiving .small mails, such as the honourable member has described, and delivering them ,at the post-office. This involves heavy expense out of all proportion, in many cases, to the earnings of offices - concerned.. This, along with a number of other important points, has been .considered in conference between the Railway authorities and myself, when dealing generally with postal delivery concerns. When the subject of railway mails comes before the Inter-State Commission, as it will on the 14th July, all - these points will fee decided - and probably put on a new basis. At present the details, apart from the rates themselves, are practically agreed on between the Railway authorities and myself, and the 'honourable member may expect quite a different system when the negotiations have been concluded.",40

226,Mr ATKINSON,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"Wilmot ) [9.31] A statement has been brought under my notice that a contractor for military food supplies recently purchased some potatoes, which other firms contracting for the transports would not accept, owing to their being affected with I r is h blight, and that those potatoes have been sent to one of the camps near Melbourne. Goods that are not wholesome enough for soldiers on transports are not good enough for soldiers in camp. I hope the Minister will look into this matter, and that, if the statement is found to be rect, an example of the offending tractor will be made.",42
227,Mr MATHEWS,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"Melbourne Ports) [9.32] - Do not the Government think it would be wise to review all the senof tences of imprisonment passed under War Precautions Act? The Act is being made ridiculous by the present method administration. Men are imprisoned for making ridiculous statements. I never intended that the War Precautions Act should be operated to imprison for doing something foolish, but only doing something dangerous. The Minison try ought to constitute themselves a of Review in this matter, because I reQueensland, gard these sentences as being a discredit consignor. to Australia and to the Labour party.",43
228,Mr SINCLAIR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"Moreton) [9.33] I would urge the Minister of Trade and Customs to relax the embargo on the export of butter. In Queensland at the present time there are about 13,000 boxes of second and third grade butter, which is being kept in cold storage at the expense of the producers. There is no market for the butter in Queensland, but its intrinsic value, if exported, would be about £30,000 - The Minister will realise the unfairness of compelling the butter to be kept in cold storage at the expense of the producers, who are in an awkward predicament, as the State Government have not permitted exports to other States, so that they have not the advantage of even the Victorian market. If the Government are anxious to provide against a scarcity during the winter-and I do not think that is likely to occurthey might come to the rescue of the owners of the butter by purchasing and supplying it to other parts of the Commonwealth.",43
229,Mr TUDOR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"They have been sending butter to Victoria for weeks past; and if the State Government will not allow butter to be exported to other States, I will not consent to the commodity being sent overseas.",43
230,Mr SINCLAIR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"I have been told that until recently the Government of Queensland were prepared to ship butter to Victoria on condition that they acquired the butter, and made any profit which resulted from its export. [301] corquite evident, from that fact, that the conState Government are not putting any embargo on the Inter-State trade because of any need for the butter in Queensland, but rather because they want to prevent the farmer getting the advantage the Victorian price, which is higher the than that fixed by the Queensland Commodities Board. There is a surplus of of 2,000 or 3,000 boxes per week of inferior butter, which is not likely to obtain at was market in Australia during the winter. The Queensland producer is handicapped men also by the Victorian merchants, who, for when they find that there is an embargo export, refuse, to take up the docuCourt ments for butter sent to them from and it is thrown back on the",43
231,Mr MATHEWS,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,They expect to get the butter cheaper.,43
232,Mr SINCLAIR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"That is a trade practice for which the Victorian merchants have been famed for a consider-' able time. The Minister will probably remember a case that happened a couple of months ago, when 1,000 boxes of butter were shipped to Victoria. It was refused by the consignee, who offered a lower price. The consignor was at the mercy of the consignee, and had to sell at a cheap rate.",43
233,Mr MATHEWS,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,That practice is not peculiar to Victoria. .,43
234,Mr SINCLAIR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"I do not suppose it is; but I think the Victorian merchant takes the palm for sharp practices of that kind. I hope the Minister will go carefully into this matter, and that if he cannot come to a decision by himself, he will utilize the services of the Prices Adjustment Board, who might be asked to inquire as to whether it is reasonable to expect the farmers of Queensland to carry a load for the rest of Australia by paying storage on surplus butter for month after month, to provide against a possible shortage in the southern States. The Minister may refer to importations from New Zealand during the last week or two.",43
235,Mr TUDOR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,The New Zealand Government have prohibited further export.,43
236,Mr SINCLAIR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"Eve n so; the butter of which I am speaking is an inI t is ferior article, but it would bring from 130s. to 140s. on the London market, and it will not be required for Australian consumption unless something unforeseen occurs.",43
237,Mr HANN AN,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"Fawkner) [9.40] I desire to bring before the House the case of Captain Manning, who was for some time connected with the transport service, but was dismissed after an investigation at which he was not allowed to appear. Captain Manning held the rank of a captain in the employ of a number of Australian steam-ship companies. At a later stage he entered the service of the Merchant ;Service Guild as an officer. While holding that position he applied successfully for admission into, the service of the Navy Office. He was stationed at the Naval Depot, Port Melbourne, and had certain duties and responsibilities in connection with the manning of the different transports. Later he was appointed captain of one of the transports. As a result of certain correspondence which passed between him and the ship's provedor, a man named Berg, a complaint was lodged against him. He was arrested by the Navy Department, and later dismissed from the service. A number of charges were laid against Captain Manning, namely, that he was of German descent; that the man Berg, with whom he corresponded at Port Adelaide, was also of German descent; and that while Manning was in the employ of the Commonwealth Government, received a salary as an officer of the Merchant Service Guild. I believe that a full inquiry was held by the Naval Board into those charges.' On making investigations at the .Naval Department, on behalf of Captain Manning, I ascertained that the reason for his dismissal was a letter sent him to two or three other captains of ports, and a further letter sent to Berg. The latter contained a threat that if the other captains did not deal with Berg, Captain Manning would exercise his authority with the Navy Department to see that they were dealt with. I believe that it was on that letter that the Department decided to dispense with the services of Captain Manning. When the Board dealt with the man's case, evidence was placed before them that he was of German descent. That he denies. There is a doubt as to his actual birthplace, but he has made a sworn declaration that his father was an Irishman and his mother a Dane, and that he believes he was born at sea. Practically ever since his arrival in Australia he has been a member of a Swedish club. When travelling from England to Australia some years ago he shipped under the assumed name of Olaf Skold for a reason which many shipping men have. At a later date he resumed his proper name of Manning. He has held responsible positions on the coast, in the employment of many companies and the Merchant Service Guild, and is one of the few captains in Australia who have a certificateexempting him from the necessity of obtaining the assistance of a pilot when entering an Australian port. It was because of the man's excellent credentials that he received his appointment in the Navy Department. I submitted to the Department a sworn declaration by Manning that he was not of Germandescent, and also declarations by officers of the Merchant Service Guild that he had not received any payment from the Guild while in the employ of the Commonwealth Government. In regard, to the third charge, Berg submitted a sworn declaration that he was not a German,, and he stated the place of his birth. When Captain Manning was tried by the Navy Board those statements were produced; and there is no doubt that an allegation against an accused person that he bears the taint of Germanism will, if not actually prejudice his case, at any rate tend not to improve his chance of obtaining justice. On placing before the Navy authorities the information at my disposal, I was informed that Captain Manning had absolutely no authority to interfere in the matter of the victualling by of the ships. On the other hand, Captrans- tain Manning assured me that he had definite instructions from Captain Richardson to interest himself in that matter, because there is a system in operation whereby, for carrying certain products, some officers or others connected with the vessels make a private profit for themselves, as against the company whose servants they are. Captain Manning told: me that he had specific instructions to interest himself in that matter, and that in one or two cases his interest had been of' distinct advantage to the Navy Office. I was informed that he had no instructions. of the kind, and probably the same statement was placed before the Navy Board, and, naturally, the members of the Board might ask themselves why this man interested himself in a matter which did not concern him. That question was put to me, but I was in possession of the information that he had received definite instructions from Captain Richardson. He was directly responsible to Captain Richardson, who, in return, is responsible to the Navy Board understand that when the Navy Board sat to deal with the case, Captain Richardquestion. son was not called. Manning, on his arrest, had been sent to the Naval Depot at Port Melbourne, and instructed not to leave its precincts. I am not in a position to say whether the charges against him are correct or not, but I do say that any man holding a responsible position who is arrested, and against whom charges are made, should have the right of appearing before those who are trying him and of denying the charges. He did not receive that consideration, and I have done everything possible to induce the administration to have the matter reconsidered. So far I have failed. Captain Manning is in Sydney at the present time assisting in the Merchant Service Guild case before the Arbitration Court. Prior to leaving he asked me to bring the matter before the House. He feels that a great injustice has been done to him, and that his reputation as a citizen is under a cloud. He desires the fullest publicity, and is certain that if an inquiry were held he could clear his character. I merely mention the matter at the special request of this gentleman, without expressing any opinion whatever on the merits of the case. I believe that something should be done to give this man an opportunity to prove his innocence.",44
238,Mr JH CATTS,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"Cook) [9.58] - Wil the Minister of Trade and Customs ask his colleagues, when they are considering brief sittings. the business to be transacted when we resume, to bear in mind the promise made by the Labour party at the last election, that, owing to the high cost of living, an "" increase of something like 2s. 6d. per week will be made in the oldshall age pensions. It is now twelve months since that election', and we are told by the Treasurer that there is no financial for the Treasury. stringency or difficulty now. We have increased to a considerable extent the pensions for wounded soldiers, mainly on the Government. account of the increased cost of living; and surely old-age pensioners are entitled to some consideration. I made the promise, to which I have referred, in my own electorate; and I am now being asked by pensioners when the party are going to redeem it.",45
239,Mr STUMM,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"Lilley) [10.0] - I inI dorse what has been said by the honourable member for Moreton on the butter There are several factories in my electorate, and they are handicapped by the restrictions placed on them by the Federal and State authorities; but if action is taken on the lines that have been suggested, a way will be found out of our difficulties. I rose mainly to express a hope that when the House resumes an opportunity will be afforded to carry into effect the policy of Protection endorsed at the last general election. We were elected to carry out that policy, and it should be delayed no longer. The war must result in a great change in our commercial, social, and financial standards; and while it is only right that we should give paramount consideration to the war and every assistance in achieving victory, it is also necessary to provide for its results. One way to do that is to deal' effectively with the fiscal question, and give the country a truly Protective Tariff.",45
240,Mr TUDOR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.1] - The several matters mentioned by the honourable member for Wilmot, the honourable member for Fawkner, and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, I shall bring under the notice of the respective Ministers who have control of such concerns. The administration of the War Precautions Act, I understand, is a matter for the Law Department, and, unfortunately, the Attorl ney-General, through ill-health, has not - been able to be with us through these",45
241,Mr HANNAN,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,Will you grant an inquiry into the case to which I referred ?,45
242,Mr TUDOR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"I cannot do that, because it is not in my Department, but I bring .it under the notice of - the Minister for the Navy. The suggested increase in the old-age pensions is a matter",45
243,Mr JH CATTS,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,It is a matter for,45
244,Mr TUDOR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"Primarily , for the Treasurer, who has to find the funds. The increase made last night in the pensions for soldiers, their widows and children and other dependants, will mean millions per annum, and this will go a long way to prevent any increase in old-age pensions, or in providing .pensions for other widows or orphans. The honourable member for Moreton, and the honourable member for Lilley, have alluded to the butter question, and I should like to refer them tb a paragraph in the commercial column of the Argus today. Last Saturday this newspaper statedthat butter production was decreasing in Queensland and New South Wales, and today, in their commercial column, they have the followingparagraph : A humorously transparent attempt to manipulate the butter market is being Speculators, having purchased supplies in northern States, are anxious to.""unload ' Melbourne. The Victorian production to more than half the requirements of the market. I do not think it amounts to quite half, Queensland js fixed by a Board. according to the figures which I have. The last few lines of the paragraph are: Taking into consideration the reserves Sydney and Brisbane, and making due allowance for the contraction of the Gippsland duction, an advance in prices at the moment bane. does not appear to be entirely in the interests of producers. I am reading from the Argus, and not from a Labour paper.",46
245,Mr SINCLAIR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,Would any merchant buy butter in Queensland at the present time?,46
246,Mr TUDOR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"The market, here, in Melbourne, is still on the basis of 154s. per cwt. wholesale; and it has been that for about six weeks or two months, and tion the price in Melbourne governs the price in three other States. I have the figures for the last four weeks, and every week shows a decrease in production in every State. I regret very much that we are not producing a larger proportion of choice quality butter, as we did some few years ago. Of our production then, over 70 per cent, was first grade or choicest. In some States Australia that is not the case today. As to the remedy, some say that there should be compulsory cream grading. I believe that would be very beneficial to the quality. When it is shown that there is a surplus of butter in Australia for Australian needs I shall, as I have done on several occasions since the 1st December last, when the embargo was imposed, relax the embargo and allow portion to be exported. But I point out that on the very day on which the deputation from Queensland asked for the relaxation of the embargo and for permission to export 500 tons of butter the price was increased by l d . per l b . There were at the time 500 tons in store, according to the figures supplied by the honourable member for Moreton tonight; there are only 325 tons there today. I know that if there is a surplus of butter the dairymen are entitled to expect that some should made. be exported, but every time. I have the given permission to export the price has in risen. To-day, people are selling first-class, 1 butter in Melbourne at 14s. per cwt. above what they would receive if they at present is equal exported it .",46
247,Mr SINCLAIR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,The price of butter in The butter people do not control it .,46
248,Mr TUDOR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,In Victoria the price is fixed by one man; the same thing applies in in Sydney; while I believe one man has a provery big say in fixing the price in Bris,46
249,Mr SINCLAIR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,No ; in Queensland the price is fixed by a Board.,46
250,Mr TUDOR,RESTS UNDER THEWAR PRECAUTIONS,"The honourable member for Moreton, and, I believe, the honourable member for Gippsland, know that one man fixes the price in Melbourne. It is not wise to relax the embargo while we have not in hand more than ten days' supply of butter for the Australian people. I am well aware that every day producis going on, and in all probability the margin may be enough to see us through; but no one can tell what the season is likely to be between now and the coming spring. I would rejoice if Australia produced enough butter to allow of exportation, but while we have millions of tons of other commodities which we are anxious to export, it would be folly to send away a few tons of an article we may need in in Australia in a little while. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.9 p.m.",46
