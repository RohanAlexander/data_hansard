3,Mr HOWARD,BOUGAINVILLE," Mr Speaker, could I have your indulgence to say a few words to the House about events in Papua New Guinea in recent days.",13
4,Mr SPEAKER,BOUGAINVILLE,Indulgence granted.,13
5,Mr HOWARD,BOUGAINVILLE,"I know that all members of the House will be particularly concerned about the very disturbing events in Papua New Guinea over the last 48 hours. Since becoming independent, Papua New Guinea has adhered-often in very difficult circumstances-to strong democratic principles and has acted in accordance with the provisions of its constitution. A central element of that democratic tradition has of course been the absolute authority of the civilian government over military authorities. I should, therefore, make it very clear on behalf of the government-and I believe on behalf of every member of this House-that we utterly deplore the attempts of the former Commanderin-Chief of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force to defy the authority of the duly elected government of Papua New Guinea. In the circumstances, the action taken by the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Julius Chan, to remove the head of the defence force was both understandable and justifiable. I certainly express the hope, on behalf of the government, that there will be a proper, peaceful and normal return to the constitutional processes of that country. Our position on this subject was made crystal clear in public comments yesterday and our High Commission in Port Moresby has conveyed our position to the Papua New Guinea government and is also conveying our attitude to the current acting commander of the defence forces in that country. This is not an occasion for overblown rhetoric or unduly bellicose statements. The domestic situation in Papua New Guinea is fragile. The government there does have a very difficult domestic problem in relation to Bougainville. My government and the governfor ment led by my predecessor as Prime Minister grappled with that issue over a period of time. There is no easy solution and anybody who understands circumstances in New Guinea will know how difficult it is for any government of that country to resolve that particular issue. Having said that and having fully expressed the view that the civilian authority of the elected government of New Guinea should prevail over any statements of the defence force, can I make it clear so far as the other issue in our relationship with Papua New Guinea is concerned-that is, the potential use of mercenaries on Bougainville-that the attitude of the Australian government that that would be a retrograde and an extremely regrettable step remains completely as it was before the events of the last 48 hours. As members will know, I met the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Julius Chan, in Sydney last Sunday week. During a discussion of some 4Y2 hours, which traversed the full gamut of the bilateral relationship, I made it very clear to him that Australia remained very strongly opposed to the use of mercenaries on Bougainville and that, if the use of those mercenaries took place, there would be consequences of a serious kind so far as the relationship between Australia and New Guinea was concerned. I take this opportunity of reiterating that position on behalf of the government. I make it plain that the alternatives to the use of the mercenaries, which I outlined to the Prime Minister on 9 March, remain on the table and I draw the Prime Minister's attention to the existence of those alternatives. The final point I want to make is that the primary concern of the government at present is the safety of Australian citizens in Papua New Guinea. That is a situation which has remained under very close attention over past weeks, particularly over the last 48 hours, and, as would be expected, the government is very closely monitoring that situation. All appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that if there is any threat to those peopleand I am not advised that there is any threat of consequence at present-every available opportunity will be taken to continue monitoring and, if steps are necessary, they will be taken.",13
6,Mr BEAZLEY,BOUGAINVILLE," Mr Speaker, can I have your indulgence to speak briefly on the same matter.",14
7,Mr SPEAKER,BOUGAINVILLE,Indulgence granted.,14
8,Mr BEAZLEY,BOUGAINVILLE,"The opposition agrees basically with the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), including in particular the strictures that he made on the question of the authority of civilian rule military predilections at any point in time in Papua New Guinea and also the questions he raised in relation to the difficulties that being confronted by the Papua New Guinean government. I also note and appreciate the fact that he made reference to concerns on his part that, should a situation which does not now exist occur at some point in time in the future where more concern might be exercised in relation to the presence of some 10,000 Australian nationals who live and work in Papua New Guinea, he is bearing their concerns and the question of their safety in mind. That is important, particularly in the context in which we are making statements to the Papua New Guinean government. I also recognise that there are occasionally situations in international diplomatic circles when governments can make statements behind doors, not publicly, but oppositions not in that same position. So let me make a few. I think it has to be made absolutely clear to the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea that we regard the persistent attitude on his part to the continued or the possible use of mercenaries in Bougainville to be completely unacceptable and as drawing consequences in terms of the relationship between Papua New Guinea and Australia should that situation obtain. Those consequences would go to the defence cooperation program and to the aid budget. He should be placed clearly on notice that we have those concerns and that those concerns will produce those consequences if that is persisted with. It is not simply a question, important though it is, of the use of mercenaries in that situation in Bougainville, nor is it simply a question of Sandline International. There are other mercenary groups operating around the globe as well as them. The question of how they are utilised on BougainviIIe is of concern to us, but the introduction of mercenary forces into the political and military equation in South Pacific island states would be absolutely devastating, not simply in Papua New Guinea but elsewhere through the South Pacific. A line is being, and ought to be, firmly drawn by the Australian government in over relation to the Papua New Guinean government as far as that is concerned, not only because of the issue on Bougainville but are because of the general concerns that prevail in that regard. We have had a bit o(gratuitous commentary from Sir Julius Chan on the attitudes of the Australian government since the Australian government has made its views clear. The Australian government has every reason to believe that Julius's nose has been thumbed at it from the outset on this particular occasion, starting with the foreign minister's appearance in announcing a $4 million aid package for what was then apparently Papua New Guinean government strategy some four days before the hiring of Sandline became evident and followed by an appearance that guarantees were being given that mercenaries would not be serving on Bougainville and then some days later a firm statement was are made by the Papua New Guinean government that in fact that was not the case and they would still continue to be used there. Quite clearly there is an erratic response forthcoming from the Papua New Guinean government to the positions that have been put forward to it and apparently undertakings given to us by the Papua New Guinean government. I noticed in the Sydney Morning Herald a particularly gratuitous piece of commentary from the Papua New Guinean government, if it is an accurate reflection of the press conference of the Prime Minister yesterday, and that was a suggestion, evidently in a question, that somewhere or other the reaction or activity of the Papua New Guinean defence forces was related to a threat that was issued by the Australian government that aid issues, military and civilian, were on the table and whether or not that might have motivated the general then in charge of the Papua New Guinean defence forces to do what he did. ""J QQe.,W-)U1d have expected, I think, from the --""Mini$ter.of Papua New Guinea that -;wOJllc;1 be a firm rejection of any such I!-StiOD. There was not. In fact, what he had to say was 'probably' there was a relationship between the two. Again, that is not an acceptable suggestion, I would have thought, as far as the direction of policy of this country was concerned in our relationship with Papua New Guinea. We have always made it absolutely clear cut in our relationship with the Papua New Guinean defence forces over the years that we see no political role for them whatsoever when these issues from time to time have arisen. They have never arisen as dramatically as they have in the last couple of days, but whenever they have arisen in the past that has been absolutely clear cut on our part. So this is a situation which is going to continue for some considerable time and is going to require very considerable diplomatic resources for the Australian government to deal with it. The Australian government will have the backing of the opposition in any stand of absolute firmness as far as this is concerned. We absolutely believe that there is something of a threshold being reached here in a number of issues, and that threshold having been reached we must be absolutely certain that it is not crossed or advanced upon in a way that in the long term both Papua New Guinea and ourselves find it very difficult to live with. I believe the lines that are being pursued by the Australian government are correct. I cannot see, of course, the way in which their diplomacy in relation to it is being pursued. All I can say is that, to this point of time, the way in which we have pursued it does not necessarily seem to have had very much effect. That means that I do believe that the bunsen burner needs to be turned up a little in relation to the relationship with Papua New Guinea. I might say too-and this absolutely in no way whatever excuses the actions by the brigadier yesterday-that part of this mess is a product of the insufficient support given to the Papua New Guinean defence forces by the Papua New Guinean government over a period of time. Really that is a situation which could have been very easily addressed by the $38 million that went to Sandline. There are many issues around that $38 million where legitimate questions are being asked of the Papua New Guinean government and ought to be answered. NA",14
9,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition. Before moving on to the first question, I advise the House that we have in the gallery this afternoon a number of significant visitors to Australia. We have Austin Currie and Mrs Currie. Austin Currie is the Minister of State for Health, Education and Justice from the Republic of Ireland. It is a pleasure to see Ambassador Richard O'Brien and Bernadette O'Brien in their company. We also have Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of Mahatma and a former distinguished senator of the Indian parliament, and Dr Jara Mosorova, Vice President of the Senate of the Czech Republic and a member of the UNESCO Council and a former distinguished ambassador to this country. I extend a very warm welcome to you all. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Papua New Guinea: Bougainville",15
10,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Did the government have any forewarning of yesterday's events in Port Moresby? Was the government aware of the dissatisfaction within the PNG Defence Force Command in respect of the employment of foreign mercenaries? If the government did not receive any forewarning and, as appeared yesterday, was caught flatfooted by events, how can you explain such a failure in the course of this protracted crisis in our bilateral relationship? Mr Gareth Evans interjecting",15
11,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not quite up to the standards of the Leader of the Opposition, I did not think. The government did not have any forewarning of the actions by the commander of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force or soon to be former commander of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. Clearly, since the announcement by the Papua New Guinea government or, should I say, the revelation in the media that the Papua New Guinea government was to employ Sandline International, there has been no doubt some debate within the Papua New Guinea military about the wisdom or otherwise of that. I do not really propose to go into a commentary on that. The chief of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force has made his own statements about the attitude of his defence force and that is really a matter for Papua New Guinea to debate and a matter for them to contemplate. I just want to take the opportunity to make it clear that we did have no prior knowledge of the actions and the statements of the commander of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force before yesterday. Since becoming aware of those developments, Australia's views on these matters have been made clear in the Prime Minister's statement today, as well as in the comments that were issued through a spokesman yesterday. The government clearly firmly opposes any unconstitutional moves against the Papua New Guinea government. The government would like to see the Papua New Guinea government resolve this matter as soon as possible, peacefully and in accordance with Papua New Guinea's constitution. NA",16
12,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling the honourable member for Mitchell, I also note in the gallery this afternoon a former distinguished Premier of New South Wales, the Hon. Nick Greiner. A very warm welcome to you. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Health",16
13,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of a press report today which claims that the government has agreed to negotiate on the legislation to restrict provider numbers passed by the parliament last year? Is there any basis to these claims?,16
14,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his questions and note his interest and support in matters relating to health financing. I did see that article in today's Sydney Morning Herald. It quotes a junior doctor representative talking about the IRC hearing yesterday: Justice Maidment made clear at the [commission] hearing that the negotiations were to be about the substance of the legislation, not only the implementation ... One of my departmental officers was at that meeting yesterday. I have checked with him and he informs me that that comment is completely false, that Justice Maidment made no comments whatsoever about the legislation. And that would stand to reason, given that the federal government is not a party to the industrial dispute. It is a dispute that has been notified by the New South Wales Department of Health. That said, I am happy to meet with representatives of young doctors in New South Wales now that they have decided to resume work, and this will be my eighth meeting in six months with young doctors on this issue specifically. Why we are doing this is quite simple. It is because we believe that access to a Medicare provider number involves a degree of mutual obligation-that, if medical practitioners are to be given access to Medicare for life, they in return have a responsibility to ensure that the quality in general practice is as high as possible and that we can do something to get more doctors into rural areas. Both of these are important; both of them the government makes no apology for; on both of them the government has no intention of backing down. It may be that, with respect to the implementation of this, there are a few issues on which I can put young doctors' minds to rest. I am happy to try to do that, but I make it very clear that we do not give into thuggery, we do not give into bullying-and the legislation has passed the parliament. Industrial action in itself is rather strange. It is a bit like two football teams having a match. One football team wins, it leaves the field and the crowd goes home. The other team keeps playing, keeps kicking goals and keeps cheering themselves. The fact is this legislation passed the parliament on 14 December. It received royal assent on 17 December. I can understand the concerns of the younger doctors, though, because there have been some very wild claims relating to this legislation. These were also repeated in the article in the Sydney Morning Herald today. It states: The junior doctors have consistently objected to new legislation, claiming it would cut doctor numbers because of a shortfall of 400 training places a year, leaving many junior doctors without jobs. These are claims that have been made since September last year. These are claims that are demonstrably false. The fact is that we are already into the first year of the legislation where we are supposed to have 400 to 500 doctors without access to training positions, and the fact is there are training positions available in Australia that we cannot fill. The last time. I checked, which was 1Yz weeks ago, there were 22 training positions in New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory that someone could walk into tomorrow that are unable to be filled. So, far from being 400 to 500 doctors who do not have access to training, there is no doctor who wants training and is prepared to move that does not have access to it and there are, in fact, training positions that are unfilled. In the end, what is being asked for is a guaranteed income for life. We do not give that to hairdressers, we do not give it to accountants, we do not give it to builderswe do not give it to anyone else in the community-and it is unreasonable to expect young doctors to be treated by the government in a way that is different from the rest of the population. Papua New Guinea: Bougainville",16
15,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again my question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, do you recall your answers to my questions on 23 and 26 February when you said you were investigating the sourcing of funds for the PNG government's employment of foreign mercenaries? Minister, will you now advise the House of the results of your inquiries? In the light of allegations of corruption made by Brigadier General Singirok and the reported calls for a PNG royal commission into the mercenaries deal, what specific measures have you taken to ensure that Australia's contribution to the PNG budget is not helping pay for the mercenaries?",17
16,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to that question, let me say that the Australian government has taken that matter up with the Papua New the Guinea government, in particular the question of Australian aid money not being used to pay for the mercenaries, and we have on occasions been given an assurance by the Papua New Guinea government that Australian aid money is indeed not being used for the payment of the mercenaries. As far as the question of the source of the money is concerned, I have to say to the House that there are various versions of the source of the money, and I do not propose to canvass those in the House today, but I think what I can pass on to you is that we have been given assurances on more than one occasion by the Papua New Guinea government that Australian aid money has not been used. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport",17
17,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Is the minister aware of recent reports that he has asked the Federal Airports Corporation not to proceed with minor capital works at Sydney airport that would extend the threshold on the third runway? Can the minister inform the House of the details of any decision he has made in relation to this matter?,17
18,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. He, along with a number of other members of this House, has taken a deep and abiding interest in the issue of aircraft noise in Sydney. As Chairman of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, he has had a leading role in trying to resolve some of the problems that this government inherited when we came into office in March of last year-problems which were created by the ineptness and mismanagement of the previous Labor government that left Sydneysiders with an enormous problem dealing with aircraft noise which this government, with the assistance of the honourable member for North Sydney, has been working very hard indeed to try to resolve. I would like to thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his efforts, and indeed the other members of the Sydney Airport Community Forum. The issue that the honourable member for North Sydney refers to is one that has caused some considerable interest in recent days. When the new third runway was originally constructed, for reasons best known to the former Minister for Transport, the threshold, which is the point at which aircraft land on the runway, was not placed at the end of the runway but was moved some 500 metres in from the end of the runway. This meant that the operations of the airport were unbalanced and this decreased the efficiency of the operation of the airport which caused an increase in delays and in inconvenience for those people who use the airport. The Federal Airports Corporation, as part of its plans to resolve the problems of Sydney airport, has looked at moving the threshold back to where it ought to have been, which is towards the end of the new runway. I have, though, been approached by the member for North Sydney, in his capacity as chairman of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, and he has said to me that members of the Sydney Airport Community Forum have resolved that the threshold issue should not be dealt with at the present time and that the threshold should not be looked at unless it is looked at in of the long-term operating plans for the operation of Sydney airport which the government is currently dealing with. In light of our desire to be as aware and sensitive as possible to the needs of Sydneysiders over aircraft noise problems, the government has spoken with the Federal Airports Corporation, and the Federal Airports Corporation has agreed that they will not be moving the threshold at the present time and that any decision to move that threshold will not be made unless it is made in the context of the long-term operating plan for Sydney's Mascot airport. I compare this with the manner in which the previous government handled this whole issue of aircraft noise. Here we have a clear example of this government listening to the needs of the people in Sydney",18
19,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What about your sleazy, sneaky deal?",18
20,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If there is any suggestion of sleazy deals in all of this, one can consider that the people of Sydney were treated in a very sleazy fashion by the former government over the way Sydney's aircraft noise problem was created. Indeed, the sleaziness of that arrangement was that nobody in the former Labor government listened to the needs of Sydneysiders, which resulted in mass demonstrations at Sydney airport which caused great inconvenience to all people concerned, inconvenience and delays which could have been resolved by a governmerH which was prepared to listen to the people of Sydney on this vital issue of aircraft noise. We are listening to the people of Sydney. This is but one example of that. There are many others. We had, for example, six public meetings held in October and November last year which the honourable member for North Sydney chaired and which thousands of people attended to discuss the long-term operating plans for Sydney airport. That is part of the community consultative process that this government is engaging in. We have invited submissions on this subject and, in putting together the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport, we received 1,500 submissions from the community which we have light taken into account. Now that we have released the first draft of the long-term operating plans, we have received some 3,000 submissions from people living in Sydney. This government is listening to those people. This government is acting in concert with their wishes and it is this government which is resolving the problem of aircraft noise created by the Labor Party when they were in government for 13 years making this issue an enormous mess. Superannuation",18
21,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the what Treasurer. Is it not the case that on industry evidence to the Senate last week at least one million Australians, the overwhelming majorigo home. ty of whom would be low and middle income earners earning far less than $85,000 a year, will be liable for the new 15 per cent superanI nuation tax plus a compulsory advance instalment of 7Yz per cent because they will not have provided tax file numbers to the superthis annuation funds in time, required by the proposed legislation?

Mr Reith-On the point of order, Mr Speaker: this is a frivolous point of order. It is absolutely laughable for the Leader of the Opposition to attempt to interrupt the Treasurer when he properly makes the point that we are doing is fair and they are defending the top end of town. If that is not relevant, we may as well all get up, pack up and",19
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are occasions when think that is probably a good idea, but today is not one of them. I now call the Treasurer.",19
29,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I indicated before, is a government which is committed to fairness in the taxation system. That is why government did something about the fact that superannuation taxation arrangements were more concessional the higher up the income scale you went. So concessionality increased as your income increased. It was the one arrangement where if you happened to be a high income earner the p?oportion at benefit was greater than if you were a low income earner. And who allowed that to be in place? Mr Gareth Evans-We are not arguing",19

33,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: we do support the surcharge on high income earners, but this goes to relevance.

35,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much. That is exactly the admission we wanted. So what is the Labor position? You support it. You support this scheme. That is your position.

42,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If it had not been for the jack-in-the-box tactics of the Leader of the Opposition I would have finished by now. So where are we? We have introduced a fair measure. The Labor Party supports it and the Labor Party, while saying it supports it, is creeping around the place trying to open up another constituency, because you do not have the decency to actually put your votes where your mouth is. In relation to the implementation of this scheme, it builds on the current scheme. The current scheme in relation to employer contributions has the assessments paid by the superannuation funds-exactly the same system. The only other system, which presumably is the one that the Labor Party supports, would be to have either all the employers of the country or all of the employees of the country doing it. If you want to have the decency to stand up say that you want every employee in the country to start filling in new forms, that is your alternative. But, as for us, we think, because superannuation schemes are already doing it and because they have guaranteed income and because it is not a poor industry and because it is their business, it is quite a reasonable thing for those superannuation funds to do it. In fact, when you were in government you thought it was a reasonable thing. You put a measure in place where the funds paid across. You thought it was a reasonable thing. But, of course, you now no longer support anything you did in government, do you? You're against all of the positions you took for 13 years, aren't you? Once you went out of government, once you had no responsibility for anything, you became completely opportunistic. You turned on every position that you had held.",20

53,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the level of support from young Australians, especially secondary school students, for the proposed work for the dole project?",21
54,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I can inform the honourable member for Makin that the experience I have had in the last 10 days in travelling to various parts of Australia has demonstrated very strongly to me that there is overwhelming support in the Australian community for the government's work for the dole proposal. Mr Costello-Where does Labor stand?,21
55,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to that in a moment. It is particularly apparent that young people very strongly support the government's work for the dole scheme. For example, the Herald-Sun ran an article on page 1 last week entitled 'Teens support work for the dole'. That report said: A special Herald-Sun youth poll has revealed overwhelming support for the introduction of for the dole. Two-thirds of senior school students backed the concept of work for the dole. I repeat: two-thirds of senior school students backed the concept of work for the dole. That has been the experience I have had. It has obviously been the experience that the member for Makin has had. In fact, the member for Makin has drawn to my attention a large number of letters that she received from year 10 students attending the Salisbury East High School in South Australia. There were comments such as this from Becky MCNamara: I think the work for the dole is a good idea. I think that this idea should have been applied many years ago. Who was in office many years ago? They were. They were in office for 13 years. Craig Tucker said: I give the idea the big thumbs up. Nicole Pirie said: I feel that working for the dole is one of the government's best proposals yet and I hope that the idea goes ahead. Tomorrow the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training will be introducing legislation into the parliament and that legislation will be inviting the Australian parliament to alter the provisions of the Social Security Act by taking out the prohibition that now exists on people who receive unemployment benefits being required to do some work in return for those benefits. I think a lot of people, including all of those young people who support the work for the dole scheme, would be very interested to know where the Australian Labor Party stands. It will really require their vote on this measure for us to finally find out where the Australian Labor Party stands. Ever since I announced this proposal several weeks ago the Labor Party has been performing a monumental flip-flop on it. One minute it is in favour of it. One minute it is against it. The next minute it is in the middle, then it is slightly on the right, then it is slightly on the left. You had the Leader of the Opposition calling it 'a council of despair and failure'. The member for Batman, the spokesman on employment matters, who specialises in making insulting remarks about young work unemployed people, inferring that they stay home in bed all day, said it was belting dole bludgers. He said: The coalition's got difficulties so what do you do? You roll out one of the hairy chestnutsthat is what you called itand belt the dole bludgers. They were your remarks on 10 February. Then the Leader of the Opposition has a sort of stroke of moderation and says: We are going to amend it to blazes. We are going to put down propositions that actually make this look like a proper labour market scheme. But then the member for Canberra, the spokesman on industrial relations, said: If this is the only proposal they have, we'll improve it as much as we can, but we will not stand in the way of it. But then the piece de resistance comes from the member for Hotham. You know what he says? He says that Labor's always supported work for the dole. All 1 can say to those people who sit opposite is: your moment of truth is nigh. The legislation will be here tomorrow and we will await with baited breath whether or not you support it. Employment: Car Industry",21
56,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I wonder if those people who answered the poll understood that it was 10,000 jobs",22
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will address his question.,22
58,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that the Prime Minister is so keen on polls in the HeraldSun, does he recall the poll taken by that paper just after we announced our new car industry policy in which 90 per cent of the respondents backed our approach? When will the Prime Minister do the right thing and say where he stands on the position of Australia's 47,000 auto workers and back that plan for more exports and jobs-real jobs for real Australians, not 10,000 places for 800,000 unemployed? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, 1 raise a point of order. I ask you to rule on that question's content and construction, particularly its second section, as to whether it is in order with regard to the standing orders and their application to the flip-flop opposition leader.",22
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,22
60,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question because he does ask a question about a very important issue, and 1 would like to say something about the issue of car tariffs and the issue of tariff policy generally. But before I do that can 1 just draw the House's attention to an interesting contribution that was made to this whole debate by the New South Wales Labor Premier two days ago. He was being interviewed on 2GB, and the interviewer said: Rundles has gone. You've blamed the Howard government. CARR: No. No, I was careful, I was careful about that. I'm not making political points about this, John. I blame Canberra. I blame Canberra tariff policies. INTERVIEWER: Because it's been happening for years. CARR: Indeed it has. Bob Carr in saying that-he had the honesty because he is in government-was exposing the complete opportunism of the Australian Labor Party. If we are going to have an honest debate about this, let it be understood that in the last 20 years the biggest step towards lower tariffs in Australia was taken in my view in 1991 when, to his credit, Bob Hawke as Prime Minister of Australia brought down a statement on tariff policy. I am on the record in the past as having said, both before and after I became Leader of the Opposition, that I thought that that was one of the more courageous economic statements of the former government. And, if we are to have an honest debate, let the Labor Party be the last party to parade itself as a party of high tariffs, as a party of industry protection. Mr Crean-No, we're not.",22
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, you are; that is exactly what you are trying to do, and you are behaving in a very hypocritical fashion. So far as the attitude of this government is concerned, we will not flip-flop one day against it, another day for it. One minute you are in favour of protection, the next minute you are against it. We are not going to do that. What we are going to do is exactly what you did in government-and that is, when we have the final report of the Productivity Commission, we will then take, with all proper dispatch, a decision on that report. I can assure the House that that decision will take into account the interests of all of the Australian people. We will not only have regard to the interests of people in a particular part of Australia, because tariff policy decisions affect all Australians-a point recognised by Bob Hawke, the man you supported when he made that tariff statement in 1991. Film Classification",22
62,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. What measures has the minister taken to ensure greater community involvement in the classification of films? Can the minister be sure that these measures will assist in making film classification decisions balanced and responsible?,23
63,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In December last year I announced a proposal to establish community assessment panels to enhance significantly the involvement of the public in the classification of films for both cinema and video. Last Friday in Melbourne, I had the opportunity to discuss the details of the proposed scheme with the state and territory ministers responsible for classification matters, and I am very pleased to report that the proposal received their unanimous support. The panels will have an advisory role in assessing decisions made by the Classification Board of the Office of Film and Literature Classification. Each community assessment panel will be made up of 20 independently selected members of the community. The panel membership will be drawn from a broad cross-section of the Australian community. They will represent various age groups, and they will come from diverse backgrounds. Three different panels will be convened in each year, and they will meet in different parts of the country. They will be selected by independent consultants in order to get an appropriate demographic sample. The first panel will be held in New South Wales, the OFLC being in Sydney, and will have members drawn from metropolitan, outer suburban and regional areas. The classification ministers were firmly of the view that the panels should be constituted in different parts of the country as the scheme proceeds so that they will be able properly to assess community views as they vary throughout the country. The panels will assess a selection of films which are submitted to the Classification Board. They will apply the same guidelines the board uses itself when making classification decisions. This will enable the board to compare the assessment made by the panels with their own decision and enable them to take this into account in their future decision making. The panels will review films after the films have been classified but before release, and the process will not ordinarily delay the release of the film. The establishment of these panels is consistent with recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards. The initiative will ensure that ordinary Australians will have a say in what they and their children watch. . Tariffs",23
64,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question goes to the Prime Minister and is on the subject of flipflops. Does the Prime Minister recollect going to the polls on the tariff issue last year with this undertaking: 'A Liberal-National government will not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55 a tonne as we have already met our obligations under the World Trade Organisation GATT 1994 agreements'? That was, prior to the last election, your promise and undertaking to the Queensland and New South Wales sugar growers. Do you also recollect on the subject of statesmanlike treatment of the tariff issue your own newsletter which said, 'Lower tariffs in Australia should be matched by equally fair treatment from other countries,' and that, 'Lower tariffs should be matched by reductions in business costs,' et cetera? Prime Minister, in these circumstances, how can you look Queensland and New South Wales sugar growers in the eye and tell them that you have honestly upheld your obligations to them?",23
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is very easy to do that when the domestic price of sugar is well below world parity and has been so for two years.,24
66,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,24
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There are signs of increasing disorder in this House. This is a general warning. I reserve the right to take whatever action I see appropriate. Industrial Relations,24
68,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the minister aware of recent announcements by senior figures in the labour movement about changes in industrial relations policy? What are these changes, and how would they affect Australian workers? What is the government's reaction to such changes?",24
69,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Adelaide for her question. I appreciate her interest in industrial relations reform. I have seen these remarks. I think they are quite significant. They are the remarks of the shadow minister for industrial relations, who said in Adelaide on 8 March: There is a contrast between saying enterprise bargaining is an important option and moving to the point that the only way in which living standards can even be maintained for most Australian workers is through continuing rounds of enterprise bargaining. I think it is an important statement, and it was declared an important statement by the shadow minister himself, who said that it was a very big change in Labor's approach to industrial relations. You know it is very big and important in the Labor Party because Jennie George endorsed the statement the next morning on television. I suppose the nub of it is that the opposition's long standing policy position in industrial relations has been that enterprise bargaining should be the centrepiece of the system and that that is the way in which the system should develop in the future. What they have done now is downgrade all of that to say merely that it is an option. We all know that in the labour movement, if you have an option, the people who will run the show are basically the ACTU because they are always in favour of a legislative framework which gives the unions the majority control in a lot of situations. The contrast in what they are now saying with what they were saying in government is very stark indeed. For example, the member for Kingsford Smith, in October 1993, when introducing their last reforms which had as a key part enterprise bargaining, said: This legislation marks the culmination of the government's break with the past-our move as a nation from a centralised to a decentralised",24
70,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question related to industrial relations policy, not to the question of past policies. It is not an issue about which the minister is responsible. You should get him to sit down. He should talk about the current industrial relations",24
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,24
72,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question asked what was the effect on workers. I can tell you that we do consider that to be a responsibility of this government. In fact, that is a big contrast to what we had when you were in government when, quite frankly, the interests of the workers were the last thing on your mind. What that quote shows is that Labor moved to enterprise bargaining as the centrepiece of their scheme. The reason they did so was in their very own statements. Prior to the last election they said that the reason you would move to an enterprise based system in industrial relations was that it could produce dramatic gains in productivity and better paid and more secure jobs for workers. That is the reason you would do it. So why is it that they are now moving away from it? The then Labor government, in its platform for the last election, said that the Industrial Relations Reform Act entrenches workplace bargaining as the centrepiece of Australia's industrial relations system. The reality is that Labor has moved away from that which it said was important. It follows a long history. Before the 1990 election they were opposed to enterprise bargaining, but after the election they moved to implement it. In the 1993 election they were opposed to our policy to further it, but after the 1993 election Keating endorsed it. In the 1996 election they were in favour of enterprise bargaining, and after the election they are now apparently opposed to it. The reality is that they are not interested in the welfare of Australian workers. There is only one explanation for this shift, and that is that it is an opportunistic shift which they think might curry them with some favour, particularly with the ACTU. This government is determined and resolved. We have shifted the system further back to the workplace to give workers a greater opportunity to have a say in the way in which their workplaces are run but, most importantly, a chance to introduce those work practices that will both retain their jobs and give them a chance of higher pay. Small Business",24
73,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Did the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs say in his press release of 27 November last year that the Yellow Pages Small Business Index was 'only of historical interest' and that the of the November survey were 'meaningless' because the circumstances had changed significantly for the small business sector in Australia since that survey was carried out? Is he aware that the most recent small business index survey released in February showed that small business confidence 'is unchanged from the low levels recorded in August and November 1996 surveys'? Does the minister acknowledge not only that the index is reflecting historical factors but also that current levels of confidence of the small business sector have not been bolstered by his policy?  his question. Indeed the Yellow Pages survey of February shows-as do a number of surveys and the ACCI survey as weJl-that confidence in sales profitability and the economy is improving. In addition to that, the most recent survey of the Australian Institute of Company Directors also confirms that fact. If you look at housing starts, there is a 22.5 per cent increase over the last 12 months, with a lOA per cent increase in January alone. If members opposite want to continue to talk down the - conomy and want to continue to talk down the prospects of small business in this country, be it on their head. The quislings in the comer over there",25
74,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. I require the withdrawal of that statement. They were miserably betrayed by the Prime Minister when they were expelled from the Liberal Party.",25
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! We are not going to debate the issue.,25
76,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I haven't heard. Has the minister withdrawn that remark?",25
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He has not been invited to withdraw it.,25
78,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I presume he was referring to this comer here. Mr Andren- Mr Speaker, I take objection if that reference was made to me as an Independent. Would he withdraw it? ",25
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister has withresults drawn his comment. I thank the minister.  that the initiatives, particularly those announced in the budget, are having a positive effect on the small business sector in this country and it is about time the opposition supported those measures for smaJl business so that they can grow their businesses and employ more young Australians.",25
80,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A supplementary question,",25
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"from one of the quislings! Is the minister aware that the February survey was conducted after cuts in interest rates, after the details of capital gains tax rollover relief for small business was known, after the Small Business Deregulation Task Force delivered its recommendations on how to reduce red tape and after the workplace relations bill passed through the Senate?",25
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The question falls within the umbrella of the question first asked. I invite the minister to finalise his answer.  interest rates. In fact, that survey said that 57 per cent of those surveyed said that reductions in interest rates had had or would have a positive effect on their business. I do not know where the member for Curtin is coming from, but indeed I think that survey was a positive response in regard to the government's business initiatives. Meat and Livestock Industries",25
83,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, on behalf of the many livestock p-oducers in Mallee. Can the minister provide hIS assurance as to how the streamlining of the services and promotion activities of the meat and livestock industries will improve ownership and accountability in a commercial environment? Also, how will the new industry structure give more autonomy to the sheep meat and meat sectors?",26
84,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question, which is of great importance to Australia's red meat industries. When we were elected to government some 12 months ago, we found no less than three statutory authorities underpinned by Commonwealth legislation. We had the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the Meat Research Corporation and, overarching them and telling them what to do, we had the Meat Industry Council, which of course had been the previous government's very inadequate response to their own Industry Commission's major inquiry into the problems in the red meat industry in Australia. It was unquestionably an awesomely cumbersome and inefficient set of arrangements. It was the subject of a great deal of criticism by producers feeling, of course, enormous economic strain with low prices about the lack of ownership, the lack of control and the lack of direction that they were able to exercise; and by processors as well, who, as heavy levy contributors, felt that they had no control over promotion campaigns that were of no relevance to them. So I initiated a major review of the whole set of arrangements last year. I recei ved that towards the end of last year. After a very extensive consultation-and that was important because this is a historic opportunity to get something right that has been seriously wrong-I announced today that all three statutory authorities will be wound up. The Meat Industry Council will simply go. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the MRC will be replaced by a producer owned company. It will be a service provider-it is very important that its role be clearly understood at the outset-to industry, owned by and accountable to industry and producers, the levy payers in particular. . The policy direction and leadership for the mdustry must be, should be and will be incr.easingly provided by the appropriate bodIes, that IS to say, the peak industry councils and their state affiliates-without the confusion of recent years. That is important because the duly elected representatives that producers throw up ought to be able to do what they are put there for-that is, to lead. !his cOI-pany will have separate operating umts covenng research and development, food safety and quality, the maintenance of Ausmeat and a range of other roles such as market access and residue management. On the issue of promotion and marketing, there will be separate institutions, or separate bodies, operating within the company for both beef and sheep meats-the so-called below the split line. There will be no more muddying of the waters, so long a cause of complaint. There really will be proper accountability, and levies contributed by sheep producers and by beef producers will be assuredly spent on promotion dedicated to each of those industries. There will also be appropriate external performance audits, and a 66 per cent majorit- v?te by levy payers will be enough to dIsmISS the board at annual general meetings. There will be a commitment to projects rather than program promotion efforts, and those efforts will be, over time, made fully contestable. At the same time, the new board will have a major new test and responsibilityMr Fitzgibbon-Is that your last page?",26
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hunter! The minister will resume his seat. I invoke standing order 304A in respect of the member for Hunter. Remove yourself from the chamber forthwith! The honourable member for Hunter thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,26
86,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is actually important to people who are concerned about what is happening in rural Australia and to the 70,000 or 80,000 workers who depend upon us reclaiming our international and, for that matter, domestic competitiveness. This is a model which will help Australia's red meat industries regain their place in the world. It hands control back to the owners, to the levy payers, back to industry, where it belongs. I have no doubt that they will make it work. This is first-class policy from a government committed to empowering industry so that it can perform to its best levels. Superannuation",27
87,Mr JENKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, why does the definition oP'assessable income' for the new 15 per cent supyrannuation tax include eligible termination payments? Has the Treasurer calculated how many lower and middle income earners who lose their jobs as a result of his government's actions this year will be liable for the new 15 per cent superannuation tax as a result of that definition? Is it not a fact that Corio. most of the 22,000 Telstra employees about to be made redundant will have their retirement income cut by the new 15 per cent tax, even though practically none of them would have been earning anything like $85,000 a year?",27
88,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The arrangements apply in relation to taxable income including superannuation contributions in relation to taxable income, because it is fairer than if it were applied to gross income and including superannuation contributions to catch those situations where there was salary sacrificing. In relation to eligible termination payments, they are treated in the same way as the superannuation contributions are treated. That is why it is there. Also in relation to eligible termination payments, the arrangements apply to golden handshakes because they would otherwise be a mechanism for avoiding superannuation. That is why it applies. It applies in the fair way in which the current arrangement applies and it applies tv the higher income earners. The thing that I come back to, though, is this: why go to all of the trouble to ask these sorts of questions when your own leader says you support it? The truth of the matter is this: you have a leader who does not have the courage to come out and say what his real position is. He does not have the courage to come out and say to low income earners in Australia, 'For 13 years we presided over an unfair system and we liked it, and we'd like it to continue.' He does not have the courage to say that. Mr O'Connor-We gave them super, you idiot.",27
89,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He has come out with merely,27
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will resume his seat. The honourable member for Corio has exceeded the bounds of behaviour in this chamber. I invoke standing order 304A in respect to you. Mr O'Connor-Why doesn'the stop lying?,27
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I name the member for Motion (by Mr Reith) put: That the member for Corio be suspended from the service of the House. The bells being rung,27
92,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to the fact that, as you have already taken action against the honourable member for Corio understanding order 304, it is not appropriate that he vote in this division.",27
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the right honourable member for New England. We have indeed reflected on the question and I have been reminded that a precedent has already been set in this House where a member excluded understanding order 304A and on the occasion of his withdrawal from the chamber was named and voted in the division.,27
94,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a further point of order. What status does that give the naming of a person understanding order 304A? Does that mean that it can easily be revocable without there being a further action by this House or by you?",27
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I understand the thrust of your question, but the further offence was committed on the way out of the chamber. So, while standing order 304A pertains in the sense that the member removes himself from the chamber forthwith, if he commits another offence of a more serious nature, I reserve the right to name him, which I did, and as he had not physically left the chamber at the time. I think it is appropriate that he be involved in the vote. The House divided. [3.16 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) Ayes ............... Noes ............... Majority .........

96,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Corio is suspended from the service of the House for 24 hours. The honourable member for Corio thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,28
97,Mr COSTELLO,PAIRS,"As I was saying in relation to these surcharge arrangements, they apply to taxable income. Where the taxable income is above $70,000, they apply in that year and that year only. Anybody who is on $70,000 is on a marginal tax rate over 48 per cent, and the current arrangements would give you a tax concession on the contributions of about 33 per cent. Under the government's new, fair arrangements, allegedly supported by the opposition, the tax concession is evened up, and that is why it is being done. Telstra: Sale",28
98,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PAIRS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Minister, can you inform the House about the progress of the government's sale of one-third of Telstra? Minister, can you also let us know what the next steps to the sale process are?",29
99,Mr FAHEY,PAIRS,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is making solid progress towards the objective of giving Australians the opportunity of investing in the biggest domestic company which is operating in the fastest growing sector of our economy; namely, telecommunications. The government is on target to have one-third of the Commonwealth's equity in Telstra available for sale before the end of this calendar year. The one-third sale of Telstra will ensure the future success of Telstra after the introduction of the post-July 1997 regulatory environment and the entry of new international competitors. The partial privatisation will introduce much needed private sector disciplines of reporting and of resource allocation. The head of Telstra, Mr Frank Blount, said only last week that part-privatisation would make Telstra more flexible and efficient while planned incentive schemes for management and staff would drive motivation and deliver direct rewards for higher productivity. Last week I was pleased to announce, subject to the conclusion of contractual and fee negotiations, the firms selected to undertake the roles of global coordinators and lead managers. As global coordinators, the firms selected were LB. Were, ABN AMRO Rothschild and CS First Boston. As joint lead managers, the firms selected were Ord Minnett, Daiwa, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Goldman Sachs/Macquarie Bank. This selection was undertaken by an independent selection panel consisting of two business representatives and two senior public servants. The role of the joint global coordinators and lead managers is to help prepare the company for sale and to lead the global selling effort of Telstra's shares; to provide advice on all sales issues, such as offer structure and marketing; and to manage the sale project. The firms selected are leaders in their respective markets and have been chosen to provide a balance of sales expertise, international telecommunications experience and a geographic mix designed to attract a broad share registry for the newly listed Telstra entity. Further steps in this preparatory process include the appointment of legal and accounting advisers and the independent adviser to the government who will not participate in the sale of shares. The process of preparing Telstra for privatisation will ensure the ultimate success of the float. The ultimate winners will be Australian consumers of telecommunications services. European Bank of Reconstruction and Development: Appointment of Senator Short",29
100,Mr GARETH EVANS,PAIRS,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer to his announcement today of the appointment of Senator Jim Short to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, at a UK tax-free salary of some $150,000 a year. Is this the same European Bank of Reconstruction and Development that in its first year of operation spent more money on tarting up its London headquarters with Carrara marble and sycamore panelling than it lent to the whole of central and eastern Europe, which is the purpose for which it was established? Is it the case, furthermore, that the Treasurer's advertised job specifications required, among other things, 'a strong record of ... leadership, judgment and management experience, as well as conceptual and analytical abilities of a high order'? Is his appointee the same Senator Jim Short who was forced to resign from the front-bench last year after what he himself described as 'a careless oversight' in which he forgot that he had issued, while he was responsible for banking matters, a banking licence to ANZ Grindlays?",29
101,Mr COSTELLO,PAIRS,"I do not know about the tarting up of the foyer, but if anybody did it would most probably be the member for Holt, I would say. It may be true, it may not, but if Senator Short is going across there I am sure that Senator Short would make the view known, as we instruct all of the people we appoint to international agencies to do, that we think these agencies should be run on a disciplined expenditure basis. In relation to Senator Short's appointment, let me say that Senator Short is eminently qualified for this position. Senator Short was a career Treasury officer, and he was a career Treasury officer who dealt with international issues of this genre before he entered the parliament. Mr Gareth Evans interjecting",29
102,Mr COSTELLO,PAIRS,"Look, I know you are obsessed with the tax-free status of international jobs. I know you are, and I know that it is a matter of more than mere passing interest to you personally, but I am not going to say anything about it. Government members-Go on!",30

104,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! Members on my right.,30
105,Mr COSTELLO,PAIRS,"They are trying to lead me down bad paths. The only other thing is that, yes, the government did ask for expressions of interest for the job. After considering them personally I can say Senator Short was easily the most qualified. I can also report to you that other applicants for the job included opposition staffers. Literacy",30
106,Mr HILLSON,PAIRS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training.",30
107,Unknown,PAIRS,Opposition members interjecting,30
108,Mr BILSON,PAIRS,I am pleased that meets with the approval of the House. I draw the minister's attention to the fact that 30 per of 14-year-olds cannot read at an appropriate level. Can the minister inform the House what steps the government is taking to ensure that all young Australians achieve adequate literacy skills?,30
109,Dr KEMP,PAIRS,"I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. I know his personal commitment to the young people of his electorate. Lack of literacy skills amongst young Australians has been one of the most serious issues with which this government has had to deal after 13 years of Labor Party administration. As the member for Dunkley says, after 13 years of Labor, some 30 per cent of 14-year-olds could not read adequately and boys' reading capacity had actually declined quite significantly over this period. New research that I released last week showed that boys with very inadequate literacy skills had less than a 50 per cent chance of completing school and were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as those with good literacy skills. Lack of literacy skills does not cause unemployment, but it is very much related to the disadvantages which young people face in the labour market. After 13 years of drift on this very important matter, the government took the view that this situation could not be allowed to continue. The Commonwealth government provides some $3.3 billion for schooling each year. The primary purpose of these payments is to teach young people to read and write. I am pleased to inform the House that last Friday, in an agreement which some have hailed as historic, the Commonwealth agreed with all the states and territories that from 1998 every child commencing school will achieve a minimum standard of literacy and numeracy within four years. There was agreement that from 1998 students would be assessed against a national literacy standard or benchmark for reading, writing and spelling. Queensland and Western Australia have agreed to move from sampling measures to universal testing of students. All children entering school from 1998 will be assessed as soon as possible to determine their literacy level and teaching needs. Stucent dents who need extra help will be provided with that help in order to meet the year 3 standards. An important aspect of this agreement is that the states and territories have agreed to set aside out of their own resources the money necessary to provide the professional development for teachers to make sure that this goal is met. There will be national reporting of the results for each state and territory against the national standards from 1999. This historic agreement means that for the first time since Federation there is now a national commitment on the part of all Australian governments to provide all young Australians with the skills they need to provide a foundation for their later lives. Let me make it quite clear, and underline this, that this is part of the delivery of the government's promise to address the fundamental obstacles which are faced by young people in getting jobs and in getting on with their adult lives. Black Hawk Helicopter Accident",30
110,Mr BEVIS,PAIRS,"My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Minister, is it not the case that your public disclosure of the payments made to the family of one of the Black Hawk disaster aircrew breaches the guidelines and the procedures applied by your own department and contravenes section 14 of the Privacy Act 1988? Minister, why did you so wilfully and shamefully breach your own department's procedures",31
111,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: standing orders relating to question time forbid the asking of a question seeking a legal opinion, and one was just requested.",31
112,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The point of order is out of order.,31
113,Mr BEVIS,PAIRS,"Minister, why did you so wilfully and shamefully breach your own department's procedures and the Privacy Act? Will you now publicly apologise to Mrs Berrigan for your gross injustice to her and to this parliament for your breach of defence personnel policy and the act?",31
114,Mrs BISHOP,PAIRS,"I must say that I find that question in the most appalling taste. As I made quite clear at the press conference I had, I understood that grief can affect different people in different ways. I understood very well that Mrs Berrigan could have been affected in different ways from other folk. However, Mrs Berrigan did choose to go on the radio and to complain that she had received no payment. Mr Bevis-Does that justify you breaching",31
115,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The member for Brisbane asked the question. Be quiet.,31
116,Mrs BISHOP,PAIRS,"It was most important-and I put it to you, Mr Speaker, as others have seen it was most important-that the record was simply set straight. As for the question of it being unlawful, it simply is not. Indeed, if you have a look at the guidelines, you will see it is quite within the guidelines. Furthermore, to have it on the record that somehow this government had not paid out those entitlements which Mrs Berrigan was entitled to receive as early as July and August of last year was simply to have distorted the facts and to have left a wrong impression in the minds of the Australian people. Quite frankly, I was not prepared to let that be the case. Mr Bevis-I seek leave to table the details of disclosure under the DFRDB Act. Leave not granted. Australian Capital Territory: Land Swap",31
117,Mr NAIRN,PAIRS,"My question is to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government. Can the minister advise the House of progress on the Kingston-Acton land swap in the ACT? What are the implications of the land swap for the proposed National Museum of Australia?",31
118,Mr WARWICK SMITH,PAIRS,"I thank the member for his question. Indeed, I am pleased to report to the House that an agreement has been reached with the ACT government for the exchange of land here in Canberra: Acton Peninsula and the Kingston foreshore. It is a matter that has been going on for some time. Agreement has been reached about the contamination at the Kingston site and the demolition at the Acton site. It is now resolved. The demolition of some of those structures on the Acton site was approved by the National Capital Authority last week, and those matters will now proceed. The Acton site, as would be well known to members, is a matter of national significance. Areas of heritage value will be protected. The territory government is proposing to develop on the Kingston foreshore site a recreational, commercial and tourism activity. At the present time there is a national compement tition for design taking place in conjunction with the ACT government and the National Capital Authority which I think will develop an opportunity for Canberra Canberra citizens will welcome it, and the many thousands of visitors to Canberra year will also enjoy into the future. Most importantly, though, last year on 13 December the Prime Minister announced that, after advice from a detailed committee, this government would proceed with the erection explanation. of the National Museum of Australia on the Acton Peninsula site. That is a decision we are very proud to make. It was a decision that we made in the election that we would proceed. It is in contrast with what has happened when the opposition was in government. In every election for the last 12 you raised the prospect of there being a National Museum of Australia. You never ever delivered on it. This government made an undertaking. It has delivered and it deliver. I am now pleased to report that that agreement, so essential for its erection, been completed. Unemployment",31
119,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PAIRS,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does Minister recall saying in this House in October last year that I should not ask a question about unemployment until 12 months into his government? Has the Prime Minister seen today's ABS figures showing long-term that unemployment at a 17-month high-40,000 more long-term unemployed than in May ants. 1996? Given that time is now up, Prime Minister, will you tell the House when government will get serious about comprehenprovision sive training and real job creation programs to reduce unemployment?",32
120,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,"I will tell the member for Batman that I do remember what damage he did to the employment prospects of Australclear ians when he ran the ACTU. I remember that, and every Australian remembers that and every member on this side of the House remembers that. What I have said over last 12 months, and what I will say again and again, is that a party that ran the affairs of this country for 13 years-drove unemployto a recession peak of over 11 per cent, left us with almost 30 per cent youth unemployment and 8V2 per cent general unemployment-has no earthly credentials to lecture us that certainly on unemployment.

131,Mr SPEAKER,PAPERS,"I have received a letter the from the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The suffering caused to Australians with health problems by the government's health cuts and the misallocation of resources to private health insurance rebates rather than directly to patient care I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required all by the standing orders having risen in their places",33
132,Mr LEE,PAPERS,"In early 1995, we on this side of the House were quite pleased that Dr Wooldridge, the member for Chisholm, became the then opposition spokesman on health. He had a pretty reasonable on our side of the House as a new decent person. We were also quite pleased that he just happened to replace the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) as then opposition spokesman on health. You can imagine why we thought it was an improvement when it went from Mrs Bishop to be in a position Dr Wooldridge. In the time that Dr Wooldridge has been the Minister for Health and Family Services in Australia, we have come to raise a number of questions about decisions that have been made. You can understand why John Howthe ard-the current Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for in the Bennelong-picked Dr Wooldridge, the member for Chisholm, as their spokesman for health. The member for Bennelong was compromised on his policy on health care. He was already on the record as saying that he wanted to pull Medicare apart and that he thought bulk-billing was a rort. What he on needed was someone warm and cuddly who could try to convince the Australian people 12 that the Liberals could be trusted with health care. They thought that, in the member for of Chisholm, they had the person who could do that. The honourable member had been dumped as the deputy leader for Peter the current Treasurer, but he had been resurrected by the member for Health Bennelong to try to convince Australians that Liberals could be trusted with health care. What have we seen in the one year that the minister has had responsibility? Before the election, he promised he would maintain Medicare rebates-that has been broken. He promised to maintain the pharmaceutical benefits scheme-that has been broken. He prvmised to maintain pensioner entitlementsthat has also been broken. He promised to maintain the Commonwealth dental health program-that has been broken. He also promised to maintain funding for public hospitals-that has also been broken. We do not mind a minister who fights hard to keep his promises but who just happens to get rolled in the ERC by the Visigoths and the Huns who run the ERe. We do not mind a minister who goes in and fights hard for what he believes in. What we cannot stand are hypocrites and frauds who make promises but who are unable or unwilling to stand up and fight for what they believe in. What we cannot stand and what we object to are ministers who make promises, break the promises and then try to find someone else to blame for the fact that they have not met their undertakings. I would like to begin this analysis by starting with public hospitals. It is our public hospitals that are the pressure point, the crisis point in our health care system today. Before the last election, the coalition made a number of undertakings on public hospitals. They said that they would maintain the federal funding for our public hospitals. The current Treasurer even said that he would provide a guarantee that there would be a net increase in health spending. Those were the promises made before the election-to maintain the spending on public hospitals, federal funding for public hospitals. Since last year's Premiers Conference and federal budget we have seen federal cutbacks in funding for our public hospital systemscutbacks which total $800 million. If you look at the cuts made at the Premiers Conference and in the budget last year you will see that this government cut back federal funding for public hospitals by $800 million. Mr Forrest-That's not right.",33
133,Mr LEE,PAPERS,"The member interjects and says, 'That's not right.' I encourage the honourable member to look at the budget papers and the outcome of last year's Premiers Conference. The member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) might not know it but the government of which he is a member cut back federal funding for the states by a massive proportion. It was agreed by the states and the federal government at last year's Premiers Conference to cut over a billion and a half dollars. If you look at the current proportion of state spending that goes to public hospitals, you will see that the Premiers Conference cost the public hospital system at least $500 million. They lost $500 million at the Premiers Conference and another $280 million in the budget, which the honourable member for Mallee supported. The budget that came down cut back $280 million in addition to the $500 million that was cut in federal funding for state public hospitals-a total of $800 million that is there is black and white for every member of this House to read. I would encourage the member for Mallee, when his local public hospitals tell him that they are under pressure, to ring up Dr Wooldridge, ring up the minister for health. When people are waiting too long to be treated as public patients in your hospitals, ring the minister for health and ask him why he cut back federal funding for public hospitals. You tell your constituents why you voted for that budget which cut back federal funding for your own public hospitals. We all know it is the public hospitals that are under pressure today. It is the public hospitals that are in need. Federal cutbacks in public hospitals are causing patients to wait too long to be treated as public patients. It is those cutbacks in federal funding that are causing people to wait too long in casualty. People are waiting too long to be admitted into beds in our public hospital system because there is inadequate federal funding for our public hospital system. The hypocrisy I cannot stand is when a minister goes on the Sunday program last Sunday and says: In fact, over the last five years, the Commonwealth has put nearly a quarter more than it was putting into public hospitals. This hypocrisy continues. The minister goes on to say: The Commonwealth has got a pretty good record over the last five years of supporting and putting extra resources into public hospitals. All of that is true, but what I find hypocritical is that the four years of growth in federal funding for public hospitals came from the former federal Labor government-the former federal Labor ministers for health. And who is the one minister for health who has overseen a reduction in the federal funding for public hospitals? This man over here, the federal minister for health. He has made a reduction in federal funding for our public hospital system. I really do think it is the utmost hypocrisy for this minister to say: The Commonwealth has got a pretty good record over the last five years of supporting and putting in extra resources into public hospitals. Minister, you took out resources from public hospitals, yet you go on the Sunday program and try to claim some credit for the fact that your Labor predecessors were able to convince their cabinets that extra money should go into the public hospital system. That is what we consider hypocrisy. He also went on to attack some of the states as a whole. He was not prepared to attack Jeff Kennett and his own state in particular, but I will get on to that in a minute. He said that the states have 'pulled out about a billion dollars over five years'. I happen to agree with the minister that some of the states, almost exclusively coalition state governfriend, ments, have cut back state effort for public hospitals, and that is something that should changed. That is why we welcome the fact that in New South Wales Andrew Refshauge has increased that state's funding for public hospitals by $600 million over the last few years. I would like to see them put in even more. The minister has the hypocrisy to attack states for pulling out a billion dollars over the last five years when this minister has himself taken out $800 million from federal funding for public hospitals. Minister, don't you think it is a bit galling for you to preside over reductions of that order and then take some pot shots at your state colleagues for also reducing government expenditure on public hospitals by a similar amount? What we find even worse is that before the election, this minister made a guarantee to the people of Australia. He said that they were going to come up with a new you-beaut solution to every problem in our health care system, and it was called a tax break for private health insurance. Sure, it was going to cost $1.5 billion but he would make sure that there were no cutbacks in public spending to pay for this new incentive for private health insurance. He promised there would be no cutbacks in funding for public hospitals to fund the private health insurance initiative. What we find galling is that when you look at the cuts that were made last year, they have done exactly that: an $800 million cut in federal funding for public hospitals, a $400 million reduction in the Commonwealth dental health program, and a $500 million reduction in Commonwealth assistance for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. When you add those three together-your cutbacks in federal funding for public hospitals, the Commonwealth dental health program and the PBS-you made reductions that total $1.7 billion. That just happened to balance the very tax break that this minister is prepared to pay the private health insurance industry. The problem that the minister has is that everyone is walking away from this government's centrepiece of its health policy. We even get the minister's close personal Jeff Kennett, saying that this private health insurance initiative is money down the be drain. We get the AMA saying that this initiative is poorly targeted. We get the government's own inquiry saying that the government is spending $560 million a year to save only $240 million. They spend $560 million to save only $240 million. So when Jeff Kennett, the AMA, and your own inquiry the all say that the centrepiece of your health policy is a failure, why aren't you prepared to look afresh at your measure? Why is there so much arrogance in your administration that you are not prepared to admit the fact that the $1.7 billion private health insurance initiative is a failure? Everyone else acknowledges it is a failure. The argument that they put to us before the election was that this tax break would lower the cost of private health insurance and in some way that would increase the number of Australians with private health insurance and, therefore, reduce the pressure on our public hospitals. But what have we seen in the last 12 months? We have seen increased premiums and dramatic increases in the cost of private health insurance. Those increases have swallowed up most of the benefit of the tax rebate and, even before the rebate starts to paid, we have got 800 people a day leaving private health insurance. We have got people leaving private health insurance because of these changes. And if the minister will not listen to us-and you will not listen to Jeff Kennett and you will not listen to the AMA, and you will not listen to your own inquirythen why don't you perhaps listen to your good friends at MBF, who produce this survey on private health insurance every quarter? Because even though the MBF is not considered to be exactly a strong supporter of Medicare and the views that this side of the House advocates, the MBF survey has shown in its latest research that the proportion of current fund members who say they will be encouraged by your tax rebate to maintain their private health insurance has fallen dramatically from 82 per cent to only 57 per cent. In the last year, almost one in three of all insurance. of the current health fund members have reached the conclusion that your policy is a lemon. It is a lemon that obviously is not encouraging people to maintain their private health insurance. Mr Forrest-That's more than you ever did.",34
134,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,The member for Mallee will contain himself.,36
135,Mr LEE,PAPERS,"You are spending $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money to encourage people to take out private health insurance and the people are saying that is not going to make them take it out. It would have been much better for this government to have spent that $1.7 billion directly on public hospitals. Spend it on the electorate of the member for Mallee, on the electorate of the member for ProspectMr Martin Ferguson-Box Hill Hospital.",36
136,Mr LEE,PAPERS,"Or in Box Hill. Why spend $1.7 billion indirectly through the health insurance funds rather than spending it directly on patient care? Everyone else says that would have been a much better way to reduce waiting times and reduce pressure on our health care system. But the only response of this minister-and the only response of this government-is to try to come up with new be ways to prop up their failed health insurance initiative. And the way they are going to come up with it-their new initiative-is to all force middle income families to take out private health insurance. In the last budget, they brought in the Medicare surcharge, allegedly on 'high income' earners who do not have private health insurance. And yet in the secret minute from the minister's own department, which we released on 6 March in the House, we made it clear that this government is currently considering reducing the threshold at which that Medicare levy surcharge bites in. So it starts off as just a surcharge on high income earners to force them to take out private health insurance and, before long, they are looking at ways to lower that income threshold step by step so that eventually we will end up with a system where middle income earners are forced to take out private health With 800 people a day leaving private health insurance, is it any wonder that you have got to come up with sticks like tax penalties to force people to take out private health insurance? But even when you force people to pay a higher Medicare levy and you raise more money through the Medicare levy, what is this minister's response? Does he say that that money should be put into our public hospital system to arrest the problems? Ms Macklin-No, he says it's a tax.",36
137,Mr LEE,PAPERS,"As the honourable member interjecting says, he says, 'The Medicare levy is really nothing to do with health. It is really another way to collect revenue.' It is nothing to do with health. When this minister says that the Medicare levy is just another tax, it is a warning to the middle income earners out there that they are about to pay more, but their local public hospital will not see the proceeds. That is the strategy that this minister and this government are developing to try to overcome these things. So in 12 months, what have we seen? Federal funding for public hospitals cut. Pharmaceutical charges increased. The Commonwealth dental health program abolished. Medicare rebates reduced. The health insurance rebate: it's a lemon. We have had up-front nursing home fees imposed. We have had charges for child care increased. Minister, you have a record of administrative failure and policy collapse and it is time for you to go.",36
138,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAPERS,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (3.S9 p.m.)Unfortunately, there was a bit of a give away in the letter from the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) to Mr Speaker today because this urgent matter of public importance is in fact dated 10 October 1996. I thought, 'Maybe this is just a slip of the typewriter.' So I went to Hansard and had a look at what happened on 10 October 1996-it was a sitting day-and, in fact, there was a censure motion on that day from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). The matter of public importance was from the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson)-who has not stayed around: The employment data released today by the ABS indicating that job growth has fallen because government's budget strategy. It is quite clear what has happened here. This was a matter of public importance that was so important it was prepared six months ago. The member for Dobell clearly got rolled by employment data coming out at 11.30 a.m., so the member for Batman snuck in his MPI just before the 12 o'clock deadline-and this MPI has been sitting around since October. In the 12 sitting weeks since October you have not been able to get this MPI up till today when clearly, thrashing around, the strategy committee could not find anything to run a matter of public importance on. So they said, 'Pull out the old one you have had sitting around, Michael.' But he forgot to change the date on the notice. I table that for the information of honourable members. When we came to government let me tell you what I found as health minister. I found the Medicare rebate system, the size of the budget of Western Australia, increasing five per cent real a year. I found radiology completely out of control in terms of costs, with services like ultrasound going up 21 per cent in the previous 12 months. I found a system of pricing radiology that was so absurd it paid exactly the same rebate for someone using a CT scanner that was IS years old compared with the latest CAT scanner. I found with nuclear medicine that, while the cost was increasing, the previous government had set up a hatchet job, put a consultancy out and the recommendations for that did not recognise that the increase in nuclear medicine was essentially the emergence of a new profession, and had those recommendations that were engineered by the previous government been taken on board it would have destroyed totally the profession of nuclear medicine. We found pathology, in spite of several attempts to reduce outlays, again, out of control. I found psychiatry so loose that one practitioner could see a patient 747 times a year and bill for 747 7S-minute consultations and successive years of attempting to negotiate with the College of Psychiatrists had been absolutely unfruitful. We had assistance at of the operations provided whether or not there was any requirement for that assistance. We had skin lesions increasing as a proportion of items. Again, there was strong anecdotal evidence from the medical profession that there were rorts in that area. That is what we inherited. In terms of doctor numbers, we had very clear indication on that from two former Labor health ministers: Graham Richardson, who said that he told the AMA in 1993 that unhindered increase in doctor numbers was unsustainable; and Brian Howe, who also said that to do something about doctor numbers would destroy Medicare. What was done? On the issue of numbers, nothing. On the issue of overseas trained doctors, there were several attempts over a decade to do something all of which were totally ineffective. In an area like public health we had Australia ranking third worse in the Western world for completed childhood immunisation, something that has been confirmed as late as the September quarter last year. We had diabetes, in spite of numerous reports-the most recent being the rise and rise of diabetes-and something which is responsible for a very large proportion of Australia's health care costs, completely neglected. It was not one of the country's major health priorities. We had hepatitis C, about which there has been substantial publicity in recent days, completely ignored. In an area like Aboriginal health we had a complete lack of coordination between Commonwealth, state and territory governments. We had over 200 communities that had no access to health services whatsoever. With the greatest single threat facing Aboriginal people, that of HIV-AIDS, in spite of being 13 years into the epidemic we had no coordinated response whatsoever. We had cost shifting that was out of control, costing the Commonwealth somewhere in the vicinity of $300 million per year. We had bleats from previous health ministers about how awful it was but we had no effective action whatsoever. We had a system of public hospitals whereby the Commonwealth had put in more money in the last Medicare agreement and had no capacity whatsoever to have any control over the states just taking the money out. The then government knew this. The Leader of the Opposition when Minister for Finance walked around the country, wailed and bleated and said how awful it was, but what have they done? Nothing. The situation the public hospitals are in today is as a result of that inactivity. In rural health, we have a further decline in doctor numbers in rural areas. There was no particular training focus meeting the needs of trying to get people out into rural areas. Of course we had private health insurance, an 'area about which a former Labor minister, Graham Richardson, said during the election campaign: Unfortunately, again, Labor aren't recognising the big problem. It is still a huge problem, by the that people are deserting private health insurance at the rate they are, a much faster rate than anyone in the Government's been predicting and it just goes on and on. On the issue of a surcharge for high income earners, Graham Richardson had this to say after the budget in August last year: ... when I leftthe Labor Partyas the Labor Party had always been a bit biased against private health insurance ... That really sums up everything that has happened over the last six months on that score. He then goes on to say: One idea I had which had no chance of ever being accepted by my caucus or cabinet colleagues was to charge an increased Medicare levy for highincome earners who refused to take out private insurance. I was never comfortable with the thought of wealthy people elbowing battlers out of queues in public hospitals. Spot on, Graham Richardson. Neither am I. When we were looking to the future, to the things that offer us some prospect of making our health system sustainable in the medium term, what did we have? Coordinated care had completely stalled with the medical profession up in arms and we were facing a new Medicare agreement when the last two Medicare agreements under the previous Labor government had instituted no substantial reform whatsoever but had merely been saying, 'Let's keep the system going and put a bit of extra money in it.' If there is a reason why we are in the situation we are in today, it is a combination of those issues. The shadow minister talks about keeping promises. He is on fairly hollow ground here. He should have a look at his own party's 1993 health policy document. I will read out a few things from that health policy document. In fact, I can find 12 broken promises here, and that is just on pages 4 and 5. First, they promised new initiatives in the private sector-$100 million over four years. What happened? They spent $13 million. Second, private hospitals would be included in the health services regional planning agreements. It was not done. Third, the aged care industry review would examine the way, adequacy of nursing staff to meet the increasing dependency of those living in hostels. Well, you had three reports-Gregory, Keys and Macri-and not one of them looked at it. Fourth, the national rural health program would focus on expanding the rural health centres initiative and developing rural health plans. When we came to government three years later, there was nothing to find. Fifth was access to Medicare rebates for bone densimetry for women at risk of developing osteoporosis. It never happened. Sixth was the establishment of a national health promotion authority. It never happened. Seventh, legislative reform to the National Health Act would ensure Australia's commitment to the promotion of public health. It never happened. Eighth was the provision of language services in public hospitals. In spite of the fact the Commonwealth does not fund public hospitals directly, it was a promise you could not keep and it was a promise that did not happen. Ninth was the establishment of a national advisory council on ethnic health. It never happened. Tenth was the continuation of the national health strategy. The member for Jagajaga, who is in charge of that, knows that was axed immediately after the 1993 election. Eleventh was the development of a national primary health care policy. It never happened. Twelfth was a national environmental health strategy. It never happened. That is from only two pages of your 1993 health policy document. Of the issues of substance that the shadow minister raised, I will talk about hospitals about private health insurance incentives. The shadow minister claims that somehow the Commonwealth has reduced funding for hospitals by $800 million. Yet of that, he calculates $500 million as being one-third of the $1.5 billion the states offered to give the Commonwealth to help with the budget black hole that we were left. It does not follow logically in any sense that because the states offered to make a contribution to help the Commonwealth's deficit a cent of that money will come out of hospitals. In fact, looking at total health expenditure by states on hospitais in 1995-96 and then in the following year 1996-97, our indications are that the expenditure will almost certainly go up. You are saying that $500 million is being cut out, when states are spending more money. It does not follow. It is illogical. It does not stand up. It simply is not sustainable. In terms of saying that we have actually cut money from hospitals, this year we are spending $67.2 million more than we did last year-an increase of 1.4 per cent which, given the low rate of inflation, will probably tum out to be a real increase, far from the reduction of $800 million that you are accusing us of. In terms of private health insurance, the shadow minister makes a number of assertions. The best way I can respond to that is to look at the Labor Party's 1996 policy document entitled Leadership. The page entitled 'The family health rebate' states: For families. Family private health insurance premiums. How does the rebate work? There is a flat rebate of $350 for the cost of private health insurance. Then, in the indications that are given here of an eligible family we see: Mario and Sue have three children and receive family payments. They are eligible for the Family Health Rebate of $500 a year. The family has private insurance hospital cover. Under the Family Health Rebate the family would receive $350 towards their health insurance. What absolute cant and hypocrisy! Mr Lee- Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I and raise a point of order. My point of order is that the minister is misleading the House by not quoting the article correctly.",37
139,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,Mr Nehl}-You know better than that. Mr Lee-Why does he not finish the quote?,39
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,"You will withdraw or follow that point in a substantive motion. Do you withdraw? Mr Lee-My understanding is that if someone alleges that the minister has deliberately misled the House then it is appropriate to withdraw, not mislead. But I will follow your guidance.",39
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,"I take the point you make and, yes, you did not say 'deliberately' .",40
142,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAPERS,"He does not like it, but what hypocrisy, to offer rebates yourself in an election 12 months ago and then criticise the government for doing it today. What we are doing is keeping our promise. Given your 1993 health policy and the 12 broken promises on two pages, I can understand your unease. The shadow minister makes much of 800 people a day leaving private health insurance. Yes, I am concerned about that. But what he did not say is how many were leaving prior to 1996-about 1,300 to 1,400 a day. So, in fact, the rate of decrease has halved over the last two quarters as people are waiting for the private health rebates to come in. That is important because there is a very large number of Australians, probably over 700,000, who have incomes under $20,000 a year and who have private health cover. What were you offering them? Nothing at the last election. Nothing, because they didn't fit your demographics of the voters you wanted to attract with your private health insurance bribes that you are now criticising us for trying to implement. But these rebates are fair because they cover a much higher proportion of the population. In the end, what we have had from the opposition is nothing about the future for health, nothing about how we will meet the needs of an ageing population, nothing about how we will introduce new technology and nothing about how we will make Medicare sustainable in the long term. What we have had an is litany of whinges, a litany of half truths, a litany of assertions that are completemuch ly unsustainable by an opposition who thinks they can criticise and not have people remember what their record was for 13 years of government. As far as I am concerned, they can go on as long as they like. (Time expired)",40
143,Mr LEO MCLEAY,PAPERS,"-We have just heard a mealy-mouthed response from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) which will not do anything to disguise the fact that, as a member of the federal cabinet, he has been an absolute failure in his attempt to do a job for the Australian health industry. Once again, he has been a doormat for the Treasurer (Mr Costello). He has shown that he was unable to win the battle in the budget last year, and he is now off to sign a health agreement with Ireland. I hope he does not gyp the Irish in the same way that he has gypped the Australian public with what he has done here with health care. Today, being the day after St Patrick's day, would probably be the day he would decide to do that. That is just what this government is like. It does not matter what promise they make, you can rely upon them to break it. In the last election campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave very specific promises about health. In fact, the Prime Minister's polling told him that one of the most important issues to Australians was Medicare. So he went out there and made all these weasel speeches about how he believed in Medicare; he thought Medicare should stay. In February 1996, he said that 'health benefits will not be cut; health spending will be boosted in net terms under coalition health package reforms'. That is what he said before the election, and the people believed him. But what happened after the election? The 1996 budget marked the beginning of the end for the universal health care system in Australia, a system which has served the needs of Australians very well. The 1996 budget saw a net cut of $1.7 billion over four years to the health budget. So much for the Prime Minister's promise to maintain health benefits. I wonder where would we be if he had said that he was going to cut them; where would we be then? So much for his honesty and so for the honesty of the Minister for Health and Family Services. As I said earlier, it has become obvious that the minister is just a doormat and a stand-up for the Treasurer to knock down every time something comes along. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, in the bush that you represent in this Parliament it has always been a matter of pride for Australians in the country and the city that we have access to high levels of health care in public hospitals. I have heard members from the National Party come in here whingeing year after year about how terrible it is that there is not enough help for public hospitals. I have not heard any of them whingeing about what this Minister for Health and Family Services has done-and what he has done to public hospitals has been something terrible. Over the next four years $800 million will be cut from hospital budgets by this government. And the National Party just sits there and says, 'Well, that's all right, we probably did it ourselves, it's not really our fault.' truth is that it is your fault, and you should be sticking up for the people of your electorates. But you do not. In the last budget we also saw the government make a massive attack on pensioners and their health. The government has made cuts to schemes such as the Commonwealth dental program, which the Labor government introduced. We heard National Party members tell us in this House year after year that that was a good scheme; in fact, I think Mr Deputy Speaker. I recall you saying that. But what has happened to that now? After 1 January this year that has gone, as has gone the dental health of older Australians and the unemployed and people on health care cards. Before this scheme was brought in, the statistics of the Labor government supported the fact that the only access most people who were pensioners or on health care cards had to dental health was, in the main, to get their teeth out. In fact, that group of people had 87 per cent more extractions than any other part of the community. What has happened now? They are back to having to have their teeth out. Michael Wooldridge has put the bite on the budget and they have lost the bite out of their mouth. That is what has happened under this government. The trouble is that none of these people even care. The government's cruel abolition of the dental health care scheme means that tens of thousands of pensioners and the unemployed will be forced back to having to have their teeth extracted rather than having fillings because they cannot afford them. Abolishing that program will seriously disadvantage many thousands of Australians just because they are poor. That is the only reason they are going to be disadvantaged-because they are poor. Of course, that does not matter to John Howard and Michael Wooldridge because they have won the election. The big con worked, and now it is whip into the health system. When we were in government, we decided that we should do something for hearing services. But what has the current government done about that? By introducing the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997 and the The Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill 1997, the current government will be denying many Australians the right to hear properly, for a paltry saving of $1 million-and it calls that a reform. This legislation will cut off 19to 21-year-olds from access to Australian Hearing Services, and it will cut off about 30,000 seniors card holders from Australian Hearing Services. Thirty thousand people will no longer have access to the hearing service, for the saving of a lousy $1 million. So much for the Prime Minister's promise to pensioners of Australia that he would not be removing any entitlements that they had. It is another broken promise to those people who are seniors or health care card holders. The cuts to hearing services are not fair. They are not fair to people with hearing losses, and they are not fair particularly to young Australians who have hearing loss because poor young Australians who can no longer afford to have these services will find that their chance of obtaining skills, work and a reasonable life, like their friends and relations, will be put at risk. Why? So that the Prime Minister and Dr Wooldridge can save a lousy million dollars. Another measure introduced in the budget which will have an increasing impact on Australians was the government's decision to cap bulk-billing payments made to doctors. It does not take an accountant to figure out that, as doctors' costs go up, pressure will increase on them to stop bulk-billing patients. Low income earners especially will be hit by this measure, but they will not be the only ones. Many ordinary Australians know the cost involved in taking a number of children to the doctor over winter when they are suffering with coughs and colds, and they will not be able to afford to do that any more if doctors do away with bulk-billing. Today in this House we saw the minister's response to a dorothy dixer about what to do with doctor provider numbers. I would have thought we might have heard from the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) on that today, because he has always been very keen on quoting Dr Birrell in here. In fact, he was so keen on it he never mentioned that he was quoting from one of Dr Birrell's speeches, until the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) reminded him of it. Mr Fitzgibbon-Has he got a provider number? Mr LEO MCLEA Y-He has a provider number, as has the Minister for Health and Family Services. The Minister for Health and Family Services had the hide to say in here today that there is no more certainty for people having permanent' incomes, and the government is not going to do that. When are they going to hand in their provider numbers? When are they going to do that? If they do not believe that ordinary young doctors should be able to get provider numbers, when is it going to be good enough for them to hand their's back. But, once again, we hear the minister falling back on his mealymouthed response when he says, 'Of course, I could give my provider number back in, but then the law let's me reapply for it.' Well, change the law. They are the government: change the law. Better still, the minister and the member for Bradfield could stand up in this House and give an undertaking that they will not use their provider numbers. Have they done that? Of course not. They want to stop young doctors from having a career, but it is all right for them to keep their provider numbers. They will keep themselves on the gravy train, yet they say that everyone else wants to get on it and that that is shocking. If the member for Bradfield had been keen on mentioning what Dr Birrell said some time ago, he might have reminded the government-if they had let him into this debate, which they are not game to-that restricting the number of young doctors who can get into the Medicare provider scheme will put pressure on doctors and there will be fewer and fewer doctors going to the bush. What do we hear from the National Party about that? A member from the National Party is going to speak next in this debate. I want to hear what he has to say about that. Will he say something about the lack of young doctors in the country because of what this government has done? We will not hear a word from him about that. We will hear nothing-nothing. They are part of the problem; they are not the solution. They are like the minister. The minister gets run over by the Treasurer, and the National Party gets run over when the truck hits them on the way through. What this government has done to Medicare is disgraceful. I draw the minister's attention to the Canberra Times. He said this was not a timely or an important thing to say. This is what the Canberra Times said in its editorial today: The decision not to channel funds from the higher Medicare levy into health care is entirely consistent with the Coalition's historical attitude. The Government has no desire to see the public system thrive. It wants people to be privately insured, and if it cannot bribe them with rebates or threaten them with levies it will at least make sure that the public system stays poor. That is the government's policy: keep the public system poor, ensure that the poor do not get a fair go in this community, and look after their mates. They will spend $560 million saving $240 million for people on private health insurance. If that is the way they want to run the economy, it frightens the life out of all of us. This minister is a fraud. He will not stand up for himself. He will not stand up for his department. He will not stand up for the health industry. He will not stand up for the poor. He is just a sell-out.",40
144,Mr FORREST,PAPERS,"It is quite clear that the Labor Party has never understood the problems confronting an electorate like mine. I have been challenged to make a contribution. I have had a lot to say in the formulation of the policy that this government has adopted to address the very issues that confront my 23 hospitals. I am the member in this parliament who has the largest number of private hospitals of any electorate in Australia. How many private hospitals does the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) have? How many private hospitals does the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) have? Does he have nine? There are nine private hospitals in the electorate of Mallee covering 26 per cent of Victoria. The people in these isolated communities that support their private hospitals know jolly well that, without their private health insurance, they will lose their hospitals-because they cannot accept public patients. The Labor Party has never understood that difficulty. Now for the first time 13 years we have a minister who is prepared to address the real problems confronting the people for Mallee. On a number of occasions the member for Dobell has challenged me over whether or not I support the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). I do, because for the first time in 13 years the very problems confronting the people of Mallee are being addressed. The member for Watson mentioned doctors. Where was the Labor Party for 13 years when my 22 hospitals were struggling to attract Australian doctors? I have been in this parliament for four years. Thirteen of those hospitals have gone through the trauma of trying to attract a doctor in the last 13 years. Of those 13, nine of them had to get foreign doctors because the previous government did not have a comprehensive policy to address those issues. This government does. We are about making it happen. The member for Dobell mentioned hypocrisy. I hope you will forgive me if I stand here with some misgivings about this matter which is considered to be of national importance. The fact that this proposed discussion has been sitting around since October makes a mockery of that. All of a sudden, because there does not seem to be anything else to attract the attentions of the Labor Party, they want to raise this issue. Where were you for 13 years? Where were you then addressing the needs of the people of rural Australia? Do not stand up here and challenge members of the National Party. We are now participating in two things. One is trying to address the nation's problem with its deficit. That is difficult enough. That is the Australian Labor Party left behind. The second is trying to create good social policy to address the needs of rural people. The Labor Party has never understood that. This government does, and I am delighted to have an opportunity to support the minister. He really does not need to be defended against this matter, because it lacks integrity as it appears on the program of business today. The member for Dobell must not be able to add up. Budget paper No. 1 shows an increase in the 1996-97 budget allocation through the in Medicare agreements of $4.97 billion. That is an increase of $67 million. So how could you possibly raise for discussion cuts in funding to hospitals? Medicare raises about $3.6 billion. The balance comes from consolidated revenue. If there is any misallocation here, as I have said, it is simply an allegation. It does not apply to the current government; it applies to the previous government. The sooner you stop being transparent about this issue and accept some responsibility for the damage that you have done to this nation over 13 years, the sooner you will get a lot more credibility from the people you are now trying to appeal to in my electorate. They see through your transparency with this bleating about private health insurance. Albeit it is not much of a rebate, it is something, and it has arrested their departure from private health insurance. Why doesn't the shadow minister spend some time talking to the people in Charlton, in Rainbow, in Sea Lake and in Birchip; people who support, through their own contributions, the establishment of bush nursing hospitals? They are private hospitals owned by the community. I have in my electorate eight bush nursing hospitals and one separate shareholder owned private hospital in Mildura-the largest number of private hospitals in Australia. That recognises the importance that people in my electorate place on private health insurance, because it is a 2'12 hour drive, a two-hour option, to go in an ambulance to some provincial centre. So do not try to preach to the people in my electorate about actions that this government is taking to preserve the integrity legacy the of private health insurance. If you look at the figures, in 198363.7 per cent of the Australian population participated in private health insurance. Who came to government in 1983? I ask that question and that is the question they ask. The latest figures in June 1996 show that only 33.6 per cent of people participate in private health insurance. That is a big decline while the Australian Labor Party presided over the public policy that directed this issue. The very serious matter that this raises for my people, who are an ageing population, is that only 29 per cent of the Australian population under 65 years of age participate in private health insurance. That means that the proportion above 65 is higher-well above 40 per cent. That reflects the nature of the people in my electorate. Burning in my ears from 4 o'clock yesterday were the words of a constituent who came into my office and said, 'Please do what you cari to preserve the integrity of private health insurance.' Something the Labor Party has never really understood is that private health insurance is a vital part of the provision of health care in this country. Even Richardson said that if private health insurance dropped below 40 per cent that would put unbelievable pressure on the Medicare system. We are now talking about a participation rate of 33 per cent. That is why there are waiting queues in public hospitals in the big cities. We have now got a generation of people below the age of 30 who say to me, 'Why do I need private health insurance?' Even my own staff said that in a discussion a few hours ago. My family is like any other family in Australia. Every time. I get my health insurance bill for $2,500, I have to have a discussion with my wife. But we have maintained our private health insurance because we live in a rural environment and it is going to be very difficult for us to get the doctor of our choice if we have to consider an ambulance drive to a larger provincial centre. So do not preach to members of the National Party about the government's approach on this. It is being addressed. It may not yet be perfect, but we are looking to build on our current policy and to make sure that we provide to all Australians a broad based health care system that is fair and equitable. Let us have no more of this bleating from the Australian Labor Party, who lack credibility after 13 years of policy neglect.",42

147,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"WentworthParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (4.35 p.m.)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (1997) Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (1997), which I have just tabled, contains an alteration to schedule 1 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. This change will operate on and from 10 March 1997. It accords developing country preference under the Australian system of tariff preferences-ASTP-to the newly created Territories administered by the Palestinian Authority. I might add that the authority welcomes Australia's action. Honourable members will be aware of the Middle East peace process started at Madrid in October 1991 and the Oslo declaration of principles whereby Israel is transferring to the Palestinian Council powers and responsibility for certain areas formerly administered by the Israeli military government. The Australian government fully supports the peace process and the implementation of these agreements. Many Palestinians living on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip are suffering economic hardship and experiencing a serious fall in their living standards. High unemployment is a major problem for them. The extension of the ASTP concessions to the Palestinian Territories will assist the economy to transform itself from one dependent on exporting labour to one exporting products made in newly established industrial enterprises. It will also enhance bilateral trade with Australia. The Palestinian authorities have already indicated their interest in purchasing wheat and live sheep from Australia. The cost of this change will be minimal. The inclusion of the territories administered by the Palestinian authority has no implications for the government's position on the outcome of the final status negotiations between the parties involved in the Middle East dispute. A summary of the alteration contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Brereton) adjourned. NA BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 March, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time.",44
148,Mr RICHARD EVANS,CORPORA TIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As you realise, this is a nice speech that needs to be continued. Doing business is tough in Australia. The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, the member for Forrest, Mr Geoff Prosser, said in the latter stages of last year: Labor has no credibility on small business issues. Nor should they, for they have no experience when it comes to business. It is not their fault; it is just that when they take risks they would prefer to take risks with other people's money-other people's money being of course the taxpayers' money. We know about the Labor Party's misuse of public funds during their period of office, but that is really another debate for another time. Life was tough for business under the Labor Party government. Under Labor, bankruptcies were at a record level of more than 14,000 in 1994-95. Under Labor, businesses struggled under the weight of compliance imposts. The Labor government imposed on them the fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax, the superannuation guarantee levy and the failed training levy, which is doing nothing to reduce the cost of compliance. Labor raised the provisional tax uplift factor. Of course the Labor government did not cause all the resulting problems associated with this, but they contributed heavily to many of the social issues we are now faced with. The Labor Party put everything on the bankcard, on the cuff. Because they put it on the cuff, Australia almost lost its shirt. This includes the shocking figures for youth unemployment. Youth unemployment accounts for almost 45 per cent of the total unemployed and in Cowan it is an unacceptable 27 per cent. It is a terrible statistic that requires the whole community to support solutions. Mr Deputy Speaker, you are no doubt aware of the government's utmost desire to fix the terrible problems of Labor's legacy. This includes giving small businesses, which are the backbone of the nation's economy, the chance to grow and profit. Business is such a major factor of our society that, when it suffers, we all suffer. Having worked in a wide range of occupations myself, I have come to realise the importance of small business. Small businesses are often the ones affected by spiralling debts. The Western Australian Small Business Development Corporation was able to provide me with figures relating to bankruptcy in Western Australia which brought to light an interesting point. In our state, the lack of business ability has overtaken economic conditions as the No. 1 cause of business related bankruptcy in Western Australia. Economic conditions are still the major cause overall in Australia, at 26.4 per cent. Of the 275 Western Australian business related bankruptcies reported during the 1995-96 financial year, one-quarter were attributed to poor business skills. In some ways, it is encouraging to know that government policy is not the major-nor the sole-offender, although it is on a national level. Yet, it is still a very disturbing fact that people continue to move into business without adequate training or a sound knowledge of precisely what they are getting into. Inappropriate business decisions can be made, leaving the way open for more problematic factors to feature, such as the accumulation of debts. Other significant causes relating to bankruptcy in Western Australia were economic conditions, at 22 per cent, and lack of capital, at 20 per cent. In 1995-96, bankruptcies directly caused by business activity accounted for approximately 15 per cent of all Western Australian bankruptcies and 27.5 per cent of all Australian bankruptcies. Out of all the states and territordecade; ies, Western Australia was one of only three to experience a decrease in business related bankruptcies. Furthermore, Western Australia had the second highest fall after the Northern Territory. It should be noted that a business related bankruptcy does not necessarily equate to an actual business closure. Even though Western Australia's level of bankruptcies has been increasing since 1994-95, this is due to an increase in non-business bankruptcies. Obviously, it is apparent that a bankruptcy does not necessarily have to follow liquidation. A business or a company can signify many different things and bankruptcy or liquidation are just two stages of this. I believe the world of the small businessperson is about to enter a new positive phase under this government, with various initiatives either already in place or not far around the comer which will make the life of the small businessperson much easier. The government's small business initiatives include reducing the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent, cutting red tape, delivering capital gains rollover relief, moving to scrap Labor's unfair dismissal laws and arresting the slide of budget deficits. All these will provide a small business with the certainty and support it needs. This positive feeling does seem to be supported not only by government initiatives but also by various studies published by the Western Australian Small Business Development Corporation. According to this organisation, using statistics from the ABS, over the last decade the number of small businesses in Western Australia has increased at an average annual rate of 4.8 per cent, the highest annual growth rate of all states and territories. The corporation also published results of a small business opinion survey, which found that: Even after a year of low profit levels and variable trading conditions, small business is anticipating increased sales and prices jn 1997 to boost profits. An example of the renewed vigour in small business was recently brought to my attention by a company in my electorate which has become a virtual runaway success. Business has been tough for this business over the last however, it is now reaching levels of productivity which it has not seen before. This business makes quality, very large and very expensive signs. That would seem fairly trivial, but these signs are quite spectacular. I saw a recent example of this when I stopped to view their latest project, the distinctive world sphere sign that sits on the top of Planet Hollywood restaurants in Australia and in Asia. This particular sign has a six-metre sphere and 2.4-metre-high lettering. The sign is destined for the Planet Hollywood in Melbourne, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, so when you visit that august place of eating you will be able to see it. It was actually made in Western Australia. This company has already made signs for restaurants in Sydney, Singapore and Bangkok and is looking at doing some more on the Gold Coast, in Auckland and in Guam. Perhaps to my eastern states colleagues this may not seem terribly remarkable. But to a Western Australian this signifies a great achievement: that a local company is able to compete not only in the national marketplace but also in the international marketplace. This is in consideration of the fact that in many senses we have a few natural disadvantages in Western Australia that can often stand in the way of competitiveness. The eastern seaboard does not need to consider such factors as the isolation and distance factors. rw.s --l-ti vely small company, called Si8Jl»iJ#'-on. is ,able to employ up to 50 l-""-p'letQcarry out its operation, which o,-YlQ\l-l.fhjiS ad--tages for the economy. .' A1tftougq. there is every indication that business iWiU continue to dowell, it is not the only busil1ess that is doing well within Western Australia. Small business is obviously very important to Western Australia. It is very important for Australia. Business will still be tough to do in Australia, but it will be much easier under the coalition's policy and initiatives than it was in Australia under the Labor Party. This bill is supported by all those that have an interest in any of the matters associated with the bill. It has no financial impact on the government. It is a bill which will help business and I commend it to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCClelland) adjourned. NA Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee",45

I want to thank all involved in the seminars, in particular the chair of the subcommittee, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nuthis gent); Sir Ronald Wilson, the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission; Mr Chris Sidoti, the Human Rights Commissioner; the senior adviser to him, Mr Kieren Fitzpatrick; as well as the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Ms Philippa Smith-all of whom gave their time to attend and to inform the committee about their work. I would also like to thank the staff of the joint standing committee, in particular Margaret Swieringa and the staff of the human rights subcommittee who organised this very successful seminar program and drafted the report. The report itself embraces some five resolutions and I want to address those briefly. The first two essentially are matters that I am delighted to be able to report to the House, in part because my wife, through the work she has undertaken with the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and NegReport lect, NAPCAN, has been advocating these measures for some considerable time. The first recommendation was that the Australian government should introduce legislation to incorporate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into domestic laws. Members will be aware of the Teoh case and of the implications of that. While this is not an alternative, it certainly appears to us to be essential that, having subscribed to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, we should now adopt it into domestic law. The repetition of events such as those that occurred in the Teoh case should not then recur. The second recommendation suggested that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) investigate the feasibility of establishing a children's commissioner within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That and the last resolution, which is within the Office of the Ombudsman, both identify particular problems that emerged from the seminar. There should be a children's commissioner. I think most members of this House would concur. There have been far too many cases of child abuse and far too many cases of sexual abuse; far too many cases where children have been the victims. The ways by which they can best be represented are matters not just of state jurisdiction but I think very much matters for the federal parliament and I very strongly recommend to the government that they take up that second recommendation of this seminar's report. The next three recommendations relate to the Office of the Ombudsman. I have little doubt that my colleague the honourable  his concerns with respect to item 3, so I will pass that by. But one of my concerns about the Ombudsman has always been that an Ombudsman should never replace the work undertaken by senators and members of this place. I have always felt that people who go to the Ombudsman should recognise the work that is undertaken by federal members, and in many instances that work could obviate the work that otherwise goes to the Ombudsman. We do have a responsibility to our constituents and I think people need to recognise that. I want to identify recommendations 4 and 5 very briefly. We think a parliamentary review of the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman needs to be done to look at the resources of the office to make sure it is adequate for the purpose. The fifth recommendation is that we think there are particular problems for indigenous Australians. We do not think that the Ombudsman's office is adequately equipped to pursue those problems at the moment. We think there does need to be, therefore, a specific person in the office of the Ombudsman to fulfil that function. We have suggested that an indigenous Australian should be appointed to the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to ensure that they can undertake within the Ombudsman's office that task. In saying that, I also hope that individual member's offices employ indigenous people, because that too provides another vehicle by which you can relieve these obvious difficulties that occur so often at a time when we are aware of too many racist problems and when there are quite real difficulties in many parts of Australia. Both HREOC and the Ombudsman have confronted racism. They see it as a significant issue. Therefore, I think it needs to be pursued. There is no doubt that, if we take note of that recommendation with respect to the staff of the Ombudsman, it would fill the notable gap. I therefore commend this report to the parliament and suggest to members and to the government that these five recommendations are matters of which they should take serious note. Consideration interrupted. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Superannuation",47
151,Mr COSTELLO,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence to add to an answer that you in fact asked me in question time today. I will not detain the House long.",48
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,Mr Jenkins)The Treasurer may proceed.,48
153,Mr COSTELLO,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"You asked me about the inclusion of eligible termination payments in assessable income for the purposes of the superannuation surcharge. My press release of 5 February 1996 dealt with that and, if I had had it with me then, I would have read it out. I will now read out the relevant part-that dealing with golden handshakes. It said: It should be noted that this definition would not include bona fide redundancy and approved early retirement payments to the extent to which they are within the income tax exemption levels. From 1 July 1994, bona fide redundancy and approved early retirement payments have been exempt from income tax up to a limit which is indexed annually to average weekly ordinary time earnings. For the 1996-97 year the income tax exemption limits are $4,348 plus $2,174 per year of completed service with the employer. NA Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Consideration resumed.  leave-It is always a pleasure to welcome the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), especially in his capacity as Chatrman of the Joint Standing Committee on FdreignrAffairs, Defence and Trade. Like bitn,! wish 'to commend the chairman of the human rights subcommittee, in particular for continuing to maintain an Australian as well as an international focus on human rights. There is no doubt that the two officers who were part of this seminar-that is, the Human Rights and Equal Community Commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman-form a very important part of the Australian fabric of human rights. I think it is worth noting that Sir Ronald Wilson now completes his sevenyear term as chairman of the human rights co-mission. This has followed a very distingUIshed career on the High Court. I often think it would be nice if we as a parliament were able to acknowledge the contribution of outstanding Australians. I certainly believe that he falls into that category. I support with the same vigour the first two r-commendations of this report but, as the nght honourable member for New England says, I do have a particular interest in the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. It was very clear when the acting chairman, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), had the Ombudsman before him that indeed ordinary Australians are suffering as a result of cutbacks to the office. I note that in the last .couple of weeks of the last sittings of parlIament we put through legislation to establish the Auditor-General as an independent officer of the parliament. It is really important that the consideration that has been extended to the Auditor-General be extended to the Ombudsman's office. We must understand that every time we restrict the budget of the Ombudsman, as we did in the last budget, we effectively limit ordinary Australians' ability to contest administrative decisions on a no-fee basis. We also avoid the opportunity for the Ombudsman to scrutinise administration rather than just deal with individual cases and to make recommendaReport tions to departments to fix systematic errors of administration. So those changes benefit a whole range of ordinary Australians. It is also important to note that a group of people who are victims of a lack of jurisdiction of the Ombudsman are small business people. They do not have an ability to actually take their cases to the Ombudsman because much of Commonwealth work is' now being outsourced-but I do not want to enter into that debate. The Ombudsman has detailed in successive reports the impact this is having on small business. I sincerely hope that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will expedite the legislation that will fix this want of jurisdiction. As I understand it it is neither disagreed with nor controversial. V(e recommend there be a parliamentary reVIew of the Ombudsman's office. I sincerely hope that we will have that opportunity. It does not necessarily have to be conducted by the !oint Standing Committee on Foreign AffaIrs, Defence and Trade Committee. I sincerely believe that, if we fail to do that we will be letting down the people of Austr-lia. Last but not least I would like to concur with the right honourable member ·for New England that there is no better person than a dedicated member of parliament across a problem capable of providing solutions to ordinary people. I think no matter how good or how effective an Ombudsman's office is it will never replace the role of members of parliament. Regrettably, from time to time the executive constricts the ability of members of parliament to seek redress on behalf of their constituents. I think that is something to be regretted. I commend the report to the House. I used to claim that I as chairman of the committee was far more productive than the previous chairman. I thank the right honourable member for New England for not claiming that but, demonstrably, a lot of work and reports are being done. The chairman of the human rights subcommittee and the chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee can take great comfort in the number of reports-they are certainly worthwhile-they are delivering to the parliament. I am not sure that the other two subcommittees are working as effectively yet. I thank the staff for their assistance in preparation of the report.",48
154,Mr NUGENT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As chair of the human rights subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak briefly. There are a number a points that I would like to make in respect of the report entitled The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman: report on public seminars 20 and 25 September 1996. Firstly, I will comment very briefly on the matters concerning the Ombudsman, which the previous speaker, the member for Chifley  The key point to make is that, obviously, we are very keen to see the Ombudsman retain the independence of that office. That is probably the most fundamental matter that our committee is concerned about and, therefore, the recommendations that we have made in this report are very much directed in that sense to making sure that that independence is maintained. In terms of the budgetary constraints, obviously they are difficult. They have been applied in a number of areas where they are equally difficult. Given that the amounts are relatively small, perhaps some review of that cutting back could occur. I would like to speak very briefly about the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and about both Sir Ronald Wilson and Chris Sidoti. I am pleased the previous speaker mentioned Ron Wilson. I would like very much to say a couple of words about Ron Wilson personally. Sir Ronald Wilson is a former High Court judge. He is coming to the end of his term as the head of HREOC. He also was the inaugural Deputy Chair of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation for three years. As a member of that council, I served with Ron for three years-I have now been on for a further three years. I would have to say that Sir Ronald Wilson has been one of the outstanding Australians of our generation, a man of a good age who still regularly commutes from Western Austhe tralia, travels around the world and the country and does not stint himself in the service of his fellow Australians in any shape or form. I think his contribution to this country has been very considerable. I think it is important that we recognise that contribution in this place. Sir Ronald Wilson gave the committee some very harrowing accounts of some of the evidence that was coming forward in his inquiry into the stolen children-the Aboriginal children taken away from their parents. Quite clearly, his report in that area is before the government and we look forward to a positive response from the government to the recommendations of that HREOC report. I think that HREOC report is a very important report because, if you do not understand the significance of the impact on many indigenous people of having been taken away from their parents or having had their children taken away from them, then you do not understand the root cause of many of the problems of disadvantage today. If you do not understand the causes, then you cannot fix the problems that are manifest today. So I think that is a very important report. I would also like to comment very briefly on some of the comments made by Chris Sidoti in the human rights area. Chris Sidoti, apart from the matters that we have explicitly covered in this report, also talks about some of the regional matters of human rights. We should not lose sight of the fact that the human rights movement in this country has outstanding international standing. Certainly, we look at areas within Australia where there might be some deficiencies and where there are on occasions some deficiencies, but equally we do have a good international record. We are making a major contribution to human rights in the area. We often need to make that contribution because the human rights records of some countries in our area are less than perfect by a long way. Chris Sidoti and others have been very instrumental in setting up regional human rights mechanisms. The chair of the joint standing committee, the member for New England (Mr Sinclair), last July attended a regional forum in Darwin. In a couple of weeks time, in early April, there is to be the next regional forum in New Delhi.  Peter?",50
155,Mr NUGENT,COMMITTEES,I did not hear the interjection from the gentleman from Chifley so I cannot respond.,51
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,It is a good idea that you do not.,51
157,Mr NUGENT,COMMITTEES,"I think he might have asked if I were attending and the answer is no, unfortunately, I am not. My point is that I think we are aiding a lot of countries in our region in the human rights area. I think it is an important responsibility and one which we need to continue to undertake as one of the leaders in that field and as people who not only have got the financial resources to do so but have the track record and the skills to do so. I think we can make a major contribution in that area. Of course we are concerned about racism. We do have a proud record as a country in our multicultural society. Racism is certainly nowhere near as bad here as it is in many parts of the world, but there is no doubt all not perfect and I think it is important that we are ever vigilant as a parliament to guard against such things, to speak out when it is necessary and to make sure that we do not spoil that record. I know the members of my subcommittee, as well as the full joint standing committee, take that task very seriously. I commend the report to the House.",51
158,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,by leave-I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed.,51
159,Mr MCCLELLAND,CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Barton) (5.06 p.m.)Firstly, I would like to address a number of issues raised by the member for Cowan (Mf Richard Evans), the previous speaker in this debate on the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1996. The member expressed concern regarding the number of small businesses going into bankruptcy. Of course that is a matter for regret and it is indeed a matter for concern that that number is increasing. The member for Cowan referred to factors which he believed played a role in that occurring. But what he did not refer to and did not acknowledge-and this is common to just about all government members-is the dramatic and drastic effect of the government ripping such a massive amount of money out of the economy. It is literally taking customers away from small business doorsteps and has really caused severe problems for not only small business but the economy generally. In addition, the failure of the government to announce policies to address unemployment has caused fear and insecurity. Far from people feeling relaxed and comfortable, as was promised in the last election, there is real apprehension out there. It is a very bold person who is going to commit themselves to a major purchase such as a car or a house when there are such feelings of insecurity. Any car dealer and any real estate agent is would tell you the consequences of that fear of unemployment. If you add to that an absence of any policy in relation to developing industry in this nation, you get a bleak picture. The member for Cowan also suggested that the government had the means to address this small business decline and referred to the repeal of the former government's unfair dismissal laws. The facts of the matter are that, if that is the best the government has in their armoury, we are all in real trouble. We are all in big trouble because the government itself does not understand its own legislation and it certainly did not understand the former government's legislation. For instance, on about four occasions the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) has stood up and berated the former government for relying on International Labour Organisation convention No. 158, which dealt with the concept of unfair dismissal. It seems the minister does not appreciate that the relevant part of his legislation dealing with unfair dismissal specifically has, as one of its objects, furthering the International Labour Organisation Convention. That is defined in section 4 of the act as being set out in schedule 10. All the minister has to do is look at schedule 10 which is set out in the act itself to see ILO convention No. 158. So, if the minister says departure from the former government's policies and departure from ILO convention No. 158 are going to resurrect small business and employment in this country, we all, as I said before, have real problems on our hands. The only repercussion that the government's legislation has had, by introducing a few hurdles and somersaults that applicants in unfair dismissal cases have to go through, is to shift unfair dismissal cases into the state sphere. My information is that in the last two months in New South Wales we have seen a 200 per cent increase, for instance, in unfair dismissal cases. If the government thinks it has created some sort of new order, it is sadly mistaken. I suggest with respect to the minister that he obtains a briefing from the experts in his own department. I have spent my time so far addressing and replying to points raised by the member for Cowan. One final point that he raised which I would like to address is his praise of the concept of risk undertaken by business entrepreneurs. What I would like to emphasise is that risk is not only taken by business entrepreneurs. Every day workers get on the train or get in their car and go to work and face risk in industrial accidents. Any solicitor's office around this country is likely to have several-indeed, many will have scores ofquite serious, and in some cases, horrifying injuries sustained by workers. In some industries, it is still the case that spouse waiting at home does not know whether their partner is going to come home with a serious injury. Mining is one of those industries. Indeed, although they have been damned and condemned by this government, the waterfront is still a very dangerous industry. Workers who go along there face considerable risks. So my point in this matter is that the government should really appreciate that economic growth in this country is not solely generated by the activities of entrepreneurs. Rather, it is literally built from the sweat and, regrettably in many cases, the blood and flesh of Australian workers. I want to move on to the topic of the bill itself. In 1992, the Corporate Law Reform Act introduced a new system for the voluntary administration of companies. It allowed a system whereby an independent administrator could be appointed to take over the charge of a company for a limited period of time. The thrust of that bill was significant because it was one based on mutual cooperation between the debtor company and the creditors and the independent administrator. The scheme allowed the company to operate under a deed of company agreement. That deed was one that essentially bound all parties-that is, the company, the creditors and the administrators-as to the course of action to apply in dealing with the company's affairs. It specifically' precluded another creditor from claiming some sort of priority over other creditors by acting inconsistently with that company deed of arrangement. In many circumstances it was acknowledged that the best people to run the company were the directors themselves-obviously because of their contacts and their industry knowledge. The voluntary administration allowed in the 1992 act certainly facilitated that, providing that the administrator generally oversaw the operations. In other words, it enabled a company facing difficulty to request the appointment of an administrator as an alternative to the old sudden death system of appointing a receiver. That was a significant and welcome advance. Indeed, that was a factual background in the now famous Crawford House case. The issue a in that case was whether debts incurred by a company still under the control of the directors, but in a situation of voluntary administration, received the same priority as that which normally attaches to debts incurred by an administrator, where the administrator is left in control of the business. Usually, it is that later case that is adopted whereby the administrator himself is in control and any debt incurred by his actions receives priority at the end of the winding up. But the situation in the Crawford House case where the directors were left in control is still not uncommon and in many cases desirable. Obviously, it is more likely to occur if the creditors regard the directors as reputable and competent. In many situations, if not most, they are going to be the most able to deal with the company's affairs because of their long history of commercial relationships and their knowledge of the industry generally. In many instances, the creditors of the company will cooperate in that situation because they have a vested interest in the company's survival. Because of the interactions in commercial relationships, many creditors will be suppliers or purchasers of the particular business. If they lose a link in their trading network, obviously their businesses are going to be the worse for it. So there is often a vested interest in creditors cooperating and trying to save one of their trading partners. I think it is fundamentally important that creditors so cooperating to save one of their trading partners not be penalised. This bill, it must be said, substantially addresses that issue. As I said before, normally, if the administrator was left in control of a company, the debts incurred by that administrator would get priority. This bill essentially ensures that debts incurred by the company under the ultimate control of the administrator, but through the actions of the directors, receive that same priority. Justice Cohen in the Crawford House case itself indicated that his conclusions as to the direction that the law took him were regrettable. For instance, in his opening address in the judgment, he said: The conclusion I have come to, if correct, can result in creditors of a number of companies which have entered into deeds of company arrangement having no fund upon which to claim for payment of their debts if the company should in due course be wound up. This would be a matter of serious consequence for the commercial community. Unfortunately, he felt compelled to arrive at that conclusion. He summarises the effect of his conclusion later in the judgment with these words: This results in the regrettable situation that there appears to be no right in those who became creditors of the company or whose debts were increased during the period of the operation of the deed, to prove for those debts or increased debts. This would not seem to be a result intended by the legislature. Later on, he said: It is not satisfactory that the position should be left as it is and it requires urgent legislative amendment. In fact, the former government had proposed a bill very similar to this and the opposition hence supports the government's actions. It is probably desirable that the legislation moves in a direction which encourages administrators to leave directors under control. While most administrators are competent and honourable, the facts of the matter are that they charge their time at professional rates and often that hourly rate of somewhere between $200 and $400 an hour is the final straw which causes the company to go under. I recall a recent speech by the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) in which he gave an account of a business in his electorate which faced a very similar situation where an administrator took over control of that company. It seemed inevitable from that day forward that the company was going to die a slow death, whereas if the directors had been left in control there would have been every chance that the company would have survived. It is highly desirable that the legislation does as this bill does: that is, it does not cause an impediment to directors being left in control of a company facing financial difficulties. If the company can survive, employees of the company are going to benefit-not to mention their families. As I have said, company insolvency is often contagious, so any arresting of the decline of a business partner can keep secure its trading partners. In summary, there are very sound public policy reasons for justifying the legislation. I note the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) in his second reading speech has expressed that the only reservation is one of addressing the question of priorities generally. We, in the opposition, would agree with that. It is appropriate that the issue of priorities in company receiverships and bankruptcy be addressed. I note the government is to refer that question to the companies and securities advisory committee. The opposition would most certainly endorse that occurring. From my own personal point of view, I think there should be some rewards attached to trading partners taking a risk to try to keep their associated company or trading partner alive. I note that this bill is topical in another sense. It was addressed by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in the context of announcements by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) the week before last. The Treasurer indicated the government's intention to review corporate law generally. He said that he intended to review the law to give it a stronger economic focus so that businesses could undertake their businesses with low transactional costs and that, as a starting point, he would be addressing the Australian accounting standards boards. I also note the Treasurer's comments that he regarded the law as too proscriptive and too legalistic. In the Australian Financial Review on 20 November 1996, he is reported as favouring a system of self-regulation of a scheme of business ethics, which he believes will promote investor confidence. I must say that I have concerns about a voluntary code of ethics. I do not think, from my experience, that it will go anywhere near addressing a number of concerns that shareholders have. They still have concerns that there is inadequate reporting in respect of the foreign activities of companies. Even though they receive balance sheets regarding local activities, there is usually very scant information provided as to the foreign activities of companies of which they are shareholders. Similarly, the procedures for the reporting of related party transactions are very inadequate. Equally, there is a generally inadequate methodology in the Corporations Law regarding the election or appointment of directors. While substantial work has been done since the days of Clyde Cameron in 1972 to ensure the democratic election of trade unions, very little of that seems to have been translated into the Corporations Law. It is one area where there is a severe lack of democratic control. That is something which is inevitably going to deter ordinary Australians from investing in the share market and buying shares. News Corporation is a case in point. For instance, a recent article reported on the techniques of News Corporation in selecting its board members. That is achieved by one of News Corporation's in-house lawyers going around with another director and virtually head-hunting the board members. I should say that the board members are the government, as opposed to the chief executives of the company. If one anticipated that occurring in respect of a trade union, in which the members of the committee of management were not democratically elected, there would be a public outcry. The government must be alive to the fact that the Australian public is becoming increasingly educated in the affairs of corporate investment and the activities of corporations. Much more information is being communicated to them through the general press, business papers and, of course, electronic communications. The Australian people are in a position to judge, and judge appropriately, the standard and quality of directors, and this government should urgently look at taking steps to encourage the democratic participation of shareholders in the composition of boards of companies.",51
160,Mr MILES,CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (5.26 p.m.)-in reply-I want to sum up the debate, and thank the four or five speakers who have participated in it. I will go back over a few of the key points of the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1996. This legislation has come about due to the voluntary administration scheme, in part 5.3A of the Corporations Law, becoming an increasingly popular means of dealing with companies that find themselves in financial difficulties. The objective of that scheme was to provide a swift, flexible and inexpensive insolvency procedure which focused on saving the company's business, rather than the company, and preserving employment prospects. So it is an important aspect in the situation in which companies find themselves in difficulty that we make sure that it is a straightforward process. This amendment is about clarifying that process and making sure that there is security for those people who attempt to ensure that that company keeps going. A large proportion of companies using scheme are successfully negotiating deeds of company arrangement with their creditors, allQwing them to continue with their businestechnical ses'ratherthan going into immediate liquidaamendments tion: It is important that, while those comset pldidt are under a .deed of company arrangea ment;',creditors are not discouraged from supporting them by trading with them. This bill will resolve an anomaly in legislation whereby creditors who trade with a company under a deed are at risk of losing any claim on the assets of the company if the company should subsequently go into liquidaoffences tion. The bill will render those debts provable in a subsequent liquidation. The bill has the support of the Law Council of Australia and the Insolvency Practitioners Association Australia. The related issue of whether the debts should not only be provable, but should also receive priority treatment, is a more contentious one, though not as urgent. In this regard, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has This referred the issue to the Companies and tion. Securities Advisory Committee, which is reviewing the operation of the voluntary an administration scheme as a whole. I know that members have had a reasonably wide-ranging debate on this issue. It is not contentious debate. The opposition supports this legislation. It was almost entirely the same bill which the then government had prepared. We have picked up on that legislatation; tion. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Miles) read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.1) 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 February, on motion by Mr Sharp: That the bill be now read a second time.",54
161,Mr TANNER,A VIA TION LEGISLATION,"Melbourne) (5.29 p.m.)the This Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 amends three acts of this parliament, two of them substantively and one in a way. The two substantive sets of I will deal with briefly. The first relates to the Airports Act 1996. There are variety of amendments to this act which are essentially tidying up amendments to various oversights or difficulties which have emerged the from that legislation, which was passed roughly six months ago by this parliament. Some examples of the amendments are: the adoption of a tiered process with respect to and penalties for environmental matters, which ensures that there is, in a sense, a cascading sequence of penalties that can be applied so that people can be found of guilty of and penalised for lesser offences rather than greater offences; and an obligation to be imposed on all persons to comply with an airport environmental strategy rather than just to be imposed on the airport operator. fixes an oversight in the originallegislaOne rather spectacular amendment imposes obligation upon an airport lessee to operate the land as an airport. It is rather surprising that was not in the original legislation. Other a amendments are: a requirement of consultation with respect to major changes to airport master plans be undertaken in line with the original requirements with respect to consula requirement upon the minister to extend consultation beyond the operator for the exercise of certain powers under the legislation; prohibition on subleasing an airport through means of trusts to avoid the act and guidelines on how the airport should be operated. There are a variety of other specific amend-ents - n this section which I will not go into In detaIl. - ut all of t-e- are essentially tidying ul! provISIons to faCIlItate the operation of the AIrports A-t: The opposition strongly supports these provlSlons. It does illustrate-an observation I have made a couple of times in the past in the debate on the sale of the airport leases-that there will be a substantial learning process with respect to the airport sales. Already I think some problems and issues are emerging that were not necessarily conceived at the time the former government was dealing with these issues and have not as yet been addressed by this government. I cite as examples the question of future investment and, in particular, the distinction between investment in non-aeronautical airport activities and aeronautical activities which may lead to an imbalance between thtwo, and the question of price capping and concerns that I have indicated about the likely future effectiveness of the price capping arrangements that have been adopted. These are just a couple of examples of problems that I think we will have to deal with in the future. It will be to some extent a learning process and I suspect there will probably be other difficulties that emerge as well. The fact - ha- we are already amending legislation does IndIcate that that is going to be the case. The second substantive set of amendments relate to the Air Navigation Act, one of which is to establish a register of encumbered aircraft so that prospective buyers of aircraft can have some information about any legal encumbrance that may exist on the aircraft. I understand that there are a variety of circumstances where parts of aircraft can be encumbered as collateral for loans and the like and it can actually be quite confusing and difficult for prospective buyers. The proposal to establish a register has the support of the op-ositio-. It does not entail any legal implicatIOns WIth respect to the relationship between buyer and seller, but it should facilitate the process of purchase of aircraft and make things a bit easier for prospective buyers and therefore has our support. The second section, which the opposition does have a couple of amendments to, relates to the approval of international charter operations by the secretary to the department. Under the previous provision, the essential criterion which applied in this case was 'the need to provide reasonable protection' to the Australian aviation industry. Under the new criteria - roposed by the Minister for Transport and Re.glOnal Development (Mr Sharp) in the amendIng act, there is a list of concerns which the secretary to the department must take into - ccount 'prior to granting an approval for an InternatIOnal charter. These include such matters as consumer needs, promotion of trade. and tourism, aviation security, the locatIOn of the services concerned international relations generally and the criteria that are followed by the International Air Services Commission. T-e oppositio- does have a slight concern, albeIt a substantIve concern, about the drift of this particular - et of legislative amendments, the concern beIng that there is a gradual shift occurring under the new government towards an open skies policy. The opposition does not oPl!0se the concept of broadening the criteria which govern the secretary's decision with resp.ect to granting international charter rights but In the context of some other decisions that the government has taken we do wish to register our concern at the gradual drift in aviati.on 'p.olicy whi-h may ultimately be to the sIgmfIcant detrIment of our two major national operators, Ansett and Qantas and the Australian industry more generally. ' I indicate that I will be moving two amendments circulated in my name, the second of which is actually a condition or contingent amendment. There are two options there depending on whether or not the first is adopted. I will not go into the detail of those amendments. That will be dealt with in the consideration in detail stage. I will flag what they relate to. The first of these amendments would add an extra criterion to the government's proposed new set of criteria for the secretary to the department to consider and that would be 'employment and investment in, and general development of, the Australian Aviation industry'. The second of these amendments would be to apply the same set of criteria to any decision by the secretary to the department to exempt a particular charter operation from the requirement to be given approval. That power is currently in the amending legislation. The amendment that we will be moving would seek to ensure that in exercising that power the secretary would take note of the same issues that he would have to take note of in exercising his power to grant an approval. I understand that the government's intention with respect to this power of exemption is that it would relate to, in a sense, one-off charters to unusual or very small or low key situations. Certainly, we do not object to the intent of what the government seeks to do wi- the; legislation. Our concern is that the po-er: thtit is granted to the secretary to --ernpt.is a fair bit broader than that intent al?Pli-$. 'As l,have indicated, the opposition does have some' concern about what we would see as a drift towards a more open skies policy. Clearly there is a difficult balance to be maintained here. Competition in international aviation needs to be fostered, but at the same time we need to make sure that there is a viable Australian international aviation indus- situation. try. We are very proud of the fact that we have an internationally renowned carrier in Qantas, which has a worldwide, top-class reputation. Clearly, we want to make sure that Qantas can continue to operate and function in a similar way to the way in which it has historically functioned. We can also take great pride in the fact that we now have a second Australian international airline in Ansetl. We forward to Ansett's share of the total market increasing-preferably not at the expense of Qantas but at the expense of other international operators. I will quote from a press statement the minister put out on 10 June of last year relating to charter flights, particularly in freight area, to indicate the general drift is occurring in policy. The minister stated in this press release that freight was being neglected in favour of passenger demand and that the government would seek to 'bilaterally negotiate significant increases in dedicated capacity for air freight services in key export markets' and that 'an APEC model air freight agreement for greater liberalisation of air freight operations' would be sought to be developed and the government would seek to 'liberalise the freight-charter approval process for carriage of Australian exports'. Finally, he stated: Throughout the world, passenger charter services have served to stimulate international tourism growth by providing seasonal services on many routes not normally served by scheduled carriers, at prices affordable to tourists who would not otherwise travel internationally. As you would recollect, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, having chaired the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform which did a study on air freight recently, the lack of available freight charter capacity is not really a major problem in the total picture of Australian airfreight. Clearly there are issues associated with capacity, but the findings of that committee, which you chaired, were that there are numerous problems that appear all along the chain and there is no great single dominant problem. There are a number of problems with our airfreight Contrary to popular myth, Australian exporters actually get access to pretty good airfreight prices, primarily because they are cross-subsidised by passenger tickets, because the vast bulk of the airfreight currently goes out in passenger planes. I do not necessarily agree with the minister's comments on freight charters. With respect to tourism, the statement the look minister made in that media statement is in fact broadly accurate, but it fails to recognise that we have a slight backloading problem in Australia. Tourist charters that operate, for example, between Britain and Spain clearly have a fair potential to operate with substantial passenger loads in both directions. One of the the difficulties with tourism charters to Austhat tralia is that in many instances it is very difficult to maintain the number of people going from Australia with sufficient regularity to make the charters economically viable. Clearly, ultimately people have to go back to where they came from, but the time they wish to spend in a particular place is going to vary and the volume you are able to get in a charter operation is going to depend on the amount of demand for travel in both directions. That will be a significant influencing factor. I question just how strong that is likely to be in Australia. That may be a significant restraining factor. I understand that today the government will vote against the amendments we will be moving but is going to give some further consideration to them subsequently. The minister may wish to elaborate on this in his closing remarks. On that understanding, we will not seek to divide on the two amendments we will be moving. The matter can perhaps be revisited when the bill gets to the Senate. I conclude with a reference to my concern about the government's general approach to transport and transport policy; that is, transport in essence is primarily a cost and little else. It is more than just a cost. Yes, it is an important cost consideration for the vast bulk of the Australian economy in a direct or indirect way, but transport, particularly in aviation, is also a major export earner. Qantas is our third largest individual export earner. Ansett is now earning substantial export dollars directly as an international carrier and, as I indicated before, hopefully will increase its share. Qantas's market share is now below 40 per cent of the Australian international aviation market. I certainly hope that it does not go much below that. I think our international aviation market, where Australian operators supply roughly half of the total, is probably about right and has a reasonable balance. It is important that we do not alter our policy framework in a way that might derogate from that. Clearly, the proposals the government are enacting are not likely to have a sudden, direct impact on the viability of Ansett and Qantas, but it is important to ensure that we do not, through the back door, introduce competition that is outside International Air Services Commission agreements and which might undermine the economic viability of Qantas and Ansett services and might undermine their capacity to compete with the other international operators that ply the Australian routes. The concern I have is that the government, in pursuing its general direction in this area, is focused excessively on the issue of cost, which is important, and is failing to focus on the importance of maintaining a viable Australian international aviation industry which, as I have indicated, delivers very substantial export dollars and a large number of generally highly skilled and generally well-paid jobs to Australians. Efficiency is important, but so is the capacity to participate in our society, to have employment, to earn a reasonable income and to have a reasonably skilled job. I think there will be a role for additional foreign charter flights in the future in the areas of freight and tourism. It is reasonable to anticipate that that section of the aviation industry in Australia will probably expand. The minister and I may differ a bit on precisely how large such an expansion might be. But, as I have indicated, I think it is very important that any such expansion not undermine to a significant extent the viability of our existing international carriers. It is also important to ensure that safety concerns are protected. CASA has undertaken recently a program of enhanced safety examination of foreign carriers. We have a lot of foreign carriers coming to Australia from small countries. Sometimes there are question marks over the maintenance regimes, in particular, that apply to the aircraft and sometimes there are question marks over the age of the aircraft-things of that nature. It is very important that we maintain our overall safety profile and performance. Increasing the access of foreign charter flights to Australia is one way that safety could conceivably be undermined. I would be interested to know what discussions the minister has had with Qantas and Ansett about this legislation. I hope that he has consulted with them about it and that he has had some discussions with them, because these issues do ultimately affect their viability and capacity to operate as major Australian operators and as an important Australian industry. The opposition's amendments are not designed to protect the Australian industry and not even designed to be as strong as the previous criteria were. They are simply to ensure that, in the criteria before the secretary of the department in making decisions about granting international charter approvals, there is some reference to the interests of Australian industry. At the moment it is virtually the only thing, the one aspect, that is left out. All of the other issues that have been put in the draft legislation are entirely legitimate and perfectly reasonable to consider. The one thing that is missing is the potential impact on Australian industry. If that change is made to the legislation, we feel that it is entirely supportable and worthwhile. As I have indicated-I will wait to hear what the minister has to say in reply-n the understanding that the issues will be considered further in the context of the matter being in the Senate at the end of this week, we will put up the amendments and, on the assumption they will be voted against by the government in the House today, will not seek to divide in the hope that we can reach some agreement in the context of the Senate debate.",55
162,Mr DONDAS,A VIA TION LEGISLATION,"I rise in support of the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997. A lot of legislation passes through both houses of parliament. From time to time a particular piece of legislative framework is introduced that creates some interest for members. I think it would be very difficult for a member to try to cover all the legislation that is introduced into this House. This bill, I believe, does have a great deal of interest for those living in the Northern Territory and in remote areas o!"" Australia, especially those with very good tourism destinations. As I understand from reading a press release today, the government is currently negotiating to lease airports in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth to interested parties. Also, the government has recently announced that the evaluation and short-listing of stage 2 bids for long-term leases of these airports are complete. The government is offering 50-year leases, with options being available for a further 49 years. Nine consortia were shortlisted in October last year and have lodged bids for one or more of the phase 1 airports. Six consortia have been short-listed to proceed to the next phase of the process, and they will be required to lodge revised offers by the middle of April this year. It is envisaged that the sales will be completed before 30 June 1997. The press release which has been issued by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in the last 24 hours would certainly alleviate the concern expressed by the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). He thought there were some hiccups and that the government was having a few problems. My understanding is that the minister has made a statement that the sales should be completed before the end of this financial year. The main purpose of the bill is to amend the Airports Act 1996 and will consequently allow for certainty for new and existing airport operators and ensure that the Commonwealth has a clear regulatory framework for the operation of these airports. The bill also amends the Air Navigation Act 1920 relating to charter operations of which I will speak later. The bill includes provisions to ensure a better standard of environmental protection at Australia's airports. These provisions include: variable penalties for breaches of environmental standards; providing new offences for deliberate harm to the environment; power to allow pre-existing contamination to be addressed; prohibiting subleasing to trusts; requiring public comment on proposed plans or developments to be sought by the lessees of airports, and ministerial approval; and a statutory requirement that airport lessees actually use the airport site as an airport. The federal Department of Transport and the office of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development have been working on the development of regulations governing the environmental standards required, in consultation with Environment Australia. These regulations will ensure that the responsibility of maintaining correct environmental standards lies with each and every person undertaking an activity at an airport that will affect the surrounding environment. Section 130 of the act already stipulates that the airport lessee take responsibility for the monitoring of any environmental issues caused by the airport. This will now be expanded to include all other persons undertaking an activity at an airport site to take the responsibility of ensuring that the environment is protected. It also authorises the Commonwealth to set limits of aircraft movements at airports, and it allows for public reporting by the ACCC on competition issues like pricing and practices at airports. There has been some difference of opinion between the states and territories on the aftersale lease powers that the Commonwealth will have. This is reflected in the state-territory opposition to the land planning powers, building authority function and environmental authority function that the Commonwealth will have. I know that the Northern Territory government has some concerns about the balance of power between the different levels of government post FAC. It is my hope that the Commonwealth will delegate some of those responsibilities to the territory government, which has an excellent record in that area. The bill prohibits the subleasing of airports to trusts on the grounds that it may be a way of sidestepping the ownership provisions of the act. Therefore, the amendments will prohibit a trust being declared as a sublease and, consequently, prohibit the separation of the legal and beneficial interests of a lessee. The bill will also amend the Air Navigation Act 1920 in order to facilitate quick approvals for international charter flights, establish a register of charter aircraft pursuant to the provisions of the act and add some clarification to technical details. As I have mentioned, I have a special interest in charter flight operations. So I welcomed the government's decision last June to move towards a more liberalised and flexible international air charter market. This led to the release of updated charter guidelines for charter flights in Australia. Charter airlines, particularly in remote Australia, have the potential to provide some healthy competition to the scheduled airlines, particularly in the area of tourism. When one thinks about Alice Springs being the centre part of central Australia and Uluru being a much sought after destination, there is absolutely no reason why international charter operators could not fly into central Australia. Alice Springs could become a hub which would then support Qantas and Ansett domestically by having a two-hour flight to Sydney, a two-hour flight to Brisbane, a one hour and 50 minute flight to Adelaide and a two-hour flight to Perth. The shadow minister for transport was concerned that there may have been a restraining factor. I think it would make sense if Concord were to fly into central Australia because there are no environmental requirements and no curfew. That may become a very interesting factor in terms of the development of tourism in central Australia. Other operators in the Asian region would still have the capacity of discharging passengers in central Australia. Those passengers could be flown to other destinations, brought back into central Australia and flown back on the charter on which they originally started. That certainly has some interesting prospects. Those prospects were not available before the minister introduced his amendments. There is a lot of work to be done by the various tourist commissions. With private enterprise, there is no reason why charter operators cannot use the territory as a hub. That is something that the Northern Territory government would be very interested in. Another interesting factor is that of freight. I have known of instances where Flying Tiger used to bring their cargo from overseas ports into Australia and then fly empty from Sydney over Darwin and back into Singapore or other Asian ports. I always thought that was a waste of a resource, especially as the territory in the last five years has developed a tremendous horticultural market. Only 10 years ago horticultural development in the Northern Territory was worth about only $1 V2 million to $2 million per annum. Now it exceeds $60 million per annum. We are to export some of our produce to northern areas such as Sabah in Malaysia and Singain pore. If Flying Tiger were able to bounce Darwin and pick up a couple of tonnes of freight, that would certainly help the developSprings, ment of the horticultural industry. I believe the amendments as proposed by the minister would have some validity if approved by the secretary to the department are certainly some avenues which will open up. I do not know whether the opening of the blue sky policy, as mentioned by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, is the objective of this legislation. This legislation provides those operators with the capacity, after obtaining approval, to move in and out of the country both with freight and with passengers. The amendments in the bill will go another step in freeing the operations of charter companies by streamlining approval processes for applicaairport, tions while strengthening protection for consumers by ensuring that passengers are indemnified for financial loss should the charter not fulfil its obligations. While northern Australia has had a fairly liberal charter policy for some time, this bill enables quick approval for multi-destination charters. The amendments also provide for the establishment of a register. It is envisaged that the register will be managed by Airservices Australia and will list information on encumAmendment bered aircraft. This will be a national register, and it has the in principle approval from states and territories. The Northern government already has complementary legislation. So a move to the national register should not pose any major problems. acknowledging that this is only an information register and does not guarantee title, a useful and welcome initiative. Whilst restating my concerns that the balance between the Commonwealth and the territory be preserved, I want to mention of the other operations of the FAC at airports. I want to highlight one particular instance which has caused me some concern. A coach operator who had permission from hoteliers to pick up guests from the airport and transfer able them to the various hotels as a courtesy service had his operation ceased by the F AC Alice Springs. The reason for this was that the FAC had entered into an exclusive agreeinto ment with another operator to take those passengers to various destinations in Alice but those people did not have bookings. They were simply walking off the aircraft, looking for transport and were able to use the bus shuttle into various parts of of transport. There Alice Springs. I felt very sorry for the operator because he had gone to a lot of trouble to make arrangements with the various hoteliers to transport their guests from the airport to the hotels in the various locations. Because of a regulation of the FAC, the road into the FAC was virtually closed off. This prohibited the operator from going into pick up passengers. I realise that this does not have anything to up do with the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1). However, if somebody bought an what extension would the legislative process provide for the protection of those people needing to do business at the airport? With those few comments, I commend the bill to the House. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development will obviously pick up some points raised by the shadow minister, and I will listen with interest to that.  p.m.)-I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Aviation Legislation Bill (No.1) 1997 and to support the amendment as moved by the shadow all minister for transport, the member for MelTerritory bourne (Mr Tanner)",59
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,A VIA TION LEGISLATION,"I do not think it has been moved yet. I think it While will be moved later on.  it is foreshadowed by the shadow minister. Far be it from me not to have it correct when I address you, sir. But, when it is moved, I support the action that he has indicated and some certainly understand the likelihood of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) looking at the worth of that amendment; and, whether there is an opportunity to embrace that in any ultimate legislation, I am conscious of what activity is taking place there. I have looked through the bill that is before us and through the minister's second reading speech, and also a speech made by the minister to the Orient Airlines Association at Sanctuary Cove on 29 November last year. I want to draw upon some of his remarks in that speech and some of the information that he provided in the course of that speech, because it contained a quite comprehensive analysis of the international aviation industry in Australia. The two largest aviation markets in the world are the United States and the European Community, with 280 million and 360 million people respectively. Those two markets recognise the economic importance of having strong aviation and shipping industries and the multiplier effects of those industries. Yet I have to say that this Treasury-led doctrinaire government, a captive of the economic rationalists, never misses a chance to hit Australia's shipping and aviation industries. Earlier this session, the government pushed through cuts to government assistance to Australia's shipbuilding industry and depreciation allowances for Australian flag shipping. That assistance had been initially established to encourage the growth of both of those sectors-shipbuilding and ship operation. One of the intended effects of this legislation is to weaken the role of Australia's international airlines, Ansett International and Qantas, in the international market. I will compare that a little later with the attitude the European Community and of the United States which have very strong and protective policies towards their international aviation industries. The ultimate result of that is to transfer jobs offshore under the pretext of increasing the size of the tourism industry. When I looked to the minister's speech of 29 November last year I saw he made the point that Australia has been pursuing a policy of keeping the capacity ahead of the demand. That is a very good doctrinaire approach, but when the capacity is so far ahead of demand, that 40 per cent of the capacity that is available into and out of Australia is not utilised, that is something we need to look at fairly closely. There needs to be a balance in all of those things. As I said, when I look at the really big players in the world and look at the policies they are following, I ask: with all of the strength that they have and all of the market opportunities available to them, what leads them to pursue the policy they are following and are there indicators there that we should be taking notice of? When I look at Australia. I see that at present only 60 per cent of the total seats available-just under 200,000-are actually operated each week by the airlines. There are 330,000 seats available each week into and out of Australia but only 200,000 of those seats are operated. The minister made the point in that speech that Australia's international aviation policy is aimed at liberalisation but that we are not pursuing open skies. There is a fine line there. I can see the objective, I have listened to the shadow minister and I am conscious of the previous Labor government's policy, but the warning I want to give is that it is a fine balance. When you look at the United States, when you look at the Asian airlines operators, when you look at the growing conglomeration of international airline operators around the world, we are but small bit players. We are small bit players in the global sea and just how much risk can we take with what are really fledgling industries. If you look down further, you will see our share of traffic into and out of Australia has of increased from 38 per cent to some 42 per cent in 1996 with the operation of Ansett International. Again, Australia's market share has been declining. So we should work through and look at what is happening in the rest of the world and what we are doing here with our policy. There is another issue, but I will come back a little later to look more at the European scene. When we look at some of the airlines operating into Australia-and it is helpful that the minister is here at the table when I am making these remarks because I want to talk about the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the onerous task that that organisation carries-we see that just over 41 million people travelled by air in Australian air space in 1995-96. That includes domestic majors, domestic regional operators, the few that go by general aviation and all of the international travellers who come into Australian airports or go out of Australian airports. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority, from a report I read in the Daily Commercial News of 3 March 1997, has found some 'major safety deficiencies' with an international airline which is flying into Australia-into Sydney. CASA has covered some six or eight airlines and found that one had some major deficiencies-and the minister would quickly be able to recall which one that is without my naming it. With 50 international airline carriers coming into Australia, it is vital that they are checked for safe operation, for airworthiness and for safety deficiencies. Let's not blindly accept that, because an aircraft is registered in another nation, that nation has the same attitude towards airworthiness and safe air operation as we have in this country. We are one of the leaders in the world, but there are all sorts of flagged aircraft coming into this country now that have differing levels of safety and safe operation. So unsuitable aircraft-the aviation equivalent of Panamanian registered ships, I am sure you would appreciate, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER --create the fear of an accident occurring. We need to be concerned about the possibility of unsuitable aircraft, especially high-passenger planes such as Boeing 727s and 767s, and they need to be watched and they need to be supervised from an airworthiness standpoint. An example of a safety concern is an airline, which did not land in Australia, where a plane was registered in one country, chartered to another country and operated by a crew from a third country who were licensed by a fourth country, for instance by the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States, and probably had a multiracial crewjust to make you happy! Last month, in that period that was reported, CASA banned 13 international airlines from landing in Australia and put another 15 on notice to improve their air safety regulations. CASA is currently concentrating on inspecting the 15 carriers who are on notice, but eventually it wants to inspect every foreign carrier entering Australia. I believe that the Australian public demands no less than that achievement. There is a blind acceptance-rather, it is almost like a blind expectation-that international aircraft are really absolutely safe and, if they have a flag on the tail of the country of origin and they are registered overseas, they will be right. We know the reality is somewhat different from that and the level of risk varies greatly as we increase the number of aircraft, the flags, coming into Australia. With the prospect of charter operators coming in, there is clearly in the charter industry-if one looks closely, like in the shipping industry-a greater incidence of older aircraft often operated by organisations or businesses that have lesser durability than their standard scheduled operators who have a much greater market image to protect. The risk, in my mind, of crash and injury is greater with some of those operators. I have to qualify that. I do not want to raise the alarm, but we do need to recognise the reality of the composition of that industry. It is a different industry to the scheduled operators. Those remarks I made about CASA are drawn from the DCN of 3 March. Inbound tourism flows out of all of this, because the purpose of growing the international airline industry is to grow inbound tourism. Inbound tourism is constantly presented as the panacea for all of Australia's ills. However, in the general community, there are increasing numbers of Australians raising questions about who benefits from increased inbound tourism. There needs to be clear policies and industry initiatives in place to ensure that Australian businesses and Australian men and women gain income and employment from increased inbound tourism. Increased inbound tourism can bring benefits, but there have to be effective policies in place to achieve those benefits. Increasingly, at an electorate level, I am told of foreign travel agents selling tickets to foreign visitors who travel to Australia on foreign airlines and travel from the airport in foreign made and foreign owned buses to foreign owned and foreign managed hotels. Having rested at the hotels, they proceed outwards to foreign owned facilities or recreation activities and foreign owned duty-free stores staffed by foreign staff to buy goods. They go back to the hotel and back on their foreign controlled buses back to the airport. I am asked the question-I am sure a number of my colleagues here in the House have been asked the same thing-'Well, what does Australia benefit from that?' With regard to the incidence of vertical integration, I do not know the answers; that is why I am raising it in this debate. It needs to be addressed and those questions need to be answered. Where is the benefit to Australia and does that kind of vertical integration benefit Australia? If more foreign activities being vertically integrated do benefit Australia, is there a mirror of that, where Australian owned businesses are similarly vertically integrated in their journey abroad? I would like to think that they were. The parting remark that I usually get in that kind of discussion is a sort of dismissive sentence that goes something like, 'Well, it seems to me we get to make some of the beds and wash some of the dirty clothes, thanks very much.' But it is a serious question and it is that perception that needs to be addressed. I have seen a number of current affairs shows and I have seen it addressed on various television semi-documentaries. It is a problem we need to address if we are going to continue to have the support of Australians for that. I can understand people forming those views of inbound tourism in light of the media coverage that I have referred to. The question of vertical integration needs to be addressed. That leads me to the next point. We regularly hear calls from the industry for less and less supervision of tourists coming to Australia. Some spokespeople wanted visas abolished altogether. I am looking here again at the DCN. It is not my favourite journal that I read all the time, but it just so happens that I noticed these articlesMr Sharp-It has been referred to in a lot of your speeches.  looking for material for this debate. In the DCN issue of 27 February 1997, there is a heading 'KAL makes Aust visa breakthrough'. KAL said: . . . it will be able to issue visas for travellers bound for Australia beginning from April. Again, in the public perception, what goes on here? A few weeks ago, we saw, vividly, news bulletin after TV news bulletin of two Koreans being bashed to death in a street in Sydney and then the subsequent reports that they were related to crime syndicates that had come in. The point I am making here is what price is protection and what price is domestic security when you continue to relax the supervision of the entry of tourists from abroad? There again has to be a balance about the level of inspection and the level of examination. I do not hold a view that you should make it open slather, open door, let come in whoever wants to come in and then lament the problem that we have created. We have seen already numerous news reports about the Yakuza from Japan, now the Korean criminal gangs that are here and all the other ones we have heard referred to in the past. These more recent ones have to do with the increased flow of tourism. I think the industry itself and governments themselves, both federal and state, need to address this issue before it develops too far. It is a serious issue. We looked at the industry as a whole, and where the industry is going. The airline business is a very tough business to be in. It is a very attractive business. So many operators think that if you paint 'airlines' on the tail of your aircraft your fortune is made. All you have to do is collect the money and enjoy the wealth. I refer to another article which says that it is a cyclical industry that is highly sensitive to discretionary factors. There is no more a discretionary factor than in the case of charter aircraft, or unscheduled air services, as they are known. If you look to Europe, you will see that 1997 is the year-I think it is next monthwhen cabotage within the aviation industry ends, when any nation within the European Community will be able to transport people by air to any other nation within the Ee. going to be interesting to see how that works, because the EC has had a history of deliberthe ately high domestic fares with travel Europe being much cheaper than travel within Europe. When that develops, it will be interquality esting to see what the effect is going to be the domestic cabotage rights member states that constitute the community. Going on from that, I looked at a report prepared by the BTCE, report No. 86, and section in that which deals with unscheduled services-'non-scheduled passenger traffic' the jargon for it. It makes the point that, we have known before, non-scheduled serweek vices, or charter services, provide a relatively small proportion of total revenue passenger skies policy. kilometres, RPKs, or total traffic, across the world. In the 1992 figures, it was some 14.7 per cent of the total international revenue passenger kilometres, both scheduled and scheduled-that is all, less than 15 per cent of it. The demand for that kind of traffic is their highly discretionary. It is very price sensitive and it varies. It used to be the case that charter operators opened new markets and policy. brought in a great deal of traffic. There was a very substantial margin between the schedtwo uled fare level and what the charter operator could come in with, often with an older aircraft and often with a lower standard of accommodation in the aircraft-usually a higher passenger number, a closer configurawhere tion, less leg room and all those things that to passenger comfort. But that margin has greatly narrowed and there is not generally the margin of fat used to be there for the unscheduled operator or the charter operator to come in underneath and siphon off traffic from the scheduled passenger operator. Again I raise the doubt about that. I can see chartered aircraft services as a way of opening up some new markets, activity. but I do not think we should hold deal of expectation about it. I do want to reinforce a point made by the shadow minister for transport, and that is I do not want to see this country going an open skies or blue skies policy-the love of so many people in the tourism industry. It is have a very strong view that airspace, our aviation market, is very much like minerals in ground. It is a national resource. It is not into something you give away. Yes, it has a potential. That potential expands with the of technology and transport available. on But it is a national resource not to be handed within the 17 out to other nations. I have a concern with the way this government is going about handing out bilateral the arrangements, it seems to me in many cases with little in return. We are so hasty, and you is can see that reflected in the figures. We have as 330,000 seats available out of Australia each and only 200,000 of them are utilised; yet the minister refers to that as not an open If you go to the other extreme, you can look at non-scheduled service to the Middle East. What is said in respect of the Middle nonEast? Most Third World countries and Middle East nations have tight restrictions regarding non-scheduled operations in order to protect infant aviation industry. So there is this great mix of tight aviation policy, not so tight policy and in some cases I think overly liberal I come back to the point I started with. The greatest markets in the world-the European Community and the United States of America-fiercely guard their aviation resource, their national aviation markets and the utilisation of those markets. If you look at the growth is going to come from in go the market, it is interesting to note that, looking across the United States, the Pacific and the international market generally, half of that the revenue of all US airlines comes from trans-Pacific operations-half of it. Compare that to what the minister had to say in his speech in November, that by the year 2000 the Asia-Pacific will constitute 40 per cent of the world total of aviation traffic and aviation Australia's share of that, as I said, is out a great down to 42 per cent. Whilst I understand and see how the minister has put the legislation forward, and that I strongly support the amendments, I just into want to sound those warnings that I have raised in respect of tourism and making it too I easy for undesirable people and people with criminal backgrounds to come into this country. There is the need to ensure that proper levels of safety and the safe operation of international aircraft are observed. CAS An..:eds to have those resources and we need to ensure that people do have that proper protection and can utilise with confidence the services into and out of Australia, particularly in respect of the charter operations. I support the amendments foreshadowed by the shadow minister for transport.",61
164,Mr RANDALL,A VIA TION LEGISLATION,"In speaking to the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997, I would first like to give a brief background on the intended sale process of the Perth, Melbourne and Brisbane airports. The sale of the long-term leases on federal airports will improve the efficiency of airport investments and operations while at the same time provide ordinary Australians, such as my constituents in the electorate of Swan, with the opportunity to invest in what is a very stable and profitable business. Following the enactment of the Airports Act 1996 in September of last year, expressions of interest were called for in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports. The probable selection of the successful bidder is expected in the next few months and finalisation of the sale of the leases shortly thereafter. The successful bidders may commence operation in the airports towards the end of June, but certainly will do so by the end of this parliamentary sitting or before we sit again. Sydney will not be leased without a satisfactory solution to the noise problem from aircraft. In my opinion, that is a very sensible situation, given the heat surrounding Sydney. The government strategy of offering long-term leases, coupled with the decision to break up a government owned monopoly airports network, is a world first and has attracted considerable international interest. It is providing significant opportunities for private sector involvement in infrastructure, with airports representing very attractive investments. This bill will provide certainty to new airport operators and existing airport tenants and will ensure the Commonwealth can exercise adequate regulatory control over the leased airports. In order to reduce, if not eliminate, caveats being applied by the bidders to the payment of the sale proceeds to the Commonwealth, all essential elements of the regulatory apparatus need to be finalised forthwith. Amendments to the Airports Act 1996 will clarify some issues which are unclear and empower required regulations. These will include statutory requirements for an airport operator to use an airport site as an airport, this is a legal requirement to ensure that airport land is not redeveloped for other purposes; variable penalties for breaches of environmental standards; powers to allow pre-existing contamination to be addressed; and prohibition on sub-leasing to trusts. The bill also provides for some amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920, including the establishment of a register of unencumbered aircraft to provide buyers and sellers of aircraft with information on registered security interests held by lenders and creditors over aircraft including airframes, engines and avionics. This initiative is supported by the aviation industry. Other amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920 relate to the current approval process for charter flights. The amendment will strengthen consumer protection provisions and streamline and better identify charter approval processes consistent with the government's aviation policy. The Airports Act provides for the future operating regime of privatised airports for the next 99 years-50 years with a 49-year option. At this stage I wish to put the new owners of these airports on notice about their responsibilities and their obligations under their new ownership. The whole of Perth airport will now lie in my seat because of the redistribution of the seat of Swan, so I now wish to direct my comments to the Perth airport. In a recent article in the West Australian there was some speCUlation about who the new owners will be. It is understood that the bidders have been given until 10 April to submit their revised bids, with June now looming as the deadline for the sale, as I said earlier. John Fahey has stated that the government sales team has reviewed the bids against a range of criteria including price, diversity of ownership objectives and airport management capacity. Whoever ends up 'owning/leasing' Perth airport needs to be aware of a number of obligations they will be required to adhere to. Because the airport will be in the hands of this new owner for some considerable time, I believe that the new Perth owners will need to develop a strategy like the good neighbour policy the current FAC management at Perth airport has in place. It is quite well known that up until a few years ago the Perth airport did not have a very satisfactory relationship with its neighbouring councils, some residents and the business community. Approximately three years ago a group called RAGE, or Retailers Against Government Enterprise, was formed. It was one of the most successful lobby groups that were formed in relation to Perth airport. It was headed by Wally Daly, a local business proprietor, with the support of a well-known lobbyist from Western Australia called Bill Mitchell. Unfortunately, Mr Mitchell has since passed on. This group was successful in addressing what were major concerns in the development of Perth airport land by commercial enterprises. At one stage it looked as though there would be a 20,000 square metre commercial development which would encroach on the local business community. There was so much contention in the Western Australian business community, especially the retail sector, that this group grew in stature and was able to attract the attention and the support of the Western Australian state government at the time. Some of the considerations in this project included not only a huge commercial site but other developments which were regarded as being incompatible with the local environment. As a result of that, and possibly with the change of government, this large commercial development did not go ahead. In fact, it became such a contentious issue that the developers were unable to obtain local planning approval for this commercial development. I believe the then Minister for Planning in Western Australia, Mr Lewis, even threatened to cut off road supply to that part of the airport if they did not have greater consensus with local councils in relation to planning approval. Under the management of the now FAC chairman in Perth, Mr Graham Muir, there has been a far better conciliation process with local councils and local commercial interests. I believe that the new proposal now being considered involves 5,000 square metres of retail floor space rather than 20,000 square metres. Compatible developments around the Perth airport include a three-star hotel. For those who do not know, Perth is absolutely bereft of hotel space at the moment. Perth hotels are continually booked out. I believe this will provide a great opportunity for compatible development on this land. There is also the possibility of a golf course being built in the local area, subject to environmental considerations. The Perth baseball community are currently looking for a home, and I suggest that they accept the proposal in the Ovens report, which was given many years ago to the Belmont City Council, of locating to the commercial area of Perth airport. It will not impact on residents as such because the beauty about Perth airport is that it has a huge buffer zone around the airport and is away from residential development. Perth Glory, a very successful soccer team, is also looking for a home. As many people are aware, dual purpose stadiums are the way to go. The Perth Heat and the Perth Glory soccer team sharing a stadium might be a very good usage of airport land. This is to be considered by the new owners and the new planning process for the Perth airport precinct. It is highly commendable that the government made sure that Perth was considered in the cross-ownership provisions and that Perth airport did not become an agency of Sydney.",66
165,Unknown,A VIA TION LEGISLATION,Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.,67
166,Mr RANDALL,A VIA TION LEGISLATION,"In the time. I have left, I would like to again bring to this House's attention a number of issues that particularly affect the Perth airport and its surrounds. When I was finishing before I made it clear that I was very pleased that the Perth airport was allowed to be out of the cross-ownership provisions. It will be a stand-alone purchase if that is the way it turns out and it will not become an appendage to the Sydney airport, where I had some grave concerns about its autonomy. I wish to now refer to environmental considerations regarding the Perth airport and its surrounds. In doing so I would like to bring to the House's attention also that there is considerable concern by local environmentalists regarding the natural bushland that surrounds the Perth airport and the buffer zone there. I have visited that part of the airport with Senator Ian Campbell, Senator Dee Margetts, Joan Payne from the WA Conservation Council and Mr Kevin MCLean from the local environmental group. We have looked at some significant areas of urban bushland, which is an important consideration in environment issues. Mundy Swamp is an example of a very good swamp. It is believed to have been the home of the very rare short-necked western tortoise. Unfortunately, they have not seen one for 23 years; however, it is believed that it may still be a good environment for them. What has caused the problem here is that those who designed and placed the new international terminal on the Perth airport placed it in such a way that, if there is to be a second parallel runway in many years to come, Mundy Swamp is under threat in terms of its existence. I believe this matter has been attended to in some respects because at one stage the Perth airport bushland was put on the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Council and the F AC challenged this listing on the basis of concerns that it had regarding this listing. This matter was arbitrated ally before the court and the area now has been removed from the Register of the National Estate. But this does not mean to say that there are not very important considerations that need to be taken into account regarding the urban bushland and the wetland surrounding the Perth airport. Again I put the new owners on notice that they have a great obligation in terms of environmental considerations for the Perth airport buffer zone. This will include the commercial activity that may be allowed there eventually and such things as the golf course. As the local member, I can assure the community in general and the community that represents the environment groups that wherever I can I will help in terms of preserving the natural bushland and the wetlands around the Perth airport. There are some very concerning aspects regarding environmental measures related to the area surrounding the Perth airport. For example, right next to the Perth airport are the major marshalling yards for Western Australia. On the odd occasion there have been some major oil spills. In fact, I went and witnessed one of these oil spills where a large diesel tank ruptured into the subterranean surface and leaked thousands of litres of diesel into the subsoil. They had spears in the soil trying to suck the diesel out of the soil and save it from getting into the ground water. However, it was leaching into the wetlands and going through the main drain through the Perth ai:rport and covertly being pumped off when it could be. So there are great considerations regarding some of the environmental matters surrounding the Perth airport. I would also like to make sure the House is aware that one of the great concerns at the moment is the fact that there are three overlapping native title claims on the Perth airport. In my opinion, there is a very good chance that some of these are not as genuine as they may first appear because there seem to be competing interests from three different groups who claim native title over the Perth airport. My advice is that where the airport has eventubeen developed-runways, buildings, et cetera-the title no longer exists. However, the parts of the airport that are considered to be urban bushland and remnant crown land are still subject to native title claims. This is why we need the government to make a decisive action regarding native title. I am sure it does not help the potential private owners of the Perth airport in their future ownership to have three overlapping native title claims on the airport. I would also like to mention a number of facts regarding the Perth airport. It grossed a profit in the 1995-96 year of $24 million. In the year before that it was $18 million. However, in 1988, when the F AC first took over, the Perth airport operated with a substantial loss. Since then there has been a 26 per cent annual growth and in the last three years profit levels have more than doubled. Most of this is non-aviation related. This is why there is great potential for the new owners to expand their commercial and developmental interests around the Perth airport. I do warn the new owners that they may have a little problem trying to make it any more efficient than it is at the moment because Graham Muir, whom I mentioned earlier, under his urbane stewardship sees the FAC making sure the Perth airport is a very efficient operation. Mr Graham Muir would be an asset to any of the new owners as a manager not only because of his ability to manage the airport in an economic manner and make sure it turns a profit but because of the fact that he is a great consulter. As I have said previously, he has taken the airport from being a contentious issue to local business and local councils to being a harmonious working relationship. I can assure you that he has made the term 'good neighbour policy' an effective one regarding the Perth airport. I would also like to make sure that the new owners understand their obligations and the protection that was given under the Airports Act 1996 regarding noise around the Perth airport. It is rather fatuous for the Labor Party to carry on about the noise around the Perth airport at the moment. They never, ever put money aside for noise studies regarding the Perth airport. They never did anything in a concrete way to help anybody who said that they had a noise problem. All they have done since they have lost office is run around and stir up local action groups and tell them quite incredible mistruths regarding their entitlements and make people feel they have some sort of entitlement that they actually do not have. This is seen around Sydney airport, and there are Labor members in Western Australia who certainly are trying to beat up this regarding the Perth airport. It is a shame that they would do this to the honest residents who live in areas surrounding the Perth airport, but that is not to say that the Perth airport does not have obligations regarding noise. The beauty about the Perth airport is that aircraft have to fly over areas of either uninhabited land or industrial land, except for one small section in South Guildford. As a result, the noise problem of the Perth airport is not as severe as anywhere else in Australia. I feel there are measures that can be taken to make sure that this is even further alleviated. As a member representing the people who live in areas surrounding the airport, I can guarantee those people that I will be acting on their behalf. Perth airport is a tourism hub and an airport freight hub. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, the report Jet fresh: paddock to plate gives the opportunity for a hub like Perth airport to enter into Asia in terms of air freight. That potential has not even been tapped yet. In terms of tourism, Western Australia is the gateway to Australia from the west, and it provides a tremendous opportunity for the marvellous tourist potential that Western Australia offers. We have a tourist potential in Western Australia, unlike anywhere else in Australia, that the rest of the world has not seen. Deregulated private ownership of the airport plus other aviation related measures will make sure that air travel is within the grasp of all Australians and far cheaper for international visitors. As a result, I want to see Perth airport deliver that. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Cadman) adjourned.

167,Mr MAREK,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Capricornia) (8.11 p.m.)The Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 is a step in the right direction for those of us involved in the industry. I am a pilot and owner-operator of a Cessna twinengine aircraft and, as a parliamentarian, I am required to travel extensively throughout Australia on major airlines. So I understand the problems-not only as a pilot but also as a passenger-that the industry is currently having. I should add at this point that much of the problem is coming from the hierarchy in the industry. I am talking about the aviation board: a group of appointees-most of whom have little to no experience in aviation. The people on the ground in the industryand I am talking about the investigators or liaison officers in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia-know their job. They know what is required of them to put the industry right. On the other hand, the industry is immersed within a bureaucracy that feeds the board, for want of a better word, absolute rubbish. The information that the bureaucracy is currently handing on to the board puts them in a situation where they only act on that but, more often than not, the information that they are given is not what is actually required to get the best job done the first time. The problem then grows as the aviation board is short of knowledge in the field and is more often than not misled. They then intervene when they are not required to do so. Further, I believe every ship should have a captain to make the tough decisions and to gi ve direction. But, seriously, you cannot tell me anyone in their right mind would appoint someone to captain a ship who has never touched the controls before. Likewise, those on the aviation board have no experience, no idea, no credibility and no leadership. They should not be there. At this point I must say that I expected, after being elected to the parliament, I could do more for the industry that means so much to me. But, alas, I am somewhat disappointed and frustrated-frustrated that we, the coalition government, have not yet been able to make the aviation industry more user-friendly, especially to the general aviation sector, although I will continue to drive for significant change with all the enthusiasm and resilience I have. I see the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is trying to take charge of this misguided group, the aviation board, and has put his best foot forward to fix the problem. So I say to the board: do you want to continue to be part of the problem or become part of the solution? To this end we have seen the public opinion that agrees the board must change more in line with the industry. Obviously now we see the group refuses to move despite the need for a safer industry. This direction will not happen while we have people who know nothing about the problems the industry is experiencing and continue to flounder against the need for change. In regard to the latest developments, the minister has moved to fix the problem only to come up against another brick wall. I talk of the obstructive Democrats in the Senate, in particular Senator Cheryl Kemot, another individual whose experience I would question in the field of aviation. This situation is precisely what I have been talking about in past addresses to the House with regard to knowledge of a topic or issue at hand. How can one profess to be representative of the people on any topic with no experience of the issue at hand? This is why the country is in trouble today. We have people making laws and changing legislation who have no knowledge of the topic. This brings me to an article in the Herald-Sun by Bob Stone entitled 'Kemot flies against public's wishes'. He says: Recently, Senator Cheryl Kernot stated she was not convinced that there was a need to change the board of the Civil Aviation Air Safety Authority. What will convince her ... a major air disaster? Whether she likes it or not, the electorate at large gave the coalition government a mandate to form a government, and as a government, it has a duty to look after the interests of all Australians, ing their safety. I am afraid that the Democrats under Senator Kernot are nothing more than a bunch of egotistical obstructionists. I rest my case. The amendments relating to international charter flights are an initiative that moves towards a more open and flexible international air charter market in Australia. The country city of Rockhampton in the electorate of Capricornia has an airport that has the capacity to handle overseas air charter flights for tourism and, even better, the ability to air freight food types to other countries. Runway 15-33, which is currently running plan with an extension to handle larger heavier aircraft, will fall right in line with change of legislation. The Capricorn International Resort at Yeppoon, some 40 minutes drive from the airport, has looked forward to the day when ment. they will be able to fly Japanese visitors direct to Rockhampton and then bring them to the resort. The extension to the runway the new legislation make this event quite possible. Another of the amendments casts light on the sale of encumbered aircraft, the registrain tion of security interests in relation to aircraft and their components. The register will enable the government to assist the industry with its economic viability by giving buyers and sellers of aircraft certainty of title. It is envisaged that Airservices Australia will be responsible for the development ongoing administration of the register, which will operate on a full cost recovery basis. approach has been agreed to by the industry. The availability of this information on ty interests held on aircraft and certain components will be of particular benefit to general aviation sector as this sector has been hit very heavily in the past by the economic downturn which, in turn, increases the risk exposure of undisclosed encumbrances. The register will protect the purchaser of an aircraft from buying a machine which has interest outstanding debt against it-and here I am talking about engines and engine components, airframes and internal equipment like avionics. This, I believe, will also assist in the tracking of bogus parts and/or the sale of includ- second-hand parts or components that are not up to scratch and subsequently fitted to aircraft which are not being caught by the system set up to safeguard against such occurrences. Too often, aircraft change hands with funds outstanding from the previous owner. In many cases, the aircraft has been sold because the owner could no longer afford to keep it, owing to the increases in maintenance costs, fuel hikes and landing fees. The cost to the owner/operator of aircraft these days is phenomenal and is only getting worse. I look to this government in the near future to continuing to put good legislation forward that will decrease the cost to owner/operators this and, therefore, stimulate the industry. People will then be able to afford the costs, thereby increasing the number of people involved in the industry and ultimately creating employIn years past, the previous Labor government has forced people out of aircraft. You and do not have to look too far to see how many people have discarded their light aircraft to purchase ultralight planes-aircraft that do not require 100 per cent attention to maintenance order for them to fly throughout the country. It is getting bad when people have to step away from the good old 172 that they might have used, say, in the electorate of the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) to check the fences and the water and, on the odd days, to zip into the local town to buy the weekly or and monthly groceries. The Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill This (No.1) 1997 is to provide certainty to new airport operators and existing airport tenants securiand to ensure that the Commonwealth can key exercise adequate regulatory control over the leased airports. The new subsection provides that an airport lessee company must not enter into an airport management agreement unless of the agreement has been approved in writing by the minister. This will enable the Commonwealth to ensure that the public is not prejudiced by these agreements. In general, this initiative is to ensure that an airport is used for the purpose as defined of aVIatIOn. With this in mind, many airports throughout the country have been sold off by the Commonwealth. This, once again, was another great milestone of the Australian Labor Party. They sold everything and now whinge that the coalition is selling off the country. Talk about hypocritical! Local government or the shire councils currently have most of the airports. In some cases a company or group could take ownership of one in a certain area and, if the airport were failing to cover its costs, the lessee may attempt to use the airport for another purpose, thereby obstructing the main task that is expected at that field, which must be aviation-the ability for aircraft to frequent the strip as required in accordance with the regulations. I commend the amendments to the House. The amendments are needed and are industry supported.",70
168,Mr HOCKEY,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"I am very grateful for the opportunity to be able to speak about environmental matters on the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 because this is the central focus of the proposed amendments. Specifically, we are including some new provisions in relation to variable penalties for breaches of environmental standards, providing new offences for deliberate harm to the environment, providing powers to allow preexisting contamination to be addressed and requiring airport lessees to seek public comment prior to submitting minor variations of master plans and major development plans to the minister for approval. The environment and aviation go hand in hand. Aviation, particularly in our modern cities and particularly in Sydney, relies significantly on the cooperation of the general public and on a harmonious relationship with the environment. That certainly has come into question over the last few years. Of course, we think only too often of the impact of the construction of Sydney's third runway, as it became known, on the environment and on the Sydney community. We should never for a second underestimate the importance of Kingsford Smith airport to the people of Sydney and to the Sydney basin. It has been there since 1919. More than 50 per cent of all international flights into Australia come into Kingsford Smith airport, and Kingsford Smith airport also handles over one-third of all domestic passengers. So, apart from having the massive infrastructure there that employs over 60,000 people and provides ongoing employment and further employment to a number of related industries and a large number of people, the airport is also the tourism and traffic hub of Australia. Forecasts suggest there will be an annual increase of 4.1 per cent of aircraft movements until the year 2000, and it is fair to assume that that growth will continue in the aftermath of the Sydney 2000 Olympics. According to the Department of Transport, in 1995-96 Kingsford Smith airport had 270,000 movements. This will increase to 316,500 movements in 1999-2000. Of those, 55,000 movements will be international, 235,000 will be domestic and 26,500 will be non-scheduled aircraft. I think this is a wonderful opportunity to go through some of the events that have occurred during the last few years, particularly in relation to the environmental management of Kingsford Smith airport. The most significant event was the opening of the third runway on 4 November 1994. It is a date that is indelibly marked on the minds of the people of Sydney. Within weeks the community's anger was palpable, culminating in a massive public rally held at Leichhardt Oval on 3 December 1994. Soon to follow, on 17 December, was a blockade of Sydney airport-an unprecedented event. Community anger was centred around the fact that the environmental impact statement associated with the construction of the third runway was proven to be misleading within days of the opening of the third runway. The ALP government on 20 December 1994 put in place the northern flight corridors. We all remember it: Paul Keating and Laurie Brereton standing in front of a massive map of the Sydney basin saying, 'We are going to shovel the planes up this narrow flight corridor.' That corridor became known as the Bennelong funnel. The funnel was, in effect, the most obvious example of the very base politics that the Australian Labor Party employed in relation to the airport. The problem became very significant in a very short time for over 200,000 Sydney residents who were receiving over 55 per cent of all traffic to the north of the airport. Reaction to the ALP's obvious disregard for the welfare of residents resulted in a second blockade at Sydney airport, this time at the domestic terminal, on 13 February 1995. The coalition was very aware of this anger because the coalition had been aware of the great dispute within the Australian Labor Party during the debate about whether a third runway should be constructed at Sydney airport or whether a second international airport should be constructed in Sydney. I am a fair man. I will recognise that credit should be given where it is due. The current member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) is recorded as saying that he was opposed to the construction of a third runway at Kingsford Smith airport. I think it is important at this juncture to refer to what became known as the bible of the Hawke-Keating years. I would like to quote from that bible. It is the Bantam publication Whatever It Takes, written by that authoritative source, Graham Richardson. Let me take you, Mr Deputy Speaker, into the politics, according to this authoritative source, of the debate about the construction of the third runway. He says: Two Labor held seats were in danger over the decision to build the runway. To be realistic, probably only one, St George, held by Steve DuboisI do not remember him; he is certainly not here these dayshad a big enough majority to survive. But Gary Punch's Barton stood out as a real electoral ty. I worried about this. With a worsening economy and interest rates going ever higher, I do not apologise for being concerned with issues of electoral wisdom. Here comes the clanger: However, Keating, Leo MCLeay and Peter Baldwin, among others, considered the problem of threatened seats only one of several factors. Their electoral bases were safe. This is Graham Richardson saying that Leo MCLeay and Peter Baldwin, two· people who have had a keen interest in the ramifications of the construction of the third runway on their electorates, thought it was okay: 'We have got a big enough margin; we do not have to worry about too many people in our electorates. ' Isn't that a sad indictment of the attitude of the Australian Labor Party? That is why they are in opposition today. It is that sort of pervading attitude-'My margin is big enough; I do not have to worry about it' - that put them there. I remember how during the six public meetings, which I will touch on a little later, the current member for Watson was standing in front of about 1,500 people in the Marrickville Town Hall professing his support for their concern about the ramifications of the construction of Sydney's third runway. I quote to the member for Watson what his own mate, the man who wrote the bible about the Hawke-Keating years, said. He says that the current member for Watson had no real concern for the constructionMr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the member for North Sydney knows that is a lie, and a damned lie, and he is implying something from those remarks in that book which is not true. If he has any honour, he will stand up and admit that.",72
169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,I do not think there is a point of order. He was quoting from a book. He was not claiming to misrepresent it. He is relevant to the debate on the bill because we are talking about environmental matters in aviation. I call the honourable member for North Sydney.,73
170,Mr HOCKEY,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"I am only quoting from the mate of the member for Watson. The mate of the member for Watson says, quite unequcasualivocally, that the member for Watson was unconcerned about the ramifications. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a further point of order: his problem is that he hasn't got a mate so he could not quote from a book that says anything about him. My point of order is that the member is just making up a tissue of lies here. He knows it; everyone else knows it. If he has any honour, he will stand up and say that.",73
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"The member for North Sydney is referring to the environmental issues which revolved around the development of the third runway in Sydney. The member for North Sydney is in order and might come back to the substance of the bill. Mr HOCKEYI am happy to do that. I did not know why the member for Watson was so sensitive about the contents of the book Whatever it takes. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not all that keen to enter into this debate, but he wants to be provocative so I am happy to accommodate him. I am not sensitive about this at all. His problem is that he is the one telling the fibs, not me.",73
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,There is no point of order. The honourable member for North Sydney has the call.,74
173,Mr HOCKEY,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have obviously touched a sore here. I can understand that it is a sore because it is a festering sore. Even today the people of Sydney will never forgive the Australian Labor Party for the construction of the third runway. They will never forgive the member for Watson for saying, 'It is okay to have this because I've got a big enough margin. I don't need to be too concerned.' In fact at the time he was the member for Grayndler, I think. What does that say? Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a further point of order: I never made any assertion like that whatsoever. If the member for North Sydney had any honour, he would tell the people of Sydney about the sleazy deal he has entered into with the Minister for Transport and Regional Development to take the planes off his electorate and that is why they stopped the extension of the new runway.",74
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"The honourable member for Watson will resume his seat. There is no point of order.  inference was that the member for North Sydney has entered into a 'sleazy deal', to quote the member for Watson's words. That should be withdrawn.",74
175,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Will the member for Watson assist the chair and withdraw those particular remarks, please? Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I find it fascinating. The quisling from the west who was referred to by my colleague here from",74
176,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"No, we are not here to debate the issue. Would you assist the chairMr Leo MCLeay-I have not said anything about him. The member for North Sydney wears that as a badge of honour. He said nothing. I did not say anything about the minister, so I have nothing to withdraw.",74
177,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"You are not here to debate it. The member for North Sydney has the call. Mr HOCKEYI am very glad that the member for Watson has come in here. I wonder if the member for Watson has consulted with his close friend and colleague the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) about his attitude on the delay in the extension of the threshold on the third runway? Does the member for Grayndler share your views about what it really means? I might ask the member for Watson to go back to his electorate and ask his constituents, probably for the first time, whether they actually agree with the extension of the threshold, which was, after all, a part of the third runway EIS originally. But, then again, the member for Watson has never had a particularly keen interest in representing the people of his electorate. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, my point of order is: you can get this member back to the debate before the chair or you can let him involve himself in irrelevancies. If he wants to continue to try to impute some motive to me, I will continue to take points of order to put my point on the record. My constituents do not like anything that his government has done with Sydney airportnothing at all.",74
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"The honourable member for Watson will resume his seat. There is no point of order. I ask the member for North Sydney to restrict his comments to the bill that is being debated in the chamber. Mr HOCKEYI am happy to do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am happy to talk about the environmental ramifications of the aviation proposals before us. The most significant outcome of the election campaign was the policy of the coalition in the lead-up to 2 March election. That policy, Putting People First, indeed did just that it put people first. What we said was that we were going to put the people of Sydney first when it came to discussions about the environmental impact of the operations of Kingsford Smith airport. That policy manifests itself today in what has become known as the long-term operating plan for Kingsford Smith airport. This plan, put together by the industry, the various community groups, Airservices Australia, the Department of Transport and all the various interested parties, offers a total solution for the problems immediately associated with Kingsford Smith airport. What we promised in January and February of 1996 was that we were going to spread the noise around, that Sydney airport could cope with the demands, which I have talked about a little earlier, of the 21st century. What we wanted to do was put in place a comprehensive system that introduced new modes of operation at Kingsford Smith airport, was able to share the noise around and, at the same time, was going to address the concerns of specifically the people who suffered under the Bennelong funnel-the Bennelong funnel that people like the member for Watson said was okay for their electorates because they had a significant enough majority to cope with some of the dissent. They significantly underestimated the dissent in the community. That dissent has come to the fore in two ways. Firstly, it was a direct part of the development of the coalition's policy. Secondly, the concern of the Sydney community is directly conveyed to the minister today through the Sydney Airport Community Forum. The community forum, which I am fortunate enough to chair, has representatives from the Australian Labor Party, including the members for Grayndler and Barton (Mr MCClelland), the state members for Heffron, Diedre Grusovin, and Lane Cove, Kerry Chikarovski, and a number of mayors. Most of those mayors are not obvious supporters of the coalition, including the Marrickville mayor, who is obviously not a supporter of the coalition. That group has come together to have some important feed into the decision making process at Kingsford Smith airport. As a part of this plan, over 1,500 submissions were received from the general public, including representative groups. We also held six public meetings. Most of the public meetings were held in Labor Party seats. What I find most interesting is that the public meetings held in Labor Party seats, such as in the town hall at Marrickville-the members for Grayndler and Watson are party to thisattracted about 2,000 people. In total, about 6,000 people attended the public meetings and had some feed into the long-term operating plan. The net result is that the plan is being considered further by the Commonwealth government. I urge the minister for transport to adopt the plan. I urge the government to fully support its implementation. The beneficiaries of the plan, which benefits the Sydney community significantly, are mostly the people immediately to the north of the airport. It is not just the people in my electorate of North Sydney who benefit and it is not just the people in the electorates of Bradfield and Bennelong who benefit. People in the electorates of Grayndler and Watson are also the big beneficiaries of this plan. We are happy to go into bat for the people of Watson and Grayndler because their own members are not representing them and are not batting for them at any time. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ",74
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"I call the honourable member for Watson, on a relevant point of order, I hope. Mr Leo MCLeay-Absolutely, Mr Deputy Speaker: I am concerned that this new member, who has not been here too long, is intent on misleading the parliament tonight. That is a very serious and unfortunate thing for him to do, and that is what he is doing.",75
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,The member for Watson knows that there are forms of the House to use if he is going to make those sorts of accusations. There is no point of order.,75
181,Mr HOCKEY,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Before we came into government on 2 March 1996, over 50 per cent of all air traffic went to the north of the airport. Currently, it is around 35 per cent. Under this plan, it will be 17 per cent. And the immediate and most significant beneficiaries are not Liberal Party voters; they are Labor Party voters. They are the Labor Party voters that were abandoned by the Labor Party when they constructed the third runway. They are the Labor Party voters who abandoned the Labor Party on 2 March 1996. (Time expired)",76
182,Mr LEE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"What the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) forgot to mention to the House is that when the great debate was taking place in the federal parliament about whether or not to build the third runway, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) was in the House of Representati yes day after day opposing the construction of the third runway and the honourable member for North Sydney was working for the Greiner governmentMr Ronaldson- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: this is a point of relevance. It does not relate in any way to the matter before the House. I would ask the member to return to the substance of the bill.",76
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Mr Vail e)There is no point of order. There has been a wide-ranging debate concerning the third runway and the environmental impacts, which are somewhat relevant to the bill.",76
184,Mr LEE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Thank you for your protection, Mr Deputy Speaker, and for giving me the right to express my point of view in this debate. It is a pity that someone as junior as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), who is at the table, tries to inhibit proper debate on this issue. The honourable member for Watson was in the House of Representatives day after day explaining his reasons for opposing the construction of the third runway. In contrast, the honourable member for North Sydney, at that time probably a very junior member on the staff of one of the Greiner government ministers, was out thereMr Hockey-Not junior.",76
185,Mr LEE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Well, perhaps he was a large member on the staff of one of the Greiner government ministers. They were out there running a public campaign to increase pressure on the Hawke government to build the third runway. Mr Leo MCLeay-It might have been his idea!",76
186,Mr LEE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"In fact it might have been his idea to build the third runway, as my colleague the member for Watson interjects. It might have been his idea to build the third runway which has resulted in extra noise over his electorate. Mr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: there is no way that I was a party at any stage to any decision to support the construction of a third runway.",76
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,There is no point of order. You can't participate in the debate.,76
188,Mr LEE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"There is no secret about the senior officers of the Department of State Development, probably carrying out the instructions of the now member for North Sydney and his ministers, pressuring the state government of New South Wales, trying to pressure the federal government to build the third runway. Let the facts speak for themselves. We also note that, despite many promises from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), the government has failed to accept the responsible legislation which has been advocated by my colleague the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) to impose a legal cap of 80 movements per hour. Mr Hockey-Where is it? You know that you had no cap on the airport.",76
189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,Order! The member for North Sydney has had his tum for a contribution.,76
190,Mr LEE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"We are waiting; here is your chance. At the end of this debate, we could suspend standing orders and bring on the debate for the honourable member's bill. Mr Albanese-We might just do that.",76
191,Mr LEE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"We might just do that. But the important thing is that promise after promise has been made by the minister, guarantee after guarantee has been given, but the government has not been prepared to introduce legislation to impose that cap to make sure they are not just relying on some regulations to maintain that ceiling of 80 movements per hour. The other point I make to the member for North Sydney is: whatever happened to the promise made to the constituents of the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) that there would be no extra flights over that electorate? What happened to that promise? Spaghetti has been left all over the electorate of Lowe with all the flight paths causing extra noise for constituents. Mr Hockey-The member for Lowe is out there fighting for his constituents.",77
192,Mr LEE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,Doesn't the member for Lowe speak up for his constituents? Mr Leo MCLeay-He just did in the member for Lowe.,77
193,Mr LEE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"He did in the member for Lowe; it would not surprise me. He tried to claim credit for it anyway, even if he did not. I actually rose tonight not to speak about the third runway but to respond to some other comments that were made in the debate earlier tonight. My colleague the member for  of remarks that have resulted in my seeking the call to make a few comments in support of the Australian tourism industry. But before I get on to that I would remind the House that in my maiden speech I said that the honourable member for Shortland was the greatest Minister for Transport Australia had had since the war. The point I would like to make is that, when I first arrived in the Australian parliament, Peter Morris, the member for Shortland, was the acknowledged expert on transport matters. He displayed in his contribution earlier tonight that he continues to be extremely well informed and remains up to date in many ways about the issues that are before the parliament tonight and that affect aviation. He has always been a strong advocate for making sure that Australia's interests are protected in aviation and shipping, and other matters. I would just take up a few of the issues that the member for Shortland raised in the debate. He quite rightly pointed out that in the past, when Australia was negotiating airline agreements, we often used to adopt positions based on what we thought was best for the Australian airline-in practice, what we thought was best for Qantas, which was then the only international airline owned by Australians. Some years ago, during the time of the former Labor government, the philosophy changed so that we were looking at what would be the best position to advance the economic interests of Australia. That certainly its is the way we should be going now, especially with the Australian tourism industry having grown dramatically in the last decade. If we want to make sure that we maximise not just the foreign exchange earnings for Australia but also the number of jobs that we create in Australia, we need to balance what is in the interests not just of the Australian owned airlines but also of creating jobs and investment in Australia. I believe that there have been discussions between the shadow minister for transport,. the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), and the minister for transport about ways in which we can seek to improve the current proposal which is before the House to make sure that we do get a proper consideration and proper analysis of how we can estimate those benefits for Australia. There has been a bit of debate about charters and whether we should be making it easier for air charters to bring mOre tourists to Australia. During my time as Minister for Tourism in the last government, there were a number of examples of where charters had been able to grow and expand potential markets for the Australian tourism industry. In particular, I think there were a number of flights from Singapore to regional areas that really blazed the trail for increasing tourism from a number of countries in Asia. Also, I think the British market to a large extent still depends on large numbers of charter flights each year, despite the large number of scheduled flights between Britain and Australia. If we did not have those charter flights from Britain, despite the relalots tively large number of them, I think the Australian tourism industry would probably be receiving fewer English tourists and in many ways probably fewer English backpackers. However, despite what people have thought in the past, backpackers often are the ones who stay the longest and spend the most during their extended stay in Australia. I know that people on both sides of House probably would prefer to see more scheduled flights. But, if we can use charters to advance the economic interests of Australia, that is something which should be welcomed. The member for Shortland also said that we should be trying to address this issue which often gets raised of how much economic benefit flows to Australia if you have people flying on overseas owned, foreign owned, airlines, staying at foreign owned hotels, allegedly shopping at foreign owned duty-free stores. This issue often gets raised in the tourism industry, and people ask how much of the money stays in Australia, especially if the airfares are prepaid overseas. In fact, there have been a number of studies on this issue. They have all concluded that up to 80 per cent or so of the land component of these overseas holidays stays in Australia. If you stay at a hotel, no matter who owns it, someone has to provide the food that is served there and local staff are employed there in the hotel to provide the services. No matter who owns the hotel, it is not just a matter of cooking hamburgers and making beds; there are jobs in management and careers paths for young Australians, in particular, to advance and make their way. The member for Shortland also raised a very important issue about the calls by some people, including myoid friend Bruce Baird from the Tourism Council of Australia, for the abolition of visas or the identification perhaps a dozen or so countries for which visas should be abolished. The member for Shortland quite rightly raised the concerns that will follow if we do abolish visas for some countries. He is not the first person to raise in this House concerns about what happens if you allow visa-free entry from Japan and other countries. There have been of stories in the paper about the Yakuza and other crime syndicates-not just those involving Japanese citizens. I know that a number of members on the government side of the House have also expressed strong concerns in the past about making sure that visa checks remain very thorough and we make sure that people of poor character or who are involved in organised crime, drug trafficking or other unsavoury activities are prevented from coming to Australia. I have always thought that some people in the tourism industry, including Mr Baird, exaggerate the impact that visas have on tourism to Australia. I seem to recall a study once which claimed that billions of dollars in foreign exchange earnings were lost because we required people from other countries to have visas. When you went back to the raw data of the survey, you found that it was 80 people who happened to be accosted as they arrived in Australia. The amount of rigour which that survey entailed would lead me to question the validity of some of the conclusions that were made. I think the department of immigration has been working for a number of years on the introduction of electronic visas. If the department is still able to meet its targets, that will go a long way towards making it easier for international visitors to travel to Australia because they will not have to send their passports away. It will allow people to get their visas more easily and more quickly without having the inconvenience, but it will also ensure that those character checks are still carried out. A comment was made about the number of seats available for flights into and out of Australia-that is, about 330,000 per year. People have commented that only 200,000 of those available seats are actually utilised. I of think we have to be careful not to exaggerate the impact or the meaning that might be read into that. A number of airlines who have the right to fly to Australia do not. A number of airlines do not use their full capacity. Let us look at the number of flights that have been agreed between Australia and Korea, or Australia and Taiwan or Australia and Indonesia. As the tourism flows have grown, Australia has, through negotiations, agreed to increase the number of flights per week from those countries. That has certainly led to a significant boost to the Australian tourism industry because the airlines then have a vested interest in filling their seats and in making sure that more tourists from their country come to Australia on holidays. This is not to deny the comments . made by the member for Shortland that the United States and the European Union are fiercely aggressive in defending their airline rights. I think we have to apply the test that I mentioned earlier of working out the best way to develop the most economic benefit to Australia. Simply because some other countries have anti-competitive practices does not mean that we should automatically make the same mistakes as them. If we liberalise air service agreements from other countries to Australia, the test will be whether that delivers increases in the number of tourists coming to Australia or whether that delivers extra foreign exchange earnings, especially if our airlines are slightly less worse off. We have to work out on that balance sheet whether or not there is an economic benefit to Australia. That is the way to do it. I am sure all those who hold out hope that there are extra jobs in the Australian economy as a result of the tourism industry want to make sure that we get that balance right.",77
194,Mr LEO MCLEAY,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Watson) (8.56 p.m.}It is unfortunate that the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) scuttled out of the chamber before the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and I made our contributions. As the member for North Sydney knows, by bringing into the debate the canards that he did, he has opened up the debate to a number of areas which the government probably would not feel all that comfortable about. The Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. I) 1997 before the House tonight is about the environmental impacts of the use of airports. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) said in his second reading speech that he and the government 'want to include offences for deliberately causing environmental harm'. He also said that the environmental protection regulations 'will establish a regime to identify and manage any pollution or sources of pollution at the leased airport sites'. Everyone knows that the greatest form of pollution at any of the airports around Australia, most particularly at Sydney airport, is noise pollution. All the people living in western suburbs know that the person responsible for noise pollution around their homes is the member for North Sydney. He has done a sleazy deal in collusion with the minister for transport. The government made an election pledge to move a problem that the Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), hadthat is, the noise over the poor little people in his electorate-and spread it over everyone else. This was the most wicked example of self-interest that anyone has seen here in a long day's march. The member for Bennelong said, 'It is really shocking that the millionaires who live in Hunters Hill'-who are the ones in the aeroplanes-'have to put up with the noise caused by their neighbours in these aeroplanes. We will get the member for North Sydney to set up this committee and move the noise into someone else's electorate.' The government attempted to buy the last election. As I outlined in the MPI today, another electoral bribe put forward by the government was the Prime Minister saying that you could trust him on health. This is another one of those electoral bribes. The Prime Minister has said that you can trust him on airports. He told the gullible electors in Lowe that they could trust him; that the government would remove noise pollution from the electorate of Lowe. The people of Lowe might be able to have a go at the government because the government said that they want to include offences for deliberately causing environmental harm. The Prime Minister promised that there would be no aeroplanes flying over the electorate of Lowe. The people in the electorate of Lowe have a credibility problem because they wake up every morning to these aeroplanes when the Prime Minister told them that there would be no planes flying over Lowe. The member for North Sydney gave the game away five minutes ago. He said that the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) could speak for himself. The truth is that the government has cut the member for Lowe adrift. He is dispensable now. The government has a big majority; it does not care about the member for Lowe. Poor old Paul Zammit has members of the Liberal Party in the Lebanese community wanting to do him in. He has members of the Liberal Party in the Greek community wanting to do him in, and now he has the member for North Sydney wanting to do him in because he does not matter. They have got to organise this noise pollution and environmental harm in a way that suits them. The way that suits them is to get the planes out of the member for Bennelong's electorate because he is the Prime Minister and you cannot upset his constituents, for goodness sake, and we have got to get the planes out of the member for North Sydney's electorate because he is the chairman of the Sydney airport noise abatement committee or whatever it is called now. He cannot have any noise, because there is no point in appointing him to this most important committee if he cannot get the planes out of his electorate. So the poor old member for Lowe has just got to sit there and cop it and the planes will zoom down Jet AIley, down there through Dobroyd Point and over there through Ashfield. They will all zoom through the member for Lowe's electorate and when the poor member for Lowe's voters wake up every morning they will think, 'But hang on, we remember the last election and we remember the Prime Minister coming out here and saying that we won't have to worry about environmental harm' - and this biII does talk about environmental harm-'and we won't have to worry about offences for deliberately causing environmental harm; we won't have to worry about the noise.' They voted for the member for Lowe as a result of that, but what do they find now? They find that the member for North Sydney and the government have cut him adrift. They have said: 'Paul Zammit? Well, he's expendable. We'll just let those planes rip up there through Jet Alley so that the Prime Minister and the good old member for North Sydney, who is chairman of the noise committee for the government, are protected.' The member for North Sydney has got the hide to come in here tonight and try to impute motive to people on this side. The problem the member for North Sydney has is that the rotten government that he is part of and the predecessors of this rotten government have been trying to do their damnedest to build up Sydney airport since the seventies, since the days of Malcolm Fraser and his major airport needs of Sydney expansion program. The people around Sydney beat that. Now we have the current government saying that they have this little bilI here tonight in which they want to include offences for deliberately causing environmental harm and they want to establish a regime to identify and manage. That interesting word 'manage' is in the second reading speech on the top line of page 2, but it is in inverted commas. So what does 'manage' mean? What they mean by managing air pollution and noise pollution is that they manage it into someone else's electorate. They manage it into the electorates of my coIleague the member for Grayndler and my electorate, but they manage it out of tht? electorates of the member for North Sydney and the member for Bennelong. That is what they mean by 'manage' and that is why, in my view, 'manage' is there in inverted commas. Of course, you have the other person who has been sacrificed on their altar of airport expediency. That is the poor old member for Hughes (Mrs Vale). The poor old member for Hughes literaIly came in here on a wing and a prayer and she has been doing a bit more praying than winging lately. Her problem is that she has got in here as a member of the government. The people of Hughes ought to really pray for the member for Hughes because she has been terrific for them. Since she got here the government has given her a nuclear reprocessing plant in her backyard and it is now about to give her a 24-hour operation airport. The contagious diseases hospital and the locust plague will be along next week. That is what the member for Hughes has been given. So she has been cut adrift. The member for Lowe has also been cut adrift. The poor old member for Hughes and the poor old member for Lowe are sort of just dopes in the old Liberal Party regime. They got in here but, unfortunately, they were not supposed to get in here, I don't think. Mr Albanese--The wrong side of the harbour. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-They come from the wrong side of the harbour, as my colleague says. But the member for Bennelong and the member for North Sydney and the old mad monk over here are part of the ascendancy, they are part of the Liberal Party royalty, they have got to be protected at all costs. So they have these arrangements whereby they dump into poor old Danna's backyard an airport that will run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But they never told anyone about it before the election-they never mentioned a word about it. As for the member for Lowe and the poor old election promise they made to him, that mustn't have been a core promise because it is now not a promise. The only real core promise is to look after Liberal royalty, which is to look after the member for North Sydney and the member for Bennelong. That is not good enough. If we are going to have a sensible regime in this country about how to deal with pollution and its sources and if we are going to have a sensible regime that deals with those people who deliberately cause environmental harm, we need to address sensibly the question of Sydney airport and not accept quick fixes and smart snide comments from the member for North Sydney, who, I might say, I find a decent bloke. I do not mind him at all. He is a good fellow. You meet him over at the Irish Embassy and have a beer with him and he is a decent bloke. The trouble is that he comes in here and tells a lot of fibs. That is the real problem with him. He is like a chameleon. One minute you meet him and the other minute he is out there fibbing his head off. He comes in here and he tells a lot of fibs and puts some constructions on what is in a book. When they write the book about him and Nick Greiner, crikey, we will all be quoting from that bookl Mr Abbott- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER Mr LEO MCLEA Y-He knows all about books. He's trying to bum them at present.",79
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Mr Hollis)Order! Mr Abbott-Pulping will be sufficient. Mr Deputy Speaker, I understand the interest that the member for Watson has in this matter and I understand the passion which he feels on the subject. I also understand the pleasure he takes and the great savour he has of the parliamentary theatre, but I do think that to repeatedly accuse the member for North and Sydney of fibbing is akin to accusing the member for North Sydney of lying. I do not think that should be done. I suggest that the member for Watson be asked to withdraw those comments.",81
196,Mr LEO MCLEAY,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs reckons the member for North Sydney is a liar, that is his problem. That is not mine. I do not think he is a liar at all. I just think he is a fibber.",81
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,The parliamentary secretary has asked for those comments to be withdrawn and it would assist the process of the debate if the member for Watson would withdraw what the parliamentary secretary finds offensive.,81
198,Mr LEO MCLEAY,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"The problem is, Mr Deputy Speaker, that",81
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Nol Come on, you have been in this chair. You know the game. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-That is right. That is the trouble. I do know the game and that is the problem. As for the honourable member for North Sydney, he is not here.",81
200,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,You know that any member can take offence at something they thinkMr LEO MCLEA YI would think it is amazing that a book burner could take offence at anything.,81
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"It would help the chair and it would also help the process of the debate if the honourable member for Watson would just withdraw. Then we can continue with the debate. Mr LEO MCLEA Y- Mr Deputy Speaker, I find this a fascinating point of order that the book burner has taken, because",82
202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,You know better than I that you should refer to honourable members by their correct title. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-But he is a book burner.,82
203,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,No. Come on.,82
204,Mr LEO MCLEAY,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,He is. Mr Ronaldson-On a point of order: the member for Watson is clearly defying your request in relation to this matter. I would ask you to pursue the matter with some vigour.,82
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"I think the honourable member for Watson, as a member of long standing and great experience, is perhaps debating the issue. I wish he wouldn't. I have invited him to just withdraw the comments that members have found offensive and then we can continue with this most interesting debate and the House can continue. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-Dear me, the book burner is a softer flower than the member for North Sydney. The member for North Sydney did not object to me calling him a fibber. He did not even object to me calling him a liar. He was happy with that. Mr Abbott-I really do not wish to make a big song and dance about this, but it is the duty of the chair to maintain the standards of this place. You are attempting to do so. The member for Watson is acting in a way which does not become a former Speaker of this place. I really do believe that, as you have said to him, all he needs to do is to withdraw the insinuation that the member for North Sydney is habitually untruthful. I would also appreciate it if he would refer to the member for Warringah by his title as well.",82
206,Mr LEO MCLEAY,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,I give up.,82
207,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"All you have to say, as you well know, is 'I withdraw' and then we can continue with the debate. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-If the book burner is not happy, I am happy to withdraw. I am more than happy to withdraw, because",82
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"As the honourable member for Watson has said many times from this position, 'You must refer to members by their correct title.' Mr LEO MCLEA Y-The reason I am so happy to withdraw is that to compare any decent fibber to the member for North Sydney is a terrible calumny on a decent fibber. I apologise to the member for North Sydney but, more particularly, I apologise to all those decent fibbers out there who are just telling small lies. To put them in the same class as a master blaster like the member for North Sydney is just being bad to them altogether. The member for Warringah is not really a book burner; he is not up in that class. He is just an ordinary little suer. Mr Abbott-On a point of order: I know that the member for Watson has studied the history of this place and he obviously is aware of the famous reference of former Prime Minister Hughes to former Prime Minister Deakin in reference to Judas Iscariot. He is attempting to model some kind of an attack on the member for North Sydney along the same lines. It is unbecoming for the member for Watson, having enjoyed a drink with the member for North Sydney earlier, to be carrying on like this. Mr Deputy Speaker, I really do believe it is incumbent on you to ask the member for Watson to settle down.",82
209,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"We should proceed with the debate and we should refer to all members by their correct title. This is an important debate for many people, so we should continue with the debate. It has been a wide-ranging debate. Everyone in the chair has permitted a wide-ranging debate. We do not want to narrow the debate, but we must insist that members be referred to by their correct title and that the debate continues. Mr LEO MCLEA YThank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. That was a Solomon-like decision. I think the parliamentary secretary was right. There should be a little more decorum here. I think that the slur he cast on the member for North Sydney-he suggested that he had been drinking before he came into this chamber-is disgraceful. Maybe he might want to withdraw that, because that is what he was saying. You can't be too smarty pants and come in here and get funny. Maybe you have hoisted yourself on your own petard. Maybe you should go back to suing and book burning rather than trying to get a little too clever in here and a little too smart for your own good. The trouble is that that is the problem this government has. Their problem is that they are all a little too smart for their own good. The member for North Sydney wants to come in here in a debate and try to blackguard others. The fact of the matter is that he and the government are mixed up in a lousy, stinking, sleazy deal to do over the people of the inner western suburbs of Sydney. They are involved in this filthy, corrupt, sleazy deal to cut loose the poor old member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) and to make him dispensable just so that the Liberal Party royalty over there on the North Shore, of which the parliamentary secretary at the table is part, can go out there, sue people and bum books and in the end say, 'We've put the problem somewhere else.' The poor old member for Hughes (Mrs Vale)-she is a oncer and she can go out the door. And the poor old member for Lowe, as the member for North Sydney said, can speak for himself. The interesting thing is that we have not heard him so far tonight. Mr Albanese-Where is he?",82
210,Mr LEO MCLEAY,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Where is he? It is quarter past nine. This debate has been going since just after 8 o'clock. We have not heard from him. Goodness knows where he is. The minister says, 'We are going to come up with a pollution regime'-a regime which includes offences for deliberately causing environmental harm. Yet they are out there causing the most massive environmental harm to the inner suburbs of Sydney and getting away with it! They have gone out there and told lies to the people in that part of Sydney. They have let the poor member for Lowe go out there and say to people, 'You can trust the Prime Minister. He won't let you down.' They have let the member for Hughes go out there and say, 'You can trust the government but, by the way, after the election there is an airport in your backyard.' As well, the poor woman gets a nuclear reprocessing plant. I suppose that is probably going to be a beacon for the planes because they will all be lighting up of a night. The problem is that this bill shows the absolute hypocrisy of the government-a government that says it wants to include offences for deliberately causing environmental harm. The trouble is that if it really wanted to do that it would have to gaol the minister, the member for Bennelong and the member for North Sydney because they are the ones who are creating the environmental harm in Sydney right now.",83
211,Mr ALBANESE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Grayndler) (9.16 p.m.)I am pleased to speak on this issue tonight because it is important that the inner west be represented in this debate on the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill. The member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) certainly will not be speaking in this debate, because the member for Lowe is cowering and running from anything to do with Sydney airport. I am pleased also because this bill is in part about charter flights. It is interesting that the issue of charter flights comes up, because back on 6 November 1996 I asked a question of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp )-question No. 927 on the Notice Paper-about an Evergreen Airlines flight over my electorate of Grayndler on 15 October 1996. I asked that question because I had a number of representations from dozens of residents who saw fuel being dumped over their homes, over their schools, over their clothes, over their cars, over their suburbs-carcinogens being dumped on their heads where they live. It is interesting that it took the minister for transport five months to give a response. Eventually I did get a response about this Evergreen Airlines flight. The response that I got is quite astonishing. It appears that it was a flight chartered from Qantas-a B747200 departing to the north, the favoured mode of operation under the long-term operating plan. That aircraft departed, on its way to Hong Kong, with 240,300 pounds or 35,865 US gallons of fuel. And what happened? I will read you the minister's response. It states: It is reported that the aircraft released fuel take-off to Russell Leain the electorate of Lowea distance of about 10 kilometres. For 10 kilometres fuel was dumped on the residents of Sydney and on their homescarcinogens: poisonous, damaging to their health, damaging to their houses and damaging to our environment. It appears that Airservices Australia wrote to the operator, Evergreen International, requesting that an inspection take place and that any fault be . quickly rectified. The matter was also taken up with Qantas, given that they were the charterer of the aircraft. What is extraordinary is that the investigation found that there were five-not one, not two, not three, not four, but five-broken vent valves in the wing tanks. There were five tanks pouring out carcinogens on my electorate. What is the response from the minister? To sit on this matter for five months; to not give an answer to the residents of the inner western suburbs of Sydney; to not give an answer to me as the member for Grayndler; to not give an answer to the discredited member of the extreme right of the Liberal Party, the member for Lowe. It went even further. The minister also replied to my question of how many similar incidents have occurred since November 1995. You might have expected the courtesy of a detailed response: 'Yes, and these were the details.' But what I got was simply a oneliner: 'Three similar alleged incidents have occurred.' We are talking about 10 kilometres of fuel dumping on the heads of residents of Sydney, and on three other occasions similar incidents have occurred. Today I have put questions on notice to the minister asking exactly what those incidents were, because residents have a right to know when carcinogens are being dumped on their families, homes and schools. The minister's response to solving the problem is pathetic. He has hit them with a feather. You would expect some sort of penalty-a financial impost, the banning of the particular aircraft, some action which says to these airlines that the government actually thinks this is not on and that the government from actually cares about the residents of Grayndler and the residents of Lowe. Perhaps if the fuel had kept coming out and had gone on to the residents of Hunters Hill we would have had some action. But what we see from this government is, 'If it ain't over the North Shore, it doesn't matter.' The minister's pathetic response just says: Should any future incidents occur, the issue will again be raised with the operator as a matter of urgency. Oh dear me! Airlines dumping fuel over residents and, if it occurs again, it will just be raised with the operator as a matter of urgency: 'We'll pick up the phone. We won't take any action, but we will raise it.' I am sure that the multimillion dollar airline industry will be quaking in their boots at such decisive action from the minister! It is interesting that the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) has tonight raised the issue of Sydney airport and prattled on about the great job being .done by the Sydney Airport Community Forum. I am proud to be a member of the Sydney Airport Community Forum and I think that some of the work it has done has been very valuable. But I have to say this: what is the value of this North Shore Hockey club when we are not told about incidents such as this; when we are not told about the proposal to move the third runway threshold; when we are not told about the Rockdale proposal to build a Darling Harbour type development; when we are not told about the $800 million expansion for the Olympics-we read that on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday-and when we are not told about the incompetent mismanagement and mistakes in the long-term operating plan that has been released? Now we are not told about jets dumping barrels of fuel on the most densely populated area in Australia. That is pretty consistent with the lack of action. We still see from this government no legislative cap on Sydney airport, we still see no second airport for Sydney, we still see no real noise relief for residents around Sydney airport and we still see chaos at that airport. In this House during the last fortnight I asked the minister whether he was still committed to a legislative cap and, if so, when he would introduce it. I was told 'soon'. The government have a whole department at their disposal. They have advisers over there-boxes of them. The other side of the House is full of these spivs who have now moved away from the airport flight paths. They used to live under them but they have moved away from there to get away from the noise. They moved away from Leichhardt because they did not like it and because they knew that this minister would not solve the problems. But why the delay when the minister has a whole department at his disposal? Even I, a newly elected backbench opposition member, could get together a bill. I got a bill together and introduced it into this House. It was seconded by the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), who tonight gave an eloquent exposition of why he opposes the chaos at Sydney airport. Why the delay? Look at the Liberal policy of 29 January 1996 called 'Putting people first'. It said: The Coalition will cap aircraft movements at 80 movements per hour ... That was the then opposition policy that was launched by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the electorate of Lowe. It counts for nothing. We then had a press release from John Howard on 8 February 1996-that is, last year; not this year-which stated: The Coalition will cap aircraft movements at the current capacity of 80 movements per hour. Again, nothing happened. So I put together a bill, which had its first reading on 4 November and its second reading on 18 November. On 18 November 1996 the minister released a media statement headed 'Sydney airport aircraft movements cap to be legislated'. It stated: The Government will introduce its own legislation to enshrine the 80 movements cap. Again, nothing happened. The minister actually said in that press release that substantial work had already been done on this. Substantial work has supposedly been done, but five months later nothing has happened. In the House Paul Zammit, the discredited member of the extreme Right of the New South Wales Liberal Party and whom the Left, including the member for North Sydney, and the John Howard faction, including the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott)Mr Tanner-The uglies.",83
212,Mr ALBANESE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Believe it or not, the member for Warringah is a moderate in the context of the New South Wales Liberal Party and compared with the member for Lowe and the uglies, the old Urbanchich mob, in the New South Wales Liberal Party branch who reared their ugly heads in a ballot at the last state council. The member for Lowe, Mr Zammit, said in the Hansard of 18 November 1996, 'It will occur early in 1997.' Define 'early'. It is now towards the end of March. He is the holder of a marginal seat north of the airport but the government are prepared to just throw him away because they do not really care about the member for Lowe. Then we come to the long-term operating plan. It is an interesting plan. There they show their real contempt for the member for Lowe. The long-term operating plan lists suburbs and the impacts on the residents of Sydney. The only problem is they left out 30,000 people. The postcodes for Haberfield and Five Dock-2045 and 2046-are just not there. Maybe if we leave the people out they will not be affected. Mr Hockey-They're not affected.",85
213,Mr ALBANESE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"The member for North Sydney says that they are not affected. The people of Haberfield and Five Dock will be pleased to know that he is acknowledging that there are in fact no planes over their heads, that there is acid in the water flowing through the taps of Haberfield and Five Dock. The residents of Haberfield and Five Dock must be seeing things, they must be hallucinating. When we look at the maps we see how far the dishonesty goes. Maps 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 10 are all wrong. Mode 3 says 'Departuresrunway 16 left; arrivals-runway 34 left. ' We all know that at Sydney airport long-haul jets effectively have to depart to the north, but they do not appear in the maps. Mode 5 says 'Long haul jet arrivals-16 right', but the maps which purport to tell residents where the planes will go over their heads have no lines on them. They are silent. They are like the Thunderbirds, like invisible, fast-moving aircraft that do not make any noise which affects residents to the north of the airport. I think that is extraordinarily dishonest. It is about as dishonest as the coalition's promise that Lowe will not be affected in the future-a direct promise by the Prime Minister. Well, Lowe does not have one flight path. It has four. The reason why it has takeoffs to the north rather than landings from the north is that, if planes are to be landed from the north, they have to be brought in in a straighter line and they would have to come in over the electorate of Bennelong. This government is about putting the noise anywhere but Bennelong. That is the real philosophy behind this government. It thinks that hearing is related to income; it thinks that the richer you are, the more sensitive your hearing is. So it is okay to put the planes over Marrickville and Sydenham because that is where the poor people are. 'We'll dump on them just as we'll dump fuel all over their heads and not even bother to let them know.' They just dump on them because they certainly are not a priority. If you compare the delay in introducing a legislated cap at Sydney airport with the urgency that this minister has shown in replacing the CASA board or with spending money on the PADS system, then I think it stands in stark contrast. Maybe we should have done some sort of an exhibition in the corridor on the flight paths. Maybe then we would get some action. Maybe we could build a few lightweight houses in the corridor of the ministerial wing, and then we could get some action on their voluntary acquisition. Mr Ronaldson-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, and it is with great reluctance that I do take this point of order: it has been a very wide ranging debate, but I think it has even ranged beyond the wide ranging debate status.",85
214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Mr Hollis)The debate is winding up and, as you have so rightly indicated, it has been a very wide ranging debate. I am sure that the honourable member for Grayndler is relating his comments to the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997.",86
215,Mr ALBANESE,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Absolutely, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think the issue of Sydney airport is a global one. You cannot view these things in isolation because everything is connected to everything else, and everything has got to go somewhere, as Paulo Freire, the noted theorist, stated. In this we see on the one hand decisive action to get planes away from Bennelong and delay on all other fronts. We see a second Sydney airport delayed. We have got this madcap Holsworthy proposal. We see no action from this government on a second airport. I must say that, when I introduced the cap bill, I predicted this prevarication from the mob on the other side. I actually said at the time that there was no timetable for the introduction of a cap at Sydney airport. There still is no timetable. Last week I got in my office a list of bills being put forward in the next session. Again it just does not appear. It is not there. You are not going to do it. The government simply has a policy of expansion at Sydney airport. I am surprised because there has been substantial community support for my bill, including from the council at North Sydney which unanimously supports the Albanese bill. The council at Lane Cove unanimously supports the Albanese bill. The councils at Hunters Hill, MarrickviIIe, Botany Bay, Kogarah, Rockdale, Leichhardt, South Sydney, Ryde and Hurstville all support the Albanese-MCLeay private member's bill to limit capacity at Sydney airport. So what you see on the one hand is opposition members ensuring that some real action is taken on Sydney airport. On the other hand you see a continued expansion of the facilities at that airport. We have been told by Airservices Australia that modes nine and 10 in the long-term operating plan allow for up 120 movements per hour, so we know that that is the case. You can put that together with the attempt to change the threshold of the third runway, again to expand the capacity at Sydney airport. I am pleased to see that the minister has responded to the pressure from the Sydney Airport Community Forum-I might say in a motion moved by myself, the Labor member for Grayndler, at that forum. It was pretty clear what the numbers were if it came to a vote on that. The member for North Sydney can count. He had his instructions from the minister, but he could count so he had to tell the minister, 'Sorry, Johnny. We didn't have the numbers on this one, so we have to back away,' and the government has backed away. What we see in the meantime is no action o-,;th(seCond Sydney airport, expansion at R-MlPe, exchanging the threshold, bringing In modes which allow for up to 120 movements per hour, a preference for take-offs to the north rather than landings from the north at the airport, goodbye to the member for Lowe and the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale) being shown contempt by her own political party and meanwhile fuel being dumped on the heads of the residents in Grayndler. Fuel would never be dumped on the residents of North Sydney because planes have to go over my electorate before they get anywhere. Every plane that moves to the north goes over my electorate. The sort of contempt that we have seen from the member for Lowe, who cannot even bother to come into the House tonight-(Time expired)",86
216,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,I remind the honourable member for North Sydney that he is not in his correct place wants to engage in a bit of interjection. I call the honourable member for Ballarat.,87
217,Mr RONALDSON,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (9.36 p.m.)- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER Mr Albanese-Don't I get an extension?,87
218,Mr RONALDSON,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"You would be joking. I will just very briefly sum this up. I would like to remind members that we are debating the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. l) 1997-just in case that was lost on anyone, especially those who read Hansard and wonder what happened in the intervening stages when the debate was there. While it was good theatre, I do not intend taking up the matters raised between the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) and the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey). That is for another time and another place. Ms Macklin interjecting",87
219,Mr RONALDSON,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"The member for Grayndler was involved as well, you are right. I would like to take up the point raised by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). I thank him for his contribution and other members for their contributions, especially those who talked about the bill. The member for Dobell made some important points in relation to the importance of the charter industry vis-a-vis benefits to tourism and benefits to employment. There is no doubt that the flow-on dollar that the member for Dobell referred to-the expenditure, the supply of services and all those associated matters-is important. Often these take place in regional centres and away from those main routes. That was an important point and I fully concur with the matters raised by the member for Dobell. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Schedule 1, item 1, agreed to. Schedule 1, item 2.",87
220,Mr TANNER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"I really must congratulate the member for North if he Sydney (Mr Hockey) for staking his claim tonight for future leadership of this House. He has managed to entertain us for an hour and a half, to waste an hour and a half of government business time, and to produce a bunfight out of what was a relatively uncontroversial piece of legislation. It was quite a spectacular performance. I move opposition amendment No 1: (1) Schedule 1, page 8, after proposed subparagraph 15D (iii) insert the following subparagraph: (iiia) if foreign interests hold substantial ownership and effective control of the charterer or the charter operatoremployment and investment in, and general development of, the Australian Aviation industry; and The net effect of this amendment, as I outlined briefly in my comments in the second reading debate of the aviation bill, would be to add to the list of criteria that are established in the bill with respect to any decision by the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Regional Development to grant approval for an international charter operation-a consideration with respect to employment and investment in the Australian aviation industry. It is the one missing factor in an otherwise comprehensive list of factors that the secretary should be obliged to consider in making the decision with respect to granting an approval. It is important, as I outlined in my earlier contribution with respect to the second reading of the bill, that the Australian industry's position is kept under scrutiny in the process of handing out charters. If charter approvals are handed out indiscriminately or in a way that takes no account of the total impact the charter operations have, there is a serious risk that the viability of the Australian international aviation industry may be undermined. It is therefore important that that viabilitythe export dollars that it earns, the important service base that it provides to the Australian economy, the thousands of jobs that it provides to many Australians, which are overwhelmingly skilled jobs and overwhelmingly well-paid jobs-is taken into account by the secretary in making any decision with respect to granting of a foreign charter. I understand that the government will be voting against this amendment in the House today on the basis that the government has indicated that it will further consider the amendment prior to the legislation going to the Senate. The opposition will not divide on the amendment today in the House.",87
221,Mr RONALDSON,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (9.41 p.m.)-The shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), is right. There are some discussions taking place in relation to this matter and other matters. The government will be opposing the amendments at this stage, but I do not intend going into the matter any further. Amendment negati ved.",88
222,Mr TANNER,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"I move: (3) Schedule I, page 4, after proposed section 15A(3) insert the following subsection: (3A) In deciding whether to make a determination under subsection (3), the Secretary is to have regard to the following matters (except to the extent, if any, to which the matters concerned relate to the safety of air navigation): (a) the public interest, including but not limited to: (i) the need of people to travel on, or to send cargo and mail by, aircraft; and (ii) the promotion of trade and tourism to and from Australia; and (iii) if the application relates to a program of flights to or from Australiawhether there is to be a wide range of places in Australia that will be served under the program; and (iv) aviation security; and (v) Australia's international relations; (b) the availability of capacity (within the meaning of the International Air Services Commission Act 1992) on scheduled international air services, and any relevant determination made by the International Air Services Commission in respect of the allocation of capacity on those services; (c) any relevant advice on matters referred to in paragraph (a) that is provided to the Minister by that Commission under paragraph 6(2)(c) of that Act; and (d) any other matter that the Secretary thinks relevant. By way of brief explanation to the House, amendment No.2, which now lapses, was conditional upon amendment No. 1 being passed. Amendment No.1 has been defeated. Therefore, amendment No. 2 is no longer applicable. We now move to amendment No. 3. The net effect of amendment No. 3 is that the criteria which apply, with respect to the secretary to the department granting an approval for a foreign charter operation to come to Australia, will also apply when the secretary exercises his power under this legislation to exempt a particular charter operation from needing to get approval for that operation. The provision in the legislation has been indicated by the government to be there to provide for certain specific situations where there may be a once-only charter. From time to time circumstances may prevail where there is a need for a particular charter, and to have to go through the bureaucratic approval process may be unduly onerous and may be relatively unnecessary. The opposition does not contest the logic of that position on the part of the government but is concerned at the breadth of the provision as it stands at the moment, which empowers the secretary to the department to give an exemption from the requirement to,obtain approval. The opposition feels that the simplest way to get around this problem is to require that, in granting any exemption from a requirement to give approval, the secretary is required to give consideration to the same factors that he is required to give consideration to in granting an approval. That way, there is an evenness between the two sets of criteria: whether the secretary is making a decision by saying, 'Yes, you can have approval to run a charter operation from your country to Australia,' and vice versa, or whether the secretary is saying, 'Yes, you are exempted from even having to seek that approval,' that he has to think of the various issues that are set out in the legislation in both cases. So that is the purpose of the amendment. Once again, I understand that the government, although it will vote against the amendment in the House, will give further consideration to this matter and that we may be able to reach some common view by the time the matter gets to the Senate. On that basis, the opposition will not proceed to divide on this amendment.",88
223,Mr RONALDSON,AVIATION LEGIS LA TION,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (9.45 p.m.)-I concur with the latter comments made by the shadow minister. Just briefly: effectively, if the determination referred to by the shadow minister is made by the secretary and does not require permission that becomes a disallowable instrument and is, therefore, subject to full parliamentary scrutiny. The government is concerned that this amendment may simply add an unnecessary extra administrative layer onto the charter process. At this stage we are opposing the amendment. Amendment negatived. Item agreed to. Remainder of bill-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Ronaldson)-by leave-read a third time. NA GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: NA GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 February, on motion by Mr Tim Fischer: That the bill be now read a second time.",89
224,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"The Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997 is an anti-export bill, an anti-export measure. It is bad policy. It is bad for jobs. It is bad for exports. It is bad for Australian exporters. It is bad for the development of an export culture. It is bad for our balance of payments. It is bad for economic growth. But it should come as no surprise to this House because this is consistent with what the government has been doing in the trade and industry policy area since it came to office. The bill reflects and implements substantial changes announced in the budget on 20 August 1996. What the government is proposing to do with the Export Market Development Grants Bill is consistent with what it has been doing in a range of industry and trade enhancement measures-very many of which have been contrary to government election commitments. If it is not the gutting and the narrowing of the export market development grants scheme, if it is not the adverse export and trade consequences of the government's ramshackle handling of the DIFF scheme, if it is not a $2 billion cut to research and development, it is the abolition of bounties such as the shipbuilding bounty in an industry which is now exclusively exporting. That is the government's general approach to trade and industry enhancement measures. Export enhancement is one of the very important legs of trade policy. The opposition's position and response to the government's bills-these two measures, the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997 and the transitional bill, the Export Market Development Grants (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Bill-is reflected by a second reading amendment which I am happy to have circulated in my name. To reflect the opposition's detailed concerns in respect of these particular bills, detailed amendments will be pursued in the consideration in detail stage. I am happy to have those amendments circulated at the conclusion of my remarks. The second reading amendment and the consideration in detail amendments reflect the opposition's approach to these particular measures. The opposition's parliamentary response to these measures has been threefold: the second reading amendment, which I will formally move at the conclusion of my remarks; the amendments at the consideration in detail stage, which I have referred to; action by the opposition in the Senate to ensure that these bills were referred to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. Consistent with the Senate standing orders, on the introduction of the legislation to this House, the bill in Senate was the subject of a reference to and public hearing by that committee. That public hearing was conducted on Monday of this week with a resolution of the Senate that the committee report by Friday of this week. Coincidentally, with the passage of the legislation through this House, we will find the Senate exploring the adverse implications of this legislation to Australian exporters by way of its relevant legislation committee. The opposition reserves its right to move further amendments in the Senate, dependent upon the detailed consideration of that public hearing and the evidence given yesterday. There are some items of the legislation which the opposition has no difficulty with. Some of those go to the full extension of the scheme to tourism providers. That has been the subject of a number of reports by various committees of this House-in particular, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration and the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. From memory, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) was a member of the relevant industry committee and was one of the signatories to a report with a recommendation to that effect. The full extension of the scheme to tourism providers is supported and welcomed by this side of the House. The reduction of the eligible threshold limit from $30,000 to $20,000 is also supported. The restriction of the scheme to firms with a turnover of no more than $50 million per annum is also supported, as is the upper limit of $25 million in export earnings. A couple of minor measures are also supported, including the three per cent calculation for communication costs. What is strongly opposed are those measures which form the heart of the government's two bills. The second reading amendment that I have referred to is in nine paragraphs and I and take the opportunity of going through paragraph by paragraph. In that logical way, I will draw fully to the attention of the House the opposition's concerns in this matter. The first paragraph of the amendment refers to the fact that this legislation is in breach of the the government's election commitments, and I welcome the entry into the chamber of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) and the extension of the courtesy to listen to my remarks. Mr Tim Fischer-I've come all the way from Dubai to listen.",89
225,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"The minister asserts he has come all the way from Dubai. I think, from tracking his program, he arrived home yesterday. He does always extend full courtesy so far as parliamentary debate is concerned, and that is appreciated on this side. As the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister says across the table, 'Now I propose to bore it right up him.' The first point is that this legislation is in breach of the government's election commitments. The Meeting the challenges document, which was distributed and circulated by the then shadow minister for trade and now Minister for Trade in the run-up to the election, refers to maintaining the export market development grants scheme, continuing the innovative agricultural marketing program, maintaining the international trade enhancement scheme and maintaining the Asia-Pacific fellowships program. The EMDG scheme has been effectively gutted. The lAMP scheme, the lTES and the Asia-Pacific fellowships and business fellowships schemes have all been abolished in breach of election commitments. I also note in the document there is a commitment to 'welcoming the contribution of the business community through chambers of manufactures and chambers of commerce and industry and other similar bodies to improve international trade performance'. So there is in this document an expressed commitment to consult with the relevant business community and to heed their remarks. Similar commitments are made in the coalition's industry and commerce policy, which was released by the now Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). The present government's election commitments went beyond those general comments. On page 40 of the Meeting our commitments document, which the now Treasurer (Mr Costello) released in the concluding stages of the election campaign, the Treasurer proposed as the to-be government's financial commitments a reduction to generate savings from greater efficiencies in Austrade and the export market development grants scheme of a total of $58.3 million-a combined reduction in expenditure from Austrade and the export market development grants scheme of $58.3 million. The export market development grants scheme measures implemented by this piece of legislation reduce expenditure in EMDG alone by $426 million over four years. In the Austrade area, the annual reductions in appropriations are over $90 million per annum. So the first point to be made in respect of these measures is that they are in breach of expressed election commitments given by the opposition. Secondly, this legislation in respect of EMDG is in breach of personal undertakings and commitments given by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade while in opposition, and that is a matter that I refer to more in sorrow than in anger. In the course of the parliament's consideration of the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1996, in the course of public hearings before the relevant Senate committee, the executive secretary of the Australian Book Publishers Association, Ms Sue Donovan, took a question on notice and provided a written answer: The Association is extremely concerned about the threat to the future of the scheme, especially in view of the Government's election commitment to maintain it. This commitment was contained in the presentation of the Coalition trade policy by the Honourable Tim Fischer, MP, as Shadow Minister for Trade, to the National Press Club on 15 February 1996, and repeated on pages 1 and 8 of the Coalition's industry and commerce policy document released by the Honourable John Moore, MP, Shadow Minister for Industrywhich I have referred to. Ms Donovan went on to say: These pronouncements reinforce the clear and unequivocal commitments to continue the scheme, without fiddling amendments, until 1999. This was also given to me by Mr Fischer at a meeting in his office on 29 June 1995. So, in the course of discussions with exporters in the run-up to the election, the now Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade gave personal commitments and undertakings to relevant export associations that the EMDG scheme would continue until 1999-on the five-year review cycle that we have seen over the years-without fiddling amendments. You can hardly regard the gutting of the financial commitment by the government and the narrowing of the focus of the scheme as fiddling amendments. They are substantial amendments. They are adverse for Australian exporters and adverse for our trade and export performance. The third point the second reading amendment refers to is that these measures occur precisely the time at which the government's own papers show that the net contribution of exports to growth in GDP will be negative. In 1995-96, the budget papers show that the contribution of net exports to growth in GDP was a positive one per cent. In the budget papers which saw these particular measures announced by the government, the contribution of net exports to growth in GDP for 1996-97 was forecast to be a negative threechanges quarters of a per cent. And in the mid-year fiscal review released by the Treasurer early last month that negative contribution is forecast to continue not just for 1996-97 but for 1997-98. So at precisely that point in cycle where the government's own papers forecast a negative contribution of net exports to growth in GDP, the government is gutting one of the most successful trade and export enhancement measures that has been in operation in this country since 1974. In the government's own budget papers, if you look at the portfolio budget documents, Budget Related Paper No. 17 at page 87, you find that the success measure for the EMDG scheme is said to be an export performance ratio of 33: 1. That measure, contained in government's own budget related papers, been in the past. occurs at precisely the same time as the Deputy Prime Minister announces the gutting and narrowing of this scheme. That export performance, or export ratio, does not come out of the blue. The export market development grants scheme has been in operation since 1974 and over the years have seen a myriad of reviews. In some respects the EMDG scheme has been rethe viewed to death. I will not go through many of the reviews in any detail, but the first significant recent review of the EMDG scheme was the Hughes report of July 1989. That report recommended that the scheme global economy. continue for a further five years and drew attention in the course of the report's deliberations to the enhancement of an export culture and the incentives that the scheme provides to emerging exporters and exporters. In the course of this report and in others, very many suggestions have been made for improvements or modifications to the scheme. at They have been considered by the parliament and by many other people in the course of the years. There has never been any great difficulty on either side of the House, whichever side we occupy, in having a look at the various reports, having a look at the various suggestions for change, and dealing with them and considering them on their merits. The great difficulty with these particular is that they have not been made on merit. The Minister for Trade walked into the ERe, was given a global allocation of $150 million and told to make sure the scheme fell within that amount. He did not go through the the objective process or the objective review, which has occurred over the years, of trying to discern which measures were effective, which measures would continue to be of assistance and incentive to Australian exporters. He simply got his budget bottom line and, when you look at Budget Related Paper No. 17, to which I have referred, the explanation for the gutting of the scheme is referred to simply as to meet the ERe savings target identified by the ERe in April of last year. There has been no objective review which has the seen these measures come about as there has In later years the Hughes report was followed by the MCKinsey report Emerging exporters: Australia's high value added manufacturing exporters. That was in June 1993. Again, we find positive references to EMDG as 'enhancing and assisting Australian we companies' and 'adding to Australia's export culture'. You find similar remarks made in Foreign Affairs and Trade report Winning very enterprises: How Australia's small and medium enterprises compete in global markets. The same is true of the June 1995 report Winning markets: Australia's future in the Austrade's annual report of 1995-96, which is worth referring to in a modest amount of detail, at page 39 says: The scheme attracted over 1200 new claimants who lodged grant applications in the 1995-96 financial year. $202 million in grants were paid during the year to 3,251 claims. Recipients in the 1995-96 financial year achieved $5.7 billion in exports resulting in a ratio of exports to grants of 28: 1. Total administration cost for the scheme was $6.3 million, representing 3% of grants paid. If I can just digress on the three per cent of grants paid, the $150 million, which it is proposed to cap the scheme at, includes up to a maximum of five per cent for administration. So the real amount available to Australian exporters is $142.5 million, if you take out the cost of administration. We are told that the administration is simplified but, on the one hand, we find that in the 1995-96 year administration came in at a cost of three per cent and, on the other hand, on what is lauded by the government to be a much simplified scheme we are told that administration will be as high as five per cent. The key point is that the cost of administration comes out of the scheme. The Austrade report goes on to refer to the 1994 evaluation of the scheme Helping to meet the export challenge, which demonstrated through independent economic analysisthat was Professor Bewley's report-that the scheme creates additional exports of up to 25 times the value of grants received. The report goes on to make further positive remarks about the scheme. That report was followed by the two audit office reports-the 1993 report and the follow-up report in 1996-which saw a range of changes made to the scheme in the 1995-96 legislation. I see the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), the former minister, who introduced into the last parliament changes consistent with the audit office report, has entered the chamber to second my second reading amendment. He would be well aware of that 1993 report and also well aware of the September 1996 follow-up report which effectively ticked the box on those particular changes. Perhaps the seminal report on the EMDG scheme was Helping to meet the export challenge, which was an evaluation of both the EMDG and ITES, the international trade enhancement scheme conducted in 1994. Without referring in any detail to that particular report, it is clear that that report is consistent with a range of reports that we have found over the years, that the EMDG scheme was achieving its objective of assisting Australian business, particularly small and medium size firms, to develop new export markets. It also came to the conclusion that revenue which was gained by the Commonwealth from successful exporters who had utilised EMDG funds saw about 42c in the dollar come back to the Commonwealth by way of tax recipients. It again, by way of Professor Bewley'S report, made the point that the export benefit or the export ratio which we see from the expenditure of the EMDG dollar is more than comfortably met by export success. Those particular elements are covered by the opposition's second reading amendment, paragraphs (1) through to (4). Paragraph (5) of the amendment refers to the increased discretion provided to Austrade in the administration of the scheme. This has been a matter of some considerable concern both in the context of the Senate hearing and in the context of the submissions made to the government by way of comment on the exposure bill. I referred earlier to the coalition's election commitments. One of the commitments in the Meeting the challenges trade document was to pay attention to and consult with the relevant industry and export groups. Drafts of these bills were put out for comment in December of last year. Over 170 submissions were received. A number of those submissions have been made available either to the Senate committee or generally. There have been some significant thrusts in those submissions. There has been opposition to the retrospective application of the proposed legislation. There has been opposition to the exclusion of trusts as corporate entities from the legislation. There has been significant concern about and opposition to the capping of the scheme at $150 million and significant concern at the narrowing of the eligible export activity. It is the question of consultation that is worth drawing attention to. The minister, through his department, kindly made available to me a log of what are described as major technical amendments made to the draft EMDG Bill 1997 as a result of the consultation. There are about a dozen or so major technical amendments. There is also a series of about 30, I understand, minor technical amendments. But nowhere do we find a policy change or a change of substance. The reality is that every reasonable suggestion made by industry groups, either by way of comment on the exposure bill or by way of submissions or evidence to the Senate committee, has reflected considerable concern and anxiety on the part of industry, none of these concerns have in any way been taken up by the government. Those concerns are reflected in the final four paragraphs of the second reading amendment, which express the opposition's concern at the $150 million cap, the realisation that the real expenditure availnot able to exporters is $142.5 million, and reject the notion of the capping of the scheme. It would not, as I indicated earlier, be so bad if there had been some objectivity about the consultation, which was clearly a sham, or some objectivity and careful assessment about the way in which currently export eligible expenditure is proposed to be removed from the scheme. The scheme has been significantly narrowed and the eligible expenditure categories are proposed to be reduced from 11 to 12. Patent registration, overseas buyer visits Australia, foreign language training, international business education courses, export packaging and labelling design, tenders and quotations, technical information and subscriptions to associations are proposed to no longer be eligible, and airfares will only be eligible for the first two years. These have been the subject of very considerable consternation and opposition by industry groups and individual exporters who have commented on the exposure bill or given evidence to the Senate committee. Mr Tim Fischer-Sadly, some of them were abused.",91
226,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"The minister at the table nods his head and says that sadly some were abused. As the member for Canberra would well know, and as I am quite happy to say-I share the minister's vigilance in ensuring that this particular scheme is not abused-when you have a look at the scheme through its tenure, on the most recent briefing I have had on fraud against this scheme, the scheme has been abused by less than one per cent of its appropriations over the years. For an open-ended scheme which relies upon the integrity of exporters, that is not a result which is at variance with any general defalcation or fraud on any Commonwealth scheme. The audit office reports of 1993 and 1996 drew attention to a range of measures which could be utilised to improve and enhance that. I have no difficulty with the Minister for Trade ensuring that people who seek to defraud this or any other Commonwealth scheme are vigilantly pursued, but that should be used as an excuse to embark upon bad policy, to embark upon bad export measures. .When you have discussions with exporters, whether it is by way of meeting with them out in the field, by way of taking anecdotal evidence or by way of reading submissions, they all say that airfares are absolutely essential to them, that it is important they establish contacts on the ground in the market destination and that, for companies who are particularly involved in intellectual property or in services, things like patent registration and technical information are important to them. Recently I was in Adelaide and met with to Hamiltons Pharmaceuticals. Patent and technical information and airfares are absolutely vital to that company continuing to improve its export performance. So all those items which narrow the focus of the scheme have not been done by way of objective assessment. It has simply been drawing a line at all $150 million and working backwards from that. In working backwards from that, the measures have aspects of retrospectivity about them which the opposition rejects. There are two aspects to the retrospectivity. The bulk of these measures, all but one, were announced on budget night, 20 August 1996, to take effect from 1 July 1996. The narrowing of the scheme has an element of retrospectivity attached to it-from 20 August back to 1 July. Because this has to date been an open-ended scheme, companies make commitments well in advance of that. So there is an element of retrospectivity which adversely affects exporters. Worse than that was the retrospective effect of the proposed removal of trusts from the scheme. That was announced on the first occasion on 16 December 1996 when the Deputy Prime Minister released the exposure draft for comment. The first occasion on which trusts became aware that they might no longer be eligible was 16 December. Trusts which were already in the scheme, trusts which regarded themselves as eligible, trusts which may well have already been recipients of grants under the scheme woke up on 17 December to be advised by their managers or agents that, as a result of a press release put out in the dying days of the parliament last year in the run-up to Christmas, they were to be retrospectively excluded from the scheme. That measure is particularly pernicious. It is not as if we have seen the Minister for Trade explain either generally in public or to exporters that there is some particular problem generally with trusts as a corporate entity. If there is a particular problem with trusts as a corporate entity, the government should stand up and make that clear, and apply that particular approach so far as taxation and corporations laws are concerned. I note that the Treasurer has recently released a draft exposure bill in respect of the allocation of losses of trusts. That is a measure which to a large extent mirrors legislation put into the parliament by the previous government in the course of the last parliament. There is no difficulty in moving generally with trusts. But, if the government is proposing to remove trusts from this scheme, it should not do it retrospectively and it should not do it in a way which adversely affects the trusts that are currently recipients in the scheme. The second reading amendment, which I will formally move shortly, and the detailed amendments which I propose to move in the consideration in detail stage reflect the approach as far as the opposition is concerned: a rejection of the notion of capping the scheme at $150 million; a rejection of any adverse consequences of retrospectivity; and a rejection of the notion of narrowing the scheme in a way which does not help Australian exporters and does not help our export performance. This is one of the litany of sins that we have seen from the government on trade and industry measures. We woke up on the morning after the budget and saw a range of broken promises-EMDG gutted, ITES gone, lAMP gone, a range ofMr Tim Fischer interjecting",94
227,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"EMDG retained-not in the form of the undertaking you gave to the Australian book publishers by saying, 'No fiddling amendments until 1999,' but with substantial amendments to gut and narrow the scheme in a way which is antiexport, bad for jobs, bad for exporters, bad for exporting companies, bad for our balance of payments and bad for trade generally. These measures are opposed by the opposition in the way in which I have outlined, and they will be opposed by the opposition in the Senate.",95
228,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. However, I will give him sufficient latitude to move his second reading amendment.",95
229,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (l) notes that the legislation is in breach of the Government's election commitments; (2) notes that the legislation is in breach of personal undertakings given by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade while in Opposition; (3) notes that the Government's own 1996-97 Budget papers and recent Mid-year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 1996-97 assume a negative contribution to growth in GDP by net exports for 1996-97 and 1997-98, a fall from a positive contribution of 1% in 1995-96; (4) notes the Government's own Budget papers state that for the 1994/95 grant year the scheme achieved a ratio of exports achieved to grants expenditure of 33:1; (5) notes with concern the increased discretion provided to Austrade in the administration of the scheme; (6) notes that the $150 million proposed cap includes up to a maximum of 5% ($7.5 million) for costs and administration leaving only $142.5 million available per annum for exporters; (7) rejects the notion of ""capping"" the scheme to such a limit; (8) rejects the narrowing of the scheme and the exclusion of patent regulation, overseas buyers visits to Australia, foreign language training, international business education courses, export packaging and labelling design, tenders and quotations, free technical information and subscriptions to associations as eligible export activity; (9) rejects the adverse retrospective applicability of the Government's proposals, in particular as they relate to eligible export activity and no longer being an eligible corporate identity able to apply under the scheme"".",95
230,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Mr MCMullan-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,96
231,Mr CHARLES,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"I am delighted tonight to stand and add my contribution to the debate on the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997. I do have somewhat of a history in talking about this particular government measure. My research assistant today brought me a file of copies of speeches I have made over a number of years in this House about EMDG, and I have to say that it was a rather thick folder-not quite as voluminous as the stack of reports of the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). Nonetheless, from time to time. I have had a few words to say about this scheme. The EMDG scheme is now 22 years old, and at the outset of my remarks I congratulate the department on the putting together of this bill. After 22 years of operation, reports, amendment after innumerable amendment and changes to the scheme, we finally have a new and rationalised bill that is easy to read and understand. It is logical in sequence and very well put together. It is in plain English, so that even a non-lawyer like me can relatively easily understand the provisions of the bill. The legislation that this bill replaces is not only old but also extremely complex, very difficult to follow and had created a great deal of confusion throughout industry. I might say, it probably made a lot of money for lawyers, practitioners, accountants and others in helping companies to try to deal with this issue. I will go back to what this bill is all about. The object of this act is to bring benefits to Australia by encouraging the creation, development and expansion of foreign markets for Australian goods, services, intellectual property and know-how. It does so by providing for an assistance scheme under which small and medium Australian exporters committed to, and capable of, seeking out and developing export business are repaid part of their expenses incurred in promoting those products. In listening to the honourable member for trusts Perth, I rather got the idea that he thinks the scheme should forever be an open-ended scheme which would commit Australian taxpayers to increasing amounts of expenditure for ongoing export development work. I thought the intent of the original act wasand certainly the intent of today's bill is-as a leg-up, a bit of a help for small and medium sized businesses to become involved in the export marketing business. We want our businesses to export. I heard the former government and its ministers time after time in this place come in and talk about manufacturers, providers of intellectual property, providers of services, and companies dealing in know-how as if they had no idea of what business opportunities they could avail themselves. The government simply said, 'You must export.' I would go out and talk to my businesses, and they would say, 'Look, the government says export, but what are they doing to help us? Are they doing anything to help us?' This is one area that I constantly pointed out to them. It was a scheme that had been supported by most major political parties for 22 years. We do support the export market development grants scheme. For the member for Perth to say that the scheme has been gutted or discontinued is an absolute nonsense. It has not. The scheme has been modernised and simplified. Sure, the scheme has been capped. In a sense, I probably regret the necessity for capping the scheme. However, I point out to the honourable member for Perth that, if his mob had done the right thing with forward projections and the budget in 1995, they would not have left us with the mess that we copped in 1996, with $10 billion of unfunded government promises to spend in the future. Where do you think the money was going to come from? The money has to come from somewhere. Do we continue to draw out of this bottomless well of funds which do not exist? Do we continue to put this kind of imposition on Australian taxpayers who are already not happy about the level of taxes they already support? Do we continue to put an impost on the Australian taxpayer to fund schemes to help industry continue to make better profits and to grow? I maintain that the intent of this scheme was always as a leg-up for small businesses and for medium sized businesses to get involved in the export market, to become efficient and productive, and to get out there and expand their exports as part of an overall government approach to exports. I note that our exports are rising, particularsupports ly in manufactured goods and in intellectual property. The education sector's contribution to exports in Australia has expanded almost exponentially. The EMDG scheme has been very valuable. This streamlined, simplified rewritten bill in plain English now gives our businesses and their advisers a real good shot at understanding what complex legislation is all about and how it is to work every day. The rules have been tightened in order to provide the right kind of assistance to the right people and for the right reasons. The tightening of the rules was not to exclude everyone but to make sure that we target this application of taxpayers' funds to the area likely to do us the most good and to businesses that honestly and sincerely need the most assistance-that is, small and medium sized businesses. The new act implements the policy changes announced in the 1996 budget. In that sense, the cap on total EMDG spending is totally consistent with the government's approach to the 1996 budget, which was well received by the Australian public. It is still well received by the Australian public. It is certain that any company which is not able to receive as much benefit in the future from this program will be unhappy about that. If my pay were cut, I would not be very happy about that either. That is to be expected. That is in the nature of human beings, businesses and all good things. But that is no reason for the opposition to come into this place and criticise the government for capping a scheme to prevent excess expenditure of Australian dollars. This scheme is about helping small and medium sized businesses export the eligible products that they may export in accordance with the requirements of the bill: our goods, our services, our intellectual property and our know-how. There is a whole range of principle amendments to the act. The first amendment-the one which I will take the few minutes left to me tonight to talk about-is the one which finally says that the tourism industry is equal in status to all the other industries in Australia. The member for Perth spoke about this issue tonight. He said that the opposition fully the fact that we implemented an election pledge to bring the tourism industry into line with everybody else and finally recognise it as a full player with respect to this scheme. I have said many times that we generically support the tourism industry through major funding every year to allow the tourism industry to advertise Australia to the rest of the world, to tell other people around the world what a great place this is, what a tremendous climate we have, how wonderful our people are, how hospitable we are, what a beautiful environment we have and the many features that might attract them to come visit with us. However, for years and years we have said, 'For export services, we consider the tourism industry has enough assistance in a generic sense so we will not help small and medium sized single service tourism operators to advertise their products overseas.' We do not want them to help us go from the generic sense to the nitty-gritty. For example, somebody might say to a travel agent in New York ci y or in Palermo or in Linz, Austria, 'I think I would like to go to Australia. I saw this great ad on television. I read something in a magazine or a newspaper. Have you got any brochures on where I might stay?' The answer might be, 'No, we don't have any of those.' Why do we not have any of them? Who is going to supply those brochures? The owners and operators of the specific tourism facilities in my electorate and all over Australia are the ones that will advertise those specific locations. But it is very difficult for them to target the entire world. So they are going to have to limit their meagre funds where they can do the best job. I have maintained for a long time that the application of EMDG to single service tourism operators would be of great benefit to Australia. In 1994 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, of which I was a member, reported to the House in its report entitled Undersold overseas that tourism should be treated equally to everyone else. What did the minister do? The minister rejected our advice. Later in 1994-95 the government finally brought in a proposal, after much pushing and mush pressure from the then opposition and now government, to make tourism operators half equal. They said, 'You cannot get a 50 per cent return on the dollar; you can get a 25 per cent return, though.' So they sort of came halfway. Finally, thank goodness, this government has implemented good policy. It has said that tourism operators are just like anybody else, and they deserve a shot at export market development grants where applicable and if they spend the money. NA",96
232,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Nursing Homes  p.m.)-In this chamber, in the adjournment debate of 6 March 1997, page 1873 of Hansard, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd), referring to my reported comments in the Sun Weekly of the Central Coast of New South Wales of that date under the heading 'Elderly must sell homes for a bed' , stated: The member for Shortland should hang his head in shame for being responsible for creating unnecessary and unfounded concern among my elderly constituents. I had no expressions of concern from my constituents. He commented that I was not in the chamber when he made his attack. If I had known of his pending attack, I would have made sure I was here to respond. However, my constituents do not expect me to sit here waiting in case he might make an attack. They expect me to get on with my parliamentary duties and their representations. But there will be other occasions when I hope to be able to return the courtesy to the honourable member. I hold my head up proudly that I have helped to expose the heartless and callous charges that this mean-spirited government is trying to impose on frail, sick Australians from 1 July next. No matter how the member may seek to delude himself or to mislead others in respect of this government's charges that it wants extracted from people entering nursing homes after 1 July 1997, the truth is that large numbers of sick, aged Australians, mainly women, are going to be slugged. The claims by the honourable member that elderly citizens will not have to sell their homes to obtain nursing home care are simply pathetic. Why does he persist in trying to delude himself? Why does he persist in trying to mislead those who may need the care of a nursing home? As I said, the claims are simply pathetic. The government's own publication, Aged Care News, of October 1996 states on page 4: Nobody will be forced to sell their former home. On the same line it says: Entry contributions may be financed from the sale of their former home, from savings or other assets, or in some cases a mortgage against the home or other assets. Who are they trying to fool? People can read, people can understand, and it is clear, it is explicit. The expectation is that people will have to sell their homes. I do not have to convince people of it; they can read for themselves. The rhetoric of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) that nobody will be forced to sell their former home is clearly untrue. The government's supposed nursing home reforms clearly show the contempt in which they hold our frail and sick citizens. Let me tum to another source, The Voice of Pensioners and Superannuants in NSW. Dare I show it to you, Mr Speaker, so that I can be seen to present the original document. The f-nt page headline reads, 'Senate Inquiry into Draft Aged Care Bill,' and the subheading reads as follows: ""If you are a pensioner and your only asset is your home, the only option you have is to sell the house or not go into a nursing home."" Further on, in the body of the story, it says: ""The Minister continues to say that people will not have to sell their homes. However, that's not true,"" CPSA President Ms Norah MCGuire said. Members can read, I am sure, through the rest of that front-page article for themselves. Seven out of 10 people entering nursing homes are women. They go into nursing homes because they need to be in nursing homes. It is ridiculous for people on the other side to be saying, 'Oh yes, but that is the kind of arrangement for going into a hostel. ' You have an option about a hostel. You go into a nursing home because you have been assessed by the aged assessment team as category 1 to 5 and you need to be there. It is not a matter of choice; it is because you need to be there. So, at the time in life when women most need help, what this government is saying to them is, 'If you are one of those women, come 1 July of this year you will be forced to sell up or rearrange your financial affairs to find the money that is needed to meet the entry fee contribution.' And trying to dress it up as accommodation bonds and all other kinds of euphemisms does not fool anybody. My warning to the residents of the Central Coast is to be aware of the disgraceful campaign of deceit being conducted by government members-a campaign aimed at concealing the truth about its changes to nursing home care. There is no upper limit on what an elderly resident can be forced to pay. No upper limit has been set, and all that a nursing home proprietor is required to do is to leave the person with assets totalling $22,500. I am proud to help to get the message across to people in Australia on what this government is about. It is heartless and it is ruthless, and frail women at that time of life who most need help should not be subjected to the trauma that faces them under the measures of this government. (Time expired) Youth Suicide",98
233,Ms GAMBARO,ADJOURNMENT,"Petrie) (10.35 p.m.)Tonight I rise to congratulate all those who were involved in organising and participating in the parliament's first youth suicide seminar held on Friday, 28 February and opened by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I want to place on the record a particular acknowledgment of the work of the federal member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs in making the seminar such a success. I was pleased to attend this seminar a few weeks ago. I believe it is an extremely important issue in the context of today's society and that we need to do all we can as politicians to encourage and support solutions to youth suicide. It is true that the youth suicide rate has risen alarmingly, particularly over the last 15 years. I was absolutely astounded by figures from the Australian Institute of Criminology which suggest that every day in Australia there are six completed suicides and 180 attempts. Our country has one of the highest suicide rates in the industrialised world. No matter how you look at these figures, it is a devastating blight on our society. Youth suicide is not an issue which we can sweep under the covers or bury behind closed doors. It is an issue which in many cases is cloistered in intergenerational codes of silence. It is a problem that is growing, it is a problem which is becoming much more complex and it is a problem which is costing lives. It cannot be assumed that even our own neighbourhoods are immune to suicide. I know that there are many cases in my own electorate of Petrie where no words can explain the heartbreak, the destruction and the loss felt by families who are caught in these particular situations. What drives our kids to self-destruction and what leads our young people to get to the stage where they feel there is absolutely no turning back? This government cares for young people and has acknowledged that assistance is needed to stem the level of youth suicide. The government has initiated the national youth suicide strategy, which will provide parents and young people with the skills and support that they need to cope with these crises. One of the speakers at the conference, whom I found very informative a few weeks ago, was Associate Professor Pierre Baume. He is a Brisbane based professor and is at Griffith University. He is the Director of the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention. A recognised person in the fields of suicide support and prevention, he was previously Chairman of the National Health and Medical Research Council suicide prevention committee. Recently, Professor Baume completed a paper which was titled 'Cybersuicide: the role of interactive suicide notes on the Internet' with co-authors Dr Christopher Cantor and Mr Andrew Rolfe from the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention. When Professor Baume spoke about this issue of suicide on the Internet at the seminar a few weeks ago, he stunned the room with stories and instances of the Internet acting as a medium between life and death. As my learned colleagues would be aware, the Internet and cyberspace is capturing the attention of more and more Australians on a daily basis-a technology where the only limit is one's imagination. The research paper found that there was a really strong preoccupation towards suicide on the Internet. The report states: Suicide features in an enormous range of internet resources. A search for the word 'suicide' number of search engines has revealed thousands of matches. The report also deals with tributes to suicide victims, electronic mailing lists, suicide notes and people using news groups and talk programs to transmit and promote the art of suicide. Notes can be found on the Internet pages detailing torrid stories and people threatening to take their own lives. What we are dealing with here is virtual reality where the surreal is playing mind games. It is not fiction from a novel nor drama from a television series. It is real life lost through the keyboard. It seems that the Internet has the potential to influence behaviour here. It may be a medium which is only very new, but the level of influence cannot ever be underestimated. In concluding, an important point is made in the research paper which deserves repeating: Cybersuicide is now a reality. We can ignore it, or we can develop new strategies to promote the positive nature of interaction of this kind as well as to minimise its negative impact, for those communication conduits have limitless potential. Hi.gh-tech suicide is definitely becoming the suicide of the future and it is important that we take an integrated approach and a coordinated approach in tackling this problem. We need to work jointly as a community to ensure that we prevent these suicide strategies. (Time expired) Irish Immigrants",99
234,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ADJOURNMENT,"As honourable members would be aware and indeed the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) is certainly aware, yesterday was St Patrick's Day, which was enthusiastically commemorated throughout Australia and rightly so. Australia is, after Ireland, the most Irish country in the world. About 30 per cent of the people who live in this country have some Irish antecedent, be it a grandparent or a great grandparent or, in recent years, they themselves came from Ireland. Often, the Irish looked to America as the place where the Irish went. Indeed, this country is where the Irish not only came but were very successful. I supusing a pose, in some ways, they took over the political system. While the Irish were still struggling in Ireland, the Irish in Australia had in many parts of this country become the ascendancy. Most of those Irish people or people of Irish descent in Australia tend to forget the reasons that their antecedents came here to Australia. But there are a number of people who have formed a committee in Sydney, people like Tom Power, Ian Caruth, Terrie Pollard and Annie Rahe, who want to get Australians of Irish descent to understand what that very seminal change in Irish history was about that occurred 150 years ago: the great famine. The great famine is something that anyone whose parents, grandparents or great grandparents who live in Australia knows was a reason that their relations left Ireland and came to Australia. Most of us do not understand too clearly why that was. The famine is something that is not really understood in this country because we are so far from Ireland and that Irish experience. But this group of people in Sydney wants to set up a memorial to the famine. On the 150th anniversary of the famine, which occurred between 1845 and 1848, it is useful for all of us of Irish descent, and all Australians who believe in justice, to think about what happened there in Ireland at that time, because, while half a million people came to Australia during the 19th century from Ireland around the famine time or just after, a lot of that history has been forgotten in this country. There are some terrible statistics about that famine that we should recall. In 1845, the population of Ireland was 8.6 million. In 1850 the population was 5.5 million. Between 1845 and 1850, 1.1 million people died of starvation and two million of them left their country and went to the US, Australia and to other parts of the English-speaking world. Between 1800 and 1899, in that century, nine million people left Ireland. In 1900, 30 per cent of all Australians were of Irish descent-at present it is a little bit more. In 1910 the population ofIreland, only 55 years after the beginning of the famine, was 4.3 million-less than half of what it had been 65 years before. These people in Sydney believe that it is important for the Australian understanding of the Irish tradition that we should erect a statue to commemorate those women who came from Ireland to Australia, particularly those younger women, those young orphaned girls, many thousands of whom came to this country, who were made homeless after the death of their parents. They indeed became the pioneer women of the outback of Australia. Many of those female orphans were dispersed to remote areas of Australia. Within the first three years, 70 per cent of them had married. As one author put it, 'They married early, had large families and long widowhoods. They were indeed the pioneer women of the outback of Australia.' These people want to erect a statue in Sydney to commemorate those orphan girls. This parliament should recognise the great work that Tom Power and his committee are doing to resurrect that very important part of this history of Australia. On the day after St Patrick's Day, when we have all celebrated the more joyous part of Australian-Irish history, we should understand the very important contribution that the famine and those orphan girls made to this country. Nuclear Reactor: Relocation",100
235,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in this House to speak on the recent media speCUlation that a second airport is to be built at Holsworthy and that a nuclear reactor is to be relocated from Lucas Heights to Jervis Bay, part of which is in my electorate of Gilmore and part of which is in the electorate of Fraser. I use the time in this adjournment debate to categorically deny that the nuclear reactor will be relocated to Jervis Bay and to advise my constituents that this relocation is not and never has been on any agenda. The source of this malicious rumour is currently being investigated and I am sure it will soon come to light. This rumour has caused a tremendous amount of angst in my electorate, especially amongst our Aboriginal community, for much of the area in question is of significance to them. I am glad to say that other members in the community have treated this rumour with the contempt it deserves. I view this gossip with distaste and suspicion and trust the media will also view it for what it is: a very sick joke. I sincerely hope that those who took it upon themselves to contact me with their concerns have now had their concerns allayed. I also inform the House that I contacted both the Minister for Science and Technology, the Hon. Peter MCGauran, and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon. John Sharp, who immediately denied any knowledge of any supposed report or documentation and are on public record as saying so. I ask the member for Fraser, Mr Steven Dargavel, what he has done to quell this wicked hearsay, for part of Jervis Bay is also in his electorate. During my contact with members of the Jervis Bay community on this matter, it appears that no efforts were made by the member for Fraser to appease the concerns of his constituents. This matter has been an uncalled-for diversion of government and I trust that it will now be put to rest so that we can get on with the job of running the country as we were asked to do by the members of our electorates. Nuclear Reactor: Relocation Victorian Local Councils",101
236,Mr WILTON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in a similar vein to the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash), who spoke very briefly on defending her constituents against the possibility, as she put it, of them becoming radioactive. The government clearly has made a decision, however, to locate a nuclear reactor in her electorate and it ought to be something that all her constituents should be aware of. Of equal concern to that particular matter in Gilmore was the return to what I might best caIl grassroots democracy within the Victorian municipalities of my state when over the course of last weekend 53 councils had returned to democracy after what might best be called a three-year hiatus. I would like to briefly commend the successes of several of my friends and colleagues-notably Councillor Bill Nixon, who was tonight sworn in as the inaugural mayor of the city of Kingston, and the first-time councillors elected in that municipality, notably Di Comtesse, Darlene Salisbury and John Ronk. Equally, in the city of Casey, I commend people like Janet Halsell on her election and, in the city of Frankston, my colleague Bill MCCluskey for a stirling job that he did in campaigning to gain election as the councillor for the ward of Buninyong. There are some concerns associated with the return to democracy in Victoria. It may be said that ratepayers may gain from economies of scale generated by the creation of 78 councils from formerly some 200, being as they are now organised along corporate lines with the CEOs being granted more power. One would have thought, as put by the Age editorial of 18 March, that 'this should bode well for ratepayers'. However, there is no doubt now a cloud hanging over this return to democracy following the comments of the Victorian state Minister for Planning, the Hon. Robert Maclellan, who said that any meddling, as he put it, with planning issues by newly elected councillors could see them forfeit some of their new powers to their CEOs. Mr Maclellan, as planning minister, has a fairly long and dubious record of intervention and gives the distinct impression that he is, as the Age editorial puts it, 'determined to curb the rights of councillors to involve themselves in what is one of the most important facets of their job'. That same Minister for Planning, Mr Maclellan, recently told a meeting of council CEOs that, if councillors were seen to be meddling in planning issues, they could relinquish some of those planning powers to CEOs, who themselves would become the responsible authority. This is no doubt nothing more nor less than an outrageous attack on democracy and is symptomatic of the arrogant state government in my state that day by day loses touch with the Victorian people. Planning has been a major concern of local residents within various municipalities under the commissioners, and the Kennett government would have realised that planning was of course a serious factor when candidates were campaigning in the recent council elections. There has been 'a sense of residential certainty' which 'has been replaced by ministerial call-ins, site-specific exemptions and ad hoc planning', to use the words of Mr Demetri Dollis in his letter to the Age today. Many community groups, increasingly marginalised from this planning process and concerned with the adverse impact on their local environments, are for the first time now questioning the credibility of this planning system. As I said, Mr Maclellan's record over the past 41f2 years is perhaps one of interventionist approaches to the max. I can of course cite in my own electorate the case of the Sandhurst golf development, where the lungs of Melbourne, the green wedge, was for the first time ripped asunder to allow urban development in this otherwise green area. I urge Mr Maclellan to reconsider his sentiments and to allow newly elected councillors the opportunity to truly represent democratically their constituents and afford them the powers under planning arrangements. (Time expired) Forde Community Contribution Awards",102
237,Mrs ELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to recognise some very special people in my electorate of Forde. We in this House make laws and decisions that have a lasting effect in communities throughout Australia, but it is true to say that these special people help those communities and they are the heart and soul of our community. I am talking about the many tireless voluntary workers who give so much of themselves to ensure that the community organisations and charities are there to help local residents, families in need, the elderly, veterans and the wider community. I was delighted last week to formally recognise the efforts of 10 such workers in Forde with the 1997 Forde Community Contribution Award. I established these awards as a way for the community to say thank you to those quiet achievers who never seek or desire recognition. While they never seek recognition, I think it is only fitting we take the time to let them know that their efforts are appreciated and that they have made a difference in so many people's lives. Each of the award recipients was nominated by grateful local residents. Each of the Forde Community Contribution Award winners has a consistent record over many years of helping the community. I would like to take the time tonight to mention these people and list very briefly their achievements. Of course, there is not enough time to mention every aspect of their work over the years, so this is by no means a comprehensive list. The award winners include Ollie Mutsch of Logan Village for her community work for the Logan Village Community Centre and the Logan Village Community Hall Association. Ollie has been involved in these groups for over 50 years. She is a very caring person who over the years has been a foster parent to many children. Dawn Edwards of Tamborine Mountain was nominated for her service to the community on Tamborine Mountain in many different ways. She was Leader in the Guides and Brownies for 121f2 years. She also is a Sunday school teacher and is the backbone of a club called the Kiah Club, which brings companionship and enjoyment to the lonely, the sick and those who have little contact with the outside world. Mrs Edwards arranges the entertainment program for the club. Harry Thorsen is a stalwart in the Logan Village community. He has been nominated because of his work as Chairman of Logan Village Neighbourhood Watch and Vice Chairman of the Logan Village Residents Association, and for his work on the Local Hall Committee, the Community Centre Committee and the ANZAC Committee. He has also just recently been ordained as a deacon in St Luke's Church. Mrs Kath Ryan of Beaudesert has for 20 years worked tirelessly for St Vincent de Paul, Beaudesert Care and Concern, and the Country Women's Association in Beaudesert. She is a delightful lady with a generous smile and a generous heart. Mrs Maisie Lewis of Beaudesert has been that Secretary of the Show Society and a longtime member of the Historical Society, and has also worked for the Blue Nurses. She has made a very musical contribution to the community in Glad's Girls and the U.c. Choir. Mrs Thelma Ward of Beaudesert was Treasurer of the Wongaburra Auxiliary for many years and has worked for the Red Cross and has done fundraising for the Cancer Foundation. Mrs Ward has given 20 years plus to the community.  service so long it is quite incredible. He worked for Rotary, the Cancer Foundation, the National Seniors Association and Beaudesert Care and Concern. Beaudesert and district are richer for having his service and help he so voluntarily gives. Mr Barry Cunningham of Canungra has, since the late 1970s, been Canungra RSL Management Committee Chairman. He has also been Chairman of the Fundraising Commi ttee since 1981. He established the permanent RSL club. He has worked voluntarily at the Canungra Information Centre since 1983. Mrs Kay Curran of Loganholme was recognised for the collection of food and farming supplies distributed to drought affected faminow lies in both Queensland and New South Wales, and her work in the Leukemia Foundation, Save the Koala Fund and the Beenleigh High School Young Achievers Award. Mrs Mollie Home was nominated for her work on the Anglican Church Guild, Beaudesert Hospital Auxiliary, Beaudesert RSL, Wongaburra Nursing Home, the CWA and the local Meals on Wheels. I am sure that all members of the House would join me in thanking these 10 special people for their tremendous efforts and indeed the many thousands of voluntary workers in communities around the nation. In my view, they deserve every accolade. They are the heart and soul of our community. Once again, I thank the recipients of the 1997 Forde Community Contribution Award for their selfless ongoing work. Forde is undoubtedly a better place for their efforts. Export Market Development Grants Scheme",103
238,Mr MCMULLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to take this unexpected 2¥2 minutes provided so generously by the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) not to debate on behalf of my colleague the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel) the interests of my former constituents when I was senator for the ACT and his now constituents down in Jervis Bay-for whose support over the years I have been extremely grateful-but to respond to some of the things that took place in here with regard to the export market development grants scheme, the Export Market Development Grants Bill and the debate around it. I probably will not have the opportunity to enter into the full debate but, as a former minister for trade, I have to say I am extremely disappointed with and concerned about the implications for Australian exports and the Australian economy of the changes which have been made which are, as my colleague the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) pointed out, a flagrant breach of an election promise-an election promise which, to my chagrin, was made in a debate with me at the National Press Club when the then Leader of the National Party and shadow minister, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), was outlining the trade policies for the then opposition. We had a fairly robust but friendly debate at the National Press Club, and he made a very clear and unequivocal commitment, which has been clearly and unequivocally breached. That in itself is a problem, but what worries me about this broken promise is its implications. All the research which I saw as minister for trade made it very clear that, first and foremost, EMDGs, the export market development grants, were an effective way of getting new exporters into the field and helping small to medium enterprises which wish to export to make the transition successfully. The consequence of that for the broader Australian economy is its impact on the capacity of the economy to sustain a rate of growth sufficiently high to get down our unemployment. Research shows that the trajectory of growth that is sustainable, without running into a current account deficit problem, is influenced by the proportion of our economic output that is exported. The export market development grants scheme was one of a number of initiatives which were influencing that proportion favourably and therefore creating the potential for the Australian economy to grow and to grow at a rate sufficient to maintain four per cent plus growth and therefore to sustain continuing falls in unemployment, which Australia so sorely needs. House adjourned at 11 p.m. The following notices were given: Mr Adams to move That this House: (1) notes that: (a) the members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits for honourable 'active service' under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986; (b) the members of the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force serving in Malaya were not similarly excluded; and (c) a letter, dated 11 November 1955, from the Department of the Navy to the Department of the Treasury stated that the date on which RAN ships were allotted for duty as the RAN component of the Strategic Reserve was 1 July 1955; and; (2) calls on the Minister for Defence to take action to ensure that members of the Royal Australian Navy between 1955 and 1960 are recognised as being allotted for duty in the Malayan theatre; and (3) calls on the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to take action to ensure that naval veterans of the Malayan theatre are recognised with the relevant campaign medal and the Returned from Active Service Badge.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Federal Police (Question No. 825) Mr Filing asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 16 October 1996: (1) Is the Australian Federal Police (AFP) a vital and integral link in the Australian law enforcement and policing system. (2) Does the AFP provide a regular international link and facility to Australian policing generally. (3) Is the AFP the principal policing response to illegal narcotic importation into Australia. (4) Is the AFP the foremost policing response to fraud against the Commonwealth. (5) Does the AFP, in partnership with State and Territory police, provide the most effective policing response to the intrusion of organised crime in Australia. (6) Will funding cuts to the AFP impact on its operational effectiveness in the fight against crime in this country, if so, how. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The AFP is the primary law enforcement agency through which the Commonwealth pursues its law enforcement interests. The AFP is unique in Australian law enforcement in that its functions include both community policing in the Australian Capital Territory and the protection of the interests of the Commonwealth including the investigation of offences against Commonwealth law. The AFP is an integral part of the law enforcement and policing matrix of Australia. The AFP contributes to the national law enforcement arena by participating in the management, support and use of common police services and participating in forums such as the Australasian and South-West Pacific Region Police Commissioners' Conference. (2) The AFP provides support and enhances the international law enforcement obligations of the Commonwealth and maintains a high profile in the international law enforcement arena. The activities of the AFP overseas liaison officer network and the Interpol National Criminal Bureau (NCB) are central to achievements in this area. AFP liaison officers provide a valuable resource for intelligence and investigations on a wide range NA of criminal actlVlty. The efforts of the liaison officer network complement the activities of the Interpol NCB which handles the more formal exchange of police information and requests at international level. The liaison officers are widely used in police-topolice requests both to and from host countries and Australia, in a diverse range of investigations including homicide, drug trafficking, paedophile inquiries, fraud, money laundering and organised crime activities. (3) The AFP provides the principal policing response to the importation of illicit drugs into Australia. To provide an effective response, the AFP must continue to work with other Commonwealth agencies, such as the Australian Customs Service and the National Crime Authority as well as with State, Territory and overseas law enforcement organisations. (4) The AFP has the responsibility for investigating serious fraud against the Commonwealth. The AFP has recognised and addressed a critical need to complement its professional fraud investigation team resources. It now employs specialists in forensic accountancy, international financial systems and computing technology. It also employs lawyers with the required skills and experience to provide investigators with specialist advice on the intricacies of legislation under which fraud offences may occur. White-collar criminal activity frequently involves breaches of State and Commonwealth criminal and regulatory legislation. The pursuit of evidence often will be helped by access to the intelligence and information holdings of agencies such as the AFP, State police services, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) and the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). Considerable emphasis is placed on the cooperative aspects of investigations. The AFP has contributed to the development of Commonwealth fraud control policy and procedures through its participation in numerous committees and working groups including the Commonwealth Investigation Technical Standards Committee. The Commonwealth Fraud Investigation Database (CFID) , for which the AFP acts as host agency, was established to support agency and AFP fraud investigations and to provide statistical information to Government. (5) Central to the AFP's core business is the need to counter organised crime. Organised crime was defined by the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Review (CLER) as a systematic and continuing conspiracy to commit serious offences. Organised crime involves fraud, extortion, drug trafficking and money laundering. Technological, political and economic developments have aided the growth of organised crime which has taken advantage of technological change, the globalisation of the world's economy and the larger movement of people, cash and goods around the world. To effectively counter the pervasiveness of organised crime, the AFP has actively pursued the development of cooperative strategic partnerships within law enforcement. Such partnerships ensure that the widest possible range of modem intelligence resources and techniques is available and employed to attack organised crime in this country. No single policing agency in Australia can combat the threat of organised crime to Australian society. It takes the combined efforts of all policing and regulatory agencies and govemments across all jurisdictions-Commonwealth, State and Territory-to effectively combat the threat of organised criminal groups. (6) Funding has an impact on any organisation's operational effectiveness. Complex investigations, often with international connections, require a concentration of specialised investigational The AFP has been undergoing an extensive reorganisation and evaluation process over the last two years. The AFP is pursuing a strategy towards completing this process to ensure that it is best placed to operate within current budgetary circumstances. Through this process the AFP believes it will then be better placed to provide the Government with a cogent and accurate assessment of resource needs. Evergreen Airlines: Vented Fuel (Question No. 927) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 6 November 1996: (1) Is he able to say whether a US registered L iergreen Airlines aircraft vented fuel over Marrickville, NSW, at 12.59pm on 15 October 1996; if so, (a) why, (b) what was the flight number of the aircraft, (c) what was the make of the aircraft, (d) what was the destination of the aircraft, (e) what was the volume of fuel carried by the aircraft when it departed and (t) what was the position over land of the aircraft when it vented the fuel. (2) How many similar incidents have occurred since November 1995. (3) What steps has the Government taken to warn or reprimand Evergreen Airlines over the incident. (4) What steps has he taken to ensure fuel venting or dumping does not occur. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of reports that an Evergreen Airlines B747-200 departing on 15 October 1996 at 12.59pm was sighted by members of the public appearing to release fuel on take-off. (I) (a) I am advised by Airservices Australia that fuel venting to the outside atmosphere from an aircraft is a rare event and usually only happens on long haul flights when a full fuel load is uplifted. I am also advised that the fuel venting system of an aircraft can have faulty valves that do not seal properly therefore allowing fuel to escape into the atmosphere, particularly when the aircraft is steeply banked. (1) (b) QFA7555. (1) (c) Boeing 747-200. (1) (d) Hong Kong. (1) (e) The aircraft departed with 240,300 pounds or 35,865 US. gallons. (1) (t) It is reported that the aircraft released fuel from take-off to Russell Lea, a distance of about 10 services. kilometres. (2) Three similar alleged incidents have occurred. (3) Airservices Australia wrote to the operator, Evergreen Intemational Airlines, requesting that the aircraft be inspected and any fault be quickly rectified. My office also took the matter up with Qantas which was the charterer of the aircraft. Qantas has advised that it offered assistance to Evergreen with aircraft troubleshooting and defect rectification and that, following acceptance of this offer by Evergreen, five broken vent valves in the wing tanks were replaced. (4) Should any future incidents occur, the issue will again be raised with the operator as a matter of urgency. I am examining ways in which these incidents can be minimised. Evergreen Airlines: Fuel Dumping (Question No. 992) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 2 December 1996: (1) Did an aircraft dump fuel over Ashfield, NSW, on 30 July 1996. (2) If so, has he asked Airservices Australia to investigate the incident and has he received a report or information from Airservices Australia with respect to the incident; if not, when does he expect to receive a report or information. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of reports that an Evergreen International Airlines B747-200 departing from Sydney Airport on 30 July 1996 was sighted appearing to release fuel on take-off. (2) Airservices Australia wrote to the operator, Evergreen Intemational Airlines, requesting that the aircraft be inspected and any fault be quickly rectified. Following similar alleged incidents, my office also took the matter up with Qantas, which was the charterer of the aircraft. Qantas has advised that it offered assistance to Evergreen with aircraft troubleshooting and defect rectification and that, following acceptance of this offer by Evergreen, five broken vent valves in the wing tanks were replaced. Justice Drummond Determination (Question No. 1004) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Affairs, upon notice, on 3 December 1996: (1) Does his Department use the opinion of Justice Drummond in the matter of Desmond Gibbs v. Lyle Capewell & Drs (QG 10 of 1994) (Judgment 25/95 of Drummond J Brisbane 3 February 1995) for its determination of the question as to who is an Aborigine. (2) Are other judgments used to determine this question; if so, which judgments. (3) Has it been determined what genetic material is required to satisfy Justice Drummond's measure; if so, what are the details. (4) Is there to be a separate genctic measurement of (a) Torres Strait Islanders and (b) Aborigines from different areas of Australia. (5) If the essential genetic material has not determined, what action is being taken to identify these details. (6) When will genetic testing of Australians be required. (7) How will an individual identify himself or herself as Aboriginal. (8) How often will an individual be required to identify as an Aboriginal. (9) When will an individual be identified by a community as an Aboriginal. (0) How often will an individual need to be identified by a community as Aboriginal. (1) Can prior recogmtlOn of individuals as Aboriginal later be cancelled. (2) Will the seeking, offering or the payment of remuneration for the recognition of, or the prevention of cancellation of, Aboriginality be - a criminal offence. (13) Will the principles of due process apply to determining Aboriginality. (4) How is an approach which qualifies the rights of Australians based on racial testing compatible with (a) the express desire of Australians to be treated equally before the law regardless of racial identification and (b) the recent parliamentary statement on racism.",104
239,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following information to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes (2) Yes. Commonwealth of Australia v State of Tasmania (1983) 46 ALR 625, State of Queensland v Wyvill (1989) 90 A.L.R. 611 and AttomeyGeneral (Cth) v State of Queensland (1990) 94 A.L.R. 515 (3) In his judgment Justice Drummond said, In my opinion, in order for someone to be described as an 'Aboriginal person' within the meaning of that term in the Act, some degree of Aboriginal descent is essential, although by itself a small degree of such descent is not sufficient. All that is required to satisfy the requirement of indigenous descent is that there be evidence of indigenous descent. (4) The same requirement to establish indigenous descent applies to both Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders regardless of what part of Australia they are from. (5) The requirement is that in order to establish a claim to being an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander a person is required to provide been evidence of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent. (6) Courts already have the power to require the genetic testing of Australians for some forensic purposes. Genetic testing of Australians to establish racial origin, other than for forensic purposes, is not required and I do not anticipate that such testing will ever be required. (7 & 8) A person would only be required to establish that they were an Aboriginal if that person made a claim to access services available to Aboriginal people or sought to exercise the rights of Aboriginal people and there was some doubt that that person was an Aboriginal person. The manner of self identification would depend on the circumstances. (9 & 10) Aboriginal communities themselves determine when to identify an individual as an Aboriginal. Aboriginal communities provide certificates of Aboriginality to members of the community, when required, for members of the community to access services available to Aboriginal people or to exercise the rights of Aboriginal people. (11) Yes. There have been instance of mistakes being made in the recognition of individuals as Aboriginal. (12) There are offences under the Crimes Act 1914 that make the seeking, offering or payment of money for the procuring of false evidence of Aboriginality for the purpose of defrauding the Commonwealth a criminal offence. (13) The determination of Aboriginality is a determination of fact based on available information. Every effort is made to ensure that all relevant facts are available when the determination is made. (14) The Racial Discrimination Act 1975 allows for special measures to be implemented in order to achieve equality among racial groups. Neither the desire of all Australians to be treated equally before the law regardless of racial identification nor the recent parliamentary statement on racism are incompatible with the adoption of special measures under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 to achieve fair and equal treatment for all indigenous Australians. Defence Housing Authority (Question No. 1035) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 5 December 1996: (1) Did the Government decide in the context of the 1996-97 Budget that the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) would be required to pay a dividend of $33.6 million or 60% of operating and abnormal profits for 1995-96. (2) What was the DHA's housing program prior to the 1996-97 Budget deliberations. (3) What is the DHA's housing program for 1996-97. (4) Has there been a reduction ofDHA's housing program as a result of the dividend payment; if so, (a) what are the details and (b) how will this impact on Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel. (5) What taxation arrangements is the DHA subject to. (6) Will the DHA be subject to additional taxation under the competitive neutrality program; if so, (a) what are the details, (b) what impact will this additional taxation have on DHA's housing program in (i) 1996-97 and (ii) 1997-98 and (c) how will this impact on ADF personnel. (7) What impact will changes to DHA's operations have on (a) rental return from high cost remotely located housing, (b) the DHA housing resale market, (c) housing maintenance and (d) onbase housing. Mrs Bishop---The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Since 1992 the Defence Housing Authority has been classified as a Government Business Enterprise but the payment of taxes and dividends was deferred until the completion of the Government's commitment made at the time of the Authority's establishment, that over a decade $750 million in real terms would be provided to improve Defence housing. That commitment has now been met and the Authority has been required to pay a dividend of $33.6 million on 1995-96 earnings, being at the rate of dividend set for Government Business Enterprises. (2) The DHA's housing program prior to the 1996-97 Budget deliberations was that contained in its three year Corporate Plan 1995-98 and provided for capital expenditure of $167.3 million in 199697. This Corporate Plan, prepared in 1995, acknowledged that the exemption from dividends was to be reviewed by 30 June 1996 as the $750 million capital program would by then be completed. It was recognised that under then prevailing provisioning arrangements, the outcome of the review might cause a revision of projections for years after 1995/96. (3) The DHA's housing program for 1996-97 in Corporate Plan 1996-99 provides for capital expenditure of $94.4 million, and also provides for an accelerated debt repayment program over previous planning. In addition the DHA has made a major policy change from ownership of housing to an emphasis on long term leasings from the private sector housing investment market whenever feasible. The capital program is therefore less indicative than previously of planned housing achievements. (4) The DHA's housing program in any year is a blend of meeting essential Defence Force operational requirements and making staged changes to the housing stock that match the DHA's planned available resources, such as reducing the numbers of members renting privately and upgrading the older stock. However, in the period between developing the 1995/96 and 1996/97 housing programs, the DHA has considerably expanded the numbers of houses delivered through leasing rather than purchase or construction. The DHA therefore does not need to have the same level of capital funds to meet the same level of housing outcomes as in previous years. (a) In 1996197 the DHA will acquire by purchase or construction in excess of 400 houses, predominantly in areas of limited housing markets, and will lease an additional 300 houses. (b) There will be increases to stocks of DHA managed housing in high priority areas. Approximately current levels of members renting privately will continue to do so. There has been some rescheduling of the housing upgrade program as the DHA has ceased its reliance on interest bearing loans and uses funds as they become available from sales. (5) Currently the DHA pays some Commonwealth taxes, such as fringe benefits tax and sales tax on certain items. In addition it makes payments in lieu of local government charges to local councils. (6) It is presently under consideration within Government whether under competitive neutrality policy the DHA should be subject to a Tax Equivalent Regime. The DHA has made provision in its Corporate Plan for the possibility of such a policy and its implications (a)(b) and (c). The answers are dependent on Government decisions yet to be taken. (7) (a)(b)(c)&(d) The operations of the DHA remain constant, that is to provide housing by the most cost effective means.

(9) Did the AFP recommend that certain vehicles be driven by qualified and trained Comcar drivers Products to address safety and security concerns associated with the visit. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. (2) None. (3) Comcar's original plans involved: Canberra-14 Comcar drivers Sydney-6 Comcar drivers Port Douglas-Nil Comcar drivers The number actually used was: Canberra-18 Comcar drivers Sydney-6 Comcar drivers Port Douglas-Nil Comcar drivers. Comcar (4) No. (6) and (8) I understand that the United States Government hired a number of vehicles directly from Australian hire car companies. The related details are matters known to those parties and not my Department. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet also used hire cars, which were arranged via Comcar, for some Australian and American officials. (7) Not to my Department's knowledge. (9) Yes. This request was met.

(2) On how many occasions has dumping of fuel occurred in 1996. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of reports that an Evergreen International Airlines B747-200 departing from Sydney Airport on 30 July, 13 August and 15 October 1996 was sighted appearing to release fuel on take-off.

I The reduction in payments in 1992-93 was in response to a Commonwealth Budget decision to reduce the Commonwealth-State Housing Crisis Accommodation Program (Question No. 1234) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: (1) What has been the allocation of funds in the 1996-97 Budget for the Crisis Accommodation Program (CAP) (a) in total and (b) by State. (2) What funds were allocated to CAP (a) in total and (b) by State in the (i) 1990-91, (ii) 1991-92, (iii) 1992-93, (iv) 1993-94, (v) 1994-95 and (vi) 1995-96 Budgets.

(3) What (a) did the Social Security Act, prior to the introduction of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 and (b) does the Social Security Act now say in regard to the job unsuitability test when a person is faced with poor occupational health and safety conditions, and why was this section of the Act amended. (4) What are the estimated savings to the Commonwealth as a result of the amendment referred to in part (3). Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) There would be no penalty where a customer in receipt of Newstart or Youth Training Allowance declined a job offer due to occupational health and safety grounds. (3) (a) Existing legislation, (s 601(2A)(c) of the Social Security Act 1991) states ""particular paid work is unsuitable for a person if and only if, in the Secretary's opinion, performing the work in the conditions in which the work would be performed would constitute a risk to health or safety and would contravene a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory relating to occupational health and safety"". (b) The proposed amendment was not passed by Parliament in the previous sitting. Therefore the existing legislation is still applicable. (4) There were to be no savings as a result of this amendment. Commonwealth Games Association: Mr Arthur Tunstall (Question No. 1276) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government: (1) Is he able to say what selection process was used by the Commonwealth Games Association to select Mr A. Tunstall to the committee organised by the Victoria Premier to promote Melbourne's bid for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. (2) If so, does he support the appointment by the Commonwealth Games Association of Mr Tunstall to the committee. Mr W arwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under the endorsement contract between the State of Victoria and the Australian Commonwealth Games Association (ACGA) there is a requirement that a bid committee be established with equal representation from the Victorian Government and the ACGA. Each organisation is to provide four (4) representatives and in the ACGA's case this is tied to the office holders of the following positions; - President; - Secretary Treasurer; - General Manager; and - President, Victorian Division. Mr Tunstall is the current office holder of the position of Secretary Treasurer and, under the terms of the endorsement contract, automatically becomes a member of the bid committee. (2) As membership of the bid committee has been formally resolved between the Victorian Government and the ACGA, any comment· on the Government's position on the composition of the committee is inappropriate.

In relation to funding, (a) the first mission cost $9,050.18, and the second mission cost $5,846.50; and (b) these missions were funded by AusAID. In July 1996, an officer attended, at the invitation of the Commonwealth Secretariat, the Commonwealth Pacific Regional Workshop on Human Rights Education and Training held in Vanuatu. The officer provided assistance on electoral education to representatives of government and nongovernment organisations from Pacific countries present at the workshop. In relation to funding, (a) the mission cost $4,259.12; and (b) the cost was borne by the AEC. Assistance was provided to Malaysia in October 1996, when a delegation of senior Malaysian officials led by the Secretary of the Election Commission Malaysia, visited Australia for regional council elections of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), which were conducted by the AEC. I was pleased to meet the Malaysian delegation, and believe that the visit promoted this important bilateral relationship. In relation to funding, (a) the cost to the AEC of this visit was $1,271; and (b) other costs were borne by Malaysia. Assistance was provided to South Africa in July 1996, when two officers were invited to attend the Launch Conference for the Community Elections Evaluation Group's report on the November 1995 South African local government elections. In addi(2) (3)(a) Individual consultancies Value Australian Financial Re- $25000 view tion to attending the launch conference, the officers met with South African government and nongovernment organisations, and attended Commonwealth discussions on future technical assistance to South Africa. In relation to funding, (a) the cost for this mission was $11,236.43; and (b) this was paid by the AEC, but will be reimbursed by the Commonwealth Secretariat and AusAID. In September 1996 an officer provided advice to the South African government on the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in electoral administration. In relation to funding, (a) and (b), this mission was funded by the South African Independent Electoral Commission (lEC). I am advised by the AEC that assistance to developing countries, including Cambodia, South Africa, Uganda and Western Samoa, is envisaged for the remainder of 1996-97, subject to organisational and funding arrangements being settled.

240,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ATIACHMENT A,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: In relation to (a) and (b) only those persons who are recognised as native title holders by the common law are entitled to a determination of native title, and for this reason not all traditional owners or Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders will necessarily succeed in obtaining such a determination. It is essential for a successful determination that the claimants show that they have maintained a continuing connection with the land or waters concerned in accordance with their traditional laws and customs. The concept of ""native title holders"", however, is not synonymous with ""traditional owner"" as the native title rights of some traditional owners may have been extinguished or otherwise ceased. In terms of whether the persons referred to in the question would be able ""to reside within lands for which title has been or shall be granted under the Contract Duration Description (if completed) (3)(a) (3)(b) (4) Report: Review of International Best 2.5 months Practice in the Adoption and Management of Technology Review of Business Programs-David (not yet comMortimer, Chair pleted) Development of best practice guide for 2.25 months practitioners in housing and urban development industry Audit and fraud-related services (not yet completed) Replacement of existing Trade Mark 2 months Imaging application Native Title Native Title Act"", the answer to the question is in two parts. First, native title is not in fact ""granted"" under the Native Title Act 1993 (the NTA). The NTA provides for the making of determinations that native title exists or does not exist in relation to an area of land or waters and details the processes which are to be followed in order to establish whether or not native title exists. Before the NT A was enacted, a determination of native title could be sought through the courts under the common law. A determination that native title exists is the formal recognition of the pre-existing common law rights that have been and are still held by the persons who are the subject of the determination. The concept of a ""determination"" is distinct from the concept of a ""grant"" where a right is conferred on a person who does not already hold that right. As native title rights already exist, they may be exercised whether or not there has been determination under the Native Title Act. After a determination that native title exists has been made, native title may be held by a body corporate on behalf of the native title holders, or it may be held directly by the native title holders with a body corporate acting as a representative for the holders in certain matters affecting their native title. Second, the issue of whether the native title rights of a particular group of native title holders include the right to reside on land subject to their native title will depend on the particular facts and tenure history of the areas concerned and on the customary laws giving rise to the native title. This can only be assessed on a case by case basis. As native title is not a ""tenure"" within the normal understanding of that term in Anglo-Australian property law, it is not appropriate to speak of ""security of tenure"" in relation to native title. Security of title of native title holders, however, is a matter dealt with by the NT A. Paragraph 3(a) of that Act states that one of the purposes of the Act is the recognition and protection of native title. Native title holders are entitled to the protection afforded their title by the NTA and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 regardless of whether there has been a formal determination that their native title exists. However, the protection given by these Acts does not mean that native title cannot be adversely affected or extinguished. Like other interests in land or waters, native title is not immune from acts of the Crown. Under the common law, native title is susceptible to extinguishment by the Crown, for example by the valid grant of an interest which is inconsistent with the continued existence of native title. It can also be surrendered by the native title holders or die out by reason of loss of continuing connection to the area concerned. Since the commencement of the NT A, native title has only been able to be extinguished or affected in accordance with the NT A. Under the NT A, as is the case with other interests in land or waters, native title can be compulsorily acquired by the Crown, and may be validly affected by certain other acts (known as future acts). The NT A establishes processes to be followed when future acts are done, with the nature of the acts determining which processes are to be followed. Apart from the acts specified in subsection 26(2) of the NT A (which include the grant of mining interests), the general rule is that native title holders are to be accorded the same procedural rights in relation to a future act on land as they would have if they instead held freehold title to that area. The process to be followed in relation to the grant of mining interests and the other acts to which subsection 26(2) applies is known as the right to negotiate and does not amount to power of veto. It is a right to negotiate about a proposed act and if no agreement is reached, to have the matter determined by an arbitrator.
