(2) What is the estimated annual cost to the ADF for the provision of each benefit referred to in part (1). (3) Will each benefit referred to in part (1) be identified on group certificates under the provisions of the Government's A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Act; if so, what are the implications for ADF personnel. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Records of the number of Australian Defence Force (ADF) recipients of the above entitlements are required for Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) purposes. The following data was obtained from the 1998-99 FBT return and only relates to the FBT liability for these items: (a) an average of 3,252. (b) 28,719. (c) 2,434. (d) 146. (e) 974 ADF members and 1,709 dependants travelled on a individual sector. (t) an average of 32,901. (g) an average of 158. (h) not applicable as funeral costs and expenses are not subject to FBT. (2) The estimated annual FBT cost for each of the above is: (a) $3.146 million. NA (b) $8.013 million. (c) $6.772 million. (d) $0.480 million. (e) $0.749 million. (t) $101.034 million. (g) $0.174 million. (h) not applicable as funeral costs and expenses are not subject to FBT. (3) The legislation requires that a single FBT amount is reflected on each individual's group certificate. If a member receives more than one benefit the aggregated amount will be reported. Generally, for those conditions of service that are in the nature of a personal benefit, the effect on ADF members will be the same as the effect on other taxpayers and members of the community, ie the FBT amount reported on group certificates will be used to determine individuals' liabilities for superannuation and Medicare levy surcharges, entitlement to income tested government benefits and concessions, child support obligations and higher education contribution scheme (HECS) repayments. The Government has decided that conditions of service that are not solely in the nature of a personal benefit will not be reported on group certificates.

(3) With which countries has Australia made, or is Australia preparing to make, arrangements under the Convention. (4) For which conventions in the Hague Conference system is his department responsible. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes (2) Yes. (3) The Convention establishes legally binding standards and safeguards to be observed by State Member countries participating in intercountry adoption among themselves - As such there is no need to make arrangements under the Convention than with particular State Member countries to enable adoptions between them to occur. If prospective adoptive parents wish to adopt from a participating country they need to make an application through their State or Territory department responsible for adoption matters. Apart from the Convention, Australia has a than number of current adoption programs pursuant to bilateral arrangements between the States and Territories and overseas countries.

It would have been very disruptive to the comfort and privacy of the haven residents to allow the media of Commonaccess at that time. (3) The haven centre at Brighton in Tasmania is by generally well maintained although there have been . some instances of graffiti. Some rooms have been kept less clean than is desirable but there have been no major instances of damage.

This translated into 400 places for the offshore Parent visa subclass 103 (overseas) and 100 places for the onshore parent subclass 804. I have detennined caps at those levels under section 85 of the Migration Act. No caps have been set for the new Designated Parent category. (2) Caps may be imposed on any visa subclass during the course of the program year (except for spouses or children). At present I have only determined caps in respect of the parent subclasses mentioned above. Other subclasses may be capped during the course of the program year depending on levels of demand. (3) On the information currently available, there are some 19,400 applicants in the parent category. (4) Table 1 below provides details of the number of applicants currently in the pipeline for the remaining Family Stream subclasses including Parents. (5) No, this Government has maintained a strong commitment to family migration. The Family Stream of Australia's Migration Program enables the reunion of immediate family members such as spouses, fiance(e)s, interdependent partners, dependent children, adopted children, stepchildren, and certain other members of extended families such as parents, orphan relatives, carers, aged dependent relatives and remaining relatives. I have set processing priorities for visa applications in the Family Stream to ensure that immediate family members, such as dependent children (including children for adoption and orphan relatives), spouses, fiance(e)s and interdependent partners of sponsors and nominators in Australia are given the highest priority. The number of parent places available has decreased as this Government has sought to strike a more optimal balance between the skilled and family components of the Migration Program and give greater priority within the Family Stream to immediate family members such as spouses and children. The Government has had concerns about the increasing numberÂ·ofFamily Stream applicants who are parents and the costs to the community associated with their entry. Research indicates that these migrants have a greater dependency onÂ· services being used by our ageing population, especially health and social security benefits. Parents of working age also experience extreme difficulty in obtaining employment. The Government believes it is reasonable that these people and their Australian sponsors and assurers should bear a fairer share of the costs associated with their entry. To achieve this objective, on 1 November 1998 I introduced changes to the entry arrangements for parents including: limiting access to permanent migration to aged parents (with the exception for certain working age parents); preventing parents from applying for pennanent residence while they were within Australia, with the exception of long-tenn retirement visa holders; and increasing the second instalment of the Visa Application Charge (the health charge) from $945 to $5,000. On 31 March 1999, non-Government Senators voted to disallow these changes to entry arrangements for parents. As a result of the disallowance, many Australian citizen and permanent resident sponsors were denied the opportunity to bring their parents to Australia. Moreover, the Government was forced to reduce the number of places available in order to manage the increased financial burden on the Australian community. Following discussions with the Opposition spokesman on Immigration, I have recently introduced regulations that will allow parent applicants affected by the disallowance in March 1999 to have TABLE 1: FAMILY STREAM APPLICANTS AS AT 30 SEPTEMBER 1999 Visa Subclass (No) Spouse Prospective marriage Child Parent Preferential Family Interdependents Total Source: DIMA MPMS and RESI2 data 1 Onshore data is at 30 June 1999.

Workplace Relations Act: Independent Financial Review (Question No. 1001) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 18 October 1999: (1) Did his Department advertise or call for tenders in relation to the independent review of the financial, accounting, auditing and reporting provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996; if so, how many tenders were received. (2) What was the cost of the report entitled ""Review of current arrangements for Governance of Industrial Organisations"" prepared by Blake Dawson Waldron. (3) Did his Department provide personnel during the preparation or research of the report; if so, what assistance was provided and how much did it cost. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: their applications reactivated under a new Designated Parent class. The introduction of this new visa class will provide over 2,000 parents with an avenue to join their children. This will be on the basis that they are still prepared to-pay the higher health charges involved in the disallowed categories. I am also looking into the long-term options for allowing more parents to enter Australia without placing an unsustainable burden on Australia's health and welfare systems and the Australian taxpayer. I look forward to working with the Opposition spokesman on Immigration on these options.

(3) My Department provided limited secretariat support (forwarding submissions received), and met with the consultant in Melbourne on two occasions to discuss progress. My Department estimates salary and travel costs at approximately $3500-$4000. China: Falun Dafa (Question No. 1005) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 19 October 1999: (1) Has his attention been drawn to allegations of human rights violations taking place in the People's Republic of China with regard to the Chinese Government's repression of the practitioners of Falun Dafa. (2) Is the Australian Government taking actions to place pressure on the Chinese government to uphold the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and to ensure, in line with the UN covenant, that practitioners of Falun Dafa are allowed freedom of expression and assembly; if so, what. (3) Has the Australian Government raised these issues in the bilateral human rights dialogue with China. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My Department has been following closely reports of actions taken against Falun Gong practi tioners in China since the Chinese Government banned the group on 22 July. (2) The Australian Government has raised its concerns about the treatment of Falungong with the Chinese government: first, to the Chinese Charge d'Affaires in Canberra on 23 July 1999; secondly, to a senior official of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing on 29 July; and thirdly, in a number of senior-level meetings during the third round of the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, held in China from 16-20 August. On each occasion, we told the Chinese that, although we take no position on the beliefs of Falungong, we consider that actions taken against its adherents are in breach of the international human rights covenants which China has signed.
