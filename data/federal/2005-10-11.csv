1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Hon. David Hawker) took the chair at 2.00 pm and read prayers. NA NA,19
2,Mr HOWARD,MEMORIAL SERVICE,"On indulgence, I confirm that a short memorial service will be held tomorrow morning at 9.15 to commemorate the third anniversary of the terrorist attacks in Bali in 2002. The ceremony will be held in the eastern formal gardens and I understand arrangements will be made for the House to delay its proceedings until 10 am to allow members and senators to attend if they wish to do so. The Leader of the Opposition and I will lay wreaths, as will the charge d'affaires of the Indonesian Embassy. I understand that representatives of the Newcastle community will attend as well. I have asked Reverend Joy Bartholomew from St Andrews Presbyterian Church to make some comments and lead a prayer of remembrance at the service. I can inform the House that arrangements for this brief memorial service have been worked out in close consultation with the opposition.",19
3,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMORIAL SERVICE,"On indulgence, I endorse the remarks the Prime Minister just made, confirm the last comment he made and urge members to attend the ceremony. I am sure many will. NA Workplace Relations",19
4,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to comments made last night by Dr Peter Jensen, Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, about the impact of the government's industrial relations changes on children, families and relationships, expressing concern about the: ... need for preserving shared time for children, families, relationships for all Australians ... That's what life is about ... Without shared time we may as well be robots. Given that community leaders such as Archbishop Jensen view his extreme proposals in this way, why doesn't the Prime Minister just back off now and shred the bills?",19
5,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have heard and read the remarks made by Archbishop Jensen. Let me say that I agree with him that relationships are far more important than money. I think Archbishop Jensen is a very fine archbishop of the Anglican archdiocese of Sydney and he is a very significant and fine community leader. I take the view that Archbishop Jensen's concern for a right balance between family and work considerations is justified. In the view of the government and in the view of many people, greater flexibility will provide greater opportunities to balance work and family responsibilities. Whilst relationships and the close relationships within families are far more important than economic considerations, it is also the case that job security is very important to family security. Job security is built on a strong economy and a strong economy depends crucially on the right industrial relations policy, and that is what this government is about. Avian Influenza",19
6,Dr WASHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House what action Australia has taken to combat avian influenza in our region?,19
7,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First, I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. As a doctor he knows only too well the issues that are at stake here. Australia has been leading the region to strengthen the defence of the Asia-Pacific region against avian influenza. We have been working within APEC since 2001 to help the region prepare for pandemic threats, including avian flu. On 31 October Australia will host a meeting in Brisbane of the representatives of the 21 APEC economies who are responsible for pandemic and disaster management. It will also bring together experts from a range of international organisations such as the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and so on. Since 2003 the government have committed $180 million to combat the threat of avian flu, which includes $20 million under our aid program, to improve detection, surveillance, emergency preparedness and response capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region. Last week a high-level team of Australian senior officials visited Indonesia as of our discussions with the Indonesians on avian flu. While I am in Indonesia over the next two days I will be discussing the outcomes of that visit with Indonesian officials, including with the President of Indonesia. I hope at the end of my visit I will have something to say about that, amongst other issues, depending on the discussions I have with the Indonesians. Let me also say that the government are working at a wider international level. We are a key member of the International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza, which brings together concerned states to develop global capabilities to respond to these threats. We need to bear in mind that avian flu becoming a pandemic is of course not a certainty. Australia's Chief Medical Officer has said that the probability of avian flu turning into a pandemic in the next few years is 10 per cent. It is one in 10. So there is no need to run around and suggest that the sky is falling in. The fact is that the government are getting on with sensible and practical measures not only for us to address the issue here in Australia but to make sure we contribute to the defences of the Asia-Pacific region. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Could the Minister for Foreign Affairs table the document from which he read, in its entirety?",19
8,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the minister quoting from a confidential document? Mr Downer-Yes. Workplace Relations,20
9,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, I refer to the statement of the late Pope John Paul II, following his meeting with factory workers in Parramatta, that Australia's industrial relations system has ‘helped to defend the rights of workers and promote their wellpart being, while at the same time taking into account the needs and the future of the whole community'. I also refer to Cardinal George Pell's comments in the Sydney Morning Herald on 6 August that the test of the fairness of the government's industrial relations changes would be the preservation of civilised conditions and family time. Prime Minister, is your only response to these views the one that you expressed on 7 August that: There's no such thing as a Catholic ... view on anything ...",20
10,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I call the Prime Minister, I remind the member for Lowe that the use of the word ‘you' in the question is not necessary.",20
11,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will check precisely what I said on that occasion. As we were shown yesterday, you do not want to believe everything the opposition tells you in question time. Let me say this: I treat the member's question very seriously, as I should. He is a serious member and he is a conscientious member. I am working on him. I think I might win him over eventually to our industrial relations policies. Can I just very seriously say that the point I was making in that program was simply this: on any issue that is the subject of political debate in our community there will be conscientious Catholics who will take one view and conscientious Catholics who will take the opposite view. In fact, you presumed in your question to refer to Cardinal Pell. I seem to recall Cardinal Pell some years ago making the point that there was no such thing as a Catholic position on a particular aspect of taxation. He was right. He made that point, I think, in the context of the 1998 election. I do not draw on my own authority to talk on matters relating to the Catholic Church. In fact, I invoke the authority of the leader of the Catholic archdiocese of Sydney-a person for whom I have an immense personal regard and who I think, like Dr Peter Jensen, is a great leader. My view is this. I do not think the quality of this debate is improved by somebody trying to claim that the totality of a Catholic view is either for or against the government's policy. I do not argue that. I do not invoke the authority of any of the Christian churches in this country for our policies. I will argue policy on its own merits and I stand by what I said: there will be Catholics who will agree with us and Catholics who disagree with us; there will be Anglicans who will agree and disagree. That is how it should be in a nation such as this, which has a proper regard for the respective roles of the government and the church. NA",20
12,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon a delegation from the Council of State Governments from the United States of America, led by Governor Ruth Ann Minner. Also present in the gallery are members of a delegation of Young Political Leaders from the United States of America who are visiting under the auspices of the Australian Political Exchange Council. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Workplace Relations",21
13,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, would you outline to the House the case for further reforming Australia's labour market? Further, Treasurer, are there any other views?",21
14,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for his question. I can inform him that the case for reforming Australia's industrial relations law is that we can make the Australian economy more productive. If we make the Australian economy more productive and businesses more profitable, they will be able to employ more people at higher wages. We can make the Australian economy more productive by getting rid of six separate state systems and having one, by easing agreement making, by having flexibility and by giving people work a choices. That is the case for industrial relations reform in this country. The opposition leader has put forward his views in relation to this. He was asked a question yesterday about skills and he cited in his defence the OECD, the Reserve Bank and the IMF. Let me say, as I did yesterday, that the OECD, the Reserve Bank and the IMF have all been clear on one thing: Australia needs further industrial relations reform. In the course of that interview yesterday he was also asked about essential services. Here is the reply that the Leader of the Opposition gave to that question yesterday: Now, on the essential services thing ... I would roll that back. The policy that dare not speak its name! He obviously realised at that point that ‘rollback' was not a word to be used in polite political discussion anymore in this country, because he said: I would change that. I would eliminate that and the reasons are simply this-and I will not use that phrase, I must say, in connection with so I've amended it immediately, I've amended it immediately because this is not the exercise that we're engaged in. The immediate amendment was just a whisper too late because the policy that dare not speak its name popped out. There was an American baseball player whom our American friends will know called Yogi Berra, who had a famous saying. He said, ‘It feels like deja vu all over again.' Well, it feels like deja vu all over again when the policy that dare not speak its name popped out on industrial relations. The Leader of the Opposition was wrong about roll-back the first time and he was wrong about roll-back the second time. Workplace Relations",21
15,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Treasurer. I refer to the remarks of the Treasurer on 11 July, criticising church leaders, particularly Archbishop Aspinall, for expressing concern about the government's extreme industrial relations changes on the basis that ‘having a theological degree doesn't mean you're an IR expert'. Does the Treasurer still stand by that view?",22
16,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I said, and I will say it again, is that church leaders have every right to speak as freely as they wish on every issue. I made that point at the time and I will make it again: church leaders have every freedom to speak on every issue. They are members of Australian society and they are voters. We practise freedom of speech in this country and, like any other Australian, they have complete freedom of speech. Like any other Australian their views should be assessed on their content. Like a politician's views should be assessed and like a journalist's views should be assessed, so too a church leader's views should be assessed on their content. They should be assessed on their content on whether industrial relations these, would promote economic benefit, whether it would promote productivity, whether it would promote jobs and whether it would promote the opportunity for people in Australian society who are currently out of work to share in that. Whether it is a politician, whether it is a journalist or whether it is a church leader, every person has the right to freedom of speech and the right to be judged on the merit and content of their views. Iraq",22
17,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Unfortunately, I cannot weave the Pope into my question. Would the minister update the House on Iraq's path to democracy? What is the government doing to support it and are there any alternative views?",22
18,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,22
19,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But you were in favour for a while; we read it in the book. I thank the honourable member for his question. Let me say, in case members of the House are not aware-but I know the honourable member for Canning would be-that on Saturday, 15 October, the Iraqi people will vote in a referendum on a draft constitution. I do not know how they will vote, and there is speculation about that. I will not add to it, but the fact that the ordinary people of Iraq are able to vote on a particular draft of their constitution is a great thing. This will be another example of how democracy is arriving in Iraq. We saw that at the end of January, when the Iraqi people voted for the Transitional National Assembly. On this side of the House we are proud of our soldiers who helped to end Saddam's regime. We are proud of those who are now training Iraqis to defend themselves. We are proud of those who are providing a secure environment for valuable Japanese reconstruction work and we are proud of those Australians who are working to assist with the elections. I think our policy is perfectly clear. We are fully committed to supporting Iraq's transition to democracy, because we support democracy. We are part of a proud coalition. I saw the British Secretary of for Defence, Dr Reid, the other day and he reminded me that the British are determined to make sure they stay and defeat the terrorists. When I saw Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice in Washington and in New York the week before last, they both made the same point: they are determined to make sure that the terrorists are defeated and that democracy thrives in Iraq. Are there any alternatives?",22
20,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,23
21,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can tell from the interjections that there are some. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith, in particular, profess that their position now is to support troops out of Iraq: we should now get out; we should have an exit strategy and get out as quickly as possible. The only problem with that is that Bernard Lagan in his very revealing book argued that the member for Griffith in particular had disagreed with the former Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham. He disagreed with the Latham policy of bringing troops out by Christmas. Despite the fact that the member for Griffith and the Leader of the Opposition argued in favour of the Latham policy, we know from the Lagan book that they did not agree with it. Nobody this week has mentioned, and let me be the first, Mark Latham's very interesting diaries. The point about those diaries is this statement: Rudd wanted our policy of the troops to be a review when we get into government so I overruled him and said yesterday that we wanted them home by Christmas. The fact is that, secretly, people like the member for Griffith and, presumably, the Leader of the Opposition actually support the simple proposition that we must defeat the terrorists in Iraq and that we must support State democracy in Iraq. But because of the way the Labor Party works, they profess to hold a different view. I thought in Mark Latham's book it was all summed up with one simple phrase, and it is the phrase he used about the Leader of the Opposition. Opposition members-Boring!",23
22,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I don't think you will find it so boring. He said this about the Leader of the Opposition: ‘Kim Beazley? You can sum him up in four words: he is an opportunist.' If ever there was a great opportunist,23

26,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,All I can say after that is thank God that Chief Marshal Houston has an exit strategy and I hope he passed it on to you.,23
27,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will come to his question.,23
28,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And my question is to the Prime Minister.,24
29,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,24
30,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The interjections from both sides of this House are far too noisy.,24
31,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister.,24
32,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. Mr Ciobo-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: on a number of occasions you have asked the Leader of the Opposition to come to the question. How many times must we be subjected to that preamble?",24
33,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Moncrieff will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition has already been asked to come to his question and he will come to his question.,24
34,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Why did the government oppose Family First Senator Steve Fielding's motion to have a Senate inquiry into the implications for families of the Howard government's extreme industrial relations changes? Prime Minister, doesn't the government oppose having this inquiry because it does not want Australians to know the truth?",24
35,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The answer to the question is no. Taxation,24
36,Mr CIOBO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline to the House how all states have benefited from windfall gains from tax reform? Is he aware of any alternative proposals to boost state Labor Party coffers?,24
37,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question and I can inform him that when the government introduced the A New Tax System in 2000 the GST revenue was allocated to the states in accordance with a formula that they agreed themselves to equalise allocations between the six states and the two territories. I am happy to inform the House that, after four completed financial years since the introduction of the GST, every state and territory has benefited in the sense that they are now in a windfall situation-they have more money after the abolition of the taxes which were part of the arrangement than they would have had if the old system had continued. In 2004-05 the states will receive around $35 billion in GST revenue. The total windfall to the states in 2004-05 will be around $2 billion. No state has benefited more from GST arrangements than Queensland. Queensland has had the largest windfall-that is, GST receipts over and above what it would have received under the old system-of any state in the Commonwealth. That is why I was shocked to read a claim by the Queensland Premier yesterday that Queensland somehow was receiving less GST than it was entitled to and, as a consequence, raising the prospect that the Queensland Labor government may increase taxes as part of a minibudget. Here we are in Queensland, the biggest beneficiary of any state under the GST arrangements, own source revenue booming because of the property market and because of royalties out of coal-which is at the highest terms of trade ever-and we have the Queensland Premier saying, ‘I am now short of money and I may have to increase taxes.' The suggestion is that in some way Queensland has not got what it was entitled to. Let me tell you what Queensland got in 2004-05. Queensland received, under the GST, $7.328 billion. If the old system had been in place, it would have received $6.559 billion. Queensland has received a windfall, in one year alone, of $768 million over and above its guaranteed amounts. If there is a problem in Queensland, it has nothing to do with GST arrangements, it has nothing to do with own source revenues, which have been increasing at a dramatic rate; it is all about management. If the Queensland government cannot manage its own affairs, it cannot expect taxpayers in other states to bail it out from those affairs. Workplace Relations",24
38,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's industrial relations announcement on Sunday and his favourite example of Billy. In that example Billy is an unemployed job seeker who is offered an AWA which explicitly removes award conditions for public holidays, rest breaks, bonuses, annual leave loading, allowances, penalty rates and shift and overtime loadings. Prime Minister, is it not the case that Billy has no choice but to accept the job or remain unemployed? Isn't Billy's experience going to become the standard experience for all Australian employees moving to new jobs?",25
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the second part of the question is no. The answer to the generality of the question is that at least the member for Perth has acknowledged that Billy in that example was out of work and, therefore, it stands to reason that he is infiested nitely better off taking the contract under those conditions. Workplace Relations",25
40,Mr HENRY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister update the House as to how Australian workers will be protected in workplace bargaining in the future? Are there any alternative views?,25
41,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. What we have seen over the last 24 hours or so is the Leader of the Opposition attempting to scare Australian employees into thinking that they will have to negotiate their terms and conditions directly with their employer without any protections or assistance. Yesterday on the Steve Price radio program the Leader of the Opposition claimed: ... an 18-year-old kid walking into a workplace simply does not bargain equally with his boss. If the Leader of the Opposition were genuinely interested in the welfare of young people, rather than patronising them in the way in which he has been doing over the last 24 hours he would have pointed out a number of additional facts which he failed to point out. Firstly, he would have pointed out that every employee who is offered an Australian workplace agreement can appoint a bargaining agent to act on their behalf. He did not point that out. Secondly, if he were genuinely interested in the welfare of young people in this country he would have pointed out that that bargaining agent could be a representative of the union, a lawyer, an accountant, a parent, a guardian or any other person. Mr Bevis interjecting",25
42,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If he were interested he would have pointed that out. Thirdly, and this is important, if he were genuinely interand did not have this patronising attitude to young Australians, he would have pointed out that once a bargaining agent is appointedMr Bevis-Billy's got to get an accountant.",25
43,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Brisbane is warned.,25
44,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"then the employer must deal with that bargaining agent. There is absolutely no discretion. The employer must deal with that bargaining agent. He would have also pointed out that any person under the age of 18 years cannot enter into an Australian workplace agreement unless they have the consent of their parent or guardian to that agreement. Lastly, he would have pointed out, but he is not interested in the facts, that the AWA must contain the new protections which will be contained in the Australian fair pay and conditions standard. None of these things were pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition. The reality is, as we saw yesterday coming from the member for Perth and the member for Capricornia, an intention simply to mislead this House and mislead the Australian people about Australian workplace agreements, something which the member for Perth at least conceded on the radio this morning. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister then made an allegation which would need to be made by way of substantive motion. He did say ‘intentionally mislead'. That needs to be withdrawn.",25
45,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member conceded this morning that he misled the Australian people, and that is what he did. He misled the Australian people, and you well know it. That is the reality. Let us get back to the reality here and that is that some 770,000 Australian workplace agreements have been entered into by Australians in Australia-thousands of them in the electorate of the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition, and thousands of them in the electorate of the member for Perth-and what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do is to strangle Australian workplace agreements and therefore cut the wages of those Australians who are earning more on those agreements. We stand for choice and flexibility, not for the regressive policies that are being adopted by the opposition. Taxation",26
46,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer and relates to his release of Treasury analysis showing the undercosting of the tax proposals by the member for Wentworth. Will the Treasurer, after publicly humiliating the member for Wentworth, bring forward his own tax reform proposals or does he believe his own leadership ambitions are a higher priority? When will the Treasurer release the costings of the member for Wentworth's tax proposals?",26
47,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In calling the Treasurer, he may respond to the parts that are of public interest. He does not have to respond specifically to a colleague's views.",26
48,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The government has released its tax cut proposals. It brought them down in the budget in May. What is more: I would have thought the member for Lilley would remember because he voted them down on two occasions in the House of Representatives on the ground that there should be no tax cutMr Swan interjecting,26

55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the Treasurer and the Treasurer is in order.,27
56,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Labor Party had its way, every Australian would be paying higher taxes today. Secondly, we would be reminding the Australian people that the government has legislated further tax cuts to take effect on 1 July of next year. The consequence of that is that only three per cent of Australians will be on the top marginal tax rate. I remind the House that the Labor Party's policy",27
57,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will resume his seat.,27
58,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: it is amplyMr Costello interjecting",27
59,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is not frivolous. The way you dealt with Wentworth was frivolous.,27
60,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will come to his point of order.,27
61,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He has a question before him-a very simple one-about releasing the figures he has on the member for Wentworth's tax proposal.,27
62,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to raise a point of order, he should come to that point of order. He is not here just to restate questions.",27
63,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And I will finish my answer, because the Labor Party hates to be reminded. The Labor Party opposes the tax cuts to take effect on 1 July next year on the grounds that they are for high-income earners. If the Labor Party had had its way, the Labor Party would have denied both this year's tax cuts and next year's as well. Workplace Relations",27
64,Mr SECKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister advise the House how award changes in the government's WorkChoices reform package will affect workers in regional Australia and my electorate of Barker?,27
65,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no doubt that further reform of the workplace relations systemMs King interjecting,27
66,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Ballarat is warned!,27
67,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"will improve Australia's economic performance, increase jobs and enhance living standards. We have a strong economy now, but we need to keep working on it and ensure that we make fair and practical changes to continue to make progress. If you stand still, you effectively go backwards. People in regional areas like the electorate of the member for Barker will well remember the impacts of Labor's bungling in workplace relations and they have not forgotten the impact on residents in rural and regional Australia. There is far too much red tape and too much complexity. Some parts of the current system are just so confusing that employers have no chance of properly understanding them. When you consider that we have six different systems, 130 different pieces of industrial relations legislation and over 4,000 different awards, it is no wonder that there has been such confusion about the industrial relations arrangements. I have a practical example: Don runs a pastoral station that has a coffee and gift shop for tourists. His station hands are working under a federal award while his employees in the coffee and gift shop are employed under a state award. Don has to negotiate with the complexity of two workplace relations systemsMr Brendan O'Connor interjecting",27
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Gorton!,27
69,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"meaning two sets of laws governing how his employees are treated, their different entitlements and how they can negotiate. Their unfair dismissal arrangements and their redundancy protections are different and, of course, he has different unfully? ions in the workplace. Under what we are proposing, all of his employees will be under the same workplace relations laws. They will have the same Australian fair pay and conditions standard. He will be able to deal with all of his staff with the same set of conditions, making all the mechanisms so much simpler. Don will be able to spend his time running his business instead of trying to sort Corio! out all of this confusion. Those are the sorts of changes that can make a real difference in our workplace, and it is high time the opposilegal tion got on board and started to support this kind of reform. NA",28

71,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Hasn't the minister for immigration indicated that the government has accepted the Comrie report in full? Minister, doesn't that mean the following words are an accurate reflection of the government's management of immigration: ‘failure', ‘inexcusable', ‘catastrophic', ‘dereliction of duty', ‘shameful episode', ‘inaccurate assumption', ‘defying common sense and decency' and ‘dehumanised'? In the face of this, how is it that Senator Vanstone can say that her department has not ‘been, generally speaking, acting unlawfully'? Minister, if it has not been generally acting unlawfully, exactly how often does the department act unlaw der: the question from the member for Watson clearly contains argument in the list that he gave and also hypothetical matter.

The Prime Minister said yesterday that, yes, the minister and the government accept that there are problems that have to be solved within the department of immigration. That is being done. As a matter of fact, as Senator Vanstone, the minister, pointed out last week, some $230 million is being set aside over the next five years to rehabilitate some aspects of what the department administers. For example, the Palmer implementation plan is in line with what the minister and the department outlined under Andrew Metcalfe, the new secretary. The $230 million is being spent on coming up with better ways of implementing the department's dealings with its clients, who are, let's face it, on the whole people who have come to Australia illegally or who have attempted to remain in Australia illegally.

It will deliver comprehensive, tailored operational training for departmental officers and will have an emphasis on quality assurance and decision making. Some 250 new departmental officers will be trained there every year and some 300 officers will be put through for refresher courses. The government accepts that the department has some issues to deal with, such as dealing with the health and well-being of clients. Also, information will flow through the department as to the background of illegal immigrants and people who are overstaying their visas. Mr Albanese interjecting",29

81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ruled the question in order and the minister is in order in his answer. I call the minister.,29
82,Mr JOHN COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Watson and those opposite in their questions are totally overlooking the fact that this department, since 2001, have done the job that the government asked them to do-dealing with illegal immigration in the order of what was looking like 12,000 or 13,000 boat people every year. Members opposite do not like this, because the people of Australia backed that policy to a 90 per cent degree. They may not like that option but it is a fact, and that is what the department did. When you have a job to do that is not always pleasant, it can be damned tough to do-and they did that job. We now have virtually no boat people coming to Australia at all because the department did that job under instructions. They did it well, and Australia agreed with that. What the members opposite do not like is the fact that Australia told them we were doing the right thing. Mr Gavan O'Connor interjecting",29

84,Ms PANOPOULOS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister advise the House how further workplace relations reforms will improve the viability of Australian farmers?",29
85,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question. The government's workplace relations reforms are vitally important to Australia's farming sector-employers and employees alike. At the outset, I remind and impress upon the House that WorkChoices will protect certain award conditions when the new workplace agreements are negotiated. The award conditions include: public holidays; rest breaks, including meal breaks; incentive based payments and bonuses; annual leave loadings; allowances; penalty rates; and shift and overtime loadings. The reforms will allow streamlined negotiations between employers and employees-and nowhere is this more needed than in regard to Australia's pastoral awards, which are mind-numbingly complex and a nightmare when trying to calculate entitlements and allowances. Let me give a couple of examples to prove the point. Mr Tanner interjecting",29
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne is warned.,30
87,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In regard to the New South Wales pastoral award, there are some remarkable disincentives for employers and employees to reach agreement for mutual benefit, as well as for employers to employ people, which should be the main object of our policy, at least on this side of the House. Let me turn to clause 21(b), under ‘Transport'. It states: ... in all cases where the shearing shed is tres or more walking distance from the employees' huts the employer shall provide transport from the shed to the huts and from the huts to the shed for the midday meal. The clause referring to ‘Transport whilst at shed' states: Where the employees sleep at the employer's premises and the shearing shed is 800 metres or more walking distance from the employees' sleeping quarters, the employer shall provide transport for the employees between the shed and the sleeping quarters before the start of the day's work, and at the end of the day's work. At 400 metres you provide a minibusMr Fitzgibbon interjecting",30
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member Hunter is warned.,30
89,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and at 800 metres you provide a minibus when a few minutes walking is involved-which is good, of course, for fitness. ‘Smoke-oh lunches' particularly grabs my eye. Clause 15(a) states: Where the shearing shed is within 229 metres'not 228 or 300 metreswalking distance from the kitchen, smoke-oh lunches are to be held in the shed except: (1) where an offsider is employed; or (2) in the case of a cook of a mess of ten men or less. In country areas people are individualistic and self-reliant and do not need union officials prescribing one-size-fits all, complex and often irrelevant conditions of this kind. My favourite is under ‘Special allowances', clause 37.1: Where a station hand is required by the employer to find the employee's own horse and/or saddle the employee shall be paid an allowance of $5.30 per week for the horseMr Brendan O'Connor interjecting",30
90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for 400 meGorton will remove himself from the chamber understanding order 94(a). The member for Gorton then left the chamber.,30
91,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me start again with ‘Special allowances', clause 37.1: Where a station hand is required by the employer to find the employee's own horse and/or saddle the employee shall be paid an allowance of $5.30 per week for the horse and an allowance of $4.23 per week for the saddle. For the horse, I can understand it-chaff and oats-but for the saddle? What is the equivalence between a horse and a saddle? That is a lot of beeswax for the saddle. It just goes on and on. This is what the Labor Party opfor poses: reform of this kind, whereby employers and employees can strike their own bargain. No wonder there has been a proliferation of shearing contract teams, harvesting contract teams and the like. The Labor Party want to return to the heavy hand of government and union regulation of this kind. This side of parliament does not. Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs",30
92,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Minister, I refer to the Comrie report, which was presented after an inquiry into the deportation of an Australian citizen. I quote from the Comrie report: … the culture of DIMIA … was so motivated by imperatives associated with the removal of unlawful non-citizens that officers failed to take into account the basic human rights obligations that characterise a democratic society. Minister, isn't it true that the culture of departments is bred from policy and that the policy ultimately belongs to the Howard government?",31
93,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In calling the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, that question is very close to asking for an opinion, but the minister may choose to answer it.",31
94,Mr JOHN COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As I have made very plain, the government and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs are putting in more resources than the opposition ever put into the department to make it the department it can be and which it has been. We are fully cognisant of the Comrie report and we are fully cognisant of the fact that Vivian Alvarez was mistakenly taken overseas. Ms Gillard interjecting",31

96,Mr JOHN COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Ms Alvarez has been given every opportunity to come back. The department is dealing with it and the government is making that right. Education and Training Miss JACKIE KELLY (2.55 pm)-My question is addressed to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. Given the award of the Western Sydney technical college to the consortium led by the Catholic Education Office over the Westech proposal, led by the Penrith City Council, and the continued interest of Westech proponents in technical training in Western Sydney by the schools based apprenticeship scheme or any other model, would the minister update the House on the outcome of negotiations with the states and territories to reform Australia's training system? Are there any alternative policies?",31
97,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lindsay, who is a passionate advocate for the people from her area. She is fighting very hard for more opportunities-particularly school based new apprenticeship opportunities-for the people of the western suburbs of Sydney, in particular in her electorate. She comes from a state that has the distinction of being the last state to sign up to the 2005-08 Commonwealth-State Agreement for Skilling Australia's Workforce, the national training agreement. New South Wales was shamed into signing that agreement just last week. This agreement provides real reform of Australia's training system. It means that it can all now begin and that more training opportunities at the school based apprenticeship level for the people of Lindsay-and indeed all the people of New South Wales-should follow. We have eight separate training regimes-eight separate systems of entry, exit, assessment and so forth-in this country. We have supposedly been working under the theory of a national training system, but it is a bit like many of the things you see. The Labor Party know what it is, then they ignore it. The Labor Party states have gone out of their way to prevent a real recognition of the trade skills that people have had. In many ways, when this country federated in 1901 it was about dealing with tariffs on goods between the states. Instead, we now have tariffs on services, called licences and so forth. We now want a training system, and we can put in place a training system, in which Australian business recognise the gap between what it wants and what it gets. That should be what drives the way in which the training sector runs. It is not about the way in which the institutes and the unions which staff the institutes want to train people; it in fact, about getting real-time business demands at the beginning. We will back this initiative with funding of some $5 billion which will flow through this agreement until 2008. It includes an additional $215 million, which represents a real annual increase of $4.1 million compared with 2004. The states will match some of this funding, but additional funding is very good news. The states and territories have accepted the agreement. State owned TAFEs deliver some 85 per cent of the publicly funded training in this country. We need to improve the flexibility and the responsiveness of that public system. One of our priorities is to ensure greater access to Australian workplace agreements, which gives greater autonomy to TAFE directors to make decisions about staff who are performing well and who must be kept. We have to make sure that we end the haemorrhaging of the public education sector by having good teachers go off and take up opportunities in the private sector. One of the ways to keep them is to ensure that they can trade their experience and their abilities for more pay, better opportunities and more take-home pay as a result of their ability. That is what we are about. The Labor Party, of course, have their rollback, their IR plan and their ambition to undo all of the good that we are currently doing. I have been asked about alternatives and there is one alternative the Labor Party might like to consider. My recent trip to the People's Republic of China and the second Sino-Australia VET forum produced an amazing observation from a senior Chinese official. I would like to put this on the Hansard record so the people of Australia understand that the Chinese understand what is going on far better than those opposite do. I quote: … push vocational colleges and schools to change their management systems and operais, tional mechanisms … as well as … make greater efforts to reform teachers' payment system, [including] relat[ing] staff income to the development of the school and link[ing] promotion with individual performance. [This includes] implement[ing]it is very important that those opposite listen to thisa teacher-oriented system where salary is determined by different positions and performance. Motivate staff through this payment system. So you cannot help but wonder why, if senior officials of the Communist Party of China have got it, those opposite are the last gasps in the arguments against performance based pay through AWAs. Why is it? They have to update their logic in order to ensure that Australia can keep its skills up to date.",31

103,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I accept your apology. Prime Minister, the National Farmers Federation President, Peter Corish, said recently that he had received a guarantee from the government of future pricing parity for both basic telephone and broadband services for country and city consumers and that the guarantee would be enshrined in legislation.

105,Mr HARTSUYKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister advise the House of recent developments in the negotiations on cuts to agricultural subsidies?",33
106,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cowper for his question. Australia exports 65 per cent of its farm produce and consequently we have a vital interest in breaking down distorted international trade caused by subsidies, restricted market access and the like. Farmers have been anxiously awaiting the successful conclusion of the Doha Round under the WTO in December in Hong Kong. There is a long way to go in reaching that goal, and so little time. However, some promising developments have emerged overnight from the WTO agricultural talks in Zurich, where various trade ministers have gathered, and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, is in attendance. The United States has tabled at that meeting an initiative to cut its most trade-distorting farm subsidies by 60 per cent and to reduce other farm subsidies by 50 per cent. The United States has put this proposal in the context of a highly ambitious vision of eliminating all agricultural barriers within 15 years. That is 15 years too long for Australian farmers, but it is the first time we have had a timetable enunciated in that way. Promisingly, the European Union has responded to the initiative by increasing the extent to which it is prepared to cut its distorting farm subsidies-from 65 per cent to 70 per cent. There is no doubt that the United States proposal is a significant development that could help bring about a breakthrough in the current impasse in agricultural negotiations. The Minister for Trade has urged all WTO members to use the United States initiative as a building block to achieve tighter constraints on farm subsidies. It now falls on the European Union to take the courageous but necessary step of agreeing to improve market access in a way that delivers real commercial opportunities. There is no doubt that while elimination of subsidies is crucial to Australian farmers-because they give our competitors an unfair advantage in third markets-the No. 1 issue is market access. We must be able to trade in the various markets around the world and especially in the European Union. This is an opportunity that needs to be seized by all participating countries. Avian Influenza",33
107,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the minister's answer in question time today outlining the depth of his concern about the potential impact of bird flu on Australia and the region. This is the same minister who also said: I haven't been advised that there's a real threat that itbird fluwill come to Australia. On the potential economic impact of bird flu in Australia, does the minister also recall saying that, apart from the import of chicken meat, bird flu ‘shouldn't have any effect'? Minister, do you still stand by these extraordinarily complacent statements made fully seven years after bird flu first broke out in Hong Kong?",33
108,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said in answer to an earlier question, we are not complacent about bird flu. I quoted the Commonwealth Medical Officer and, by the way, I think I am right in saying-the health minister will correct me if I am wrong-that the World Health Organisation also shares his view that there is a one in 10 chance that bird flu could mutate and therefore be transmitted between people. Obviously, if that were to happen, the consequences could be extremely serious. But I would have thought the government had been anything but complacent. Through the APEC processes we have been playing a leadership role. We did so back at the last APEC meeting in Chile, and we will be playing a very substantial leadership role at the meeting to take place at the end of this month in Brisbane of APEC senior officials from 21 countries. I think that, when we get to Pusan in South Korea for the APEC meetings next month, the government will find that Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

The public are interested in our policy positions not in our running a high school debating society. I would think that at the APEC meeting in Pusan next month the Prime Minister and other leaders will reach a solid agreement on regional action to deal with avian flu. I mentioned, in answer to an earlier question, that the government has already committed about $180 million to deal with avian flu, so to make a high school debating point suggesting that the government is doing nothing about it is to walk around being-and I use the word again because Mark Latham uses it so often in his book-an opportunist.",34

124,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Perth proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to accurately inform the Australian people about the adverse impact its changes to the industrial relations tem will have on employees and their families. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",36
125,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The MPI today is about the adverse impacts that the government's extreme industrial relations proposals will have on Australians, particularly working Australian families and middle Australia, and on their living standards and quality of life. These extreme proposals are unfair and they are divisive. They are certainly extreme, and they will have a twofold effect. Firstly, they will reduce the living standards of working Australians and, secondly, they cut away at the values, virtues and characteristics that Australians have held dear for a very long time. The combined effect of that will be to undermine the quality and the value of life of working Australians and Australian families generally. It is not just the Labor Party or the labour movement making these analyses. We now find senior members of our community, in particular, senior leaders in our churches, making these points on a regular and repetitive basis. The Prime Minister made his ministerial statement in this place on 26 May, and on the weekend, on 8 or 9 October, we saw the government's 68-page preliminary explanatory memorandum. The framework is essentially as we saw it in May: an attack upon living standards, an attack upon our values and virtues, an attack upon our quality of life and an attack upon the capacity of Australian families to make ends meet and to enjoy a decent quality of life. As I say, it is not just Labor saying this. We find Archbishop Pell, sysArchbishop Aspinall, Archbishop Jensen, the Australian Catholic Commission for Employment Relations and the National Council of Churches, again and again since May, expressing concerns about the attack upon living standards, the attack upon quality of life and the attack upon our values and virtues. On the other hand, the government try to pretend that none of these things are at The government simply say, ‘These proposals are good for you and good for the nation.' They are spending millions and millions of taxpayers' dollars on a Liberal Party political advertising campaign to try to persuade the Australian public of that. They will not tell the Australian public the truth. They will not tell the Australian public how this is an attack upon their living standards and an attack upon values, virtues and characteristics that we have held dear. The first thing the government will not tell you is that these proposals will make working Australians worse off, and there is a very good test to prove that is the case. Repeatedly in this place since May we have asked the Prime Minister to give a guarantee that no individual Australian employee will be worse off as a result of these changes, and consistently and persistently he refuses to do that. This was something of a surprise to us, because this was a guarantee he was happy to give in 1996 when he had Peter Reith and Alsatians and balaclavas. He gave what he then described as a rock solid, ironclad antee that, under his proposals in 1996, people could be better off but no-one would be worse off. He did it with Peter Reith and the Alsatians and balaclavas, and we were surprised that he did not do it with Minister drews. Kevin is not your Alsatians and balaclavas type-he is more your opera glasses and poodles type-but he does follow his instructions. The Prime Minister says, ‘My guarantee is my record.' And his record, he says, is 14 per cent growth in wages in real terms since he came to office and a 12 per cent increase in real terms in the minimum wage since he came to office. What a surprise that after 14 years of consecutive economic growth-we are now into the first quarter of the 15th year-set up by the structural reforms of the issue. last Labor governments, the Hawke and Keating governments, we might have an increase in real wages. Mr Andrews interjecting",36
126,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister interjects and says that under Labor it was two per cent. I distinctly recall that when the Prime Minister left office as Treasurer in 1983 he left us with a 10 per cent inflation rate. When he returned to office in 1996 the inflation rate was two per cent. Last time. I looked, an effective calculation of the real wage was to judge that against the inflation rate. We battled against a 10 per cent inflation rate that the government, under Malcolm Fraser and John Howard, left us. So he says his guarantee is his record. Let us have a look at his record on the minimum wage. The Prime Minister says that, under him, the minimum wage has increased by 12 per cent in real terms since his government came to office. The government first made a submission to the Industrial Relations Commission in respect of the minimum wage in 1997. So, if you take the period when the guar- government came to office, from March 1996 until now, it is the case that the minimum wage has increased by 12 per cent. If you take the period from the government's first submission in 1997, the minimum wage An- has increased in real terms by 9.7 per cent. All of this is not because of John Howard's best efforts but despite them. John Howard has consistently opposed the decisions made by the Industrial Relations Commission in respect of the minimum wage. If John Howard's submissions to the Industrial Relations Commission on the minimum wage since he came to office had been accepted, the minimum wage would be $50 a week or $2,600 a year lower. The consequence of that is that the minimum wage under John Howard, if his submissions had been agreed to, would have been reduced in real terms by 1.55 per cent-not a 12 per cent increase-since he came to office. That is at the start of the government's attack on living standards. John Howard wants to get through the back door what he has not been able to get through the front door, through the Industrial Relations Commission, since he came to office. That is why he wants to take an axe to the minimum wage, an axe to the Industrial Relations Commission and an axe to the living standards of the nearly two million employees who are entirely dependent upon the minimum wage. Why would he do such a thing? He would do such a thing because he has an economic view that by reducing the wage level at the lower end of the scale you somehow magically increase or improve employment. Anecdotally, that means this: you have a cleaner on $25,000-rule of thumb, the current minimum wage. John Howard's thesis is that, if you reduce that by $2,600-let us say to $23,000-somehow we are magically going to have two cleaners. Or there is his productivity and competitiveness argument that, if you reduce the cleaner's wage by $2,000, somehow the cleaner is going to become more productive. The essential public policy assertion that the Howard government makes-that by reducing the living standards of those people on the minimum wage we will somehow magically increase employment-is an economic misnomer. There is no credible economic theory to that effect. Indeed, more recently we have seen serious economic analysts and labour relations and labour market analysts underlining that point. The second area where there is an attack upon the living standards of working Australian families is in respect of conditions. At the moment we know that so far as conditions and entitlements are concerned we have the so-called 20 allowable matters and the no disadvantage test. It is the 20 allowable matters and the no disadvantage test which are the measures against which any individual agreement or collective agreement has to be judged. A judgment will be made as to whether, overall, an employee who goes onto an individual or a collective agreement is at a disadvantage when compared with the award. Currently we have 20 allowable matters. The government is proposing to knock off four allowable matters out of the 20. It is proposing to knock off long service leave, notice of termination, jury service and superannuation. The government make a lot of saying, ‘We are going to enshrine four allowable matters as a legislated minimum standard: annual leave, personal or carers leave, parental leave and ordinary hours of work.' That leaves 12 swinging. The 12 that the government leave swinging-at risk-are some of those things which are most important to the lifestyle, the just living standards and capacity to make ends meet of working Australian families. They include such things as public holidays, rest breaks, meal breaks, incentive based payments, annual leave loadings, allowances, penalty rates and loadings for shift and overtime. They go right to the hip-pocket nerve of Australian families. In the great sleight of hand, the government try to pretend that those things will be protected. If you look at page 8 of the 68-page explanatory memorandum, which should be entitled ‘No Choice' rather than WorkChoices, the government says this: ... individual Australian workplace Agreements (AWAs) will need to be lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate (OEA). It goes on to say: WorkChoices will protect certain award conditions when new workplace agreements are negotiated. … … … These award conditions are: Public holidays; Rest breaks (including meal breaks); Incentive-based payments and bonuses; Annual leave loadings; Allowances; Penalty rates; and Shift/overtime loadings. These award conditions can only be modified or removed by specific provisions in the new agreement. If these award conditions are not cifically agreed to in the new agreement, these award conditions continued to apply. It goes on to say that an AWA: … need simply set out how the new agreement will either change or remove these matters in agreement. What does that mean? That means that an individual contract-an AWA for someone like Billy, who the Prime Minister in question time today was happy to say would be forced onto an AWA with such inferior conditions-simply needs to refer to the removal of those provisions. I drew the House's attention to this yesterday with the Tancred Fresh AWA example. On page 4 of 12 of that AWA, under paragraph 14, ‘Wages', it states: Your rate of pay which is inclusive of leave ing, all allowances, penalties and public holiday pay is $17.20 per hour (subject to the table below). So, under the government's new changes, you will find a one-line entry which will say your rate of pay is inclusive of public holidays, rest breaks including meal breaks, incentive based payments and bonuses, annual leave loadings, allowances, penalty rates and shift or overtime loadings. And, once you say that your pay includes those things, the government's so-called default provision goes by the board: those things are lost. They were lost for the people who signed this agreement in Rockhampton, and they will be lost for Billy, the government's and the Prime Minister's most precious example. Overnight the minister has been making great play of the fact that the agreement that I referred to yesterday in the House was not actually registered by the Office of the Employment Advocate, because the Office of the Employment Advocate said the pay rate-which essentially gave 16c an hour for the loss of all those entitlements-did not meet the no disadvantage test and had to be improved to the princely sum of $1.31 per spe- hour for losing all those matters. What of course the minister did not say overnight is that, under the government, the no disadvantage test which includes those things goes. So, Minister, thanks very much for proving that the point that we were making yesterday. I am quite happy to say, as I said on radio this morning, that the agreement that I referred to was the agreement that was signed by an employee and not registered by the OEA but, under the system that you are proposing to adopt, the Tancred agreement, as referred to by me in the House yesterday, would have been registered-proving the very point that we are making. That deals with the living standards argument so far as the government is concerned. loadThe government also does not like to hear how these extreme proposals are an attack upon the values, virtues and characteristics of Australian society. For over 100 years, we have prided ourselves on essentially being a fair and egalitarian society, saying that people were entitled to a fair go. Wasn't it interesting in question time today? One question to the Treasurer about his attitude to the churches not being entitled to have a view, and he reeled off a whole range of things that might be relevant to this area. What was the one thing he did not mention? Fairness-no mention of fairness. When the Prime Minister was asked about his favourite example, Billy, what did the Prime Minister say? The Prime Minister said that he was happy for Billy to take his chances, that Billy could either sign or not have a job. The Prime Minister, both on The 7.30 Report last night and today, is essentially saying that he is happy for there to three-tiered employment system in Australia: those people who have jobs, those people who want to move between jobs and those people who do not have a job and are trying to get into one. At each level in the system of three tiers you will be treated more and more unfairly, depending upon which point in the cycle you are in. Billy is obviously going to be treated most unfairly; those people trying to transfer between jobs will be treated unfairly; and those people who have jobs will take their chances, as minimum standards, safety nets, salaries and conditions are attacked by this proposal. The other point which the government do not make but which we find the churches making is that the government do not believe that the trade union movement has a legitimate role to play in modern-day Australian society. Unfortunately for the government, the churches and Labor do. It was very interesting to see the government's private briefing for business and industry on Sunday morning. Nothing could have been better predicated to show how this is a massive shift in the bargaining power of the employer further against employee. Nothing could have given that signal better. The government are quite happy to sit there and say, ‘We don't see a role for the trade union movement in the economic and social affairs of Australian society.' Well, we do, and there is one classic illustration: who was it that came to the rescue of the asbestosis and mesothelioma victims of James Hardie? Not one person in that room on Sunday at the private briefing had lifted a finger for those victims; it was the organised trade union movement. These so-called reforms-these extreme changes by the government-are nothing more than an attack upon the living standards of working Australians. They are an attack upon the values and virtues, underlined by be a fairness, that we hold dear as an Australian society. They indicate a view that the organised trade union movement has no role to play in the modern social affairs of Australian society. All of those things we reject and will reject day in and day out until the next election, when the government will find its judgment coming from the people.",37
127,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (3.29 pm)-There can probably be no greater irony in parliament this week than for the member for Perth to propose a matter of public importance which refers to the accurate informing of the Australian people, given his actions and those of the Labor Party yesterday in this place. It is a very interesting choice of words for the member for Perth to be speaking about accurately informing people, when that is what he and others in the Labor Party quite clearly failed to do yesterday. If he was interested in accurately informing people, he might have taken at least 30 seconds out of his 15 minutes to apologise for the way in which he misinformed the Australian people yesterday, because he conceded on radio this morning that he had done so. Let me just take the House and those who are listening to this debate through what happened yesterday. The member for Perth in question time yesterday put a question to the Prime Minister which said, in part: I refer to an AWA currently in place at Tancred Fresh ... Later on we had another question coming from the member for Capricornia, who said: I ... refer to the fact that employees have lost leave loadings, all allowances, penalties and public holiday pay rate in exchange for a maximum of 16c an hour more than the relevant award rate. Saying that this was an AWA that was currently in place was quite clearly wrong. It was misleading because this AWA was not currently in place. The terms, conditions and amounts in the AWA which was approved and is therefore in place for these employees are different to those that the member for Perth pointed out in the proposal yesterday. This is compounded because we know that the Labor Party was then hawking around the press gallery a letter from the relevant union, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, which says, in the first line of the letter that has not been whited out: ‘Recently the union came across an Australian workplace agreement which is proposed to apply to employees.' This was the letter that was being hawked around the press gallery yesterday, in which quite clearly the union says, ‘This is an AWA which is proposed to apply.' It was not the AWA which applied. The AWA which was being referred to had not been approved and, indeed, even if the AWA which was referred to had been approved the reality is it amounted to an increase of some $86 a week for full-time employees over and above the award rate for employees in that particular business. What we have here is one more example of a pattern of conduct that we have seen from the union movement and the Labor Party in relation to the government's proposed changes. We have seen this with the television advertisements. One television advertisement shows a female worker purportedly being terminated because she is looking after her family due to family responsibilities. What that advertisement does not point out is that it is unlawful in Australia their today, within the federal industrial relations system, to terminate somebody's employment because of their family responsibilities. That ad was clearly misleading so far as the general public were concerned. And then, to compound this pattern of behaviour, we saw footage on Lateline a few weeks ago showing a campaign meeting involving the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, in which she said words to the following effect: ‘Wouldn't it be great for our campaign if we had the mother or father of a worker who had been injured or killed in Australia. That would be fantastic.' Those were her words. This is despicable conduct coming from the labour movement. They were saying, ‘It would be great if we could just find someone whose child had been unfortunately and tragically injured or, worse still, killed in some accident and we could use them for our campaign against the government.' There was also the incident in this place yesterday when the member for Perth came in, aided and abetted by the member for Capricornia, and referred to a document which they must have known was referring to an AWA that had not been approved and was not in operation, because the very letter that they referred to and that was hawked around the press gallery yesterday says that this is a proposed agreement, not one which had been put in operation. A simple question to the union concerned or a simple phone call to the employer concerned would have verified that. It is no excuse to say, ‘Oh, we made a mistake,' or, ‘We were sloppy.' This is a case in which the Australian people were being misled by the members opposite in relation to the matters that they raised in the House yesterday. Contrary to what the member for Perth says, the reality is that the current AWA would not have been approved by the Employment Advocate. The AWA which they are referring to actually cashes out all annual leave, but under the proposals that the government are putting to the parliament we are saying that, as part of the minimum wages and conditions, a person has to have as part of an agreement-whether it is a collective agreement or an individual agreement-four weeks annual leave. We go further and replicate what is in existence in Western Australia-apparently acceptable to a Labor government in Western Australia-and say that up to two weeks of that annual leave can be cashed out on a case-by-case basis at the request of the employee. This is something that has worked successfully for many people who want to make use of that in Western Australia. Even under the circumstances which the member for Perth puts to the parliament today he is wrong, because under the new system these provisions of the AWA would not be enforceable as they cash out all annual leave. It would have been invalid and it would not have been approved in the form that he talks about. He has even got that wrong. We are told about failure to accurately form the House, failure to accurately inform the people. What about the opposition's attitude to Australian workplace agreements? On the Sunday program the Leader of the Opposition was asked whether his policy was to abolish Australian workplace agreements. Let us remember that 770,000 Australian workplace agreements have been entered into since their inception. Somewhere in the order of 500,000 of these individual workplace agreements are being used by Australians successfully today, paying more in wages than do both collective agreements and award arrangements for workers in Australia. When asked about this on the Sunday program, the Leader of the Opposition said: We don't favour individual contracts, and we believe that if you properly protect collective agreements and awards against an ability of the AWA system to undermine them, AWAs will disappear and that'll be a good thing. Laurie Oakes asked: So you no longer subscribe to the policy Labor took to the last election, which was effectively to abolish AWAs? Mr Beazley answered: I subscribe to what I just said. There'll be a million of those things in place when we come into office, and you can't wander round cancelling contracts. But what you can do is put in place very tough provisions, which we will, on ensuring that AWAs cannot undermine collective agreements and awards, and are genuinely policed as to whether or not they're voluntarily entered into ... If you apply that to many individual contracts they'd disappear as well. That's a good thing, that is what we want ... So is the Leader of the Opposition, to quote the words of the matter before the House, ‘accurately informing the people of Australia'? What exactly is his policy about Australian workplace agreements? He says on one hand that he will not abolish them. In fact, he says that he cannot abolish them, because in- there would be too many losers. He is right about that. There are thousands of workers in his own electorate of Brand in Perth in Western Australia who have made use of Australian workplace agreements to get higher pay. He knows he cannot abolish them, but what he wants to do by stealth-this is hardly accurately informing the Australian people of matters-is to strangle these agreements and cut them off, yet pretend that he is not going to abolish them, because he knows that people would be worse off as a result. The reality is that, to use the political cliche, the Leader of the Opposition is attempting to walk both sides of the street. But there is one thing he is right about, and that is that people would be losers. If you abolish AWAs, you are effectively saying to those people who are earning more on AWAs-whether they are managerial or nonmanagerial workers in Australia-that you would cut their wages. That is what you would do if you abolished AWAs. The Leader of the Opposition is right about one other thing: there will be a million of them approved by the next election. So what is he saying to up to 10 per cent of the Australian work force who have made use of the flexibility which is available under these sorts of instruments? He is saying, ‘We are going to make you worse off.' There was a story published in the Australian newspaper yesterday about a grocery merchandiser, Sandra Xuereb, who has an Australian workplace agreement which allows her to choose her hours and cope with the demands of being a single mother of three. The article says: Ms Xuereb works 25 hours a week for food company Cerebos, stocking supermarket shelves with coffee, sauce, gravy, salt, herbs and spices. She normally works three days a week in western Sydney, but condenses this to two longer days in school holidays to spend time with her children, aged five, seven and nine. She has had the job since March last year and has rarely taken sick personal leave because the AWA allows her to make up the hours lost when the needs of her children force her to leave work early. Here is a single mum raising three kids in Western Sydney, making use of the choice and flexibility that Australian workplace agreements give her. A government member-What a great story!",40
128,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right; it is a great story. It is a great story about somebody who is getting on with their life and has a job. We heard this nonsense from the Leader of the Opposition today-he complained about an accurate depiction that we put in the 67-page document that is available for people who want to look at the detail of our policy. We said, honestly, that there can be circumstances in which a workersomeone, for example, who is unemployedcan be offered a job on minimum wages and conditions as set out and protected by the Australian fair pay and conditions standard. We had a mocking reference to this from the opposition as if being on welfare and not having a job is somehow better than having a job. The reality is that almost 40 per cent of people who get a job in Australia use that within a year as a pathway to another job. Many people, probably many members of this House, have started a job to get a foot in the door-or ‘to get a foot on the ladder', to use an expression that was fondly used by the previous Leader of the Opposition. Many people have started by getting a job and then used that as a stepping stone to another job. We say unashamedly to this parliament and to the Australian people that it is better to give somebody who is unemployed the opportunity to get a job because that is an opportunity to get into the labour market in Australia. It is an opportunity, in many cases, to get off welfare and do something of beneor fit for themselves and their family members in the future. That is something which we, as I said, are unashamedly about. We have heard from the Leader of the Opposition about another policy of roll-back. He has been trying to avoid the word ‘rollback' ever since the disaster of the roll-back of the GST-something that the opposition were going to do and then eventually caved in on, because they saw the good economic sense of the GST that everybody else recognised. For two terms of parliament, we had the Leader of the Opposition and others saying, ‘We're going to roll back the GST,' when every Labor Premier out there in Australia had been talking about the benefits to them of the GST and wondering how they could get some more revenue out of the GST. Now we have the Leader of the Opposition saying that he will roll back this policy. He was asked yesterday whether he would roll back a policy which gave the government power to do something in exceptional circumstances when essential services were threatened in Australia. He said that he would roll that back. Note this: essential vices legislation exists in every state tralia. I do not hear the Labor premiers around Australia saying, ‘We shouldn't have the power in exceptional circumstances to do something about essential services.' Is the Leader of the Opposition seriously saying to the Australian people that if a rogue union, say in the electricity industry, went out on strike in such a way that the power supplies to public hospitals and aged care and nursing homes were put at risk, and the health and well-being of people in those hospitals and aged care homes was therefore put at risk, then we should not have the power to order an end to the dispute and get the parties into the Industrial Relations Commission? That is the practical effect of what the Leader of the Opposition was saying yesterday. He would roll back essential services legislation. The reality is that when it comes to these matters the Leader of the Opposition is an opportunist. We have seen opportunism every time from this opposition in terms of the GST and other policies that we have put forward, and we have seen it once again today. These changes are good for the Australian people. They are about building on the 1.7 million extra jobs that we have created, building on the 14.9 per cent increase in real wages over the last 9½ years and building on our economic prosperity so that we can meet the challenges of the future and not go backwards, as we would under the policies of the opposition.",43
129,Ms GEORGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I really think it is time that the government and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations were honest and told the Australian community exactly what lies at the core of their proposed changes, as outlined in the WorkChoices package. What lies at the core of these changes is an attempt to resuscitate a myth that was discredited in this country more than a century ago-that is, the sermyth of freedom of contract. No amount of of Ausspin or gloss and no amount of taxpayer funding and glossy as that we will see for weeks on end on the TV will ultimately detract from this fundamental truth. If you do not believe what I am saying listen to the words of the Treasurer, who said recently: We should be trying to move to an industrial relations system where the predominant instrument is the individual contract ... That is what the agenda is really all about. It will not happen overnight, but that is certainly where this government is heading, make no mistake about that. But what does that mean? It means turning back the clock to the bad old days in this country. It means dismantling all the protections and institutions we have developed to ensure fairness and all the things we have developed for people at the lower end of the income scale and those who are vulnerable at work to get the protections that a civilised society thinks are fair. It means getting rid of the industrial umpire. It means abolishing the protection of awards. It means getting rid of industrial safety nets. Very importantly, it means that they want to erode the collective representation of workers through their unions. All these matters are at risk. At risk, and those who stand to lose the most in the short term, will be those who are most vulnerable at work. I think that is the greatest tragedy of these changes that the minister is bringing into the parliament: those who are most vulnerable will be at the mercy of the marketplace in a very short period of time. Those who are most vulnerable are the young, the part-time workers, the casual workers, the women workers, the 1.6 million workers who are reliant today on the award safety net and the minimum wage for their protection. These changes will essentially make it easier for the employer to require workers to sign individual work arrangements, commonly referred to as Australian workplace agreements. Beyond dispute is that these agreements will be signed at standards that are lower than the prevailing award safety nets that apply in Australia today. We all know and everybody out there in the Australian community knows, but not, it seems, the minister and the Howard government, that there is not equality of bargaining power between an individual worker and an employer. Everyone knows this basic truth. That is why we have developed a system in this country that is built on the notion of fairness-the Australian way which says that every worker is not to be treated as a commodity and that society has a responsibility to ensure fairness and justice for everybody. It is this fundamental truth that has underpinned the wonderful system we have built in this nation over the last 100 years, a system now very much at risk because of these extremely radical and regressive changes proposed by the Howard government. That is why in this country we have developed awards. That is why in this country we have industrial umpires to try to conciliate and arbitrate in those intractable disputes that sometimes occur. And that is why we have always said that those who are weakest in the workplace should be able to demand the protection of these institutions. That is the tralian way, and that is what is at risk in very radical and regressive package that is to come before this parliament. We have just heard the minister say that all these changes will be in the interests of Australia. I have to dispute that, and the workers out there will dispute that. It is the working people, including the 1.6 million workers who get a wage rise only once every year, who have made an enormous contribution to the prosperity of our nation. The wages share of gross domestic product is 1.5 points lower than when John Howard came to power. This translates to a shift in income of $12 billion from labour to capital on the coalition's watch. It is no wonder that profits are booming. It is no wonder that the minister and the Prime Minister come into this House and praise the virtues of Australia's economic growth. Minister, you have to remember that it is the working people out there who have made the enormous sacrifice to ensure that prosperity, and it is not beyond a reasonable approach to ensure that they can continue to benefit from the prosperity they have so importantly contributed to. Minister, I listened to you very carefully today, and you made no case on economic grounds for these radical changes. The only case that I have ever heard argued is that this package will lead to better productivity outcomes. Don't you believe it, because you cannot find a reputable conservative economist who will back up that assertion. Let me give you one small example. Look at what happened in New Zealand under the Employment Contracts Act. From 1990 to 1998, Australia's productivity under this fair system that we have had for 100 years grew by almost 22 per cent. New Zealand, which went down the route that the minister and the government are proposing, had a productivAus- ity outcome of just 5.2 per cent over that this same period. So do not pretend that individual contracts lead to better productive outcomes, because they do not. What worries me is that the Prime Minister will not give a guarantee that no worker will be worse off. He did that in 1996, when he gave a rock solid, ironclad guarantee. Why won'the do it now? It is simply that he cannot because the system is all about ensuring that the labour market is deregulated. That will inevitably mean that real wages will fall and that existing entitlements that workers have struggled for and had implemented in their awards over the last 100 years will quickly be eroded. Minister, the great tragedy of this is that those who are most at risk are young people, people who will be changing jobs, those who are vulnerable at work, the part-time workers, the casuals, the women and the single mother with three children whom you referred to. Make no mistake about it, people will be worse off. What we will have is a new no disadvantage test of a handful of conditions. Let me tell you what the conditions are: a basic hourly rate of pay of $12.75 an hour coupled with a 38-hour week. But listen-and I am quoting from your document, Minister: it will be possible for ordinary hours to be averaged over a period of up to 12 months. So imagine the situation the single mum with her three children that you just referred your contribution, Minister, will be in. One week she will be working 15 hours a week and maybe the next week she will be working 50 hours a week. So much for work and family balance. It is certainly a barbecue stopper, in your terms, and I am sure there will be far fewer barbecues that the average family will be able to attend with this imposition and with the impact on their quality of life that the hours they will be expected to work will have. So you will have a basic hourly rate of pay, you will have four weeks annual leave-of which two can be cashed out-10 days personal carers leave and unpaid parental leave. Anything else is up for grabs once you are moved onto an individual contract. So the no disadvantage test will see real wages fall. The entitlements that are currently in awards, like public holidays, meal and tea breaks, annual leave loading, penalty rates, shift loadings and overtime rates, can go in the stroke of a pen. The example of Billy in the government's own package shows this all too clearly. The Prime Minister's words today I thought were an appalling attempt to rationalise a totally unacceptable situation where young kids, who are going to work for the first time, will never see the benefits that their parents fought for and had accepted and integrated into the fundamental provisions that apply to all working people today. You will mask all this rhetoric in the notion of choice. I do not know what parallel universe you find yourself in, Minister, but I know that out there in the real world, for many workers, there will be no choice. The choice will be the contract on offer with a lot of the basic entitlements eroded or no job at all. And, if you do not believe me, ask the young people at Krispy Kreme such as Thea Fitch, who was told she would get no work unless she signed an agreement allowing her to in employer to roster her for 10 consecutive days without overtime and to work shifts longer than 12 hours. (Time expired)",44
130,Mr BARRESI,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The ALP can do nothing else but to oppose the workplace relations reforms this government has introduced. There is nothing more they could do. They have been told that they must oppose them. They know where their support comes from, they know where their financial support lies, so they have to oppose us. But these reforms are part of a third wave of reforms that commenced back in 1993. In 1993, when the first wave went through and Paul Keating said that we must move to a situation where awards were no longer an add-on to agreements, we were there to support the then government in making the changes in that first wave of reforms. The second wave of reforms took place in 1996. The ALP and the unions opposed us at that time. In fact, we all recall Bill Kelty's statement at the time: ‘We will give you the full symphony. We will draw a line in the sand and come at you with a full symphony.' What happened following those reforms in 1996? What we saw was jobs growth. In that time we have seen real jobs growth of around 1.2 million full-time jobs and we have seen real wages increase by 14 per cent. Yet from 1986 to 1993, when the so-called masters of the union movement were in power here, we saw minimum wages fall in this country by five per cent in real terms. Minimum wages fell. Our 1996 reforms were opposed by members on the other side. What has happened to the doom and gloom which they espoused at the time and which was echoed by some members of the community that we are hearing from today, such as those within the church fraternity? At the time they also said the sky would fall in and the Australian workers would suffer following the 1996 reforms. None of that took place, and it will not happen this time around either. These reforms are needed in Australia. We are experiencing dramatic changes in the demographics of this country. We are experiencing a need to compete against the world markets-more so than we did back in 1986 and 1993 or even in 1996. We have a global marketplace where the Australian worker and Australian industry must be able to compete on a level basis with those overseas. These reforms are part of the process of making sure that we have a productivity base from which we can launch our own competitive position on the world market. Members of the ALP, and members of the media as well, keep raising the issue of the Prime Minister needing to make some sort of written commitment that no worker will be disadvantaged. The Prime Minister, of course, rightfully turns the argument to his record. There is no greater example of what a government is on about than its past performance. I want the Australian public to contemplate this: why would the Prime Minister of this country-and a government supporting the Prime Minister-who has spent the past 9½ years introducing policies that have seen the prosperity of this nation increase and the past 9½ years seeing jobs grow and wages grow, jeopardise all that? It does not make sense for us as a government to turn on our head everything that we have tried to do in the last 9½ years. It is illogical for that to take place, and that is not the intent of our workplace relations reforms. The ALP know that and the Australian public will also come to realise this very fact rather than their being scared off by the union campaign which is taking place at the moment in the media. The member for Perth came out here today, and yesterday, saying that the Prime Minister should be criticised on his record and that if, in the national wage case, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission had agreed with the government's submissions then Australian workers would be $50 worse off. The fact is, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins-and you know this because you have been involved in the adversarial system just like I have, and a lot of members of the other side also know this-that the current Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the national wage case decisions are based on the concept of ambit claims. This is the case: ‘Let's have a confrontation on wages.' The only way the Australian Industrial Relations Commission can hear a national wage case is if there is a dispute in place. And that dispute must be in terms of claims and counterclaims. That is a system which does not bode well for an Australia of the 21st century. That is one of the reasons this adversarial system that we have in place today will be scrapped as part of these workplace relations reforms. We will have a Fair Pay Commission which will be made up of members with expertise on economic management who will make their decision not on ambit claims but by taking into account the capacity for the unemployed and low paid to obtain and remain in employment. They are the vulnerable people that the members on the other side are referring to in this debate. The Fair Pay Commission will look at employment and competitiveness across the economy rather than in one particular industry sector. It will take into account some of the regional and competitive natures within our economy. It will provide a safety net for It will provide minimum wages for junior employees and employees to whom training arrangements apply. So there will be a consideration of the effect of their decision on future employment growth that will take place in Australia. So we are getting rid of the adversarial system. It is a system that the people on the other side want to maintain knowing full well that it has not served, that its time come and gone. It was a system created over 105 years ago when we were six colonies and were very much bound by state jurisdictions and certainly not looking at the competitive marketplace which the world economy offers to us today. The ALP and union campaign really is about spooking Australian workers. There is not only the campaign on TV but also what we have seen in this chamber. As I mentioned earlier on, Bill Kelty back in 1996 went on about the line in the sand, and the parliamentary voice pieces in this place were also making the same comment. We now have Greg Combet and Sharan Burrow with the same sort of campaign. We see TV advertisements, which have been exposed as fraudulent by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, advanced by the union movement as being the new world order when in fact they are not. The minister, of course, made reference to that. We have had a senior union official saying that our scrapping of the unfair dismissal laws will have employers out there dismissing employees if they have had a bad hair day. That is an absolute disgrace. It is a disgrace to the small business people out there. It is also an indictment of the ALP because they have never been in small business. They do not understand that an employer does not make decisions based on a bad hair day-'I got out of the wrong side of the bed; I'm going to the low paid. get rid of you today.' A recruitment decision-and I can speak with some authority on this having worked in the personnel/human resources field on the side where we recruit, not on the side where we create conflict, strikes and ambit claims-can cost thousands of dollars in downtime in the workplace, in advertising and in the time that it takes to recruit through screening processes in some cases or some has form of testing procedure. Employers out there do not make these decisions willy-nilly. The people out there are being sold a pup by the ALP and the union movement with these scare tactics. Yesterday we had the Tancred Fresh AWA example thrown at us by the member for Capricornia and also by the member for Perth. I am pleased to see the member for Perth has come out and basically say that it was not a valid agreement. I say to the people of Rockhampton that, if the member for Capricornia is willing to come into this chamber and deliberately put up an AWA that is not correct, what else should they mistrust her for?

Public Works Committee Report",49
136,Mrs MOYLAN,TRADE,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 17th report for 2005 of the committee relating to the proposed refurbishment of the Royal Australian Mint, Canberra. Ordered that the report be made a parliaonly available mentary paper.",51
137,Mrs MOYLAN,TRADE,"by leave-The Royal Australian Mint was built in 1965 and is responsible, and purpose built, for meeting the coin circulation and numismatic needs of Australia. The Mint buildings have not had any major upgrade works undertaken since they were built, and reports have indicated that non-structural elements of the buildings have passed their useful economic life. The proposed work is intended to refurbish the Royal Australian Mint, extending the life of the buildings by at least another years. Major refurbishment also enables the Mint to consolidate operations to one building providing two tenancies: the Process Building leased to the Mint; and the Administration Building, which will be available for lease by other government agencies. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $41.2 million. The major refurbishment of the Process and Administration buildings seeks to address occupational health and safety and Building Code of Australia non-compliance issues through: - new building and mechanical, electrical and fire services; - reconfiguration and re-carpeting of office areas; - refurbishment of the existing stone flooring to the lobby; - new public forecourt and entry courtyard; - new basement tunnel link to vault; - new goods delivery security gates; - new public and staff amenities; and - new public and staff parking arrangements. The committee conducted a site inspection of the Royal Australian Mint on Friday, 19 August 2005 prior to the confidential briefing and public hearing. Whilst inspecting the site, the committee experienced the Mint under normal operating conditions and saw the shortcomings of the current facilities at first hand. As could be expected with works to the Royal Australian Mint, the committee expressed concern at any heritage issues that may arise by major refurbishment of such buildings. The department assured the committee that the heritage value of the buildings was a major consideration in planning the 25 refurbishment and would not be compromised as a result of the work. The National Capital Authority supported the statements made by the department and was happy with the proposed refurbishment. The committee questioned the department on existing hazardous materials within the buildings and what would be done to address this issue, noting that there had been previous projects undertaken to remove hazardous materials. The department explained that hazardous materials in the buildings were mainly PCBs-polychlorinated biphenylsand asbestos, which would be removed in accordance with national code requirements. The department added that any such materials not removed as part of this refurbishment were in a contained state and therefore present no hazard. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction works are planned to commence in October 2006 with completion by June 2008 for the Mint occupation of the Process Building and April 2009 for tenant occupation of the Administration Building. However, the department was unable to specify the method of project delivery at the time of the hearing. Whilst the committee remains confident that the department could deliver the project in the stated time frame, it recommended that the department advise the committee of the project delivery strategy to be employed once it has been determined. In project costings provided by the department, the committee noted a discrepancy in the stated total project cost. At the public hearing the department explained that the initial project cost estimate, as included in their main submission, was calculated very early in the process, based on a concept design. By the time of the committee's hearing, the department were able to present a more robust project cost estimate, accounting for the difference between the original predicted out-turn cost and the budget appropriation. The revised amount provides for a greater contingency allowance. The committee was pleased that savings had already been made on the project and commends the department in this regard. Having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the committee recommends that proposed refurbishment of the Royal Australian Mint proceed at the estimated cost of $41.2 million. I thank those who assisted with the public hearing, including yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, and my other committee colleagues. As always, I thank Hansard and the committee secretariat, who make our work much more manageable. I commend the report to the House.",51
138,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,TRADE,"by leave-I concur with the comments made by the member for Pearce, the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, on the proposed refurbishment of the Royal Australian Mint. It is an important project. I was not able to attend the ing but, as was indicated by the member for Pearce, the inquiry was undertaken by other committee members. In listening to the comments of the committee chair, I feel confident that this project will be properly undertaken. It is customary for me, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as deputy chair of the committee to rise and comment upon these very important matters. An extraordinary amount of money is expended by the Commonwealth, and the Public Works Committee is vigorous in examining the way money is expended. I concur with the outline of the comments made by the member for Pearce.",53

140,Ms VAMVAKINOU,TRADE,"by leave-As a member of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present a paper containing comments by former Senator Harradine, a former member of the committee, relating to the committee's inquiry into Australia's human rights dialogue process. Prior to his retirement and while on sick leave, these comments were sent to the subcommittee; however, the subcommittee thought they were for consideration rather than inclusion. In fairness, because of his absence due to illness just prior to his retirement, we accede to his wishes and table his comments.

141,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,The Speaker has received advice from the Chief Opposition Whip that he has nominated Mrs Irwin to be a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration in place of Mr TS Burke.,54
142,Mr BILSON,COMMITTEES,"Dunkley-Parliamentary Secretary (Foreign Affairs) and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs) (4.16 pm)-by leave-I move: That Mr T. S. Burke be discharged from the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and that, in his place, Mrs Irwin be appointed a member of the committee. Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT (WORKPLACE RELATIONS REQUIREMENTS) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 October, on motion by Dr Nelson: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (4.17 pm)-Let me turn to some of the language accompanying the legislation put forward by the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the implications of what is contained in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005. The government's legislation states that all enterprise agreements in the higher education sector should be simple and flexible and should avoid excessive detail. This is code for the removal of provisions in enterprise agreements that protect staff conditions. Combining this with an award with just a few allowable matters in itself will cause staff conditions to be reduced. The legislation says that there should be no limit on management's capacity to make decisions and implement change about courses and staffing. This again is code for the removal of the right of staff to be consulted or involved in any change process. The opposition is not saying that change should not continually occur but that it should occur in consultation with staff. The bill will mean forced redundancies, and terminations will occur with management running roughshod over their staff. The resulting poor morale will impact heavily on the ability of universities to keep Australia at the forefront of research and tertiary teaching. The government is fast becoming known as a retrospective government. We know that it is a reactive government, but in this legislation it is becoming a retrospective government. When I was a young bloke growing up, I was taught that in this democracy, with our great traditions, retrospective legislation bad legislation and that it was to be used only in the most exceptional of circumstances-circumstances that everyone could agree with. But here we go again in this legislation. Legislation passed in 2003 has already allocated funds for 2005-07. The parliament is now going to change that-not for the period post 2007 but for the funds already committed. This legislation will backdate certain aspects of it to April 2005. If a university does not agree with the minister's wishes, it will lose funds that the government has already committed to it-funds that it had clearly planned on receiving and funds that it had already included in its forward budgets. Many of our universities are going to have to revisit the enterprise agreements that they have already signed with their employees and put in place within their universities. It makes you wonder whether this government has any principles at all. Agreements reached in good faith are simply not worth the paper they are written on. Here we have the Prime Minister trying to encourage Australians to trust him with his industrial relations changes. We all know that the Prime Minister has deceived the Australian people on Telstra, the Medicare safety net, the war on Iraq and the GST. There is a lexicon of deceit as far as the Prime Minister is concerned, and now he wants the Australian work force to believe him on industrial relations. I do not think they will. Under this legislation, staff will be left wondering about the past processes and will be very cynical about their future. Why should they commit themselves to their organisations and work hard to assist this nation in becoming a knowledge nation and a competitive nation if they are treated in this way by the government? Mr Billson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise was on a point of order. I ask you to invite the colleague to withdraw the direct assertion against the Prime Minister and his behaviour in relation to a number of policy issues. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR- Mr Deputy Speaker, I won't withdraw the truth at all!",54
143,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Corio will resume his seat. He was not invited to take the call. I call the parliamentary secretary. Mr Billson- Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to finish my sentence and to draw his attention to what is appropriate parliamentary behaviour in relation to that kind of allegation.",55
144,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Corio, by his intervention, considerably upped the ante and changed the environment in which we were debating this matter. I would now ask him to withdraw. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-I am a bit puzzled, Mr Deputy Speaker, as to what I am to withdraw. Is it the fact that the Prime Minister deceived the Australian people on the GST, because he did say that he would never ever introduce it?",55
145,Mr HUNT,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,He went to an election on it!,55
146,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The member for Flinders-the parliamentary secretaryis not assisting the chair, either. The member for Corio will withdraw. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-As it is the order of the House, I withdraw. (Time expired)",55
147,Mr WINDSOR,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I would like to speak briefly to the legislation, but before doing so I wish to inform the House-and I am sure that the parliamentary secretary will not object-that there is a group in the parliament today that has been very involved with education for many years. In my view, it is one of the very credible lobby groups that attend the parliament from time to time to represent their constituent bodies. One of the issues that it is raising in the House will concern the Minister for Education, Science and Training as we consider the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005. The group is the Isolated Children's Parents Association. I do not want to take up too much time in the debate, but I would like to put on the record one of the issues that the group have raised in relation to the equity of services available to country people. I am pleased that the shadow minister for education is in the chamber, because I am sure the group will have been lobbying her as well. The issue relates to tertiary access. The Isolated Children's Parents Association request that, as a matter of national urgency, the federal government of Australia introduce a tertiary access allowance, based on the living away from home allowance for apprentices. It would provide financial assistance to all rural and remote students who live away from home to access a tertiary education. There is a precedent for thisMr Billson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We are trying to be accommodating. If the member could make his speech vaguely relevant to the bill before the House and maybe achieve his goals, that would be helpful.",56
148,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I am sure that the member for New England is quite aware of the requirement to be relevant to the bill before the chamber. Ms Macklin-He's talking about access to higher education, and they're going to need highly qualified staff.",56
149,Mr WINDSOR,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"My comments are very pertinent, but I take on board the shadow minister's comments. There is a precedent in relation to this issue. There has been an allowance extended to students undertaking further study, because of geographical isolation, but not in relation to tertiary education. I raise the matter today because the group is in the gallery. It is an important lobby group. It is a very credible group. I would urge the minister-and the parliamentary secretary, who is very interested in this matter-to look seriously at this issue. The bill before the House relates to the funding of our universities and the workplace arrangements that are to be put in place. I have some concerns about this legislation-not necessarily about the concept of workplace arrangements being put in place but about the way this is being done under the legislation. There is no doubt, as previous speakers have said, that the universities are expecting this money and, in fact, they have budgeted for it. I think that to put a gun to their heads by asking them to jump hurdles and put in place various workplace arrangements and make other commitments before they receive federal funding creates a fairly nasty precedent. It is one that indicates that the government is being a little selective in the tactic that it is adopting with respect to funding and workplace relations in universities. I remember the COAG arrangements in 1995 when the water arrangements were put in place. The government said at that time that it would withhold money if the states did not comply with the various arrangements that were to be put in place under competition policy. For 10 years the Commonwealth government allowed the states to virtually accept the money and then do nothing about the provisos. That is slightly different to what is happening under this piece of legislation. At that point, there was the initiation a new competition policy and a gun was held at the states' heads. Here we have a continuation of grant funding-and I am pleased to see the Minister for Education, Science and Training has entered the chamber-and a gun being held at the head of the universities. They are being told that they will not receive their grant funding unless they comply with certain industrial relations arrangements. As I said-and for the benefit of the minister-I am not opposed to workplace arrangements, but I think that the process that has been put in place needs to be reviewed. It is not a process that I agree with. While I am on my feet, I also wish to mention briefly the ongoing voluntary student union debate that is currently before the parliament. I say to the minister that many universities-and I am sure that he is getting the same message-have plans that they wish to put in place for the ensuing year. They are wondering what the government is doing in relation to this matter. I would hope that the government would agree to an amendment that I have put before the parliament, and I know the opposition has an amendment as well. I think there may be various amendments in the Senate that look at the proviso that the non-political activities of the student union be maintained, particularly in regional universities. The other issue I raise briefly-and I can assure you, Minister, that I do not intend to take my full time-concerns the research component in regional universities. There is a very real concern that more commercial arrangements on research that are being talked about in various corridors will have, or could have, a very negative impact, particularly on the smaller universities and, almost by definition, that means the regional universities. To turn those universities-I am not suggesting the minister will do this; I would suggest that he does not do it, with all of due respect-into teacher-only universities really takes them out of the gamut, in a sense, of being universities. If I may be a little parochial, the University of New England prides itself on the research component it has styled for itself, particularly in agriculture, and on its relationship with the CSIRO and the various CRCs. I urge the government-and the minister, in particular-to bear in mind that the University of New England does not have the economies of size that some of the big eight universities have. If you apply the one-sizefits-all market orientation in the commercialisation of research, the smaller universities and those who are less able to afford to pay commercial rates for research may well miss out. In the longer term, a whole range of research bodies-particularly in agriculture, in our case-could miss out and regrettably Australia could miss out as well. I will end my contribution there. I thank the parliamentary secretary for his forbearance.",56
150,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I indicate to the member for New England that a very generous interpretation of ‘related purposes' has been used. He should not assume that that will always happen, but I allowed it on this occasion because the chamber seemed to be accommodating of that course of action. I call the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Mr Billson-A great man and a great minister!",57
151,Dr NELSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (4.31 pm)-in reply-I appreciate the interjection from the parliamentary secretary.",57
152,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"It is out of order, but we have to consider its purpose!",58
153,Dr NELSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank those who have spoken in this debate. Whilst I do not necessarily agree with all the comments that have been made, I appreciate the input of those who were committed enough to contribute. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 is necessary for Australia to remain internationally competitive in the provision of higher education. Increasingly, both Australian and overseas students will make their choices on the basis not only of cost but also the reputation for standards and the local and overseas career options. In order to compete with international universities, Australian universities need to be able to attract and keep the very best staff and reward them in accordance with their skills. The government has committed more than $11 billion in additional support for higher education through Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future. However, this funding must be accompanied by changes in the way that universities are managed and administered. The higher education workplace relations requirements will achieve meaningful, lasting and much-needed reform in the higher education sector by making fundamental changes to the workplace policies and practices of Australia's universities. These requirements will assist universities to become more productive, efficient, flexible and internationally competitive. They will facilitate and support workplace arrangements in universities which support greater flexibility individual choice. The research we have done confirms that whilst, by international standards, Australian academics are generally relatively highly paid-in fact, a recent Association of Commonwealth Universities study found them to be the second highest paid of six comparable countries-the spectrum of remuneration is relatively narrow. Professor Gerard Sutton, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong and the recently elected President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, recently said, ‘Every university vice-chancellor has a professor that is worth half what he is being paid and another that is worth twice what he is being paid.' These changes will help universities to attract and retain talented academics to undertake great teaching and research. The requirements will enhance workplace flexibility, which will assist institutions to respond to changing requirements and challenges and to develop a diverse and adaptable work force. The reforms will assist institutions to encourage individual and organisational performance, including rewarding highperforming individuals, efficiently managing underperformance and strengthening management and leadership capability. The workplace relations requirements will enable staff and higher education providers to negotiate mutually beneficial work arrangements by ensuring that Australian workplace agreements are offered to all university staff. It is essential that members understand that the government's intention is that every employee of a university-with the exemptions which are included in the act-should be offered the opportunity to have an individual workplace agreement, a common law agreement or some other form of individual working arrangement, if that is what they wish. Arguably, these are amongst the most intelligent and educated people in Australia, and and one would think that they would be perfectly capable of negotiating their own working arrangements if they so choose. If not one single Australian university employee wants to take up that opportunity, that is fine as far as the government is concerned, but we want them to have the choice. Also, we do not think that any third party should be involved in those negotiations unless at the invitation of the employee, or employees, involved. Workplace agreements allow greater flexibility than certified agreements to provide bonuses and other rewards for high performance. They assist employers to offer incentives to attract and retain the best employees. Data collected by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has found that people on Australian workplace agreements earn 13 per cent more than employees on collective agreements and 100 per cent more than employees on awards. The requirements will encourage universities to develop a culture of direct communication with their staff and will promote freedom of choice and representation. It is the right of employees to choose to belong, or not to belong, to a union without discrimination for their choice. It is a very important principle of this government that every Australian should be free to join and be represented by a union if that is what they wish. Equally, they should be free not to join a union and to represent their own interests, or have someone else do it for them if that is their choice. In response to issues raised with us by the sector, I have made two amendments to the requirements. Firstly, I have extended the time available for higher education providers to comply with the requirements this year from 30 September to 30 November. Secondly, I have agreed to relax the requirement of offering Australian workplace agreements to all casual staff but only for casuals who are engaged for a period of less than one month. This exemption will apply only until 30 June 2006. The reforms mean that universities will need to comply with the new arrangements in their work force agreements, policies and practices as well as in the national governance protocols in order to be eligible for the increase in assistance funding, which is five per cent in 2006 and 7½ per cent in later years, under section 33.15 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme. Activity is well under way. Those universities which are required to comply with the requirements by 30 November 2005 are in the process of negotiating enterprise bargaining agreements. I have recently written to universities regarding this task, reminding them that approaches which are focused on minimising, diluting or circumventing genuine reform are unlikely to result in higher education workplace reform compliant workplace arrangements. Contrary to the suggestions of the opposition and the National Tertiary Education Union, the workplace relations reforms will have no impact on acaall demic freedom-in fact, if anything it could be argued that they will enhance it-and universities will still be able to make their own decisions about the appointment of staff and other academic activities, as they most certainly should. I urge members to support the bill. Question put: That this bill be now read a second time. The House divided. [4.43 pm] (The Deputy Speaker-Hon.

155,Mr HUNT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (4.56 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 will assist in strengthening the contribution of sound intelligence to government decision making and operations. Effective intelligence arrangements, underpinned by sound accountability mechanisms, are fundamental to a range of key national priorities including countering terrorism, reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction and proliferation, supporting Defence Force operations, and protecting Australian sovereignty. This bill will implement the legislative  AO in his report last year on the inquiry into Australian intelligence agencies. It will also put in place a range of amendments to intelligence related legislation which were identified as a result of the government's review of the operation of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 (ISA) since that legislation came into force in October 2001. This review was recommended by the former Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and was coordinated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The ISA established legislative bases for the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) and the activities of the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD). The government announced in July last year that it had accepted all of the recommendations of the Flood inquiry, with the exception of the proposal to change the name of the Office of National Assessments (ONA). This bill will implement all of the legislative recommendations from that inquiry by: 1. extending the mandate of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD (PJCAAD) to all of Australia's intelligence agencies-that is, it will cover ONA, DIO and DIGO on the same basis as it presently covers ASIO, ASIS and DSD; 2. formalising the functions and ministerial accountabilities of DIGO and amending the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 to include scrutiny of DIGO on a basis comparable with that which applies to DSD and ASIS; 3. extending the mandate of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security to allow the inspector-general to initiate inquiries at his or her own discretion into matters relating to ONA and DIO without ministerial referral, consistent with the inspector-general's jurisdiction in respect of ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The inspectorgeneral should also conduct a periodic review of ONA's statutory independence; 4. amending the Office of National Assessments Act 1977 to remove the references to two assessment boards-the National Assessments Board and the Economic Assessments Board-to reflect the reality that there is only one National Assessments Board which covers strategic, political and economic issues, but with provision for different composition according to subject matter, and to strengthen ONA's community coordination role in section 5(1)(d). A major outcome of this bill will be the provision of a legislative basis for the activities of the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation (DIGO). DIGO is a defence agency established in November 2000. While it is a relatively new organisation, Australia's involvement in imagery intelligence and topography is not new. These activities have been an integral part of Australia's defence for many years. DIGO was created within Defence to better realise increasing synergies in the exploitation of imagery and other data to produce intelligence and geospatial information. Like ASIS and DSD, DIGO has a foreign intelligence focus; however, its role is not limited to that. The bill sets out the five functional categories of DIGO's work, as follows. Under its first function, DIGO obtains imagery and geospatial data to produce intelligence relating to people or organisations outside Australia. Under its second function, DIGO obtains imagery and geospatial data to produce intelligence to support ADF exercises, training and operations, wherever they may occur. This function includes providing data and material in support of ADF decision making for targeting. Under its third function, DIGO obtains imagery and geospatial data to produce intelligence to support Commonwealth and state authorities in their national security role. Under its fourth function, DIGO communicates the material produced as a result of the exercise of the functions described above, in accordance with the requirements of the government. Under its fifth function, DIGO provides non-intelligence products and assistance to Commonwealth and state government agencies, as well as to approved non-government bodies and foreign governments. Nonintelligence products include routine topographic data and products. Assistance in search and rescue and response to natural disasters is specifically included tion to acknowledge the important nonintelligence work done by DIGO in this area. The review of the ISA's operation was prompted by advice from the former Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security that this act's application had shown that some refinement was needed. In addition, increased public interest in activities of intelligence agencies and the ability of some agencies to impede the privacy of Australians warranted an examination and finetuning of accountability mechanisms at a level of detail that was not possible during the time available to the Flood inquiry. Mr Flood was aware of plans for this subsequent review. In August 2004, the honourable member for Fadden, Mr David Jull, on behalf of the PJCAAD, which he chairs, proposed to the government that it consider a number of changes to that committee. These proposals included an increase in the size of the committee and other adjustments to help the PJCAAD respond to its increasing workload. The government agreed that these proposals would be considered in the context of the review of the ISA. The government has agreed in response to the review that the committee's membership will be increased from seven to nine. A position of deputy chair will also be established and the committee empowered to establish subcommittees when required. In keeping with current arrangements, the committee will not have a mandate to review the content or conclusions of assessments or reports made by DIO or ONA, or review the sources of information on which such assessments or reports are based. The committee will not have a mandate to review the coordination and evaluation acin this functivities undertaken by ONA. Following the review of the bill by the PJCAAD in September 2005, the government also agreed with the committee's recommendation that the bill be amended so that it does not stipulate that the deputy chair must be a member of government. The government is conscious that the the committee has operated well under a spirit of bipartisanship and that the introduction of a deputy chair position should both recognise and endeavour to preserve this cooperative goodwill. However, the amendment proposed by the government will also ensure that, if the chair of the committee is not present at a meeting of the committee where a question is to be decided by voting or is absent for a period of more than one month, then the members present are to appoint a government member to preside at a meeting. That member so appointed may exercise, in relation to the meeting, any powers of the chair as acting chair. Other significant amendments incorporated in the bill include clarification of the roles and functions, and ministerial authorisation regimes for intelligence collection by ASIS and DSD. One major effect of these changes is to extend the protections that the legislation currently affords to Australians overseas to Australians in Australia. Since the act was passed, the extension of those protections has been done through ministerial direction. In the government's view, it is important that those protections be specifically set out in the legislation itself. The bill also repeals the current definition of ‘permanent resident'. The new definition maintains the link to the ASIO Act with regard to a natural person, but redefines the understanding of a body corporate. For the purposes of the ISA, a ‘permanent resident' would include a body corporate incorporated under a law in force in a state or territory, but would exclude a body corporate whose activities are controlled, or could be controlled, by a foreign power or natural person who is neither an Australian citizen nor a permanent resident. Another significant change will be adjustments to the ministerial authorisation regime to allow a minister responsible for a different intelligence agency to authorise intelligence collection activities in instances where there is a need for emergency collection and the responsible minister for an agency is not readily contactable or available. These other ministers will be the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General. A further change will give new authority to ASIS, DIGO and DSD to communicate incidentally obtained intelligence in defined circumstances. The bill also proposes a common definition of ‘staff member' for the intelligence collection agencies that clarifies the status consultants or contractors, or persons made available to work with an agency by another Commonwealth or state authority. Other changes include a provision which expressly provides for the Inspector-General to consult with the Commonwealth Ombudsman to avoid a duplication of effort. A similar provision currently exists in the IGIS Act in respect of the Auditor-General. Another provision will establish a clear right for the inspector-general, as part of monitoring ASIO's activities, to access any place being used to detain a person under a warrant issued for the purposes of questioning in accordance with division 3 of part III of the ASIO Act. Other amendments concern an inspectorgeneral inquiry which directly concerns the head of an agency. These changes will allow the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security the option of advising the secretary of the Department of Defence, in relation to the Defence intelligence agencies, or the relevant minister in the case of the other intelligence agencies, of an inquiry and to use these channels to consult on a draft inquiry report. A further change will enhance accountability arrangements for any use by the Director-General of Security of his power, under the ASIO Act, to authorise intelligence collection for up to 48 hours in advance of ministerial authorisation. This amendment will require the Inspector-General to be advised within three working days of each case where this authority is exercised. A similar change will be made to the authorities of the Director-General of Security under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The bill also includes amendments inof tended to achieve consistent treatment of the intelligence agencies under the Freedom of Information Act. I commend the bill to the House and present the revised explanatory memorandum. Leave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately",61
156,Mr MCCLELLAND,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The opposition supports the second reading of the Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005, which will go some way towards enhancing accountability and oversight of Australia's intelligence agencies. There can be no doubt that the gathering and analysis of intelligence is at the front line of the fight against terrorism. As we feel the shockwaves of yet another bombing in Bali it is appropriate to once again stress that Australia, along with our friends in the region and across the globe, is well and truly involved in that fight. It is appropriate that yesterday the parliament yet again confirmed our determination to win that fight.  following his inquiry into Australia's intelligence agencies, stated: Situated in a potentially volatile region and subject to an increasingly uncertain global environment, Australia's need for good intelligence is arguably greater now than at any time since World War II. Increasingly, that intelligence will be not only for military purposes but also for regional law enforcement purposes. Labor entirely supports the significant additional funding that has been provided to our intelligence agencies over the past four years, which is now in the order of $4 billion. The Leader of the Opposition in a speech to the Sydney Institute given on 4 August this year said: To combat terrorism we must make Australia a safe haven. It's in ‘prevention' that the primary investment must be made-we must concentrate our efforts on intelligence gathering, surveillance, investigation and detection. More recently, as a practical measure to encourage talented young Australians to enter a career in our intelligence agencies and in our defences forces, the opposition has proposed that scholarships should be offered to pay the HECS debts of young graduates who have joined our major security agencies. The opposition has proposed that scholarships would apply to ASIO, ASIS, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Department of Defence, including defence intelligence agencies. These are the agencies that form the heart of our preventive efforts of intelligence gathering, surveillance, investigation and detection. It is these agencies that need ready access to the best and brightest of our youth. Under Labor's proposals, up to 200 Australian scholarships would be offered to eligible graduates entering participating agencies each year. These scholarships would pay any outstanding HECS debt for an eligible graduate at the time they are granted permanent employment. The scholarships would cost up to $8 million each year and, based on today's graduate intakes, would cover all graduates entering the agencies. A return-of-service type obligation would require that the graduates be employed within a participating agency for a suitable period of years-for instance, based on the period of study for which the HECS debt has been paid. A graduate in Asian studies and languages, for instance, beginning work with one of our security agencies or a science and technology graduate, such as a signals analyst recruited by the defence intelligence agencies, could receive in the order of $20,000 in satisfaction of their entire HECS debt. We believe this is a practical measure that can go some significant way to strengthening the human resources of our intelligence community at a time when these human resources need to be the strongest we can possibly make them. Government agencies which keep Australia safe should be able to attract the very best young graduates to assist in protecting Australia and our region from the threat of terrorism. I note media reports from yesterday of an impending publication from the Kokoda Foundation prepared substantially by Professor Ross Babbage. The report refers to a recommendation not dissimilar to that which Labor has proposed. Apparently it will be suggested in the publication that tertiary students who do 12 months full-time military training and commit to six years follow-up annual training would have their tertiary study entirely paid by Defence. The author believes these young graduates would provide a highly trained, ready reinforcement for the permanent Defence Force. Clearly, that is an idea that is worth exploring, but Labor believes these sorts of innovative measures should extend across not only our Defence Force but also our crucial intelligence agencies. I also commend to members an excellent contribution to this debate made by newly elected Senator Trood. Senator Trood noted the numerous references in the Flood report to potential value adding to intelligence and national security assessments through greater agency contact with the public and experts outside those agencies. As Senator Trood noted: Most of these agencies have a very poor record of outside contact. They are loath to engage the lic and particularly academe, where experts may reside. Senator Trood argued that greater interaction between the agencies and academia is essential for a number of reasons including, to use his words, ‘the intelligence shortcomings over Iraq'. I recently received a submission from an academic arguing for the formalisation of an exchange program between universities and our intelligence agencies. It goes without saying that national security considerations would have to be recognised in such a formalised exchange program. Nevertheless, refreshing the ranks of agencies on the one hand and providing practical interchange with students on the other would, to use the words of the Flood inquiry, significantly value add to our intelligence-gathering capacity. I note that Senator Trood also criticised the fact that there is currently no one agency that provides an effective strategic view of longer term global trends that may impact on Australia's security and foreign policy interests. That, we believe, is a valid criticism and one that needs to be addressed. I note in that context that in the House yesterday the Leader of the Opposition noted the interchange between the Australian Federal Police and policing agencies in South East Asia which were particularly successful in, for instance, apprehending a number of those responsible for the Bali bombings of October 2002. The Leader of the Opposition noted, however, that there has not been a similar level of interchange between our intelligence agencies. Obviously, there will be particular strategic interests between our countries that may limit the extent of communication in respect of a limited number of issues. However, the opposition believe that when it comes to the war on terror those publimitations can be overcome. We believe that more work needs to be done to build up those crucial inter intelligence agency links. In particular, the Leader of the Opposition referred to the ease of movement throughout the South-East Asian archipelagos and the fact that the waterways are essentially a highway for travel between those islands and indeed between nation-states. When I visited the United States Coast Guard last year, they recognised the waterways as a highway not only for criminals, including drug use and illegal smuggling of all kinds, but also for potential terrorist activity. I note that the American agencies, through the Joint Interagency Task Force Westwhich involves not only the United States Coast Guard but also the United States military and the FBI-are providing valuable resources to South-East Asian countries, including resources and training to improve their maritime intelligence links. We believe that is a project that Australia could be much more closely involved in. As was put to us when we visited the Joint Interagency Task Force West, Australia would have perhaps an even greater capacity to open doors in South East Asia. The Joint Interagency Task Force West indicated that they would welcome Australia's involvement in some of the projects that they are involved in. The point making is that I am far from convinced, and the opposition is far from convinced, that we are doing all that we can to establish appropriate intelligence links, which are essential if we are to defeat terrorism in South-East Asia. I note that after the Bali bombings in 2002 the then head of ASIO, Mr Dennis Richardson, described the bombings as an ‘intelligence failure'. Similarly, to use that expression-not, I stress, in a judgmental sense but in a descriptive sense-last week's bombings in Bali must also be regarded as an intelligence failure. Again, I want to stress that we are advancing that statement not to be judgmental or as a criticism of anyone's neglect or culpability but rather as an indication things could be improved. These measures are some of the things that could be done, we believe, to strengthen intelligence gathering not only as it affects our nation but as it affects our region-a region which is our backyard, from the point of view of potential threats. These threats are coming from our backyard well and truly into our front yard. After that quite wide-ranging analysis, it is appropriate to refer to the detailed provisions of the bill, not in the same extent of detail that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage employed in his contribution but by way of outline. As previously indicated, the bill arises, firstly, from recommendations of the Flood inquiry of 2004 into Australia's intelligence agencies and, secondly, from a review conducted by the government of the operation of the original 2001 legislation. The government has also acknowledged the contribution of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, which the opposition would also like to formally acknowledge in recognising the parliament's I am respect for that committee. That committee has made an outstanding contribution to the national security debate in Australia. As the parliamentary secretary pointed out, it is significant that each of its reports has been unanimous. In terms of picking up some of the recommendations of the Flood report, it cannot go without mention that a significant cause of the problem that we and our allies are facing in Iraq was the intelligence failures that preceded the invasion of Iraq, intelligence failures that resulted in poor planning. In one section of the Flood report, Mr Flood said: One or both of these documentsthat is, the briefings on the existence of that weapons of mass destructionmight also have covered areas relevant to Australia's interests on which there was little intelligence assessment: the strategic cost implications for Australia of contributing to military action against Iraq, the likely strategic costs and issues involved in post-Saddam Iraq, and the impact of military action on the safety of Australia and Australians. Again, I stress that I sincerely believe that a lot of the problems facing those countries participating in Iraq are a result of the poor planning resulting from the poor intelligence assessments as to what was going to be required in the vacuum created by the removal of Saddam Hussein from the leadership of that country. Irrespective of which side of the debate you are on as to whether the invasion was or was not appropriate, those who are thoughtful in this area will recognise those intelligence failures and will recognise that inadequate and insufficient planning was undertaken as to how to deal with the vacuum created once Saddam Hussein was removed from office. Quite frankly, I think the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia are still trying to fathom what to do to fill that vacuum. Again, that goes back to the intelligence failures, not simply those about the existence or non-existence of the weapons of mass destruction but the inadequate intelligence assessment and advice about that crucial issue-that is, what would happen in the post Saddam Hussein vacuum. In terms of the specific details of the suffice it to say that the bill is intended to improve the effectiveness of oversight and accountability mechanisms of our overseas intelligence agencies, as well as to more effectively address the current division of responsibilities between those agencies. Importantly, the measures also provide a legislative basis for the activities of the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, a relatively new organisation but one that is vitally important to our national security interests, given the extent of the coastline that we are responsible for protecting. While the DIGO, like ASIS and the DSD, has a foreign intelligence focus, its ability to obtain imagery and geospatial data will assist Australian defence forces in their exercises and training wherever they occur. It should be noted that the technology can also be a valuable tool to assist in search and rescue operations. The opposition support-also with appropriate safeguards-the provisions in this bill for these technologies to be used to produce intelligence to support Commonwealth and state authorities in their national security role. The opposition also support measures in the bill to expand the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, which will now be appropriately renamed to include the additional agencies and will have its numbers increased from seven to nine. We note that the government has moved amendments in the Senate to adopt recommendations of the parliamentary joint committee that the deputy chair's position should be occupied by an opposition member except in the circumstances outlined by the parliamentary secretary. Again, we believe that that amendment is appropriate. We are disappointed, however, that the government has not accepted opposition amendments which are based on the unanimous recommendations of the joint standing committee. In particular, our amendments bill, which were moved in the Senate were proposed in order to address concerns expressed by that committee about item 22 of the bill. That item proposes the removal of the qualifying words currently contained in section 8(1)(a)(i) of the primary act, in respect of ministerial directions: specifically, removing from those provisions the requirement for such authorisations to be obtained for the purpose of obtaining intelligence on an Australian person ‘who is overseas'. It is those words ‘who is overseas' that will be removed. Despite some ambiguity, the joint standing committee noted that, arguably, removal of those words could be interpreted as expanding the powers of the agencies to collect intelligence on Australians who are in Australia. While acknowledging that there may be circumstances in which it may be necessary for our overseas intelligence agencies to collect intelligence on Australians in Australia-for instance, if an Australian is communicating with an overseas organisation or person that presents a security concern-the opposition shares the committee's concerns that the same approval regime that currently applies to ASIO in respect of its obtaining of intelligence on Australians within Australia should also apply to overseas intelligence agencies undertaking that function. In particular, the committee recommended that the ministerial authorisation regime should ‘generally replicate the provisions of and have identical authorisation provisions to those that apply to ASIO'. In the opposition's view, the ASIO warrant procedures that apply to its telecommunication interception powers are comparable to the powers that will be given to our overseas intelligence agencies under this legislation. On that basis, we have again proposed similar amendments in the House. We will also be moving an amendment which we believe will assist in the proper management of incidentally obtained intelligence. We will speak to those two arms of our amendments during the committee stage of the bill.",64
157,Mrs VALE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. This bill demonstrates the Howard government's continued commitment to Australian security and the government's priority regarding the continued improvement to Australia's intelligence services. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the Office of National Assessments Act 1977, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 and related legislation to implement proposals recommended by the Flood inquiry and the government's review of the intelligence services agencies coordinated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in 2004. Australia's strategic circumstances and the challenges Australia faces today make intelligence a vital part of this government's efforts to protect our national interest. As Australia is subject to an increasingly uncertain global environment, its need for good intelligence is arguably greater now than at any time since World War II. The government needs to fully exploit every asset at its disposal to help protect Australia and Australians from the threat of terrorism. Highquality, independent intelligence is a critical element of the government's armoury to meet these challenges. Despite the limitations on intelligence, there are nonetheless qualities which define good intelligence and which the government should expect to have access to. Australia's intelligence collection assets must be focused on the government's highest priorities, coverage of those priorities must be as comprehensive as possible and reporting must be accurate and timely. Australia has built on the foundation of a strong intelligence history to help it meet today's challenges. Our intelligence culture draws on liberal political traditions as well as the legacy of Western intelligence in World War II. Consistent with these traditions, intelligence in Australia has been focused outward and on threats to genuinely national interests. Unlike those of other cultures, Australia's intelligence agencies do not focus on internal political dissent, nor do they engage in operations to support the government of the day. Australia's intelligence needs are dynamic, reflecting rapid global transformation. Just as economic globalisation was a feature of the last decade, this decade has seen the globalisation of security threatsparticularly from non-state actors. Fast-paced technological change has been diffusing power and empowering individuals and groups to play a role in world politics. Political and military threats to Australia's security and prosperity have been supplanted by the new threats of global terrorism by radical activists. The numerous recent attacks on Western targets underline the emergence of the use of terror by radical Islamic extremists as the major threat to Australia's security. This threat is serious and enduring. This terrorist phenomenon is new in scale, method and ambition. Al-Qaeda and similar networks have demonstrated both the willingness and the capability to inflict massive casualties civilian targets, and they display no concern for the loss of innocent life. They have an active interest in obtaining chemical, biological or radiological weapons. Unlike the terrorist groups of the last century, the alQaeda fundamentalists embody an extremist terrorism that is uncompromising. Australia is a Western democratic nation. Where previous forms of terrorism barely touched Australia, this new form of extremist terrorism has declared its aim to inflict damage on Western liberal democracies. It is global in scale. No nation can afford to ignore such threats. In our own region Jemaah Islamiah has emerged as a serious threat. Intelligence is the front line of the government's campaign against terrorism and is vital in seeking warning of terrorist plans. It can help us derstand terrorist groups as well as the context that sustains them. Changing global dynamics have resulted in a number of other less dynamic but nonetheless important demands on intelligence. With a strong government focus on border security, intelligence plays an important part in countering illegal immigration networks. It is a substantial task, not least because of the phenomenal increase in people movements between nations over recent decades. There are on average some 8.4 million passenger arrivals in Australian international airports each year, which some five million do not involve Australian citizens. Non-traditional threats are more difficult to detect. Often well-defined, slow-changing and predictable targets have been replaced with networks that are complex, adaptive and elusive. Australian intelligence agencies are responding and are increasingly engaged in whole-of-government and international teams. Another dynamic affecting the intelligence community has been technology, which has proved a double-edged sword for on intelligence agencies. Technology is enabling, for the first time, individual access to communications that are instantaneous, diverse and robustly encrypted. New technology can impose great difficulties and costs on intelligence collection. On the other hand, access to our own and allied technological innovations gives our agencies new levels of reach. But keeping up with technology is a costly business. This government has recognised this increasing need with a doubling of the Australian intelligence community budget over the past four years. In 2000-01, a total of $332 million was spent on both foreign and security intelligence, rising to $659 million in 2004-05. In addition, a small part of the budget of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation assists the intelligence un- community. The figures mentioned omit expenditure on intelligence by the Australian Defence Force other than the costs of Australian Defence Force personnel working within the defence intelligence agencies. Staff resources have also increased substantially in the past five years. Numbers of personnel in the intelligence community have increased by 44 per cent, from 2,301 in June 2000 to 3,324 in June 2004. Looking at the legislation, the purpose of schedule 1 is to amend the Intelligence Services Act 2001, primarily to implement two of of the proposals recommended in the Flood inquiry. The first is to amend the legislation to include the functions and ministerial accountabilities of the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation in order to put the newest of Australia's intelligence agencies on a legislative footing. The second is to extend the mandate of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD to include the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, the Defence Intelligence Organisation and the Office of National Assessments on the same basis as that committee's current mandate. With this change is the proposal to rename the committee the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. Schedule 1 also includes amendments that have resulted from a review of the Intelligence Services Act coordinated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. These include: clarification of the existing roles and functions of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate; authority for the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation and the Defence Signals Directorate to communicate incidentally obtained intelligence in defined circumstances; and changes to the ministerial authorisation regimes for intelligence tion by agencies covered by the Intelligence Services Act. The changes to the functions of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate are not intended to change the scope of the intelligence functions of those agencies. The inclusion of a provision concerning the communication of incidentally obtained information is to clarify the circumstances when such intelligence, which has been collected unintentionally in the proper conduct of the functions of the agencies, can be communicated. The amendments to the administration of the ministerial authorisation strengthen the strict procedures contained in the original act. These procedures apply when the activities of an agency are specifically directed at collecting intelligence on Australian person. The amendments remove the legislative limitation on those procedures which currently applies to Australians who are outside Australia. Accountability for the activities of the agencies is also increased with the introduction of regular reporting obligations for agency heads on activities that have been authorised by the minister and with a specific requirement that agency heads must seek a reconsideration of a ministerial authorisation when the circumstances that justified the authorised activities cease to exist. Further, these amendments provide that the ministerial authorisation regime will be changed to allow certain other ministers to authorise intelligence collection activities in circumstances where there is a need for emergency collection and the responsible minister is not readily contactable or available. The group of ministers involved will be the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General. This amendment is intended to provide some flexibility to the agencies while maintaining the controls on their accollec- tivities contained within the act. The purpose of schedule 2 is to amend the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act to implement three proposals recommended in 2004 by the inquiry into the Australian intelligence agencies. The first is an amendment of the legislation to provide a legislative basis for the inspector-general to monitor the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation on a similar basis to the current scrutiny of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate. The second amendment is to give the inspector-general authority to initiate inquiries at regime their own discretion into matters relating to the Defence Intelligence Organisation and the Office of National Assessments. These also include changes to give the inspectoran general authority to conduct periodic reviews of the statutory independence of the Office of National Assessments. The schedule also includes a number of amendments that have resulted from the review of the Intelligence Services Act. These include a provision to allow the inspectorgeneral to consult with the Commonwealth Ombudsman to avoid a duplication of effort, as can currently occur with the Auditor General. Another provision establishes a clear right for the inspector-general to access any place being used for detention, as a component of the inspector-general's role to monitor questioning by the Australian Secret Intelligence Service under the special powers conferred by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. The purpose of schedule 3 is to amend the Office of National Assessments Act, primarily to implement two of the proposals recommended in 2004 by the inquiry into the Australian intelligence agencies. The first amendment to the legislation is to remove the references to the National Assessments Board and the Economic Assessments Board to reflect the reality that there is only one assessments board, which covers all strategic, political and economic issues but with provision for different composition according to the subject matter under consideration at each board meeting. Also included in this schedule is an amendment of the legislation to strengthen the intelligence community coordination role of the Office of National Assessments. The purpose of schedule 4 is to amend the ASIO Act and schedule 5 amends the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to implement a measure agreed in response to the Intelligence Services Act review. This change will enhance accountability arrangements for any use by the Director-General of Security of their power under section 29 of the ASIO Act and section 9 of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to authorise intelligence collection under an emergency warrant for up to 48 hours in advance of ministerial authorisation. It will require the inspector-general to be advised, by being provided with a copy of the warrant, within three working days of each case where this authority is exercised. The main purpose of schedules 6 to 8 is to provide the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation with a similar standing, under various legislation, to the other intelligence collection agencies. This is consistent with the recommendation by the inquiry into the Australian intelligence agencies in 2004 that the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation be put on a proper legislative footing. Schedule 6 also amends the Privacy Act 1988 to extend the exemption currently provided to ASIO and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, under section 7(1A) of the Privacy Act, to the Defence Signals Directorate. Likewise, schedule 7 also amends the Freedom of Information Act. The various intelligence agencies are currently treated differently under the Freedom of Information Act. The Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Office of National Assessments are exempt agencies under the Freedom of Information Act by virtue of being listed in part I of schedule 2 to the act. Subsection 7(1) of the Freedom of Information Act provides that these agencies are exempt from the operation of the act as they do not have to comply with the procedural requirements of the act. The Defence Signals Directorate and the Defence Intelligence Organisation, on the other hand, are treated as an integral part of the Department of Defence. The department is the agency for Freedom of Information Act purposes. By virtue of subsection 7(2) and being listed in part II of schedule 2 to the act, documents relating to the activities of the Defence Signals Directorate and the Defence Intelligence Organisation are exempt. However, the Department of Defence must still comply with the procedural requirements of the Freedom of Information Act-that is, it must respond to a freedom of information request on behalf of the Defence Signals Directorate and the Defence Intelligence Organisation in accordance with the act's time frames and give written reasons for refusing access to any documents sought in the application. These access decisions are subject to internal review and Administrative Appeals Tribunal merits review. These amendments to the Freedom of Information Act will result in all intelligence agencies being treated alike. The Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation are included in part I of schedule 2 and the Defence Signals Directorate and the Defence Intelligence Organisation are moved from part II to part I of schedule 2. All intelligence agencies are then fully exempt from the operation of the act. Australia's intelligence needs are many and enormously varied. The agencies of the Australian intelligence community must be able to respond to the detailed operational intelligence requirements of the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Federal Police or ASIO while also informing government policy on regional, political, economic and strategic issues. More than ever in this uncertain and dangerous world environment, Australia's intelligence needs and the resources and capabilities of Australia's intelligence agencies must coincide. This bill is a mix of provisions that will streamline the processes and operations of our intelligence agencies, and it will increase their accountability and transparency. We live in interesting times, but we also live in uncertain and potentially dangerous times. I support the government in its vital role of protecting Australia's security and national interests. I commend this important bill to the House.",69
158,Mr RUDD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the proposed amendment to the Intelligence Services Act 2001. The purpose of the Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 is to amend the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the ISA; the Office of National Assessments Act 1977, the ONA Act; the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986, the IGIS Act; and related legislation. This is to implement proposals recommended by the Flood inquiry and the government's review of the intelligence agencies. The opposition has raised concerns about aspects of the amendment, and these will be detailed soon by my colleague the member for Barton, the shadow minister for defence. The question arises when we debate this legislation as to why we had the Flood inquiry in the first place, given that it is the recommendations of that inquiry that have given rise to the amendments currently before the House. The Flood inquiry, for those who have lost track of this in the sands of time, arose because there was a parliamentary joint intelligence committee inquiry prior to it on the major deficiencies that had become apparent in the Australian intelligence community. These deficiencies had in turn become crystal clear over a word that these days almost dare not speak its name in this parliament, and that word is ‘Iraq'. Iraq has been described in various reports as an intelligence failure on the part of the Howard government, and depending on how events proceed in Iraq it may prospectively be described as a foreign policy failure and prospectively also as a national security failure. We will wait and see. Because Iraq has been so central to the reason for the reports which have been constructed so far, in the first instance by the parliamentary joint intelligence committee and then, building on that report, by the Flood inquiry, it is worth reflecting for a moment in the parliament on the reasons we engaged in the Iraq war in the first place. The reasons we were given by the government-and I recall the debate well at this dispatch box-included, firstly, the elimination of Iraq's stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and, secondly, to prevent said stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction finding their way into the hands of terrorists. Thirdly, when those arguments began to take on water, the government moved to the argument that the Iraq war all along was about the liberation of an oppressed people. Beyond that again, we were to believe that the reason for the Iraq war was to build an Iraqi democracy. More recently the government has moved post facto to a further reason for the Iraq war, which is to bring about the democratisation of the broader Middle East through some democratic domino theory approach. Two and a half years later it is worth flecting on where we have got to against the objectives of the benchmarks that the government has set for itself progressively in justifying the extraordinary decision to commit this country to war in Iraq as one of only three combatant states. On the first ground for going to war, the elimination of Iraqi stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, we can collectively conclude that that criterion has failed in being met because there were no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction at the time the government went to war. If we go to the second criterion, which is that we were to prevent stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists, that argument gets knocked over by the failure of the first ment that there were no stockpiles in Iraq to fall into the hands of terrorists. On the question of the liberation of an pressed people, yes, Saddam Hussein has been removed-that is true. But this is an interesting new addition to Australian foreign policy doctrine-that the removal of dictators now becomes an element of our foreign policy. The governments in Pyongyang and in Zimbabwe will be interested to hear how this doctrine will be applied in the future. Also relevant to this particular argument advanced by the government is the extent to which the government has been less than candid with the Australian people about the number of civilian deaths and casualties in Iraq which have occurred since the Iraq war began. When we have questioned the government on these matters in the past, the government has refused to provide details. As for the latter two justifications provided most recently by the government for the war in Iraq-that is, building an Iraqi democracy and using an Iraqi democracy to bring about a democratic revolution across the wider Middle East-the jury is still out. In early June 2003, the opposition first re- called for an Australian parliamentary inquiry into intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. The government did not respond to this request, instead resorting to the argument that Australians had at that stage ‘moved on' from the Iraq war and that no such inquiry was needed. However, on 23 June 2003, the Australian parliament announced the establishment of an inquiry into Australia's intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This inquiry was to be conducted through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The committee was chaired by the Liberal Party and had a majority of government members. On 1 March 2004, the parliamentary joint committee released its report, which devoted argumuch attention to the accuracy and honesty of the government's intelligence related claims. In fact an entire chapter was dediopcated to this. Significantly, the report also identified at least 12 examples where the government had exaggerated pre-war intelligence on Iraq's WMD threat. Example No. 1: at paragraph 2.5 of the report, reference is made to an Office of National Assessments admission that intelligence was ‘slight on the scope and location of Iraq's WMD activities'. This was in stark contrast, however, to statements made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, among others, who said on 18 July 2002, in the lead-up to the Iraq war: ... I don't think there's any doubt about Saddam Hussein having stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons. Example No. 2: paragraph 2.40 of the parliamentary joint intelligence committee report stated: The agencies provided hardly any explicit assessment on the question of the immediacy of threat posed by Saddam Hussein. Once again this contrasted with comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs when, in reference to the United Nations Security Council veto, he said: This denied the Security Council any further role in the disarming of Iraq-but it did not deny ... the clear and immediate threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to global security. Example No. 3: paragraph 4.40 of the parliamentary joint intelligence committee report said that both United States and UK government documents-that is, from my recollection, the government documents used to publicly justify the actions of those governments in going to war-as published in September-October 2002: ... did not recognise the gaps in the intelligence, the problematic nature of much of the new intelligence or the uncertainties and disputes within the agencies about what the intelligence meant. Taken together, the omissions and changes constituted an exaggeration of the available intelligence, since established as an exaggeration of the facts. In paragraph 5.520 of the parliamentary joint intelligence committee report, it notes: The statements by the Prime Minister and Ministers are more strongly worded than most of the AIC judgements. This is in part because they quote directly from the findings of the British American intelligence agencies. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs were simply cherry picking the intelligence reports to legitimise the desire to go to war in Iraq. The report damningly said of the Howard government-and I quote again from a committee which is chaired by the Liberal Party and dominated by the Liberal Party: ... the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations. The joint intelligence committee report, in paragraph 5.17, goes on to say: This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia's two analytical agencies. It is also important to note the committee's repudiation of the Prime Minister's statement to the parliament when the Prime Minister explicitly referred to Iraq's WMD threat as real and unacceptable. Again, the joint intelligence committee report states at paragraph 5.22: Government presentations were in some areas incomplete, notably in respect of some of the available United Nations information on Iraq. Furthermore, the report made the point in paragraph 5.32: ... the Australian agencies did not think the amounts of WMD to be large-they were described as ‘small stocks'-and the Defence Intelligence Organisation always expressed doubts about any production of biological or chemical weapons beyond 1991. Yet at the same time the presentations by the Howard government in the lead-up to the Iraq war, to justify the action of going to war, appeared to suggest large arsenals and stockpiles.",73
159,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I hate to interrupt the member, but having a look at the bill, the context of the bill and the report referred to in the bill-the Flood report, not a Senate report-this is about intelligence, not the Iraq war.",75
160,Mr RUDD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"With respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Flood inquiry arises precisely because of the failure of intelligence on the Iraq war. That is why these earlier observations by the parliamentary joint intelligence committee relating to these matters gave rise to Flood which, in turn, give rise to the matters which are before the House. Finally, on the terrorist threat arising from a war in Iraq, the story has been just as bad if not worse. The government's selective use of information at its disposal amounted to a fundamental misleading of the Australian people. The government explained that the war was necessary to reduce the overall terrorist threat, but the parliamentary inquiry found in paragraph 5.29: ... the view of the Joint Intelligence Committee of the UK, available at the beginning of February 2003that is before Australia went to warthat war would increase the risk of terrorism and the passing of Iraq's WMD to terrorists. The parliamentary inquiry, therefore, which has given rise to the process which is before the parliament now, examined some but not all of the intelligence information available to government in the lead-up to the Iraq war. But from what it did examine it concluded that the government exaggerated the intelligence information it had at its disposal. While it may be of discomfort to some in this parliament, I have to point out that this was a committee which was chaired by the Liberal Party, dominated by the Liberal Party, but which could reach no other conclusions than those that I have just referred to. So, when we talk about Iraq and the intelligence failure which it represents, let us be absolutely clear-cut that whatever failures existed in intelligence did not of themselves explain the government's failure to tell the truth about the intelligence information it did have in its possession. In example after example, which I have referred to from the parliamentary joint intelligence committee report, we have the intelligence committee providing information full of reservations, concerns, doubts and uncertainties about Iraq's WMD status and, on the other hand, the government in parliament and outside parliament telling the Australian people that no such doubts and uncertainties existed. This I think needs to be a matter of parliamentary record. These matters led the government to establish an administrative inquiry into the structural changes which would be necessary within the Australian intelligence community itself. We in the opposition at the time called for a royal commission to consider these matters, given that they related to not just the operations of the intelligence community itself but also the relationship between the intelligence community and the executive arm of government. We therefore criticised the nature of the inquiry which had been established, the Flood inquiry, and we criticised in particular its limited terms of reference. As I said before, the terms of reference did not focus on the extent of the political relationship between the agencies on the one hand and the political arm of government on the other in the use publicly of information provided to the executive arm of government by the intelligence community. That is the core point emerging from the analysis of these matters by the joint intelligence committee chaired by the Liberal Party and dominated by the Liberal Party. Furthermore, as I said before, the inquiry lacked royal commission powers-no power to compel ministers' attendance at public forums and no power to extract information from ministers or agencies. Furthermore, the inquiry was led by a former recent head of an intelligence agency, Mr Flood, who had been Director-General of the ONA within the last eight years, and the ONA itself was a central focus of the criticism of the parliamentary inquiry. The Flood inquiry was established in March last year. A year later, we come to the third definitive report in terms of the conclusions which the government had put forward concerning Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capability at the time of the Iraq war. The first inquiry, to recap, was the joint intelligence committee produced by this parliament. The second was the Flood inquiry, which concluded that there had been an abject intelligence failure on the part of Austrawould lia concerning Iraq's WMD status. The third, and most significant because it was an international report, was the report delivered by the Iraq Survey Group. The Iraq Survey Group was established by the United States following the invasion of Iraq. It was staffed by a number of US agencies with the explicit objective of locating said stockpiles of missing weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological weapons in particular, and to establish the truth concerning the claims, again prior to the war, about the reconstitution of Iraq's nuclear weapons program. The Iraq Survey Group, in which Australians also participated, reported on ANZAC Day this year, 25 April. Its conclusions also need to be recorded formally in the parliament. Its conclusion was: The ISG has not found evidence that Saddam Husayn possessed WMD stocks in 2003 ... And the report concluded in its key findings: The former Regime had no formal written strategy or plan for the revival of WMD after sanctions. Thanks to the Senate inquiry into the duties of Australian personnel in Iraq, also known as the Barton inquiry, we also know that Foreign Minister Downer met with Dr John Gee, an Australian government official seconded to the Iraq Survey Group, and that meeting occurred on 10 March 2004. Dr Gee had just resigned from the Iraq Survey Group reportedly in disgust at its operations. I think the Australian people today are still entitled to know precisely what advice Dr Gee provided to Mr Downer back in March 2004 concerning the work of the Iraq Survey Group at that time and the progress it had achieved in its hunt for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction in the post Iraq war period. The foreign minister has declined to reveal any context of his discussions with Dr Gee on that day, describing them as personal. I suggest, given that this country sent its armed forces to war, that such discussions are not in fact personal but in the public interest and should be placed in the public domain for proper scrutiny. Given the findings of the Iraq Survey Group report and the concerns voiced by Australian government officials working for the Iraq Survey Group, it is interesting to note what Foreign Minister Downer had to say yesterday at the launch of a report dealing with WMD in general. Buried on page 106 of the report lay the understated acknowledgement that the Iraq Survey Group had found no evidence of WMD or post1991 WMD production. Does that report and its contents constitute any formal apology on the part of the foreign minister to either the public or the parliament of Australia for the fact that Australia went to war on the basis of a lie? It does not. We still await such an apology from the foreign minister. That brings us to the present. It brings us to the matters which are currently before the parliament in terms of the future operations of the Australian intelligence community. Our approach, as the alternative government of Australia, is that the Australian intelligence community represents a vital asset in this country's continued campaign against global terrorism and, beyond that, a vital asset in this country's overall national security requirements. But it brings us back again full circle to the current situation which fronts us in Iraq. The current situation in is very difficult indeed. What we have today in Iraq is a political and security situation which is rapidly deteriorating. It has been deteriorating for some time. Yet the government still stands at the dispatch box and says that everything will go well in Iraq or that the security and the political situations are improving in Iraq. Debates in the United States most recently have pointed in precisely the reverse direction. If we look objectively at circumstances on the ground in Iraq, we find an increasingly difficult and problematic set of circumstances which exist 2½ years after this war ended. Remember the government told us that Australia's own troop commitment in Iraq would be matter of months and not of years. This requires some questions to be answered by the government. First, does the Prime Minister stand by his foreign minister's statements that the security situation in Iraq is very much improved and is heading in the right direction? Second, what is the government's assessment of the likelihood of civil war in Iraq? Third, what does the increase in sectarian violence between the Sunni and the Shia mean for the security situation in Al Muthanna province and the safety and well-being of Australian troops operating in that province? Fourth, what happens to the increased presence of foreign jihadists, principally from Saudi Arabia, in the security circumstances in Al Muthanna? Fifth, what discussions has the Prime Minister and his officials had with the administrations in Washington and London about the real timetable for troop withdrawal from Iraq? And, finally, what is the timetable for Australia's withdrawal from Iraq as well? What implications do all of the above have for Australia as a terrorist target, given that Australia's invasion of Iraq increased Australia's overall status as a terrorist target? These con- are matters which we shall continue to Iraq prosecute with the government, which has continued to remain unaccountable in this parliament. (Time expired)",76
161,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"That was a very interesting trip down memory lane with the member for Griffith and before him the member for Barton, but we are speaking today on the bill which is before us, the Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. The member for Griffith continues to work every new nuance into his rewriting of history. We can entertain him and listen to his reports as he puts them together, but eventually he will be drawn into the current circumstance and into addressing the world as it stands, not the world as he perhaps would like it to stand. The bill that we face today is a very important part in the process of equipping Australia to deal with the world as it stands. There has been a trend towards greater reliance on and greater provision of defence assets, greater reliance on and greater provision of better security assets within Australia and greater reliance on and greater provision of intelligence assets on behalf of Australia. This is a very important process, because without that we would be miring ourselves in the kind of quagmire that the member for Griffith specialises in-that is, living in the past instead of dealing with the present. I would like to touch briefly on some of the significant changes in defence and those other security assets in Australia over the last five years or so. If you go back to 2000, the government set out its strategic priorities for defence in the defence white paper. A defence capability plan was produced as part of that, and that was reviewed in 2003. If you look purely at the defence front, in the time since the 2000 report we have seen 125 individual defence capability plan projects approved for the government, including new main battle tanks, armed reconnaissance helicopters and six airborne early warning and control aircraft-a total of over $20 billion of investment over that time. That is on the defence front. We can also canvass the changes in legislation to support the Australian Federal Police and, indeed, state police structures. There has just been a very lengthy debate in Australian society about that. But, of course, intelligence is a very important part of the process as well. After government set the Flood inquiry into action in 2004, the report recommended that a series of new initiatives be implemented, and those are being implemented by the government for the benefit of the country through improving intelligence networking. The in tralian intelligence community is performing well and is a potent capability for the government. In response to the findings of the inquiry, the government is expanding the budget of the Office of National Assessments from $13.1 million to $25 million and doubling ONA staff from 74 to 145. It is establishing a foreign intelligence coordination committee under the Director-General of ONA to assist the DG in coordinating and monitoring the AIC's performance. It is providing a greater role for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in coordinating the consideration of the National Security Committee of cabinet of the priority setting and reporting of the AIC. It has increased funding for the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to build staff language skills and to conduct a periodic external review of the AIC every five to seven years. That sums up many of the changes and many of the existing responses we have heard about from the government in response to the Flood report, but now there are these additional changes and it is important that we canvass some of those and look at the entire framework within which they apply. The Intelligence Services Act 2001 came into force on 29 October 2001 and established a legislative basis for the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, for the Defence Signals Directorate, DSD, and for the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, which replaced the former Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation. The Flood inquiry was conducted last year the and now we have the changes before us. Intelligence is an important asset for the country. In the introduction to the Flood report you can see some of the important core capabilities that it entails. They are listed there. It says that through intelligence we can receive: - warning, notably of terrorist plans, but also of potential conflicts, uprisings and coups - understanding of the regional and international environment, with which Australian decision-makers will need to grapple - knowledge of the military capabilities and intentions of potential adversaries, a vital ingredient in defence procurement and preparedness - support for military operations, minimising casualties and improving the environment for operational success - support for an active and ambitious foreign, trade and defence policy. Furthermore: ... beyond these vital roles of intelligence in providing information, modern intelligence can be a more active tool of government-disrupting the plans of adversaries, influencing the policies of key foreign actors and contributing to modern electronic warfare. The development of both of those things can be influenced to our advantage. The brief of the Flood inquiry was to investigate: - the effectiveness of the intelligence community's current oversight and accountability mechanisms as they relate to such matters as the setting of priorities, the assigning priorities of appropriate resources, and the delivery of high-quality and independent intelligence advice to the government - the suitability of the current division of bour among the intelligence agencies and communication between them - the maintenance of contestability in the provision to government of intelligence assessments - the adequacy of current resourcing of intelligence agencies and in particular ONA. This is, of course, in keeping with the government's aim of eradicating duplication in our legislation and enforcing consistency and accountability. It is important to note that, through this legislation, we are endorsing and enforcing the role of parliament as a scrutiniser of these agencies. It also recognises the need for intelligence in our society, a need which is increasingly essential. The Flood report said-and I notice that the opposition spokesman for defence, the member for Barton, picked up this quote: Good intelligence is arguably more important to government now than at any time since World War II. Global terrorism has transformed Australia's perceptions of its security. Intelligence in today's world has a vital role in a range of crucial issues. This bill demonstrates a commitment to ensuring our intelligence agencies can work at their most efficient level while also maintaining their obligations to operate with accountability and responsibility. Let us look at the agencies involved. The Office of National Assessments, ONA, is responsible for reporting an assessment of matters of international, political, strategic and economic significance to Australia. It also monitors Australia's international intelligence activities. The Defence Intelligence Organisation, DIO, provides all-source intelligence assessment to support defence decito the sion making and operations. ASIS, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, provides overseas human intelligence collection; it obtains and distributes intelligence about the la- capabilities, intentions and activities of individuals and organisations outside Australia. The Defence Signals Directorate, the DSD, provides the collection, production and dissemination of signals intelligence. It also provides information security products and services to the government and the Defence Force. The Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, DIGO, provides imagery intelligence and geospatial based intelligence. I understand that it is one of the newest intelligence agencies working in Australia. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO, is responsible for gathering and producing intelligence to warn the government about situations and activities that might endanger Australia's security. This government has substantially increased the funding and, thus, the abilities of our intelligence agencies. I again quote the Flood report: Intelligence is a key element in Australia's response to this changed environment, and the past four years have seen a doubling of the intelligence budget, with over $650 million invested in the intelligence community in 2004-05. Staff numbers in the Australian intelligence community have risen by 44 per cent over the same period. Overall, the government has committed more than $3 billion in additional funding for national security from 2001–02 to 2007–08. Having sat through the comments of the previous speaker in this debate, the member for Griffith, I began to ponder where we would be if we had received the Flood report and had to decide what to do in relation to it with Mark Latham as the Prime Minister. I am sure that, if that were the case and the opposition were in government, it would be a very different response from the one we are getting from this government. After listening to the member for Griffith, I would like to pause and let members reflect on the fact that, at the time of the debate on weapons of mass destruction, the opposition were as adamant as the government that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq-and so were most of the defence organisations the world over. That position was held in practically every country of the world, except Iraq. The only difference of view in Australia was what to do about it. The view of the opposition was that basically nothing should be done about it, that sanctions should remain and that things should continue, such as the now totally discredited oil for food program. However, the government proposed a different view: after warning Iraq again and again about weapons of mass destruction, eventually the world community would have to do something about it. In the end, there can be only so many recommendations, pronouncements and warnings from the United Nations before something would have to be done. The government took a position on that. It also took a very strong position in support of the democratisation of Iraq, the freedom of its people, and against the despotic dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. The opposition spokesman for defence, the member for Barton, spoke about both the recent and previous Bali bombings as examples of intelligence failure. Those examples are not given in the Flood report-naturally enough, given the timing-but Flood does give a description of intelligence failures. He says: The history of major intelligence failures-the failure to detect plans for the World Trade Centre attack in 2001, Iraq's intention to invade Kuwait in 1990, the imminent collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 or, much earlier, the failure to anticipate the strength of Turkish forces in the Dardanelles in 1915 or Japanese plans for Pearl Harbourprovide a cautionary lesson for any policy-maker who believes intelligence is always accurate or that it can provide guarantees. That shows the quality and level of consideration that has gone into this report. It also reflects on initiatives. While steps can be taken by the government in all the areas of security, defence and intelligence, nothing is infallible because it is carried out by man. Provisions might be manufactured with the best of intentions, but they do not provide a guarantee-as noted by Philip Flood. I spoke a minute ago about the attitude of the ALP to weapons of mass destruction. The ALP have been less than candid in their position on Iraq. They were critical of the Iraq campaign but claimed to support the US alliance. In fact, as it turns out, they went ahead and elected somebody who did not support the US alliance. At the time, the opposition spokesman on defence, the member for Barton, was in the US looking at the US Coast Guard and talking up the alliance while Mark Latham was writing in his diary that Australia should become more like New Zealand. He told the ABC: We should have a look at how New Zealand has made itself the safest country in the world. That is not really a move in support of the US alliance at all. It was interesting that the member for Barton, during his contribution, referred to a speech made by the current Leader of the Opposition who told the Sydney Institute that the strategy for Australia should be to make Australia a safe haven. What is that? If you want to set up Australia like New Zealand and go down the Latham road then you are not supporting the US alliance and you are not working in a manner that is conducive to the kinds of initiatives that are being proposed by the Flood report, such as the gathering of intelligence assets to support Australia's position. It is not going down that path. It is setting yourself up as a kind of a hippy commune on the edge of the world, divorced from reality and immune from it. That is not the kind of outcome that we are seeking from this report. Once again, it would be instructive to sit there and think how we would cope with this kind of common sense if we were being led by someone with the kinds of cuckoo policies that were being proposed in secret by the then Leader of the Labor Party late last year. This bill extends the mandate of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The bill now extends its coverage to include the Office of National Assessments, the Defence Intelligence Organisation and the DIGO on the same basis. It formalises the functions and ministerial accountabilities of the DIGO. It clarifies the responsibilities of the agency and sets out the five functional categories of the agency's work. The parliamentary secretary outlined those five functions earlier in this debate. The level of scrutiny of the DIGO will be comparable to the level of scrutiny which applies to DSD and ASIS. DIGO is the newest of our intelligence agencies and this bill provides for its induction to legislative accountabilities. It gives parliament, through the committee, a consistent and effective mandate which will cover all of Australia's intelligence agencies, rather than the current situation of covering some agencies but not others. This legislation does not diminish the roles of our agencies but clarifies their functions concerning, for example, the circumstances of communication of incidentally obtained information. I would like to close by quoting from the Flood report again: Effective oversight and accountability of gence agencies is critically important for a healthy democracy. The more relevant intelligence becomes to government, the greater the need and public demand for strong and transparent oversight and accountability. There have been many recent operations whereby Australian service personnel and security personnel have been sent overseas to represent our interests, and they have done a fantastic job. They have done that in places like East Timor, the Solomon Islands, Afghanistan and Iraq with the effective support of our intelligence agencies. This bill will ensure that our intelligence agencies are even better equipped to provide better support in the future and that Australian service personnel and Australians as a whole will benefit as a result.",78
162,Mr BEVIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Brisbane) (6.25 pm)Although I am sure we would all wish it to be otherwise, we presently live in a world in which non-state terrorists are bent upon taking action against people around the world, largely at random and in an asymmetric manner. That is not surprising, given that if you were in their shoes conventional warfare with the people they are seeking to do battle with would be a fairly short encounter. That said, people involved in these acts of terror have no regard for any human life and appear to have no regard for their own lives. They operate beyond nation and state boundaries. They have no regard for international boundaries, national or international laws. In that environment, there is no doubt that one of the most critical weapons available to nation states to defend themselvesone of the greatest assets that you can have-is good intelligence. The Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 is based on a view of providing better intelligence-gathering capabilities, and that is something which I think intelliall members of the parliament understand and accept. In a free society such as Australia, though, it is one of those balancing provisions where the need to obtain intelligence on the conduct and behaviour of our citizens is always balanced against the freedoms that distinguish our society from totalitarian societies. It is important when we consider laws of this kind that we consider that balance and that we satisfy ourselves that we have the balance right: that the safeguards are in place, that the accountability is there and that we are not eroding the fundamental nature of our freedoms in such a way as to give the terrorists a victory that they could not otherwise achieve. In the end, only we can give up our freedoms. The terrorists may well be able to bomb from time to time, take life and cause misery; they cannot take our freedom away. That power rests with us and us alone, and particularly with those of us privileged to be in this parliament as legislators. I think important that we look at the Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 and similar bills in that broad context. This bill has its genesis in the Flood report. The Flood inquiry was conducted because of concerns that were raised after the 2001 election that the government and, in particular, DSD-the Defence Signals Directorate-had inappropriately intercepted telephone conversations between the Maritime Union and the Norwegian freighter, the Tampa, which I am sure everyone in this parliament will recall was a significant issue in the lead-up to the 2001 federal election. The Minister for Defence at the time released an edited report that was conducted by the then Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Blick, who inquired into the matter. The edited report was released on 2 May. The report found that there had in fact been four breaches of the classified privacy rules-that is, DSD had contravened its own rules. Whilst that much is clear and an established fact, the basis upon which that happened and the extent to which ministers in the government were aware of it in advance is something we may not know for some time. In any event, that gave rise to the Flood inquiry to look at the operations of our intelligence agencies in order to assure us, as a free society, that they were conducting their affairs in a way that the Australian people would want. We should not simply sweep aside that 2001 incident. It is a matter of serious gravity that an intelligence agency entrusted with great powers by this parliament has breached those powers and inappropriately intercepted conversations between trade union officials and the commander of that vessel. That is a serious matter. Frankly, I think it has been too lightly set aside in this debate and since the incident occurred in 2001. When intelligence-gathering agencies-special agencies it is of government with particular powers not normally afforded to law enforcement agencies-misuse or abuse their powers, whether intentionally or inadvertently, it is a serious matter in a free society. As legislators, we especially should never allow that to pass without serious consideration. The Defence Signals Directorate, or DSD, has always had as its primary charter the collection of information and data associated with people outside Australia. That has been its principal responsibility. In relation to the activities of people within Australia, including Australian citizens, ASIO has always been the body with principal responsibility for intelligence gathering. I think that has been a fairly useful delineation of responsibilities. With that delineation of responsibilities has come a different regime for activities. When ASIO wants to exercise its powers to intercept information-in plain terms, maybe to intercept a telephone conversation between one person somewhere in Australia and another person elsewhere in Australiait is obliged to follow a fairly rigid regime for the authorisation of a warrant. Successive governments have put that requirement in place for good reason. As a people, we are not going to lightly allow any government, or any arm of government, to intervene in the legitimate privacy rights and civil liberties of our citizens without just cause and appropriate authorisations. I am concerned-and we will wait with interest to hear from the minister, perhaps in the summing up on this or later in the debate-as to why it is that the bill proposes a different regime for the authorisation of DSD warrants than for ASIO warrants, particularly given the provisions in the bill to change the focus, or at least the parameters, of DSD's involvement. One of the provisions in the bill removes the restriction on DSD concerning itself with people outside Australia. The minister should clearly state the parameters for the exercise of warrants for DSD engagement and, having done that, we can then assume that this in some way extends the opportunity for people within Australia to have their privacy compromised or their conversations listened into-that is, that DSD can conduct intelligence activities in relation to people living here in Australia. If this bill facilitates a greater use of that power then it is important for all of us that the ister explain, firstly, why that is necessary and, secondly, that being so, why DSD should have a different set of requirements for getting warrants than ASIO does. If, after the passage of this bill, DSD is going to be more likely to be intercepting information involving Australians here in Australia, then it would seem to be a sound principle that the same restrictions that apply to ASIO to undertake those activities should apply to DSD. I hope that the government can comment on that. There is an opportunity for the parliament to review these activities in a limited way, and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD has fulfilled that role. I want to take the opportunity in this debate to commend that committee and its members. The parliament and the people of Australia are very well served by the existence of that committee; it is fundamentally important. Indeed, I think there is a good argument that the powers of that committee can, and should, be extended beyond what they were in the past-and that is probably a discussion for another day. The parliament is well served by the committee; it comprises people who are not only experienced members of parliament but experienced in the field of national security. In some cases, they are legal practitioners well experienced in the relevant laws. We have former defence ministers on that committee and it is chaired by a former minister of the present government. It is important that a senior committee of the parliament have the opportunity to regularly review the workings of the intelligence agencies ASIO, ASIS and DSD. I think all members on both sides share a confidence in the people who represent us on that committee, and it provides a degree of certainty for the people of Australia that these intelligence-gathering organisations are accountable, on a regular basis, to such a forum. I min- will await with interest the comments of the minister and perhaps join the debate later during consideration in detail.",82
163,Mr KEENAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005, but first I would like to address some of the comments that we heard in the chamber earlier today. In particular, the member for Griffith used the time given for his address, supposedly for him to talk about this legislation, to lecture the government on Iraq. I am amazed that he has the gall to come into this chamber and do that, considering the ALP's position on Iraq, which is not clear to me and certainly not clear to the Australian people. I understand that at last count the ALP has had about 29 separate positions on Iraq. For the government's part, our policy has always been clear: we opposed a brutal dictator who ruthlessly oppressed his own people and we are now playing our part to protect freedom and a young democracy in that country. So the member for Griffith came in here to lecture us on our position, which is remarkable considering it has just been revealed that he spent the last election campaign running around trying to cover up what he believed to be the terrible mistakes of his leader in making off-the-cuff comments and on-therun policy on what is an extraordinarily important defence issue for Australia. So the next time he cares to come into the chamber and talk about Iraq, perhaps he would like to level with the Australian people and simply explain what the ALP's actual position is. I will certainly await that with bated breath. I will listen with interest as that could be icy position No. 30 of the ALP. I am encouraged by the introduction of this bill into parliament so soon after the Flood inquiry into Australia's intelligence agencies and after the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD reviewed its own role last year. In light of the recent terror attacks in Bali, it is imperative that we as a parliament recognise the timeliness and great importance of this bill. Terror can strike at any time and in any place. Sadly, we have seen this in New York, Madrid, Bali and London and on a day-today basis in Iraq. As a consequence, it is imperative that the government ensures that it does everything it can within its power to obtain intelligence in a timely manner and use it effectively to counteract terror cells, both here in Australia and internationally. The brutal scourge of terror is closer than ever before. Enemies of freedom and proponents of a sickening and deformed interpretation of Islam continue to wage war against basic human values and individual dignity. As a consequence, Australia's intelligence services are on the frontline. They play an increasingly vital role in defending our intersecure ests not only at home but also abroad. A major component of ensuring effective, professional and timely intelligence can be directly attributed to the delegation of legislative and parliamentary oversight. Also, the provision of sound intelligence rests on the supposition that no untoward political or otherwise extraneous influence has been brought to bear on its determination. The most effective manner through which this can be ensured is parliamentary oversight. By providing wideranging but not obstructionist parliamentary oversight, we as a government recognise and endorse the valuable role parliament plays in the provision of sound intelligence. This bill also recognises and accepts that a shared responsibility exists between parliament and polour intelligence-gathering community. The government always has a responsibility to govern fairly but the parliament always has a right to scrutinise agencies of the government to ensure that Australians have effective oversight of Commonwealth operations. This legislation reaffirms that shared responsibility. It also enhances and strengthens it. This bill is a part of a package of measures designed to amend the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the Office of National Assessments Act 1977, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 and all the related legislation. In implementing the recommendations given to us by Mr Flood, by the parliamentary joint committee and by the review by the Inspector General of Intelligence into the Intelligence Services Act 2001, a number of changes will be made to legislation that will enhance agency accountability and operational coordination. Firstly, the roles, functions and ministerial accountabilities of the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, known colloquially as DIGO, will for the first time be placed on a legislative basis. Considering the nature of the work prepared by DIGO in an effort to Australia's national interest and support our defence forces, I consider these legislative amendments to be valuable as for the first time ever parliament's role in ensuring and providing oversight will be codified. The Office of National Assessments intelligence community coordination and evaluation role will also be further enhanced by providing it with a clearer and stronger authority. Mr Flood also recommended that the number of ONA staff be doubled and that there be a substantial increase in its funding. I wholeheartedly applaud this recommendation and I am pleased to see that the government has accepted it. By recognising that intelligence developed through analytical assessments of international developments is absolutely integral to securing Australia's security and national interest, the bill continues the government program aimed at securing Australia's borders. I have also been encouraged to see within this legislation that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD will have its mandate extended to cover all of Australia's intelligence agencies. In effect, this means that the ONA and DIGO, as well as the Defence Intelligence Organisation, will be included in the committee's ambit on the same basis as ASIO, ASIS and DSD. In addition to extending the mandate of the parliamentary committee, the bill will also make other important changes. The committee will be expanded from its current seven members to nine, a deputy chair will be created and the power to establish subcommittees as required will be granted. In themselves, these changes are important in expanding and strengthening the parliamentary oversight of Australia's intelligence services. On 5 October 2005, when the bill was introduced in the Senate, Senator Ferguson spoke about how previously one of the committee's major drawbacks was that, with its limited number of seven members, it was not uncommon to have one or two members unavailable for various reasons. As a result, the committee was hindered in its deliberations and therefore hindered in its oversight capabilities. The rectification of this problem will go a long way to increasing parliament's oversight capacity. The bill also provides for a deputy chair of the committee to be created. By creating this position, the government has recognised the committee's strong history of bipartisan cooperation. As a result of the September 2005 review of the bill by this committee, it has been amended so as to stipulate that the deputy chair does not have to be a government member. The goodwill and bipartisan cooperation within the committee has warranted our this amendment, and I support it in its entirety. It is often forgotten here because of the confrontational nature of Australia's political arena that both sides of politics can work together, and I am extremely glad to see that this is the case, especially considering the importance of the work conducted by this committee. However, the amendment proposed by the government will also ensure that, if the chair of the committee is not present at a meeting of the committee when a question is to be decided by voting or is absent for a period of more than one month, the members present are to appoint a government member to preside at a meeting. Once appointed, that member will exercise all the powers and prerogatives of the chair. This caveat, I believe, is vital to the bill as it ensures the integrity of the duly elected government of the day and recognises its mandate to govern. Moving away from the amendments that the bill will make to the structure of the parliamentary committee, the bill will also extend the mandate of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. A legislative basis for the scrutiny of DIGO will be created and the inspector-general will be empowered to initiate enquiries at their own discretion into matters pertaining to the DIO and ONA without prior ministerial referral. Considering the nature of the work that is conducted by the inspector-general and its utmost importance in ensuring that Australia's intelligence agencies conduct their activities within the law, behave with propriety, comply with ministerial guidelines and directives and have regard for human rights-both in Australia and internationally-the increase in this mandate recognises the body's professionalism and importance in making sure our intelligence agencies operate within their guidelines. Internationally, we have seen examples of the disastrous consequences that occur when intelligence agencies operate outside of their rightful place. By strengthening the provision against this occurring, the government makes sure that our intelligence services continue their professional practices within the bounds of their appropriate operational powers. Furthermore, the bill will require that the inspector-general conduct periodic reviews of ONA's statutory independence to ensure political influence does not adversely affect the provision of sound and timely intelligence. In giving effect to the recommendations of the review of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 which was conducted by the inspector-general, the bill clarifies the roles and functions of ASIS and the DSD to reflect agencies' operational experience under the act. Public accountability of ASIS and DSD will also be enhanced with the implementation of the measures contained in this bill. The changes outlined above will continue the process of strengthening the contribution of sound intelligence to government decision making and operations. ASIS, DIGO and DSD, as Australia's foreign intelligence collection agencies, will be placed on a sound legislative footing, thus completing the framework of legislation covering all of the Australian intelligence community. The changes will also provide an effective balance between allowing the Australian intelligence agencies to fulfil their rightful functions, while at the same time maintaining and enhancing appropriate public accountability arrangements. The balance that will be reached by this bill is important, as it goes far enough to provide effective oversight but not so far as to be obstructionist, thus inhibiting our intelligence services in getting on with their rightful job. The introduction of this bill demonstrates the Howard government's commitment to maintaining the vital contribution of intelligence agencies to Australia's security whilst ensuring that these agencies operate responsibly and with appropriate accountability. I commend the bill to the House.",84
164,Mr KATTER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The people on earth that Australians should be best friends with are our neighbours. I was minister for Aboriginal affairs in the Queensland government, which led me to visit Boigu and Saibai islands. One of those islands is 28 kilometres from Indonesia. In fact, on a clear day you can see Indonesia clearly. They are the people that we should be best friends with, and most of our initiatives in foreign affairs should be directed to this area. You may ask us, ‘Do we have a natural affinity with these people?' I represent a large part of Australia's cattle industry. All of my adult life I have been involved in the cattle industry. About an eighth, a seventh or maybe even a sixth of our entire cattle herd is now going, in the main, to Indonesia and the Philippines. We sell them fairly small beasts for about $600. They grow the beasts out-from little more than calves, I suppose, yearlings or two-year-olds-and then they process the beasts, and they are worth about $3,000 to the Indonesian or the Philippine economy. Or they may choose to sell those products on the world market to the rest of the world. So they make an enormous amount of money out of our industry, and it is a way in which we can see that a relationship with these people would be of great benefit to them and of great benefit to our country as well. Would to heaven that when I had a cattle station in the gulf we were getting $600 or $700 for oneto two-year-old steers! Having said that, a lot of these people are of an Islamic persuasion, which historically has had very great conflicts with Christianity, the predominant belief system in Australia, and that raises some questions. Add to that the fact that a lot of people who visit this country unfortunately have been involved in drugs and that the sexual mores that come from America in their movies and various other things are very unacceptable to these people, many of whom are arch-conservative in their moral beliefs. They find the sort of morality that is coming out of America very offensive. In this context, we are seen as glos, the same as the Americans. To quote Winston Churchill, those who cannot learn from history will be condemned to repeat history. About 230 years ago, Australians said, ‘We do not have to have a population in this country. In fact, we do not want population; we have birth control methods. We do not have to occupy this country; we do not have to have people living in it. It is our country-we do not have to occupy it. We do not have to defend it-our woomeras and spears are quite adequate for the defence of this nation. We do not have to export anything. There is no onus upon us to produce anything of value to the rest of the world.' The Australians that occupied this country then ran into very, very rough times indeed. Their fate was not a happy one. Has anything changed, except the colour of the faces of most Australians? Has anything changed? Do we believe that we have to have a population commensurate with other countries? Do we believe we have to occupy this country? The golden boomerang-not the Brisbane Line but the golden boomerang-was all that was going to be defended; the rest of it was going to be handed over to the Japanese. Take out the golden boomerang, and a little bit around Perth, and the rest of the country is occupied by about the same size population that was here when Captain Cook arrived in 1770 or whenever it was. So we most certainly do not believe that we have to occupy the country. As for defence, when I was a kid and left secondary school, I was handed an SLR rifle and told, ‘You're on 24-hour call-up to go and fight, son,' because we were at war with Indonesia at the time. It was delightfully called Konfrontasi, but it was a war. If I had been sent there, people would have shot at me and tried to kill me. There were 250,000 SLR rifles in Australia to defend our country, An- and standing behind them were a million semiautomatic weapons. That is what we had to defend this country with. We now have 50,000 rifles. As a weapons instructor in the Army for some seven or eight years of my life, I can say the rifle is a very substandard combat weapon. In fact, the last time. I used a Steyr rifle to shoot with, it had shot three Australians and no enemy-and I was not the slightest bit surprised. But, in any event, there are 50,000 rifles. If you think you can defend your country with 50,000 rifles, you have another think coming-and I venture to submit that your position is not much different from the position of the Australians that were here 230 years ago. I represent about 2,000 kilometres of the northern Australian coastline, which abuts our northern neighbours. I represent the Gulf of Carpentaria. And it makes me weep to read, in the newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne, of the Queensland government wild rivers legislation that says we will not be able to touch any of the water in the rivers of the Gulf of Carpentaria, where my family come from and have lived for nearly a century and a half. Those rivers' run-off is 124 million megalitres. To put that in context, the Murray-Darling system, which produces nearly half of Australia's entire agricultural production, has a lousy little 20 million megalitres of water. We have 124 million megalitres of water. If we are trying to come to grips here today with a danger to the security of Australia, I venture to submit that, if you put temptation in the way of people, they might succumb to that temptation, as they did in 1770. They came to a country where there was no-one living-the founder of my own homeland, the mid-west of North Queensland, Ernest Henry, was there for two years and never saw the people who lived there, the people we now describe as Aboriginals. He did not see one in two years. It was a vast and empty land. As he wrote home to his parents in England, he only wished and prayed that he could make contact with them. That 124 million megalitres drains the greatest undeveloped resource on the planet, a blacksoil plain 600 kilometres wide stretching from Normanton and Burketown all the way down to Blackall. A great resource God has given us: water and black soil, the magic combination. Do you know how we as a race of people have used that? Six million hectares of it has been taken over with the prickly acacia-acacia niloticatree. It has destroyed all native vegetation. you fly over it in an aeroplane, you will see a station property that is black and a station property that is white. The one that is black has the infestation of prickly acacia tree. I will not go into why one is white and one is black. If people in Indonesia, a country where 80 or 90 million are going to bed hungry every night, find out that we are sitting on a resource where not 55,000 farmers, as we have on the Murray-Darling, but 12 farmers-count on your fingers and two toes-and about one per cent of Australia's agricultural production come from there, they might get a little bit upset. They might think that we are dogs in the manger. We will not develop it and we will not let anyone else develop it. Whilst I speak here, the Queensland parliament is passing laws that nothing is to be touched-no water, no rivers, no anything. That is temptation. This is the danger to Australia: add to that the fact that the people of Indonesia had an economy that was very rapidly growing-I think it was six or seven per cent annual growth rate-and they were going on strong. Their economy ran into problems, as all economies do from time to time. There was intervention by the World Bank-and creditor nations. I will cite Joseph Stiglitz's Globalization and its discontents for the net result of that intervention. He was the head of the World Bank. Rupert Murdoch took a whole page in his own newspaper, which he very seldom does, to condemn the Australian government of the day. I do not even know whether the government of the day was ALP or coalition. The net result of that intervention was that average Indonesian income dropped from $1,800 per person to $1,000-clean in half. We were at about $19,000 in Australia. Poor as they were, our intervention-and, when I say ‘our', they lump us in with the Americans, and quite rightly so, because we were If party to that intervention-dropped their income in half. Whether or not it is fair to blame the Americans or us for the collapse of the economy, Stiglitz most certainly does and a number of others do, too. Rupert Murdoch most certainly did. But whether it is fair or not, that is how it is seen by those people. To quote Churchill again, ‘If you can't learn from history ...' The great threat to our security during the Second World War came from Japan. They were only about four or five weeks away from invading Australia when they were intercepted by the 39th Battalion on the Kokoda Trail. Members of my family were there at Milne Bay, where the Japanese were also intercepted. Every soldier in the Japanese southern army was handed a little black book. In this little black book it said: ‘Three hundred and sixty thousand Asians are ruled by 300,000 Europeans. And they will never consider us to be equal-never. They consider us to be inferior, and it is the duty of Japan to throw off the yoke of European tyranny.' That is the way an awful lot of people in Asia view the Anglos-for the want of a better word. I turn now specifically to the subject of border and coastal security. We are talking here about internal security. I pay the minister great tribute here because I think he did an awful lot to protect the coastline of Australia. He did it very courageously. He took a lot of punishment as a result, and I for one would like to put on record my appreciation of what he did in that respect. But to say we are at the present moment in occupation of the Gulf of Carpentaria is a very poor joke. You can fly in an aeroplane from Cairns across to Broome in Western Australia and see no sign of human habitation. We are not in occupation of this country at all, and if you are not going to develop it or occupy it then you cannot blame someone else for saying, as they did 230 years ago, ‘We're going to come here and have a slice of the action.' I would like to see us at least act to protect our country. I do not profess to be an expert in this field. If you are talking about infantry warfare then, yes, in my day I knew a hell of a lot about it. I was an instructor for eight years, and a very keen and enthusiastic one. But if you are talking about defending the coastline, I am not an expert; I would know nothing about that. However, people who do have said-and I urge the minister consider this-that we need 100 patrol boats. People who know say those patrol boats should be armed with guided missile capacity, which is not very expensive. It costs $5 million for five guided missiles. They say we need interception capacity on those boats-and that is very expensive. It costs about $30 million. But it could be accomplished through a 10year building program, which would make us the leading small boat builders in the world-and I would not worry too much about the free trade deal with America, because they are not going to; and if they are not I do not see why we should be restricted in awarding procurement contracts locally. We also need helicopters with over-thehorizon radar. You can see for 400 kilometres with a radar equipped helicopter. Trying to resupply your army would not be a lot of fun. Undoubtedly the heroism and bravery of our troops on the Kokoda Trail and at Milne Bay-where members of my family fought and many of their comrades died-were the most important factors. But it must also be said that the Japanese ability to resupply was cut off, ultimately, by the Battle of Midway. And the ability to resupply dictated the final outcome of the war, as it did in Europe with the invasion of Russia. If we can deprive an invading force of the ability to resupply and if 100 patrol boats can also patrol our coastline, that is the immediate issue. Again and again we see boats that cannot be identified-but they can be identified: there is a satellite up in the sky. We have vehicle-monitoring devices now on all of our fishing boats and can have them very cheaply on all of our tourism boats. All the rest of them have to go through Customs pilots-and there are other permits needed to bring a boat into our waters. If they do not fall into any of those categories, which we can bring up on a computer in a matter of seconds, then they need to be looked at. But we have no ability to confront them at present. The nearest patrol boats are in Cairns. Look at a map and see how many thousands of kilometres you have to travel from Cairns all the way around into the Gulf of Carpentaria. The people I represent tell me again and again that they see not only boats but boats landing. I cannot see any way that you could stop them under the present arrangements that we have in Australia. So even though this proposal is outside the minister's portfolio, Australian security inside the minister's portfolio. He is well equipped and has an excellent background in defending our coastline that will serve him well in the history books of Australia. I urge the minister to look further at this. At the present moment our situation is very grim indeed. I contributed to the debate tonight because I wanted to put on record that I had said, in the year of our Lord 2005, that our situation was a grim one. There were some people standing in this place in 1938 who argued that we should not have any defence system, but there were other people arguing that we desperately needed one because we were in very great peril. The price that we paid for not listening to those people was very great indeed. The price paid by a lot of my constituents, who were First Australians, was very great indeed, and I do not want to see my country pay the same price again.",87
165,Mr RUDDOCK,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 has been transmitted by the Senate, seeking concurrence of the House. It was introduced by the member for Flinders, Mr Hunt. I thank him for doing that. I had to attend a National Security Committee meeting of cabinet and that meant that the task that I was expecting to fulfil had to be undertaken by the honourable member. Of course he has been supported in this debate by the member for Barton, the member for Hughes, the member for Griffith, the member for Blair, the member for Brisbane, the member for Stirling and now the member for Kennedy. Might I say that, while the member for Kennedy roamed widely on a range of issues in relation to national security, this bill is really about intelligence services and their role in identifying any potential risk. I hope I will be forgiven for containing my remarks to the bill because Australia's foreign intelligence collection agencies provide crucial is support to government policy formulation, decision-making processes and military operations. The agencies collect information that is not available from other sources, in accordance with the national intelligence priorities established by the government. The Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 will assist in the strengthening of the contribution of sound intelligence to the government. The bill implements-and I think many have emphasised this-the legislative  AO in his 2004 inquiry into the agencies. The bill also puts in place a range of amendments to legislation identified as a result of the government's review of the operations of the Intelligence Services Act 2001, which had been in place for some four years. Effective intelligence arrangements are necessarily underpinned by sound accountability mechanisms. It is important to review these mechanisms regularly, and the Flood inquiry, along with the government's review, has provided the opportunity to do so. Obviously, I welcome-as have my colleaguesthe review of the bill by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The government is very happy to support most of the recommendations of that committee report. It is a committee that undertakes a very sensitive task with a very large degree of bipartisanship, and that is something that is appreciated. The committee also respects the sensitivities when working in this area, where intelligence information may be imparted as part of the reviews being undertaken. As outlined in the debate today, however, there are sound reasons why the government does not support the third committee recommendation-the opposition, I think, will propose it-and when we go into the consideration in detail stage I will expand on why that support will not be forthcoming. In the second reading debate most of the comments have been very supportive of the need for these measures, but there are two matters that I want to deal with. One arises from some comments by the member for Brisbane, who asked what parameters surround DSD's production of intelligence on Australians in Australia and why these powers need to be extended. Let me deal with this because my understanding of the bill is that it does not extend the intelligence agencies' power to collect intelligence against Australians. The act currently allows the Defence Signals Directorate, DSD, and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, to undertake activities to produce intelligence on an Australian person who is in Australia but only if that Australian's activities relate to people or organisations outside Australia, the responsible minister is satisfied that the Australian's activities meet strict criteria listed section 9 of the act and the responsible minister issues written authorisation to the relevant intelligence agencies under the act. The proposed change corrects an anomaly in the Intelligence Services Act 2001 by specifying that the above requirements are in the act itself rather than in a ministerial direction, as is currently the case. The same requirements are currently specified in the act for an Australian person who is overseas. This anomaly was noted in a question to the Hon. Senator Robert Hill from Senator Evans on 13 March 2002. The response to the senator's question was incorporated in Hansard on 21 March 2002. This amendment in fact enhances accountability arrangements by proposing a legislative requirement that any collection on an Australian person in Australia needs to be authorised by the responsible minister. There was also some interest in another matter relating to DSD's compliance regime and Tampa. Tampa is often raised in relation to DSD. In his inquiry into that matter, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security found that reports published by DSD had breached the 1998 rules on Signet and Australian persons. The inspector-general noted that it was not a trivial matter and the DSD immediately put in place a special internal instruction to ensure that there could not be a repetition of what had occurred on this particular occasion. Since the implementation of the Intelligence Services Act 2001, DSD has established a dedicated compliance team to ensure that DSD meets international best practice in compliance with legislation governing its activities. This team is embedded in DSD's operational elements and meets with staff from the inspector-general's office once a month to provide updates on all DSD activity in that has a compliance aspect. DSD has also engaged a specialist legal practitioner on a full-time basis, outposted from the Australian Government Solicitor's office, to provide advice on all matters related to the Intelligence Services Act and other legislation affecting DSD. The organisation has instigated a comprehensive education program developed specifically to address the requirements of the act and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act as they relate to DSD's activities. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security supports this program. He attends each course and provides participants with an opportunity to hear his views about compliance first hand. I think this demonstrates a very clear commitment to ensuring appropriate compliance is understood within the organisation. All DSD officers, including ADF personnel posted to DSD, are required to attend the full-day compliance course, regardless of where they work. The courses are also run at all of DSD's remote sites, and to date over 450 officers have received this training, with priority given to those engaged in the production of intelligence reports. DSD has also implemented technical and procedural measures which are designed to ensure that no communications passing over the Australian telecommunications network can be inadvertently collected by DSD. I think you will see that these are very serious issues. They are relevant to national security. I welcome the remarks of those members who have identified the importance of intelligence and its role in supporting government policy formulation and decision making processes as well as military operations. This is obviously a very important measure and I hope it will receive a speedy passage in this House. I commend the bill to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

(7) Schedule 1, page 10 (after line 6), after item 36, insert: 36A At the end of section 15 Add: (7) The retention of incidentally obtained intelligence concerning Australians that is not publicly available, must be minimised. We can be brief on this point. The bulk of these amendments goes to our proposals to implement the recommendation of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD in respect of item 22 of the bill. That concerns the ministerial authorisation process for the obtaining of intelligence on Australians who are within Australia. The committee recommended that the regime that applies to the obtaining of such intelligence should be equivalent to that which applies to ASIO, our domestic intelligence organisation, and that that procedure should be a warrant procedure issued through the Attorney General. We believe that warrant procedure will provide greater safeguards due to the fact that the Attorney-General is an officer other than the one responsible for these particular offshore agencies. In addition, the proposed warrant procedure is more formal than a mere authorisation procedure, with more formalised review processes. Amendment (7) attempts to replicate provisions in equivalent legislation applying to ASIO in respect of the retention of incidentally obtained intelligence. We believe there should be a statement of policy in the legislation that the retention of incidentally obtained intelligence concerning Australians that is not publicly available should be minimised. That is the thrust of the second tier of our amendments. With that, I commend the amendments to the House.",93
167,Mr RUDDOCK,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Can I firstly assure the member for Barton that the amendments have been the subject of very careful consideration. While they are not supported, I want to make it clear that the issues have been looked at as questions that ought to be properly considered. Essentially, the substantive issue is that the opposition is suggesting that we should have a warrant from the Attorney General before agencies are able to undertake activities for the purposes of producing intelligence on an Australian person who is in Australia and for ASIS activities that will have an effect on an Australian person who is in Australia. The amendments consist of a combination of provisions taken from the Telecommunications (Interception) Act as well as from the Intelligence Services Act. There are issues as to whether the opposition is proposing that the warrant system should co-exist with existing requirements or replace them. It seems to me that, if what you are seeking is a warrant, it is important to recognise that other than the person who is dealing with the issue, the Attorney or a minister, the processes are really the same. The practical difference is the terminology used. A warrant constitutes a written means of authorising the doing of a future specified act which may otherwise be unlawful. It transforms the nature of the act from unlawful to lawful. Essentially, the government is saying in relation to these matters that collecting ligence is not an unlawful act, and it is not something that has to be validated. So the authorisation procedure seems to us to be more appropriate. A proposed amendment for a warrant process implies that the activity of producing intelligence on an Australian person who is in Australia is illegal. That is not the case. The other practical difference between a warrant and ministerial authorisations involves which minister undertakes the task. The Attorney-General signs warrants; the responsible ministers for DSD and ASIS sign ministerial authorisations. The requirement for me as the Attorney-General to sign a warrant would in fact suggest that we would need to review the current arrangements in relation to ministerial accountability and responsibility generally. I say that because there are issues relating to the handling of warrants that go to ensuring that I do not undertake the warrant task lightly. They involve my department ensuring that I am briefed beforehand in situations where warrants are being sought that the lawful requirements for the issue of a warrant have been met. It is not just a question of procedures; it is a question of looking at whether the circumstances for the issue reflect the legal environment in which the agency is operating. I am grateful for that advice. I have said in the parliament before that I have come to different views at times, for reasons that I will not elaborate on, as to why a particular warrant should not be granted at a particular point in time. That is a view that I am entitled to come to, but I am comforted by the fact that officers of my department look at those issues as a threshold before I turn my mind to whether there are matters which, in my judgment, I must take into account. That of course opens up on this very question of administrative arrangements whether, if you make the Attorney-General responsible-or inteljointly responsible-for aspects of foreign intelligence activity involving DSD, DIGO and ASIS, the issues relating to foreign intelligence collection should be in the Attorney General's Department. (Extension of time granted) The other amendments proposed, in our view, add little weight to the accountability framework of intelligence agencies. They require agencies to notify the Attorney if an Australian person is involved in activities that are a threat to national security. The legislation already requires the agreement of the Attorney-General before a ministerial authorisation is given. To require agencies to minimise the retention of incidentally obtained intelligence, which occasionally does of course occur, incidentally collected intelligence is usually destroyed; however, incidentally obtained intelligence, if it were of foreign intelligence value, may be reported. This is done in accordance with the privacy rules established under section 15 of the Intelligence Services Act 2001. In making rules to protect the privacy of Australians, the responsible ministers for DSD, DIGO and ASIS must have regard to the need to ensure that the privacy of Australians is protected as far as possible. Section 15 of the act already has the effect of minimising incidentally obtained intelligence. The existing ministerial authorisation process is considered robust, vigorous and comparable to the similar provisions of the warrant process. Oversight of DSD, DIGO and ASIS operations and a ministerial authorisation process have been undertaken by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. This process will be strengthened by further specific provisions which have already been included in the Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. For these reasons, the amendments are not supported but I assure the honourable member were given serious consideration. Question negatived. Bill agreed to. Third Reading",95

169,Ms GILLARD,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"The purpose of the National Health Amendment (Immunisation Program) Bill 2005 is to amend the National Health Act 1953 to improve the vaccine funding advisory arrangements for the government funded National Immunisation Program as announced in the 2005-06 budget. The intention of this bill, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, is to ensure that the vaccine funding advisory arrangements place emphasis on costeffectiveness assessment and provide a transparent and robust framework for evaluating vaccines and making decisions on whether they should be publicly funded. The explanatory memorandum states the amendments will: ... provide for a stronger focus on costeffectiveness assessment by utilising the established transparent and rigorous decision-making processes of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) for vaccine funding recommendations. The amendments contained in this bill extend the role of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to assume responsibility for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of vaccines. The government says that this is in order to provide a more consistent and transparent process for recommending vaccines for Australian government funding. The bill also comprehends amendments to allow the PBAC to specify in its recommendation to the minister those circumstances under which a vaccine should be listed for government subsidy. The amendments also comprehend allowing the PBAC to advise the minister on any other matter referred to it by the minister in relation to the provision of designated vaccines. The amendments go to ensuring that before the minister removes a vaccine from the list of designated vaccines he or she obtains advice from the PBAC. The PBAC's advice must be tabled in both houses of parliament. And, finally, the amendments increase the total membership of the PBAC by two members. We certainly hope, though it is not clearly spelt out, that this means that those two new members will have expertise in vaccines and immunisation policy. The opposition will not be opposing this bill, but we do have a number of concerns which relate not so much to the substantive provisions in this bill but to the background that brought it to this place. I will describe that background, though there would be many members in this House who would remember these circumstances only too clearly. In particular, they would remember that the expert group that has advised Australia, and particularly the Australian government, on the cost and clinical effectiveness of vaccines to date, and up until the time that this bill is passed by the House and the Senate, has been the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. It has been the job of these immunisation experts to assess new vaccines for cost and clinical effectiveness and, if they pass those tests, to recommend to the government that these vaccines be subsidised for the target population. Depending on the nature of the vaccine, the target population might be the whole of the population or it might be an age or gender based subset, but it is their job to recommend to the government who should receive the vaccine. This is a system that has worked with considerable effectiveness for Australia until it hit a hurdle under the Howard government. Mr Deputy Speaker, if I could remind you of the hurdle that the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation hit, on 5 September 2002 the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, ATAGI, advised the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Kay Patterson, of their recommendations that the government should fund: the replacement of an oral polio vaccine with inactivated polio vaccine for infants, the introduction of chickenpox vaccine for children and the introduction of pneumococcal vaccine for infants. These were new recommendations. They passed the clinical effectiveness tests. They passed the cost-effectiveness tests. In order to pass the cost-effectiveness tests, it must be absolutely clear that the cost of funding the vaccine will be less than the cost of meeting the burden of disease arising if the vaccine is not funded. Some of these things might sound quite minor, but in truth these things are not minor when one considers their substantial health impact. The reason for moving from oral polio vaccine to inactivated polio vaccine is that there was some chance that someone could contract polio from the oral polio vaccine because it contained a live form of the virus whereas that was clinically impossible from the inactivated polio vaccine-so an important health safety measure. With respect to the chickenpox vaccine, many members in this place and in the Australian community would remember having chickenpox as a child and might think that that is just one of those mild childhood complaints. For most Australian children who contract chickenpox, that is true, but it is also true to say that chickenpox does kill Australians, including Australian children, and that there are cases where contracting chickenpox can lead to severe, ongoing disabilities. Finally, and perhaps most importantly in the minds of the community, on 5 September 2002 ATAGI recommended the funding of the pneumococcal vaccine for infants. Most Australians I think would be aware from television programs and from horror stories that they have read in their local newspapers that there are two diseases that have caused real problems for Australian kids in particular-the meningococcal virus and the pneumococcal virus. Both diseases have a very rapid onset. Their symptoms of fevers and rashes can be easily confused with more common childhood complaints, but these are deadly or severely disabling illnesses, particularly if medical treatment is not available almost instantaneously. In the community there are many horror stories about kids who have caught meningococcal or pneumococcal disease and who have been dead 12 or 24 hours later. The meningococcal issue had been dealt with by way of vaccine and on 5 September 2002 the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation said: ‘Pneumococcal kills Australian children too. Pneumococcal disables Australian children too. Pneumococcal can be prevented by infants getting access to the pneumococcal vaccine and this is cost and clinically effecbut tive.' You would think that a government in touch with the needs of the Australian community, a government competently focused on the task of defeating diseases in our community-diseases that can be defeated because of vaccines and because of medical research-would say, ‘We have this expert Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation for a reason. They have given advice, as they properly should, that these vaccines are cost and clinically effective. Our task as the government now is to get along with the funding of these vaccines.' You would have hoped, Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop-and I am sure you did hope this at the time-that perhaps in the forthcoming budget round after the 5 September 2002 recommendation those vaccines would have been funded; so one would have looked to the May 2003 budget. But, of course, in the May 2003 budget the Howard government did nothing. Then in September 2003 the National Health and Medical Research Council made exactly the same recommendations as the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. So now you have two of the foremost health bodies in this area, your experts in immunisation and vaccines and the incredibly well-respected, for good reason, National Health and Medical Research Council, saying, ‘Please, Howard government, there are three vaccines, one of them for a very deadly disease, the pneumococcal disease, that you need to fund. They are cost-effective and they are clinically effective. Can you please fund these vaccines?' Even then, the Howard government did nothing. We might debate, in moral philosophy, the difference between sins of omission and sins of commission, but it is generally believed that, if you omit to do something or you neglect to do something, that might be wrong, it is not as badly wrong as deliberately considering whether or not to do something and choosing to do the wrong thing. We need to understand, in the lead-up to the May 2004 budget when the Howard government did not fund these vaccines, that the Howard government deliberately and knowingly chose to do the wrong thing. Its Expenditure Review Committee considered these matters. This was not a sin of omission; this was not paperwork lost in a back drawer of the department on this occasion. Of course, our health minister has been grossly incompetent on a number of occasions, but it was not on this occasion a grossly incompetent health minister failing to bring forward a recommendation. On this occasion the most senior people in the Howard government, including the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Administration and people of that level of seniority, sat around a table and looked at a recommendation from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation and the National Health and Medical Research Council dealing with three vaccines and two illnesses that kill childrenchickenpox and the deadly pneumococcaland deliberately determined not to fund those vaccines. This was a dreadful day in Australian politics. It became clear in the May 2004 budget that the Howard government had done this dreadfully wrong thing. You might recall that the May 2004 budget was brought down in the lead-up to an election, a time when normally the Howard government loosen the purse strings and get out all sorts of giveaways. We certainly know that, in health, the classic expenditure pattern of the Howard government-and we are living through it again-is that for the couple of budgets after an election they cut health and other needed programs. They are in that cycle now. They did it in the last budget, a post-election budget, by hacking into the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. They hacked into the Medicare safety net, notwithstanding Minister Abbott's now infamous rolled gold, rock-solid, ironclad guarantee. They have hacked into all those programs and done mind-numbingly mean things like taking calcium off the PBS. All those things have been done in the recent budget because that is the classic Howard government pattern-after an election you cut back health. You can track this mathematically. In the budget before an election they loosen up the purse strings and chuck a bit of money at health to try and massage any constituency concerns. They hope that will last long enough to get them through the election and then they go back to hacking into health. But even though they were actually in a pre-election budget-a budget full of giveaways and vote-buying exercises with money for all sorts of things that they thought needed to massaged to buy votes-the Howard government's most senior members, including the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the minister for finance and the others making up the Howard government expenditure review committee, deliberately looked at these recommendations and said, ‘Nope, we are not funding those vaccines.' What changed? Madam Deputy Speaker, I will tell you one thing that changed. The budget is brought down on a Tuesday and on the Thursday Labor announced that it was committed to funding the pneumococcal vaccine in what was a very emotional press conference involving a small child, Bella, who had contracted the pneumococcal virus and, thankfully, had successfully won that fight for her life. Her mother, who had taken a very brief break from her bedside when baby Bella was literally fighting for her life, picked up a magazine at the hospital and read an article that said her child could have been immunised against this dreadful illness. But, of course, she did not know a vaccine was available, and the Howard government was not paying for that vaccine. So Labor announced not only that it was going to fund the pneumococcal vaccine but that it was going to fund the other vaccines of as recommended-that is, it was going to meet every recommendation that ATAGI and the National Health and Medical Research Council had laid out. I well remember the day when, in the most inelegant and seethrough of political manoeuvres two days after the budget, because Labor announced its commitment to properly fund these vaccines, the Minister for Health and Ageing had a scrambled press conference where he announced that he too would fund the pneumococcal vaccine. There was laughable scrambling around. The principal policy document of the Howard government was released on the Tuesday and the pneumococbe cal vaccine funding was not in that. Then the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, got a heads-up-presumably from someone in the media or whatever-that Labor was about to announce its commitment to funding these vaccines. He was playing catch-up politics and, with cynicism dripping from every pore, he tried to scramble around and say, ‘The Howard government is committed to funding the pneumococcal vaccine as well.' But even on that day the Howard government did not commit to the funding of the chickenpox vaccine and the new form of vaccine for polio. Of course, Labor having successfully campaigned to get the pneumococcal vaccine funded went on to say that the other recommendations needed to be met as well-the chickenpox and the injectable polio vaccines. Minister Abbott, under political pressure on these questions, did what the Howard government has done so many times: he tried to stand over the independent advisory body. We have seen this before. It is a feature of the way the Howard government deals with independent experts. It does not matter who it is. The Federal Police Commissioner comes to mind as someone who has suffered through this cycle in the past. the Howard government does not like what you are saying, it goes into standover mode. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, stood over the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation and said, ‘In respect of these recommendations about the new form of vaccine for polio and the chickenpox vaccine, I am sending them back to you for reconsideration.' Reconsideration, of course, is a word that hides a whole lot of malice in its intent. It speaks volumes for the integrity of the people who made up the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation that, even under that kind of political pressure, where they had the minister standing over them and they were basically told to somehow revisit their recommendation and cook up a new one that the minister liked a bit better than the old one, these people stood their ground and recommended again that the Howard government should fund these vaccines. It speaks volumes for the integrity of the people making up the committee. It also speaks volumes about the predisposition of the minister for health when he gets advice that he does not like. Finally, in March 2005, we ended up with these vaccines being funded as well. On the Thursday after the May 2004 budget, the minister for health gave a hurried press conference basically saying, ‘I'm thinking I will-I probably will-fund the pneumococcal vaccine.' He finally confirmed that in June 2004. He tried to stand over ATAGI. He could not crack them. They stood up to him. Finally, he had to realise that that was not going to work and he funded the polio and chickenpox vaccines. The minister for health might have been dragged kicking and screaming to this decision, but he did not forget. In part this legislation, with the abolition of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, is here because the If minister did not forget or forgive the independent experts who had caused him a political problem by standing up for what they believed in. This does not mean that the new arrangements will not work and it does not mean that the new arrangements cannot work under a competent minister for health-and one day in this country we will get a competent minister for health; we do not have one now-but part of the motivation that has brought the bill to this place is that the minister is in payback mode. He does not like it when people stand up to him. The proposal to basically get rid of ATAGI and to have its role subsumed by the PBAC was included in the last budget-that is, the May 2005 budget-without any consultation with, or advice to, ATAGI. This resulted in the immediate resignation of the chair of ATAGI, Professor George Rubin-a man of principle, a man who is prepared to stand up for what he believes in, no matter what political pressure is being put on him. And to this day ATAGI is still without a chair. It concerns us that this is the history of this bill. The history of this bill is not a road paved with good intentions. It is a road paved with very callow politics on the health minister's part. It is the kind behaviour that he is only too famous for in the public domain. The road to this bill has been paved with that sort of ill intent, but bill is here now and we would like to see the government get it in a form where it is going to work. When we were briefed by the Department of Health and Ageing about the National Health Amendment (Immunisation Program) Bill 2005, no information was provided about exactly how ATAGI and the PBAC would work together in the future and how the PBAC would utilise the expertise of ATAGI. ATAGI still has a minimum role but it will not be the decision maker, the way it has been in the past. The legislation provides for the addition of two new people to the PBAC, and it is assumed but not specified that these people will need to have immunisation experience. But there is no reassurance that one of these people would be the chair of ATAGI, which would obviously be one way to ensure the effective integration of information. We are concerned about that, and we would certainly want some reassurances from the minister for health that, whilst his downgrading of ATAGI was no doubt motivated by payback, he will make the right sorts of arrangements to make this work. We are also concerned that the way in which ATAGI has historically looked at the question of vaccines and the way in which the PBAC has historically looked at the question of vaccines is different. ATAGI has always looked at vaccines through the prism of the National Immunisation Program-that is, ATAGI has had a disposition towards the provision of vaccines universally, not necessarily population-wide but certainly to affected populations. It worked through a prism of universal provision to the relevant section of the population. It has had considerations in its mind about public health isof sues, about what is called the ‘herd immunity'-that is, vaccination strategies work best if everybody is vaccinated because that the is the way of eradicating the virus. The world no longer has the scourge of smallpox because of the way in which universal vaccination works. That has been the prism through which ATAGI has made its decisions. On the other hand, the PBAC has historically considered vaccines through the prism of cost and clinical effectiveness, and much more on the basis of putting into place very targeted arrangements for vaccines. It has not had the public health prism in quite the same way that ATAGI has in order to try and work out what role vaccines should be playing and what government funding should flow. So we have concerns about this, and particularly about the way that vaccines will be considered in the future. We are concerned that, with the PBAC now being the principal driver, they be will taking an approach to the listing of vaccines like the approach they have taken to hepatitis A and influenza where they are not looking at them as a broadly based public health measure; they are looking at cost-effectiveness tests. We are concerned that the increasing predisposition of the Howard government-and this has in fact been stated in briefings to us-is to view the future of vaccines not as great new breakthroughs to be made on the universal provision of vaccines as a public health matter but as lifestyle vaccines for highly targeted vaccine populations who require the vaccine because of some particular set of circumstances. We are concerned that we are now at a stage where the Howard government is looking at vaccines through that prism. Over the coming period, this country will be required to make some decisions about the provision of vaccines, which I would say are decisions that ought to be made through the prism of universality and public health measures rather than through the prism of the provision of highly targeted vaccine provision-the so-called lifestyle conditions that then attract a predisposition to needing a vaccine. One example of that-and I think it is a very critical one-is the vaccine that is now under development for the human papilloma virus, which we know is implicated in a number of cancers but most especially cervical cancer. This is a great Australian invention and we should be incredibly proud of it. Every year in Australia, 700 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed and there are about 270 deaths. We know that this vaccine appears to have the potential-when used as a population health measure, viewed through the prism of universality for young people-to eradicate that kind of cancer in our population. Girls growing up in the current generation and girls born this year will never have to think about cervical cancer in the same way the women in this parliament throughout their lives have had to think about it. They will not have to think about risk factors in relation to it because a vaccine will be available. It is a complete medical miracle. If someone had said to me in a casual conversation that viruses can lead to cancer, I would have said-as a non-medical person‘I think that is confusing two concepts: viruses are one thing and cancers are another thing,' which just goes to show how much I know. This virus is the predisposition for a number of cancers, but especially cervical cancer. It does not mean that everybody who has the virus-and, apparently, 75 per cent of people are infected with the virus at some time in their lives-will go on to develop the cancer, but the virus is a precondition to getting the cancer. CSL is obviously the driver of this miracle and the head of CSL, Dr Brian MCNamee, said: We have a responsibility to the Australian public and our regional partners and others to actually get the vaccine out there. I think that sentiment is right. That is an issue that this nation is going to have to process at some point through the prism of population and public health measures-not, in my view, through the prism of asking who is particularly at risk because of lifestyle factors. At some point we will have to confront the question of the provision of this vaccine to at least all girls and, given that this virus is associated with other cancers, possibly to all boys as well. Obviously, that is something that doctors will have to work out for us. But it is a population health measure and it will need to be looked at through that prism. We are concerned that, in downgrading ATAGI and in moving to the PBAC, that focus on population health measures could well be lost. As I said at the start, Labor are not opposing this bill; we are worried about the conduct of the Howard government that brought it here. We believe that it can be made to work by a government that will show a better disposition in dealing with vaccine issuesparticularly the funding of them-than the Howard government has shown at any time during the last three to four years. We need a better performance from the Howard government if we are going to accept its bona fides on providing vital vaccines to the Australian community. I conclude my remarks by moving the second reading amendment, which will be seconded by the member for Shortland. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House expresses its concern that the Government has: (1) consistently ignored the expert advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) with respect to the inclusion of pneumococcal, oral polio and chicken pox vaccines on the National Immunisation Program; (2) failed to consult with ATAGI prior to announcing this change in its role in vaccine approval; (3) failed to publicly state how ATAGI and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee will work together on the approval and listing of vaccines for sation Program and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; and (4) established a mechanism whereby it will be increasingly difficult for new vaccines, such as the vaccine recently announced against cervical cancer, to be listed for universal use”.",97
170,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Ms Hall-I second the amendment.,104
171,Mrs MOYLAN,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I find it extraordinary sitting here listening to the attack by the shadow minister for health on the Howard government. I have been in this place for a fair while longer than the shadow minister has. I remember in 1996, when the Howard government took office, that the then minister for health, Michael Wooldridge, was deeply concerned about the actions of many of the state governmentsmany of them Labor-in allowing the immunisation program across Australia to get into such a terrible state where young children, in particular, were not being immunised at a very high rate. That was deeply concerning. Today we live in a very different and a very mobile environment where children are exposed nationally and internationally and where many young childrensometimes small babies-are admitted at an early age to kindergartens and child-care centres. It puts them at high risk. We have listened to this incredible lecture by the shadow minister for health-who has now left the chamber-about the Howard government's record, but I would put it to the House that the Labor government has had an appalling record on immunisation programs. I now go back to where I really wanted to begin, having got that off my chest. Mr Tanner-Do you feel better?",104
172,Mrs MOYLAN,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Yes, I do. Ms Hall-Bring back Michael the National Immuni- Wooldridge.",104
173,Mrs MOYLAN,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"You have to give Michael Wooldridge credit for having implemented this National Immunisation Program. It was one of the very significant things done by Michael Wooldridge, whom I consider to be a very fine former minister of the Commonwealth. In the 21st century, Australia has been characterised by the near elimination of childhood diseases, such as tetanus, measles, mumps and other diseases which, in the past, caused very high rates of mortality and morbidity in the nation's children. Today, many Australian adults still suffer from the long-term complications of polio. In fact, some people in my electorate do. They were the lucky ones who survived the ravages of this disease, because many families were devastated by the death of young children who managed to get polio. I remember those years very well, and those families were not so fortunate. The dreaded lockjaw, as tetanus was referred to, causes rigidity in its victims and the jaw to lock. The medical fraternity recognises that dying from tetanus is one of the most painful deaths mankind can experience. The bacteria can very simply enter the body through any cut or scratch and it is found naturally in the soil everywhere. It has the most dreadful effect on babies, in particular, whose chances of surviving tetanus are virtually zero. These are some of the reasons why the Commonwealth, under the Howard government, has taken a leading role in ensuring that our country's children are protected against these preventable childhood diseases; but, probably due to the elimination of what, in the past, we referred to as common childhood diseases, they do not occupy or exercise our minds so greatly today. Yet children, as I said, are increasingly vulnerable due to greater mobility, nationally and internationally, and the earlier exposure of very young children and babies in preschools and childcare centres. Our immunisation programs have been substantially successful in protecttransfer ing children and adults from the harmful effects of bacteria that could otherwise lead greater exposure to a long list of lifethreatening illnesses. The health risks of childhood diseases saw immunisation programs administered through infant health centres throughout Australia in the 1940s. As the years pass, we rarely encounter those life-threatening diseases that we saw in the 1950s but not in the 1990s. Childhood immunisation slipped to dangerously low levels in the 1990s, with few states and territories requiring proof of immunisation for entry to school and childcare centres, and immunisation rates for 12month-old children fell to as low as 53 per cent. Allowing immunisation rates to get to that very low level was a serious dereliction of duty and it seriously put our nation's young children at risk. As I said, it was not until the Howard government took office in 1996 that the then minister recognised the serious risk that such a low level of immunisation posed for children. With an emphasis on encouraging parents to have their children immunised, the government increased funding from $13 million in 1996 to $288 million in 2004-5. The National Immunisation Program is a joint Commonwealth, state and territory government initiative through which vaccines are provided free of charge to the Australian community for the prevention of diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, measles, mumps, rubella and hep B. We have now added some vaccines to that list. Prior to the government's announcement in the 2005-6 budget, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation provided advice to the minister on vaccines suitable for funding under the NIP and advice to the National Health and Medical Research Council on the clinical administration of vaccines. That task will now to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. That change requires these to amendments so as to allow the PBAC to consider vaccines for funding under the NIP. The PBAC will retain the ability to assess vaccines for suitability for subsidisation through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and it will provide advice on cost effectiveness, in a transparent and rigorous way, commencing in 2006. The PBAC is a statutory body established under the National Health Act 1953 and it has developed a reputation as a world leader in the rigorous application of evidence based assessment in the development of funding recommendations. The PBAC process rewards innovative medicines that demonstrably improve the health of Australians. I am sure that the issues raised by the shadow minister for health about the human papilloma virus and new vaccinations will be taken into account, as are other vaccines, under this new program. As I said, the process rewards innovative medicines, so I am sure that this will not be any different. ATAGI will continue to be resourced to continue to provide evidence based clinical advice to the National Health and Medical Research Council and advice to the minister on the medical administration of vaccines. This body is well resourced to provide this clinical advice, and this amendment builds on the government's work in previous years to ensure a high level of immunisation cover. With new strains of influenza and other infectious diseases, the need for new vaccines and the development of complex technologies requires the government to examine the cost effectiveness of vaccines. Again, with new strains of influenza, such as bird flu, and other infectious diseases, such as the human papilloma virus, we would be derelict in our duty if we did not look at this. We must look at the effectiveness of vaccines and make sure that the public are getting value for money. I would like to talk for a moment about pneumococcal disease. According to Dr Michael Nissen, a consultant in paediatric infectious diseases and microbiology at the Children's Hospital in Brisbane, pneumococcal disease is a leading cause of meningitis in children under two. He says: Pneumococcal disease is a bacterial infection causes significant illness every year in children, such as meningitis (infection of the lining of brain) … I know about meningitis because my older sister, who is no longer with us, suffered from it as a child. And it has a number of other side effects and serious implications. Dr Nissen says: Pneumococcal bacteria can cause a range of severe illnesses in children such as ear infections and the more serious meningitis. The pneumococcal bug is carried in the nose and throats of healthy adults and children. It can be passed from one child to another in droplets that are released into the air by sneezing and coughing. If they haven't done so already, I would strongly urge parents and caregivers to talk to their GP or healthcare professional about having their children vaccinated. The important thing is that the government did provide in July, in the last year's budget, $178 million to ensure that this could take place: to make sure that all infants born after 1 January 2005 would be vaccinated and protected against this disease as part of the standard newborn vaccination program. The government also implemented a catch-up program for children who were born after 1 January 2003. It is important that any parents who may be listening to this debate tonight note that they have a few months left in which to ensure that they take advantage of the government's offer of free vaccination for children born after 1 January 2003. That vaccination is available in 2005 under the catch-up program. As new threats, such as the Asian bird flu, emerge, it is essential that the government has a sound process for considering new vaccines and ensuring that people are afforded protection from infectious diseases. These amendments will ensure that decisions about vaccine funding are subject to the same high level of scrutiny as PBS medithat cines. These changes will continue to give full effect to the government's commitment the to ensure that Australians continue to access free vaccinations to protect them against vaccine preventable diseases through the National Immunisation Program. An additional $7.8 million will be allocated to the PBAC in 2005-06 to 2008-09 to assist its expanded role. In relation to these changes, I refer to a comment made by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing, Jane Halton. She said: The reality is that cost-benefit analysis is actually a highly specialised activity. ATAGI has done a fantastic job over the last however many years, but the volume of work and the level of technical expertise that is required in respect of vaccines and analysis has become infinitely more complicated in the last few years. Really, that is what the PBAC does par excellence. I think the government's decision is a reflection of what is a new world in this area. So giving that part of the job to the group who have actually demonstrated expertise is a fairly logical conclusion. The government, through its leadership and in consultation with the states and territories, has overseen a world-class immunisation system and is proud of its record of achievement in funding vaccines. I must say too that we are proud of what our scientists have achieved. We have some of the best scientists in the world. I know that our government supports these people in their work and is very proud of what they have done. The state and territory governments are provided funds by the Commonwealth to purchase vaccines under the National Immunisation Program so that they can ensure that the target population can have access to free immunisation programs. While they have worked well in the past, the immunisation advisory structures have not changed since 1998-and things do move on-even though the vaccine costs of immunisation programs have increased. These changes are necessary if the government is to maintain a high-quality, costeffective vaccination program. The government has an obligation to the people of Australia to achieve that. There are differences between vaccines and pharmaceuticals, as vaccines are used mainly for preventing disease whereas pharmaceuticals are used for therapeutic purposes. Vaccine cost modelling will therefore take account of the health benefits to the community that are unique to vaccines. This has been an argument used for why this change should not take place, but I think that, while there are differences, that difference will be taken into account and will take into account the health benefits to the community that are unique to vaccines. The government will ensure that additional members are appointed to the PBAC and its relevant subcommittees who have vaccine specific clinical and economic expertise. In conclusion, I believe the government has made a very strong case for these amendments to the National Immunisation Program. I support these amendments.",104
174,Ms HALL,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I am sure that all members on both sides of this parliament support the National Immunisation Program that exists within Australia. Every member of this House can see the benefit that it has delivered to our nation and every member would be very keen to see the benefits that have been gained continue. I support the second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister to the National Health Amendment (Immunisation Program) Bill 2005. In doing so, I think it is very important to make a couple of points to draw to the attention of the House some of the issues that we have concerns about whilst not wishing to stop the passage of this bill. The bill amends the National Health Act 1953 by transferring funding advisory arrangements for vaccines from the vaccine experts-I emphasise ‘experts'-the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, ATAGI, to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. Also, under this legislation there will be an increase in the size of the PBAC by two members. The legislation provides for the Chair of the PBAC to be a full-time position, something that will be quite beneficial. It provides an additional $7.8 million over four years to the PBAC to expand its role in relation to vaccines. I do have some concerns. Whilst there is going to be the additional $7.8 million over four years for the PBAC-it will result in some savings for the government-I am concerned that this could be a cost-cutting exercise. I am concerned about the motivation of the government in introducing these changes, and I will speak a little more about that later in my speech. I am concerned that these changes are not motivated by good public health policy but, rather, that there is political motivation for these changes. Vaccination, as we all know, is terribly important for disease reduction and disease control. To see this, you only have to look at some of the changes that have taken place over the years with the vaccinations for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio-my own grandfather had polio and was quite disabled by it. There are also measles-how many people have been very badly affected and had residual disabilities as a result of measles? There are mumps, rubella and even chickenpox-what has been seen as being quite a harmless childhood disease takes the lives of 19 young Australians each year. There is also hep B, pneumococcal, and the list goes on and on. In the future there many other vaccines developed that will be used for the prevention of diseases. I mentioned polio earlier. Polio leaves a person with residual disabilities, and in recent times there has been the emergence of the postpolio syndrome. These are all disabilities and diseases that have an impact on our community as a whole and all diseases that have been shown to be avoidable through immunisation and prevention and by making good public health decisions. Prevention is the way of the future. Prevention is much better than cure. It was in 1997 that advice was provided to the government about the National Immunisation Program by ATAGI. It was seen to be a good idea in 1997 that there be an expert body set up to give advice on immunisation. ATAGI was a child of the Howard government, and now I hear members on the other side of this House arguing that this body, which was set up specifically to look at immunisation issues with specific expertise in that area, is no longer good enough. It no longer has the expertise. It can no longer make the recommendations to government. That raises some questions for me. Why has there been this turnabout? Why does the government no longer think that ATAGI, which was established to give advice and make recommendations on the technical and scientific elements of the National Immunisation Program and on funding and policy issues, can do that job? I think there is some politics involved in here, and that makes me very sad because I believe that decisions about immunisation should be made based on population health issues, the issues that determine what is best for our population, what will deliver the best public health outcomes and what is the best decision in the area of community healthnot based on politics. If we go down that track then we are in danger of losing some of will be the benefits that have been gained. The previous speaker in this debate, the member for Pearce, made some comments about the previous health minister, Dr Michael Wooldridge. I know he was very committed to immunisation and I suspect he would be quite concerned about these changes. He would hate to think that the government that he was part of did not have the same commitment to and passion for immunisation that he had and is prepared to slip it across to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, a statutory body established to advise the government on which drugs and medicines should be listed with the PBS. I do not think it is good enough. I really do not. The government argues that the PBAC is a logical choice for the role of providing funding advice on vaccines, since it has developed a reputation as being a world leader in the rigorous application of evidence based assessments of new medications. I still argue that it does not have the expertise that ATAGI has. The intention of the bill is to ensure that the vaccine funding advisory arrangements place emphasis on the cost effectiveness of the assessment. I think it is very important that there is this cost effectiveness aspect to any listing of medications or to any immunisation program, but I feel first and foremost that the issues that need to be considered are those that relate to public health, the best outcome for the community and the best outcome for all the people who we represent in this parliament. I would like to put on record here my concern that the Howard government has consistently ignored advice that it has received from ATAGI and from other experts in these areas. I think that the Howard government is increasingly looking to reduce immunisation costs, and that is where I worry about the cost-effectiveness aspect of the PBAC. At the beginning of my contribution to this debate I mentioned the fact that this will be cost neutral. It will actually lead to a reduction of expenditure by the government, and this is where I start to have concerns about the motivation. The Howard government has a record of ignoring the recommendations of ATAGI. We saw most recently with the pneumococcal, the oral polio and chickenpox vaccines that the government ignored the advice of ATAGI-their experts. The minister for health was not happy with the recommendation made to him by ATAGI, and he sent it back for them to reconsider their advice. Being the experts, the people that know what is best for the Australian people, the body that has first and foremost the concern of population and public health in Australia, they refused to change their recommendation. They knew that the best immunisation for Australians was the oral polio and chickenpox vaccines and that the pneumococcal immunisation was needed. We on this side of the House placed pressure on the government to make a commitment to these vaccinations, and it finally agreed to this. It finally listened to the advice of its experts, and these vaccines are now available through the NIP. I wonder whether or not the downgrading of ATAGI's role in vaccines listing is payback time-payback for not being subservient to the government and for not agreeing to the request of the health minister to back away from their recommendation. I believe there are some serious questions about the motivation for this legislation and the motivation behind these amendments. I believe strongly, and I know that my colleagues on this side of the House believe, that it is imperative that vaccinations continue to be made available to Australians as more vaccines are developed. The decisions about whether or not those vaccines should be provided through the National Immunisation Program should be based purely and simply on public health issues; they should not be based on issues that are developed by the minister for health in some esoteric way or in an attempt to cut the costs of our immunisation program. It is far too important to Australians as a whole. Whilst the intention of this bill, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, is to ensure that the vaccine funding advisory arrangements place emphasis on cost-effective assessment and to provide a transparent and robust framework for evaluating vaccines and making decisions on whether or not to publicly fund them, I have concerns. ATAGI is the body that is best able to make decisions about whether or not the vaccine should be available and what the best vaccine is, and I have concerns that now we are going to get the second best, with the decisions being made by the PBAC. Whilst there are going to be two extra members on that board, I think that it will not be quite the same. ATAGI currently comprises a chairman nominated and endorsed by the Minister for Health and Ageing, who is a member of the NHMRC Health Advisory Committee; the chairman of the National Immunisation Committee; three clinical paediatricians with particular expertise in immunisation; two members with expert immunisation program delivery expertise; a public health physician; a clinical microbiologist; a representative from the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance; a representative from the Australian Division of General Practitioners; a representative from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners; a representative from the Consumers' Health Forum; and a representative from the Department of Health and Ageing. In addition, ATAGI may appoint expert working parties comprising members of ATAGI and other persons nominated by ATAGI or other peak advisory groups with specific expert knowledge to address particular issues. I am not convinced that those people do not have the expertise to make the best decisions about immunisation. I do not believe that there could be any statutory body that would be better placed to make that decision than those I have mentioned here. To go back to what I was speaking about a moment ago in relation to the vaccines that the minister was very slow to list on 5 December 2002, ATAGI advised the then health minister, Senator Patterson, of their recommendations to the government. These recommendations were replacement of the oral polio vaccine with inactivated polio vaccine for infants, introduction of a chickenpox vaccine for children and introduction of the pneumococcal vaccine for infants-very important. The government ignored these recommendations until June 2004, when the minister was forced to introduce these vaccines under the NIP after a strong campaign from us on this side of the House and after ATAGI refused to reconsider its recommendations. ATAGI knew that that was what was best for Australia. It knew that that would deliver the best health outcomes to the people of Australia. That is its role: to evaluate vaccines and determine whether or not they are suitable. The vaccines are now being administered here in Australia and I know that they will deliver outstanding outcomes. My other concern is one that the shadow minister, the member for Lalor, mentioned, and that relates to any new vaccines. The minister's staff, I understand, have indicated that any new vaccines would be for lifestyle conditions and they would not require listing with the NIP. I hope that the PBAC do not agree with what the minister's staff were saying. We have the new cervical cancer vaccine that is designed to give immunity to the human papilloma virus, which causes cervical cancer. I think it should be embraced by the government and not put aside as a lifestyle choice. While supporting this bill, I do have the concerns that I have outlined here to the House. I am concerned that this is motivated more by payback and cost cutting than by good public health policy.",107
175,Mr WOOD,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I stand in support of the National Health Amendment (Immunisation Program) Bill 2005. I must first make a point about something that has been raised by a number of Labor colleagues. I strongly believe that past behaviour predicts future performance. When Labor was last in government in 1995 the immunisation rate was roughly 50 per cent. After great efforts by Dr Michael Wooldridge, it is now over 90 per cent. So while we are in government the public can be assured that we will do everything that can be done to protect the young children of this nation and ensure that they are properly immunised. The aim of the National Health Amendment (Immunisation Program) Bill is to ensure that the National Immunisation Program can be delivered with consistency and transparency. The National Immunisation Program consists of all state governments and the Australian government. Its function is to provide free vaccines to Australians. Currently the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee-the PBAC-provides advice to the Minister for Health and Ageing regarding pharmaceuticals. This role will now be extended to include providing recommendations on which vaccines should be funded through the National Immunisation Program. As science and technology are developing new vaccines at a rapid pace, the PBAC is required to provide analysis of the cost effectiveness of each vaccine before it is funded within the national program. It is essential review the role of the PBAC as the level of government expenditure on vaccines has increased dramatically. The advisory structure has not been reviewed since 1998. The National Immunisation Program must be able to respond to the development of new and more complex vaccines in an efficient and effective manner. This can be done through a revision of the PBAC function. We have not always been proud of our immunisation coverage record. We have had childhood immunisation programs in place since the 1920s, reducing the impact of vaccine-preventable diseases such as nus and diphtheria. However, we have traditionally experienced poor immunisation coverage, prompting a series of national initiatives, beginning with the National Health and Medical Research Council-the NHMRCconvening a panel to review services in 1993. By 1993-94 vaccine-preventable diseases were still occurring in Australia, with large outbreaks of measles and rubella. The only national immunisation coverage data came from a national survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which in 1995 found that 52.1 per cent of children aged zero to six years were fully immunised for age, excluding Hib. The level of full immunisation for the same group from an earlier ABS survey in 1989-90 was similar, at 54.1 per cent. Cases of measles and rubella continued to occur in the 1990s as the level of immunisation coverage remained below the level of 90 to 95 per cent, which is required to interrupt transmission. As a result, a national immunisation strategy was born that set targets for immunisation coverage and control of vaccine-preventable diseases and recommended initiatives to achieve these targets. The National Childhood Immunisation Program began in 1995 and the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register was established by to the federal and state governments in January 1996. Once the coalition came to office in March 1996, efforts were made to build on this foundation to improve Australia's poor record of immunisation. In 1997 the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Michael Wooldridge, initiated a seven-point plan to increase the proportion of fully immunised children in Australia. The plan included monetary incentives, commencing in mid1998, for parents whose children received child-care assistance payments and incentives for GPs to fully immunise children. This was a fantastic initiative by the minister polio, teta- which showed great vision. Since that time the coalition's commitment to immunisation has been exceptional, bringing our immunisation system to levels which we can be proud of. Immunisation coverage rates for 12-month-old children have been higher than 90 per cent for the last five years. We have also seen a decrease in the number of cases of diseases which can be prevented through vaccination. These statistics are a result of the coalition's commitment to protect its citizens from diseasewhich it has done through record levels of funding. In 1996 the federal government spent $13 million a year on vaccines, compared to $288 million in the 2004-05 period. This represents a 22-fold increase. The coalition government is committed to ensuring that Australians are receiving immunisation through existing programs as well as new programs. At the beginning of 2005 a new universal childhood pneumococcal vaccine program began to provide free pneumococcal conjugate vaccine at the ages of two, four and six months for all children born on or after 1 January 2005. The program also includes a catch-up component. All children born from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2004 are eligible for free vaccines during 2005. The pneumococcal disease can lead to an infection around the brain, blood infection, pneumonia and middle ear infection. It is transmitted through coughing and sneezing or through contact with infected articles. It can be carried through the throat and nose. Initial signs of infection in children can include fever, refusal to eat, and the child ing unwell. Children may also become quiet or continually distressed. Older children may have puffy eyes and an aversion to bright light. In 2003 the National Immunisation Program implemented a program to provide free meningococcal C immunisation for those aged between 12 months and 19 years. Meningococcal is an uncommon but lifethreatening infection. It is caused by bacteria that live in the throat. About 10 per cent of our community has these bacteria at any given time. Not all carriers become sick. The bacteria spread through coughing and sneezing, but it is not easy to become infected as the bacteria do not live long outside body. Symptoms include sudden fever, headaches, drowsiness, stiff joints and vomiting. In children signs to watch for include a highpitched moaning cry, difficulty waking the baby, blotchy skin or refusal to eat. I will just go back to the issue of meningococcal C. I can convey a story from my time in my previous role in the Victorian Police Force. One day a young female constable was coming to work. She had to work the van shift. On the way to work she became ill and decided that she needed to head directly to the hospital. When she got to the hospital the doctors took her straight into casualty. They gave her two hours to live as she had meningococcal C. Luckily for her she survived but she spent six months in hospital. That is how life-threatening this can be for a 25-year-old, let alone a young child. Earlier this year the Minister for Health and Ageing announced funding for a new program to provide free chickenpox vaccines for children at 18 months of age and for children aged 10 to 13 years who have not been vaccinated or who have not had the disease. Chickenpox is common among children, belookginning suddenly with fever, headache, fatigue and feeling itchy followed by a rash which turns into scabs over a few days. The disease can cause serious complications such as skin infections, pneumonia, and inflammation of the brain-and in some cases the illness can be fatal. It is easily transmitted by children and if not vaccinated against the disease, children are likely to contract it at some stage. Approximately eight to 10 varicella-related deaths are recorded each year. That may surprise people. Over 40 per cent of these deaths occur in people aged 65 years and over. The elimination of measles was targeted by the coalition and driven by the then Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Michael Wooldridge, as part of Immunise Australia: the seven point plan. Initiatives which were developed to combat measles included the sustained, optimal measles vaccination at twelve months and four years of age; enhanced measles surveillance and reporting; and a capacity and preparedness for a rapid control response to measles cases. The coalition also announced additional funding of $20 million to fund measles, mumps and rubella vaccination for young adults between 18 and 30 years of age as they proved to be a high risk category. The coalition is not only committed to the immunisation of our infants; the government has implemented programs to protect our seniors as well. Programs for older Australians-such as the National Pneumococcal Vaccination Program for Older Australians and the national influenza vaccine program-allow free vaccines for those aged 65 years and older. The National Indigenous Pneumococcal and Influenza Immunisation Program also provides support for our Indigenous community as the pneumococcal rates are highest among Indigenous children. These programs are only some of the government's commitments to protecting the health of Australians. Our national immunisation policy is important as it directly impacts on our local constituents. The 2001 census indicates that around 7.4 per cent of La Trobe residents are under four years of age and require protection from serious disease. On Monday, 29 August this year I visited some of these tiny residents at the Belgrave South Maternal Health Centre. It was also a good opportunity to launch La Trobe's growth chart, which highlights the importance of immunisation. The chart includes a hotline and, most importantly, will raise the awareness of immunisation throughout the electorate. There is also a website that provides details of new vaccinations that are available and a link to the Australian Immunisation Handbook, the bible of immunisation information. This web site is essential in helping new parents come to terms with how best to protect their children in the early stages of their development. There is a question and answer section which covers most questions asked by parents regarding immunisation facts. The Belgrave South Maternal Health Centre is run by the Shire of Yarra Ranges, which covers a substantial part of my electorate of La Trobe. Present at the launch of the growth chart were the Maternal and Child Health Coordinator, Jenny Fisher, and maternal and child-care nurse, Ann Ferguson. I greatly appreciated their hospitality on the day. They were joined by David Hodgett, Mayor of the Shire of Yarra Ranges, whom I can now congratulate as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Kilsyth, and local resident Sue MCMillan. Kylie Henry, mother of baby Alysha Jade, was present to talk with me about early childhood development issues and immunisation. Baby Alysha also made her public debut in my local newsletter, and I am sure she will be very proud of that in the future. The maternal and child-care nurse contacts every single parent associated with the maternal health centre to discuss issues regarding immunisation. These parents learn why immunisation is important, where it is performed, the latest research about immunisation, factual information and about the different types of immunisation. These parents are helped through this process by the maternal health centre from when the child is three weeks old up until the 12-week mark. These are the important weeks for immunisation, and I strongly encourage all parents to ensure that they follow through the entire immunisation process. I believe that the information and guidance provided by the maternal health centre is invaluable for local parents, particularly first-time parents who have not yet gone through the process of immunisation. As we can see, the coalition government inherited a poor record on immunisation when we came to office, which had allowed our children to contract vaccine-preventable diseases. Since the coalition took up the challenge to improve this record, we have seen immense success in protecting Australians from disease, and I am sure that while we are in government this great work will continue. Therefore, I strongly recommend this bill.",110
176,Ms LIVERMORE,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"There is no doubt, as all speakers in this debate have attested to, that immunisation is an important aspect of our health care system. As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure, and being immunised is an important safeguard against the world's worse diseases. There is no better protection that we can give our children than immunising them against disease. All parents should have access to vaccinations to protect against diseases that can be potentially fatal for children. Probably the best example of the immense value of immunisation is provided by looking at polio and smallpox. At its peak, polio, a debilitating and life-altering disease, infected 39.1 people for every 100,000 head of population. Australia has not had a case of polio since 1986 and was listed as polio free in 2000. Similarly smallpox was one of the world's most feared diseases until a highly successful immunisation program throughout the world saw the World Health Organisation announce the eradication of that disease in 1979. The eradication of these diseases is a great illustration of the value of an effective immunisation program. So we know that immunisation works, but we can never become complacent and assume that the job is done. The National Health and Medical Research Council stated in their 1993 National Immunisation Strategy that, in 1991, 2,352 cases of vaccine preventable diseases were reported in Australia. The report went on to say that, between 1980 and 1990, 86 Australian children died from diseases that could have been prevented with the appropriate vaccine. Thankfully, today the figures are much lower. But it needs to be stressed that in a country such as Australia death rates from vaccine preventable diseases should be zero. This is the only acceptable target. We have seen before that keeping immunisation rates up to target levels requires constant vigilance by government. The 1990s saw a decline in the number of children who were being fully immunised against all of the then recognised diseases. The national health survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics between 1989 and 1990 found that only 53 per cent of children aged between zero and four years were fully immunised, and that 20 per cent were either totally their unimmunised or their immunisation status was unknown. Recognising that these figures were completely unacceptable in a country such as Australia, the then Labor federal government introduced the National Immunisation Strategy. The National Immunisation Strategy was aimed at increasing the number of immunised children in Australia, leading to better health outcomes for these children and a subsequent saving on health expenditure caused by a reduction in the number of people at risk of contracting serious but preventable diseases. Inadequate immunisation rates account for the sporadic number of disease outbreaks, including measles, that occur from time to time. In response to that and in order to further increase the immunisation rate the Howard government attempted to build upon the National Immunisation Strategy and introduced a seven point plan in 1997. This plan involved offering incentives for parents and general practitioners to ensure that children were vaccinated, creating awareness programs and increasing funding for education and research. I believe that what is lacking in that seven point plan is a truly effective education campaign aimed at dismissing the myths surrounding the dangers of immunisation. This is an important aspect of any policy regarding immunisation, because the full value of immunisation programs is lost if immunisation is not universal. Immunisation programs should target all Australians in an effort to ensure universal coverage. Immunisation has been shown to be a great preventive tool, but it is only effective if everyone is being vaccinated. It is good to see that immunisation rates have improved over the last decade, to the point where over 90 per cent of 12-month-old children are immunised. This is a positive step which is to be lauded, but that does not mean that we can rest on our laurels and allow the matter to continue of its own accord. Governments need to be continually educating the public on the necessity of vaccination, and they need to keep up to date as far as providing publicly funded immunisation as vaccines become available for those diseases identified as posing a risk to the population or tain sections of it. Immunisation programs within Indigenous communities is another area that requires constant monitoring from government. Historically, levels of immunisation in Indigenous communities have been amongst the lowest in Australia. In 1993 the National Health and Medical Research Council offered several suggestions to improve immunisation rates in the Indigenous community. These suggestions included placing immunisation services near public transport and in easily identifiable places, and employing Indigenous health workers to overcome the cultural divide. Every effort to ensure that immunisation rates are as high as they can possibly be should be made with the understanding that money spent now will result in long-term savings to government and, of course, will contribute to improving the health and life outcomes of our Indigenous people. Other groups with historically lower immunisation rates are children from families with low incomes, children with one or more unemployed parent, children whose parents lack postsecondary education, children of single parents, children of recently arrived migrants and those children living in rural and remote areas. This information reinforces the need for publicly funded immunisation programs and for a greater effort in ensuring that these sections of the community are able to access vaccinations. Both the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners place great emphasis on the cost benefit of universal immunisation. Both groups emphatically state that the cost of vaccination is well worth it, especially considering the long-term costs of not vaccinating. While this cost has not been exactly quantified, when considering ongoing medical costs, the costs involved in carcering for children born with birth defects caused by rubella, the learning impairment costs associated with measles and the loss of productivity from parents being forced to miss work to care for sick children, it becomes apparent that these costs are quite considerable and worth avoiding on many levels. The National Health Amendment (Immunisation Program) Bill 2005 currently before us does not address these issues, however. It instead focuses on reducing the costs to the government of providing vaccinations. The emphasis on reducing the costs of the immunisation program does seem to drive the government's approach in this important area of public health policy. We have seen this in the government's shameful reluctance to protect our children when it initially refused to fund the pneumococcal vaccine. Back in September 2002 the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advised the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Kay Patterson, that the government should fund, among other vaccines, the pneumococcal vaccine. The other vaccines that ATAGI recommended should be funded at that time were the injectable polio and chickenpox vaccines. The government steadfastly ignored that independent, scientific advice for almost two years. Within that time the National Health and Medical Research Council backed up the ATAGI's advice to the government with its own recommendation regarding the funding of those same three vaccines: chickenpox, polio and pneumococcal. The 2004 budget came and went and there was still no announcement from Minister Abbott about funding for vaccines. It was only in June 2004, following our promise that a Labor government would fund those vital vaccines, that the government was forced into its partial backflip when it announced that the pneumococcal vaccine would be funded. No-one should forget that it was only after Labor's relentless pursuit this issue that the government amended its original decision and made funding available for this lifesaving vaccine. Even then, the government decided only to fund the vaccine until 2007. We should also not forget that the government's refusal to fund the vaccine was contrary to the advice of its own technical advisory group-the expert group charged with providing independent advice on the technical and scientific elements of the National Immunisation Program. Shamed into a pre-election backflip, the government finally promised to fund the vaccine, only to limit funding for that immunisation program to two years. We still have no indication from the government as to what will happen beyond that time limit when it expires in 2007. That announcement was made in June 2004. After ignoring the ATAGI's advice on pneumococcal, polio and chickenpox vaccines since 2002, the minister made that partial backflip with respect to pneumococcal vaccine but still insisted that ATAGI reconsider its recommendation on the other two vaccines. It was not until March this year that the Minister for Health and Ageing finally accepted the advice of the ATAGI and, with nowhere left to hide on this matter, was forced to list the injectable polio and chickenpox vaccines on the National Immunisation Program. This announcement by the minister came 2½ years after the government first received expert advice on the importance of making those vaccines available on the NIP. It came almost a year after Labor had taken the issue right up to the government by promising to fund all three vaccines. In the period during which the minister ignored the advice of his own advisory group, 19 Australians died and 3,300 were hospitalised as a result of chickenpox-a disease which is preventable by vaccine and which the government knew was a priority for inclusion on the National Immunisation Proof gram. This is yet another example of this government's mismanagement of health care in Australia-a case of saving money when it should be all about saving lives. The National Health Amendment (Immunisation Program) Bill 2005 has the stated aim: ... to amend the National Health Act 1953 ... to improve vaccine funding advisory arrangements for the ... National Immunisation Program. This will be done by expanding the role of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to include evaluating the cost effectiveness of new vaccines under the National Immunisation Program-a role which was previously performed by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. The explanatory memorandum that accompanies this bill states that the changes in the bill: ... provide for a stronger focus on costeffectiveness assessment by utilising ... the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) for vaccine funding recommendations. It is this statement that concerns me. After all, it has been this government which has gone looking for ways to minimise costs through the PBS and has been actively pursuing opportunities to shift the costs of medicines to the consumer. We have seen this through the government's 30 per cent PBS copayment. While the cost effectiveness of a treatment always has to be considered, and indeed was part of the criteria used by the ATAGI, the value to Australia of immunisation cannot be measured simply in economic terms, as this government would have us believe. An effective immunisation program protects Australians from long-term health issues, which has the flow-on effect of then assisting the economy through a reduction in health expenditure-not the other way around. Reducing spending on preventive measures now just means that the ultimate long-term outcome will be future governments having to shell out more and more in health expenditure to hospitals to treat vaccine preventable diseases. Imagine if this thinking had been applied to polio and smallpox vaccines 50 years ago. Debate interrupted. NA",113
177,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Alternative Health Industry",117
178,Ms HALL,ADJOURNMENT,"Shortland) (9.00 pm)Tonight I would like to bring to the attention of the House a matter of national importance. Governments at all levels have failed to effectively address the alternative health industry, which is putting people's lives at risk allowing charlatans and shysters to prey upon them when they are at their most vulnerable. This failure has allowed the employment of dubious treatments, procedures and prescriptions of unidentifiable medication. Throughout Australia there is more than $2 billion a year spent on alternative health products and procedures. That figure is from a New South Wales Health media release in November 2002. Along with the increase in spending on alternative medicines and procedures is the increase in people who are preying on the sick and most vulnerable in our society by offering cures that are of questionable medical benefit to the desperate person who is seeking a treatment of last resort. Very little progress has been made in registering or verifying the qualifications of alternative medicine practitioners. Simply drafting laws for New South Wales, Victoria or Queensland alone will not overcome the problem. A person would simply move interstate and carry on business as usual. There is a good case for legislative reform on a national basis that could involve governments at federal, state and territory level. In other words, the only way to stop the exploitation of sick and vulnerable people seeking hope where there is none is for the federal government to legislate, take the lead and stop passing the buck to the states, as this is an issue of national importance requiring national leadership. Greg Ray from the Newcastle Herald and the Hon. Richard Face, the former state member for Charlestown, have been fighting to have this issue addressed and have highlighted a dreadful litany of fraud and deceit that is hurting the sickest and most vulnerable in our communities. The husband of a constituent of mine, Mrs Marilyn Christie of and Dudley, died in May 2005 following a fight with cancer. Mrs Christie's husband was re Health Clinic by another person who was suffering from cancer and who has subsequently died. Mrs Christie and her husband became suspicious when her husband failed to respond to the treatment and decided to research the medicines. Their research revealed that the medicines appeared to be unrecognisable and unregistered medication. Extensive searches by the Newcastle Herald and by a pharmacology expert at the University of Newcastle have failed to discover any reference in medical or therapeutic literature to the medications provided by Mr Perrett. It is unknown as to whether his medication are vitamins, veterinary products or even medications that can mask the signs of the diseases they are supposed to treatfor instance, hormone therapy to treat prostate cancer masks the disease-thereby placing the person at greater risk. Paul Perrett was a serial offender and had a very dubious, dark history with questionable qualifications. Two of the most outlandish treatments he employed were the injection of urine into the veins of those unsuspecting, trusting people who sought his help and the use of peroxide drips. He portrayed himself as a person born in China, cured of childhood leukaemia by a Chinese herbalist, highly educated in the area of naturopathic medicine, widely travelled and a recipient of research grants. The fact is that he was born in Maitland, had a history of fraud and larceny and has spent two stints in jail for his fraudulent actions. He is hardly the type of person in whose hands you would be prepared to place your life. His registration with the Australian natural medicine society was based on fraud, not fact, and this registration has enabled those unfortunate people he has treated to claim money from their health funds which, in turn, has given him legitimacy. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. It is time for the federal government to show leadership. I am so concerned about what is happening that today I have written to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing requesting that the committee conduct an inquiry into the regulation of the natural health and alternative health industry. It is time to protect the people of Australia and the reputable natural health practitioners in our country. It is time for action, not buck-passing. A whole-ofgovernment approach is needed. South West Rocks Heritage Committee",117
179,Mr HARTSUYKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Friday I had the opportunity to meet with a group of very special people in South West Rocks. The South West Rocks Heritage Committee invited me to meet with them at a site of great historical significance in Ocean Street. The site comprises a pilot station, an adjoining garage and two boatman's cottages. The purpose of my meeting with the heritage committee was to discuss their concerns over a huge increase in the annual rent by the New South Wales state government and the subsequent decision by the Kempsey Shire Council not to renew the leases on the buildings. The site has been substantially improved through the dedicated efforts of volunteers. The buildings currently house a museum, an art gallery and a tourism information centre manned by volunteers who provide an invaluable service to both the local community and visitors to the South West Rocks area. During the visit, I also had the opportunity to meet with a group of senior citizens who make toys, sell them and donate the funds raised. This group of men work in the garage which adjoins the pilot station, and their work and commitment supports the local senior citizens group. The course of events which led to last Friday's meeting has highlighted the worse aspects of poor public policy. Essentially, we have a state government which has mismanaged the windfall it has received from additional GST revenues and stamp duty receipts. That same government not only is in financial difficulty but can now claim the mantle of being morally bankrupt as well. With the growth in the New South Wales government's bureaucracy at an all-time high, the Iemma government has ignored the opportunity to address its own inefficiency and chosen to target volunteers who are the backbone of local regional communities. The New South Wales Minister for Lands, Tony Kelly, has informed the leaseholder, the Kempsey Shire Council, that the annual rent on just one of the buildings, known as Boatman's Cottage No. 2, will rise from $350 per year to $12,075 per annum. Let me say that again: it is going to go up from $350 a year to $12,075. The Kempsey Shire Council has made it clear to my office that these rentals will to be met by the community, not by the council. Further, a report from Kempsey Shire Council's director of shire services, dated 5 September, claims that the council can further expect rentals to increase to $36,000 once the Department of Lands has completed a full assessment of all the buildings on the site. The increase in the annual rentals could not have come at a worse time for all the volunteers associated with the facilities on Ocean Street. The rent rises come hard on the heels of a risk assessment of the garage adjacent to the pilot station where the toy makers work. The assessment has identified occupational health and safety issues which, unless addressed, will effectively close the current operation down. I would like to publicly acknowledge the good work of these toy makers-men who are enjoying their retirement by making wooden toys and raising funds for their community. Col Laverty, Les Thomas, Bert Searle, Don Cook, Henry Thurgood, Frank Lee and Bill Jackson are all doing an outstanding job. In my view, we should be encouraging this community work, not penalising those who have taken the initiative for the common good. Therefore, every effort should be made to ensure that they can continue their voluntary contribution. Placing a financial impost on those who are freely giving their time for the benefit of others is morally wrong, economically unsustainable and socially detrimental to the goodwill of the local community. Volunteers for the arts and crafts association, the historical society and the tourist information centre will also lose out as a result of the proposed rental hike. All of these organisations, as well as the pilot station and Boatman's Cottage, are a part of the social fabric of South West Rocks. That is why I have taken the opportunity to write to the have Mayor of Kempsey Shire Council, Janet Hayes, to seek the council's commitment to ensuring these facilities are protected and the work of the volunteers is allowed to continue. I have been informed that the council has met with the New South Wales Minister for Lands, Mr Kelly, to discuss the situation. I look forward to the New South Wales government recognising their own morally reprehensible position. What is going on here is an attack on the spirit of voluntary work and the benefits which we all derive from such substantial community goodwill. Breast Cancer Awareness",118
180,Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I want to speak on the very important issue of breast cancer, as October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Whilst there have been improvements in breast cancer awareness programs and treatments, there is still lots of work to be done if we are to successfully continue the fight against this disease that affects so many Australian families. A recently released survey by the National Breast Cancer Centre uncovered some very disturbing findings about the lack of knowledge women had of this disease-a lack of knowledge which in some cases could cost women their lives. The survey of 3,000 women across Australia aged between 30 and 69 found that only half the women surveyed knew that a woman's risk of developing breast cancer increases as she gets older; 28 per cent of women mistakenly thought a family history of breast cancer on their father's side was an important risk factor; one in three women mistakenly thought that alcohol posed no risk; one in four mistakenly thought being overweight posed no risk; 42 per cent of women mistakenly rated stress as a big risk factor; and, finally, one in three women mistakenly considered a bump to the breast as a big risk factor. More disturbing were the findings that one in three women who noticed a change in their breast waited more than a month before seeking medical advice and another 23 per cent-an alarmingly high number-who found changes did not see a doctor at all. Given that 50 per cent of breast cancers are found as a result of a change in the breast, is particularly important that women know what changes to look out for and seek medical advice as soon as possible. It is clear from these survey results that, despite the excellent work done by all who are associated with breast cancer research and awareness, the myths and misconceptions around breast cancer need to be further clarified and the importance of early detection must be constantly reiterated. To do any less is simply putting women's lives unnecessarily at risk. One thing that is certain with breast cancer is that early detection provides the best chance for a woman's survival. About 90 per cent of women whose cancer is diagnosed before it has spread outside the breast will alive five years later. However, if the cancer is not detected early and has already spread to other parts of the body before diagnosis, only about 20 per cent of those women will survive for five years. It is encouraging to note that breast screening is now available free of charge to all women over 40. However, more needs to be done to encourage more women and, indeed, younger women to participate in screening programs because, along with the misconceptions regarding breast cancer, there is still a great reluctance by many women, particularly women of ethnic backgrounds, to undergo a mammogram test. We need to turn our minds to how this issue can be better addressed. I was very pleased to read last week that an education campaign was launched by the National Breast Cancer Centre, who have developed a range of resources to inform women of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds about breast cancer symptoms and the importance of early detection and to assist women diagnosed with breast cancer to make better decisions about treatit ment and support. This information is translated into Chinese, Vietnamese, Greek, Italian and Arabic languages. It is a bid to provide culturally appropriate and potentially life-saving information to women in their own language. Given that one in 11 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, it is vital we ensure that all Australian women, especially those of non-English-speaking backgrounds, have access to accurate information so as to make informed decisions about their health and, if necessary, about appropriate treatment and care. On behalf of the many women, particularly the women of my electorate, whose lives and whose families' lives have been affected by this disease, I encourage the govbe ernment to increase resources for the awareness of breast cancer and the importance of early detection. With this month being Breast Cancer Awareness Month, it would be the perfect time for the government to participate in this awareness program, provide greater assistance to address the existing misconceptions and further promote early detection as the best means of saving the lives of the many Australian women who are diagnosed with this disease on an annual basis and who would have a far better chance of survival if detection occurred at the earliest possible time. Corporate Governance",119
181,Mr FAWCETT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to talk about governance. One of the good things that come out of the modern focus on governance is the concept of corporate citizenship that companies need to display in our society. Good citizenship by companies means that they consider what are known as ‘triple bottom lines'-they consider not only profit and the environment but also what they can add to the community as opposed to just taking from the community. I think people would be quite dismayed to think of a company that was going to implement something that could cost the community, damage the community, incite violence and incite a desire in young people to act contrary to civic standards. I draw the attention of the House to a video game that has been marketed by Atari in Australia and that is due for release in November this year. This is a game where you can play as ‘Trane', a graffiti artist. The aims of the game are to ‘risk your life battling city authorities' as you attempt to get more and more graffiti up onto walls. It is a ‘Groundbreaking graffiti gameplay system, designed to sharpen your skills', using a range of tools such as aerosols, rollers, markers, wheat paste, stickers and stencils. It has a ‘unique intuition system', allowing you to find the best places to put graffiti. It actually gives examples: ‘Authentic tags from more than 50 real-life graffiti artists'. It teaches you ing skills and other things as you evade the city police and authorities. Some people would say that this is just a game and that there is no concern about that. But, as we all know, the reality is that films, games, even books can inspire young people and encourage them into taking certain courses of action. If that were not so, we would not have advertising. We know from studies on the impact of violent videos and other films that they cause some people-not all-to take these courses of action. Is it a problem? In the electorate of Wakefield, just one of the council areas that I represent, the City of Playford, pays approximately $92,000 every year to eradicate the problem of graffiti. It has some 60 volunteers-they are not paid staff; that money does not cover paid staff-who work to remove the impacts of graffiti from around the city. About 35,840 tags were removed last year. In 2004-05, that represents a 39 per cent increase in the amount of graffiti. I believe it is important to bring to the attention of the House the fact that companies do have an obligation to consider when marketing products not just their profit but also their impact. This product is due for release in November. I call upon Atari, its CEO and its board of management, to consider their role as a corporate citizen in Australia and whether they wish to contribute to the high and rising costs and social damage, as a result of the disfiguration-the damage to small business and public property-that graffiti causes. I challenge them to consider that carefully and to take appropriate decisions to support the community, to be a good corporate citizen and not to just push this product because it adds to the bottom line of profit. Safeguards Against Viruses",121
182,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"The fightMinister for Health and Ageing has recently published his proposals for responding to an epidemic of a potentially lethal influenza virus in Australia. What the minister apparently intends is that the government will release a limited amount of antiviral drugs to treat those infected in the first wave of an epidemic and to withhold the bulk of the four million doses stockpiled for ‘essential workers'. Those four million doses will be enough to protect only about 70,000 people for up to eight weeks-the period recommended by American experts for protecting people against infection during an epidemic. The risk to public health that this virus poses is well understood. In 1918 and 1919, the Spanish flu killed an estimated 20 million to 40 million people world-wide-up to six times as many as were killed in World War I. For many years, the great mystery of the 1918-1919 Spanish flu had been its virulence. In 2001, Dr Mark Gibbs, Mr John Armstrong and Professor Adrian Gibbs, at the Australian National University, used tissue samples preserved from victims of that pandemic to show that the Spanish flu virus was a hybrid produced from parts of two other influenza viruses in a process called recombination. Their analysis indicated that one of the two progenitors of the Spanish flu virus was an influenza strain that probably infected pigs. In a warning, Dr Gibbs said: Recombination has not been detected before within the genes of the virus. Now the possibility that current strains may recombine needs to be investigated as new recombinant viruses may pose a threat. We may have discovered part of the reason for the extreme virulence of the 1918 Spanish Flu virus. More recently, scientists working at the United States Centre for Disease Control have determined that it is also possible that the Spanish flu was a bird flu that infected people directly. Until recently, the great fear has been that an avian flu virus could recombine with a human influenza virus. However, this latest discovery shows that a direct transfer from birds to humans is also possible. There are two effective means of treating infections of new influenza viruses. The first is vaccination. This is a time-consuming process and is only possible if the virus can be cultured and transformed into a vaccine. The second is the administration of antiviral drugs that block viral reproduction. This means does not rely upon the manufacture of virus-specific vaccines. These drugs can be stockpiled in advance of a possible epidemic. Professor Graeme Laver, the Australian molecular biologist who developed these antiviral drugs, is highly critical of the minister for health's plans for withholding supplies for essential service workers. Professor Laver said recently that the government's plan was madness, and a waste of resources that could lead to panic. He said: The strategy is totally wrong: theythe antiviral drugsshould be available for people to get quickly. Imagine if one of your children develops fever and aches and pains and you know the bird flu is around. You will want that drug now but if it is all locked up ... In the event of an outbreak of a lethal flu, under the government's current plans the public are expected to wait for weeks or months while a vaccine is developed to combat the new virus. It is not as if alternative strategies for combating a new influenza pandemic do not exist. In 2004 workers at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, Atlanta, showed that the most effective means of responding to an outbreak would be to rapidly administer prophylactic doses of antiviral drugs to close contacts of suspected influenza cases. They showed that, for a virus similar to the Asian flu of 1957-1958, the influenza illness attack rate was 33 per cent of the untreated population, while targeted antiviral prophylaxis reduced the illness attack rate to two per cent. The mortality rate for the victims of Spanish flu was between 2.5 per cent and five per cent. Were these figures to be translated into 33 per cent Australian population, the worse case would be between 165,000 and 330,000 fatalities. Is this the sort of mortality the minister for health is prepared to accept to ensure that ‘essential service workers' are protected? Workplace Relations",121
183,Mr BARRESI,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the fundamental inadequacies of the ALP and the ACTU and their campaign against the government's workplace relations changes. The arguments against the changes have been built on outdated class warfare, short-sightedness, fear and manipulation which have exploited Australian workers. Recent literature distributed by several key unions and opposition members of this parliament has been misleading and ill informed. Against such a deliberately misleading campaign by the union movement, it is important that the government counter it with its own information. Such a misleading campaign has been particularly evident within my own electorate of Deakin, where the ACTU are currently running a pilot community campaign against the proposed new workplace relations changes. They boastfully proclaim that the trial project will commence in Deakin and, based on its success, will then be taken elsewhere in Australia. There are two key reasons why the ACTU is initially targeting Deakin. Firstly, and not surprisingly, it is still the most marginal Liberal held seat in Victoria and they believe they have a real chance of unseating the sitting member-me. That in itself is of little concern to me, as I am used to batting back every self-proclaimed minority interest group, particularly around election time. More significantly, however, the ACTU also has the assistance of compliant Labor councillors in the Whitehorse City Council. of the The conduct of this campaign to date has demonstrated the true stripes of the council's six ALP councillors, in particular the Labor mayor, Councillor George Droutsas. To date, the ACTU President, Sharan Burrow, has held two public meetings in Nunawading to coordinate the Deakin campaign. Both of these meetings were held on council premises. I have been informed that, at the initial meeting, Ms Burrow outlined how the local media will be manipulated to assist in achieving the union movement's principal political objective of unseating the local Liberal member. This clearly shows that the campaign of the ACTU has nothing to do with workers' rights. This is a political campaign, not a campaign about the welfare and prosperity of Australian workers. Interestingly, the ACTU's second meeting was at a function for the Mitcham branch of the ALP. The contact person for this function was the Whitehorse Labor Mayor, George Droutsas, who is also the President of the ALP's Deakin Electorate Council. Fellow office-bearers on the council include fellow Labor councillor Hayley Weller and the state Labor member for Mitcham, Tony Robinson. This campaign has so far underlined that the ACTU and the ALP are once again working hand in glove in playing politics. That fact was reinforced just last weekend at the Whitehorse Spring Festival. While it is unremarkable to see representatives of the Australian Services Union and the Electrical Trades Union distributing their material at such a festival, what was interesting was their location. Whitehorse residents could be completely forgiven for wondering just what was going on. While the literature belonged to the ACTU, the stall from which it was distributed belonged to none other than the Labor member for Chisholm, Anna Burke, who herself has links to the ASU. Mr Beazley complains that the federal government is aggressively advertising workplace relations reforms. It would suit the Leader of the Opposition and the ALP for this campaign to take place because the campaign is being run totally by their union comrades. On top of this, their campaign is being financed through the hard-earned union fees of workers who often do not have any say in how their money is spent. Since 1996 the ASU-Ms Burke's union-has pumped over $2,187,000 into the coffers of the Labor Party, so making available a stand paid for by the Australian taxpayer is a small return for the distribution union material. The members on the opposite side of the House and the entire ALP structure are shackled to the interests of the union movement, which has seen millions of dollars poured into its coffers. The residents of Whitehorse deserve to know just whom their elected representatives seek to represent and who is paying for what. While that situation definitely applies to federal representatives, it also applies to local councillors. On this occasion we need to know where the resources, the facilities of the council and the ratepayer funded allowances to its Labor councillors are being used for a politically motivated campaign. The whole exercise has little to do with the employment and the economic security of Australian workers. It has more to do with positioning the ALP for the coming council and future election campaigns. (Time expired) Workplace Relations  invited to join this adjournment debate through the remarks of the honourable member for Deakin. He was complaining about where the funds were coming from for the trade union campaign against the proposed industrial relations reforms. It is very clear where they are coming from; they are coming from the workers. The ACTU and the unions in New South Wales are spending a lot of money, unlike the government who are spending tens of millions of dollars on an advertising campaign that they are getting going. Mr Speaker, I am sure you are not aware, but the biggest advertiser in Australia is not a state government, it is not the collection of state governments-it is the federal government.
