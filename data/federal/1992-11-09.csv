1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Leo MCLeay) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA Victoria: Borrowings Mr RElm-My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer him to the draft letter mentioned by the Secretary to the Treasury yesterday and received from the Victorian Treasurer seeking a special addition to Victoria's. Government members-Boring!",10
2,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And we will keep on it until we get some answers from you-seeking a special addition to Victoria's global borrowing limits to retrospectively cover the $1.26 billion already borrowed. Do you deny that that letter acknowledged the Victorian breach of the global borrowing limits?,10
3,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, isn't it extraordinary. Here we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who was throwing parties last Thursday night because of the great gaffe which he claimed we had created in turning the GST into an iss.ue. It was interesting, and I am sure my colleagues would have observed that whilst the empty headed Deputy Leader over there was guffawing last ThursdayMr Beale-Hey, cut that out.",10

9,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If he thinks it was such an advantage for him, why is he not driving home that advantage to us today? What the honourable member is doing is apparently trying to make more of this issue, which everyone knows is an absolute dead duck. What the SecretaryMr Reith-I raise a point of order. Under the terms of standing order 145, the question of relevance, the Treasurer is not entitled to explore my motives in asking the question. He is simply to answer the question.",10
10,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. Mr Reith---.,. You should require him to do so accordingly.",10
11,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The Treasurer will answer the question.,10
12,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As you are well aware, the first occasion on which the Treasury was aware of this change in the borrowing occurred on 17 June. At that meeting, the representatives of the Victorian Treasury passed across a draft letter, undated, unsigned. It was a try-on. What the letter purported to say was: Victoria suggests that for Loan Council purposes, the accumulated deficits be treated as temporary purpose borrowings outside the global limit, similar to temporary purpose borrowings within the year. In other words, they were asking us, the Commonwealth, to ratify what they had done. It was made perfectly clear to the Victorian officials that neither would the Treasury nor, they speculated, would I be involved in such a ratification. That simply confirms what the Government has said all along, that the Victorians believed then, and until recently still believed, that what they had done were temporary borThe Commonwealth never believed that. The Commonwealth did not believe they were temporary purpose borrowings. Mr Tuckey interjecting",10
13,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor!,10
14,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That was the basis of the dispute between us. Of course, the draft letter never materialised. Mr Reith-Have you got it?",11

16,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I have got it. It never materialised. Mr Reith-When did you get it?",11
17,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the Deputy Leader that if he continues to interject I will deal with him. Mr Harry Woods-That's right!,11
18,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much interjection and catcalling on both sides. Honourable members on both sides will cease interjecting or I will deal with the next person who does. Taxation: Compliance Costs,11
19,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Prime Minister provide details to the House. of why minimising compliance costs for businesses is an important principle for tax policy? Can he say what specific steps the Government has taken to ensure that such costs are kept to a . , ? rrurumum.",11
20,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first and principal point to make about taxation costs and compliance in the years that the Government has been in office is that taxes overall have kept Australia's share of tax in GDP to a minimum; that is, we are now amongst the lowest two or three countries in the OBCD league table. The sort of haemorrhaging of the system we saw when the honourable member for Bennelong was Treasurer has been eliminated and fairness restored. We have always kept an eye on minimising compliance costs. For instance, we have substantially reduced the number of businesses under the wholesale sales tax systemmuch maligned by the Opposition-so that today only about 20,000 businesses are required to be in the system. That is, there are large. only 20,000 taxing points in the wholesale sales tax system. Most importantly, we have resist- calls to introduce a multi-stage value added goods and services tax. I might add that under a proposed goods and services tax there would be 800,000 taxing points.",11
21,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Good heavens!,11
22,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It would go from 20,000 to 800,000 taxing points. The very simple reason is that at each move along the production chain there is a taxing point and that is why so many people are involved. In a recent study on compliance costs in New Zealand, Cedric Stanford and John Hesseldine noted: VAT is regarded as a tax with particularly high compliance costs, if for no other reason than that the tax is collected at every stage in the productive process. I might just quote what the honourable member for Bennelong said here in 1981: A multi-stage VAT was rejected fairly quickly because it would have imposed an enormous paper work burden on both taxpayers and collecting authorities.",11
23,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Who said that?,11
24,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Bennelong said it. He was, of course, dead right.",11
25,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,11
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise .,11
27,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That has all gone out the door today as textbook ideology has taken over on the part of the Opposition. The New Zealand information is interesting because it refers to the costs of compliance in New Zealand for PAYE and related taxes such as its specified superannuation contribution, withholding tax or accident compensation levy. The Australian equivalents may be the SOC or payroll taxes. For these taxes compliance costs amount to only 1.9 per cent of revenue, whereas in New Zealand the cost to business of keeping the necessary records and filling in endless forms associated with the GST was a massive 7.3 per cent of the tax collected. I repeat: 1.9 per cent for PAYE and related taxes and 7.3 per cent for a goods and services tax; in other words, four times as This result does not hold just for New Zealand. In the United Kingdom, compliance costs of PAYE and related taxes are one per cent of revenue collected whereas they are 3.7 per cent for the VAT. The four to one rule holds up again in Britain: the cost of collecting the VAT is four times the cost of collecting PAYE and related taxes. The New Zealand study shows that most of the burden falls on small business. In fact, nearly 60 per cent of costs fell on businesses with annual turnovers below $250,000, which meant that compliance costs fell-to quote Stanford and Hesseldine-'with exceptional severity on small finns'. This is despite the fact that businesses with turnovers below $24m a year need to pay only once every two months, and those with turnovers below $250,000 need only to pay once every six months. In other words, even with that frequency of payments, the costs were still four times larger. Th,e point of the study is that, to paraphrase Stanford and Hesseldine, there is no getting around the fact that a tax collected at every stage of the productive process is exceptionally expensive. I notice that in the press in the last day or so we again had a contribution from Professor Freebaim. He said: The economic effects of a consumption tax and a payroll tax are similar . . . Unlike the coalition, believe Ole swap of a GST for payroll tax will have virtually no effect on employment or unemployment levels.",11

31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Kooyong.,12
32,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He said: Unlike the coalition, I believe the swap of a GST for payroll tax will have virtually no effect on employment or unemployment levels. The effeCts of a consumption tax and payroll tax are similar. It is worth reminding everybody that there are 800,000 businesses in this country and only 100,000 pay payroll tax. Only 100,000 would receive any benefit from OST proceeds under payroll tax, but a further 700,000 would pay the GST without any commensurate benefit coming from the imposition of a goods and services tax.",12

34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Mitchell and the honourable member for Mayo will resume their seats.,12
35,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is very interesting to look at publicity by the Opposition on the goods and services tax. A pamphlet issued by Mr Robb recently says, .'Fightback gives you big income tax cuts, petrol tax is, abolished, there is lump sum abolition, wholesale sales tax is abolished and there will be two million new jobs'-which the Leader of the Opposition says was a guesstimate. There is no mention of the GST, a tax which will collect over half of the income tax equivalent. Then we have that very brave person, the I honourable member for Hawker, who said in the pamphlet she put out, 'Why vote Liberal?'. This is Chris Gallus, the honourable member for Hawker, the Liberal candidate for Hindmarsh. She talks about seven taxes being abolished, petrol, Medicare-and it goes on. There is not one mention of the GST. Government members-Oh!",12
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is too much noise.,12
37,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'This is the tax Australia needs', they say. This is the tax they are proud of. This is the thing which the political system has not given in the past because it has not been strong enough. But now they have it, of course, there is no mention of the GST. In all the other advertisements that are being published by the Liberal Party, there is noMr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.

Today I noticed a cartoon in the Sydney Morning Herald which has the Leader of the Opposition with the GST-this very smelly GST, I might say. I have suitably inscribed it for the Leader of the Opposition. I hope that, given the fact that he is standing wistfully, embarrassed-looking, holding this thing he will not talk about, in the spotlight, he might keep this little piece for his memorabilia.",13

44,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is again to the Treasurer and refers to his last answer. Government members-Boring!,13
45,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,13
46,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Treasurer to the draft letter from the Victorians and put it to him, firstly, that the Victorians admitted it was not appropriate to maintain their short term borrowings. Secondly, they said that they would report the allegedly temporary purpose borrowings to the Loan Council. Thirdly, they said that they for a special addition to the global accommodate this refinancing. How can you then claim that they have denied the breachMr Lavarch interjecting",13
47,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Fisher.,13
48,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you are so confident in the draft letter to support your case, and if you have nothing to hide, why will you not table it? Mr Costello interjecting",13
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Higgins.,13
50,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, if the that Deputy Leader wants me to table it, I will table it. It does not support his case at all. The other point is that it was never put forward by the Victorians; it never came forward as a suggestion from them to me. They were told that, if they put it up, it would be rejected because we did not accept the notions on which they were putting it up. Whilst we are talking about letters, the Deputy Leader wrote to the Australian Statistician on 4 November 'concerning the information available on public sector borrowings which is incorporated in Budget Papers'. The Deputy Leader wanted to have the Statistician supporting him that somehow there had been some inaccuracies in the Budget Papers as far as the reporting of public sector debt was concerned. He got a reply from the Statistician on 6 November, in which the Statistician said: Your first question related to the procedures used in collecting the information on public sector borrowings for the Commonwealth and the States necessary for preparing Budget Paper No. 1. I had said that the figures in Budget Paper No. 1 included all of the borrowings undertaken by the Commonwealth and the States, including Victoria. Interestingly, the Statistician in his last paragraph concludes by saying: that Although the estimate of the NFR that is, the net financing requirementfor the most recent year is necessarily less accurate than that for earlier years it is, in concept, could argue a case comprehensive. program to Mr Castles then says this: I therefore confirm the Treasurer's statement that it 'included all the borrowings of the Commonwealth and all the States, including Victoria'.",13
51,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So what?,13
52,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, so what! What do you think would have happened to this letter had it said anything else? Do you think the Deputy Leader would have kept this little letter secret? Yet what the Deputy Leader said on radio this morning was, 'Well, the first point is that we all know the figures that went into the Budget are wrong and for that Mr Dawkins should resign' . Opposition members-Hear, hearl",13
53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order I,14
54,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, he said that today, in the face of advice from the Statistician, sought by him, that what 1 said was right and that Budget Paper No. 1 included the borrowings of the c:opunonwealth and all the States, including Victoria.

57,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So he went on to the public record knowing that he had in his hands a letter which totally contradicted what he had been maintaining. Yet he asserted again today that the Budget figuring was wrong. Mr Speaker, what is clear from this debate is that this has revealed, if anyone was in any doubt, that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is probably the most dishonest man in this Parliament.",14
58,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,14
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order I The Treasurer will withdraw that remark.,14
60,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw the remark. He has been engaged on this occasion in saying anything, doing anything, has. no regard for the truth whatever, and indeed quite untruthfully said something today which he knew was wrong. He had in his hands a letter from the Statistician confirming that what 1 had said was right, and yet he went on to the ABC this morning and said that 1 had misled the Parliament. He is a thoroughfor going outrage, and this debate has just revealed that for anyone who was in doubt about it. Credit Cards",14
61,Mr ELLIOTI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the benefits to Australian consumers of uniform legislation on credit card pricing?,14
62,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me come down a allowed notch or two, Mr Speaker. Mr Smith-Can you do that?",14
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Bass will cease interjecting. Mr Broadbent-You start from a low base.,14
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Corinella.,14
65,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Credit card interest rates have been too high for too long and Australian consumers have been requh-ed to pay too much for the credit provided to them by their credit cards. Banks have avoided their responsibilities to lower their interest rates as interest rates generally have come down. Indeed, whilst the overnight rate has come down 12 percentage points, credit card rates have fallen by 5 per cent or in some cases less during the same period. State and Federal consumer affairs Ministers have been meeting over at least the last six years with a view to the States agreeing on how they might revise and make uniform their credit legislation. What the consumers want to know is when this matter will come to an end. When will the result of those deliberations lead to a situation where interest rates on credit cards can come down? Let me give you this example: a consumer who has an outstanding debt of $1,000 on his credit card in the course of the year is paying interest of about $200-$200 for the interest on credit of $1,000. It has been the inability of the State Ministers to agree on what should be done about this which first of all led the Commonwealth to ask the Prices SurVeillance .Authority to report on this issue and to come forward with recommendationsMr Filing interjecting",14
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member Moore interjects again, 1 will name him. . Mr DAWKINS-following its investigation of what might be done. The PSA did come forward with recommendations. 1 note that many of the States, as soon as that report· came out, criticised and rejected the key recommendations of the PSA. As well as that, they postponed their December meeting until February of next year. 1 do not believe that this issue can be to languish any longer. There is a case for interest rates coming down. 1 think we can arrive at a situation where that will occur. Therefore, along with my colleague the Minister for Consumer Affairs, I am having discussions with the banks and with .consumers to see what can be done about lowering interest rates for users of credit cards. This is not to say that the States do not have a continuing role in the control of credit generally. As far as the other deliberations of the consumer affairs Ministers are concerned, that process can continue. I hope it will conclude speedily as well. But there is no doubt about the Cominonwealth's 'ability, at least in the area of banking,where 70 per cent of credit card .facilities are found, for the Commonwealth to act in this area. Therefore, we will be having discu-sions with the various parties-hopefully trying to achieve the agreement of the States as well-so that this matter can be taken in hand and we can make whatever reforms. are necessary to ensure that the interest rate burden being felt by credit· card holders can be diminished. Victoria: Borrowings",14
67,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is it not a fact that the Statistician, Mr Castles, in the letter that you referred to and I will seek leave to table it in a moment-also referred to the fact that the $1.267 billion borrowing by Victoria on 1 Miy 1992 was not explicitly advised to the ABS? Does this, not therefore reveal the vacuity of your claim, that the ABS figures specifically included the $1.267 billion? I seek leave to table the document and put the matter beyond doubt. Leave granted. Mr DA\VKINS-I am glad the honourable member for Flinders has finally come clean and tabled the document. Let me just repeat the claim I made-and the Statistician has it in inverted commas: 'I therefore confirm the Treasurer's statement that it ""included all the borrowings of the Commonwealth and all the States, including Victoria"".' What we always said was that the Budget Paper No. 1 figures, as a description on the basis of a claim on the financial resources of the country by the public sector, is the more accurate report and the one which is relied upon by the financial market. Enterprise Agreements  Prime Minister relates to enterprise agreements. What information is the Prime Minister able to provide to honourable members of any changes to the enterprise agreement arrangements with the Australian Public Service? Is he able to say whether any of these changes could be useful as a model under the Government's industrial relations policy?",15
68,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very pleased to be able to report that the Australian Government has reached an historic agreement w:ith its 150;000 employees that significantly extends the coverage of enterprise bargaining' in the community. For the first time in the Commonwealth's history, wages in the public sector of the Commonwealth of Australia will be adjusted not across the board in some systemic way but by agency bargaining, agency per agency. It will be done without a day's dispute. This is a quite remarkable change which will see, improvements in flexibility and productivity in the Public Service. . What is more, the agreement is for two years and it is closed, 'so there .will be no other increases. APS members covered by the agreement will receive a 2 per cent servicewide productivity pay increase in retumfor implementing a package of service reforms detailed in the agreement. These include reforms to reduce absenteeism, increase flexibility in hours, strengthen. discipline of inefficient officers, continue rationalisation of the award structure, and accelerate the introduction of competency-based training assessment and salary advancement. Any increases other than those generated by a share of productivity gains will be confined to two increases over the life of the agreement: one in March next year of 1.4 per cent; and one in March the following year of 1. 5 per cent. I take this opportunity to commend those who negotiated this historic agreement on their thoroughness and good sense. It introduces to one of the largest areas of employment in the country-an area most bound by tradition and most bound by uniformity-this Government's policy of encouraging agreements which enhance productivity and flexibility at the enterprise. I have to draw a marked contrast with what is happening in Victoria. In what has been a 10year break-out of industrial cooperation, we now see industrial bloodymindedness and confrontation by the Victorian Government, with 50 amendments passed to legislation as it was guillotined through the Victorian Parliament.",15

71,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For all that, we know that the Victorian legislation still cancels the annual leave loading of all State awards; still cancels weekend penalties in all State awards, although many low income families depend for their survival on their penalty hours work; still forces employees' off State awards and onto contracts with their employers, except where the employer chooses to remain with the award. In other words, it is the primitive throwback to the common law and master and servant contracts that are sought by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong. I noticed the honourable member for Bennelong sooling the Victorian Government on over the weekend, saying that yes, they should go ahead and put their policy into place. In addition, we hear from the Victorian Premier that people in the Public Service who absent themselves from work in the industrial dispute will have their names taken, to be victimised later. No wonder Victorian employees are outraged by this sort of legislative vandalism, which threatens to wipe out 10 years of progress.

Can the Minister tell the House what the Government is doing to provide a safe and secure future for Australian ,families with children?",17
102,Mr SIMMONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. Mr Carlton interjecting,17
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Mackellar!,17
104,Mr SIMMONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is true that the Government has provided assistance to a family summit to be held here in Parliament House this week. It is an initiative that has been undertaken by Ms Ita Buttrose to consider issues of importance to Australian families. I think significantly, though, I should say at this point that the Government's position on families clearly demonstrates the value that we place on families with children. In particular, our very good record on income support for families with children will be further enhanced by the integration of family payments from 1 January next year. That particular change was announced in the 199192 Budget. Integration will continue the improvements that the Government has already made to family payments over a very long period. The particular initiative of integration combines family allowance, family allowance supplement and additional pension, allowance and benefit for children into a single visible payment. Combining those payments will improve the take-up of family allowance supplement, which will be called the family payment from 1 January next year. Clients' entitlement for what is currently known as family allowance supplement will be determined at the same time as they claim for family allowance, and that will be called the basic family payment from 1 January next year. I think it is significant at this point that many clients do not really realise that family allowance and family allowance supplement are different payments and, therefore, a single family payment will be much more simple for clients to understand. More families will receive more money from the Department of Social Security for their children as a result of those changes. Making additional pension, benefit and allowance for children part of the family payments will ensure that in most cases the family's additional payment for children is not lost if the parent's pension or allowance is temporarily interrupted. For example, sale parents who are working and eligible for additional family payment will also qualify for a guardian allowance of $28.70 a fortnight in recognition of the additional burdens that are faced by this group within the community. Importantly, the integration of family payments will see child payments directed to the principal carer of children, which will usually be the mother. Under this Government's policies, the greatest level of assistance will continue to be targeted to low income families while access to basic family assistance for middle and higher income families will be retained. Interestingly, in last Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald in a very insightful article, Ross Gittins talked about the benefits for Australian families of the introduction of the family allowance supplement in 1987. He wrote: . . . the main reason for the fall in poverty among couples with dependent children was the introduction of the family allowance supplement in December 1987.",17

109,Mr SIMMONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think it is significant to look at the policies the Government has progressively implemented over a period of 10 years and compare it with the sort of prospect that is ahead under the proposals that were announced in Fightback. For example, under Fightback Opposition members plan to slash government expenditure to the tune of $10 billion, including $2.4 billion off the social security budget; they want to tighten the income testing arrangements for family allowance and over 100,000 families would lose their entitlement under that particular policy; they want to cut off the sale parent pension once the youngest child turns 12; they want to change the child-care arrangements to the detriment of many lower income families; they also want to shift the responsibility for welfare increasingly to voluntary organisations; but, most significantly of course, they want to impose upon Australian families the dreaded GST. Mr Ronaldson-But you support the GST.",18
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,18
111,Mr SIMMONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite are so concerned about the welfare of families that, under the GST, there would be an increase in food prices by 8.9 per cent, an increase in fruit and vegetables by 10.1 per cent, and an increase in clothing by more than 11 per cent. This is the sort of concern that this Opposition has for Australian families. This Government rejects outright the social Darwinism that is part of the Opposition's policies. Unlike our opponents, we do not believe that market forces can provide equality for everyone in Australia. We are committed to ensuring that all Australian families can function in a humane and dignified society. Victoria: Borrowings",19
112,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question again to the Treasurer. I refer him to the statement from Mr Tony Cole, Secretary to the Treasury, that when told of the Victorian borrowing blow-out the Secretary regarded this as a breach of Loan Council arrangements, and that if the information was made public it would cause an adverse market reaction. Given the seriousness of the issue as GST. stated by Mr Cole, has the Treasurer sought an explanation from the Secretary as to why he-the Treasurer-was not informed for almost three weeks, or was it that he really did know before 6 July?",19

120,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Standing order 146 says that a question fully answered cannot be renewed. We have evidence in the Hansard of last Thursday where this very question was answered in detail by the Treasurer. We had a repeat of this question this morning from the Prime Minister, presumably because the Treasurer did not get a run. This is another question of exactly the same meaning. I request that it be ruled out of order.",19
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,19
122,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am amused by members of the Opposition. They were throwing their little parties on Thursday night, but they are being very quiet about it today, are they not? They do not want to be talking about the GST today. They will talk about anything but the Mr Smith-You don't want to answer the question.",19
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,19
124,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I made a point earlier which I want to amplify. At the moment there are 20,000 taxing points in the wholesale sales tax system of this country. Under a coalition government that would go to 800,000, and the burden of the tax would fall on small business. This is just as we are seeing a massive misrepresentation in the Liberal Party's advertisements, where it talks about benefits from its policies but no mention of what pays for them-the $27 billion of the GST - in persistent pamphlets and material published by Mr Robb and by individual members. Also, there is a misrepresentation in a handbook for small business, GST Explained, published by the Liberal Party, which has a sample GST return form. Mr Tim Fischer-And so it mentions the GST.",19
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the Leader of the National Party. If he continues to interject I will deal with him.,20
126,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It contains what they argue is a simple return form for the GST.

D- the Prime Minister have any responsibility for New Zealand? If.so, will he tell us how their wageS are going up?",20
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! If the honourable member for O'Connor takes a point of order like that again I will name him. The Prime Minister was asked a. question about why the Government did not introduce a tax such as this. The Prime Minister is answering the question.,20
130,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is because of this huge complexity, the costs of which are borne largely by small business. I make the point that 700,000 of the 800,000 businesses do not pay payroll tax, will not get payroll tax but all 800,000 will bear the· burden of a voluminous document like this and a return form like this one, not like the one misrepresented in the Liberal Party's literature. The Liberal Party is running flat out away from the GST. It will not mention it. He is a fiumy fellow, the Leader of the Opposition. He says, 'Look, I am proud of this policy. It is the, centrepiece form. It has to be done in Australia's national interest. But, wherever I can not talk about it, run backwards, hide from it, misrepresent it or misrepresent the Government's position, I will'. I noticed that today on radio the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said: Just don't forget: if you vote for Labor you are voting for the GST at the 'next election. Margaret Fletcher, the commentator on 3AW, said: What Peter Reith said is not true. If you vote for Labor and if Labor wins the majority then I have to tell you that the GST will not be in. So that was a little bit of a political ploy at the end. But we caught him just in time! If those opposite are so proud of this policy-if it is such a good thing for Australia and, if the Leader of the Opposition has said that he is going to bring the new politics, not grubby politics, to the national affairs of this country.

We, want it to be a referendum relief, on the GST-that is, those who want one, vote for John Hewson; those who do not, vote for me and the Labor Party. It is as simple as that. No amount of squirming-or telling of untruths, such as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did, only to be found out by a radio commentator-is going to save them from that central fact.

172,Mr COURTICE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Tourism. Can the Minister infonn the House about recent movements in inbound tourism and forecasts for future growth? What arrangements are in place to achieve these targets?,22
173,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The inbound tourism figure for the year to August is in the order of 1.6 million, which is well on the way to another record. There has been almost a 30 per cent increase in inbound tourist figures from the Asia and Japan region to date. That is a truly commendable record, for which a good part of the congratulations need go to the Australian Tourist Commission. I have had occasion to outline the Government's policies before, and I will not go through them again, suffice to say that they are well received by industry as a result of those policy prescriptions. This stands in considerable contrast to the position of the Opposition which, in terms of its pollcy prescriptions, is rightly perceived by the industry to be treating it with scant regard. This· was no better articulated than at the Australian Tourism Industry Association annual conference, where the Leader of the Opposition described the industry'S case as blatant vested interest'. In so doing he humiliated his own shadow Minister, who was a co-signatory",22
174,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,22
175,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to a document which of itself stood as a condemnation of the Fightback package in so far as it impacts on the tourism industry. Legitimate criticism from the industry was described in very strong terms by the Leader of the Opposition. As a consequence of that, the Australian Tourism Industry Association described coalition comments about its case, which was backed up by independent industry analysis, as 'offensive and misleading'. In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I should also you. bring to your attention comments by the Leader of the National Party during the course of the weekend. As I noted earlier, he is very quick out of the starting blocks to take points of order if words like 'untruth' or 'misleading' are being bandied around this House. In response to one of his National Party senatorial candidates bucketing the GST, he indicated at a National party convention, in terms of the Fightback package, that 'this is a new development in the Fightback plan' and 'a concession to the airline industry'. This is the same airline industry, incidentally, that would have a 10 per cent cos- increase. In the Fightback supplementary paper No. 5 at page 21 it is indicated quite clearly that air travel in Australia, providing it is booked at the same time as international flights and is provided through· the same supplier, will not be subject to the GST. It never was. The Leader of the National Party, in saying 'this is a new development in the Fightback plan,' is clearly under enonnous pressure.· The Leader of the National Party, unlike his other colleagues, occasionally sticks with the truth of the matter. On this occasion he is clearly misleading the tourism industry. He has been found out doing that. The way to resolve these matters is to change the policy, not to mislead people about it.",22
176,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that 'a further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. There was not one question from the Leader of the Opposition. VICTORIA: BORROWINGS Suspension of Standing Orders",22

181,Mr SPEAKER,REQUESTS TO BILLS,"For the information of honourable members, I present a copy of a paper dealing with the issue of Senate amendments and requests to Bills. The paper deals with the interpretation and application of the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution. That provision states: The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. Honourable members will recall that there have been a number of disputes between the Houses concerning the application of this provision. The paper I have presented rejects the test that an amendment may be made by the Senate unless it can be demonstrated that the amendment will 'necessarily, clearly and directly' cause an increase in expenditure PAIRS under an appropriation. The paper concludes that in strict logic it may often be very difficult to actually prove such an effect. For example, where eligibility for some benefit extended, it may not be able to be actually proven that the intended beneficiaries will in fact take advantage of the entitlement and actually receive money, et cetera. At the other extreme, it may be argued that virtually any amendments will have some effect on expenditure and so they should be made as requests. The paper rejects both extremes. It concludes that, as a practical legislature, the Parliament is best advised to look at each case on its merits and to consider journed. proposed amendments in relation to the Bill in question and any existing principal legislation. It argues that it is necessary to have regard to the intended or expected and likely outcome of amendments. To the extent that the office of the Speaker becomes involved in the consideration of these matters, for my part I intend to follow this approach. I commend the paper for consideration of honourable members. I House? suggest in particular that the Party leaders and the leaders of Government and Opposition business in this place might direct their attention to the issue with a view possibility of reaching some form of understanding as to the approach that should be taken in the consideration of such issues in the future.

198,Mr FILING,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I apologise, Mr Speaker.  euphemisms and fancy packaging, what the Opposition and its State colleagues are about is pushing taxes up and wages down. Their proposals would have a harsh and damaging effect on family incomes. They aim to use the pressure of unemployment to achieve those objectives. The vehicle for their attack on employees' pay and entitlements is the abolition of the award system and the creation of individual employment contracts between each employee and employer by direct negotiation. Such a procedure implies that an employed person would have some equality in the negotiating process. Everyone knows that an employee has only his or her labour to offer: that in any such negotiation all of the power is with the e-ployer-especially in a period of high unemployment. Nowhere is that more evident than in New Zealand-the origin of the Opposition's industrial relations policy. Some people may say that people in that state of misery and bitterness have had an increase in wages, but effectively they have had a decrease in annual earnings. People's wage rates may have gone up but they have lost their other allowances and benefits. Overall, What has happened to many people in New Zealand is that they have taken a 20 to 30 per cent cut in gross earnings per annum. Let us be open and honest about the proposals being put by the Opposition. At a time when real unit labour costs have been reduced by 10 per cent; when industrial disputes are at a record low; when company tax has been reduced from 49c in the dollar to 39c in the dollar; when double taxation of dividends has been abolished for incorporated businesses; when there has been a substantial shift to profit sharing from wages; when inflation is at a 30-year low; when interest rates are at a 20-year low; when productivity is up 21/2 per cent; when 1.43 million more people are at work than in 1983; when there has been a dramatic improvement in workplace arrangements-in training and in multi-skilling; and when some 400 enterprise agreements have been signed and hundreds more ate in the pipeline, the Liberal and National parties seek to make a direct assault on employees and their families. Let us be clear about this: when an Australian worker is attacked, that Australian worker's family is attacked. It is the family income that is being attacked. Let us have no glossy words about industrial relations; it quite simple: it is that family's income over the course of the year that is being attacked. Therefore, if we look back to the issue of holiday leave loading-'-the issue which the Opposition has picked on-we see that it is but· one component in the package of entitlements and benefits that an employee receives as a reward for his or her effort or service over the course of the year. It is one component. It is equivalent to 1 to 1.3 per cent of annual labour costs for that person. That is the issue which the Opposition has fastened on-as if it in some way is the magic solution to economic salvation in this country. For an employee on an award rate or a base rate of $400 a week, abolition of the holiday leave loading amounts to a cut in pay of $4 a week. I take that as a simple example$400 a week; $4 a week cut in pay. Let those opposite be fair dinkum. Let them be clear and honest about this. What they are proposing by the abolition of the holiday leave loading is a cut in family income for Australian families. . Holiday leave loading has been around since 1970. It was first introduced in the stevedoring industry and then by consent in the metal trades award in 1972. Then, led by a decision by the New South Wales Industrial Commission in 1974-that was not under a Labor government-it was introduced generally across Australia in that year. Let us now turn to other countries in the world. Is holiday leave loading general and commonplace? Of. course it is. Eight of the OECD countries-Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and West Germany-have holiday leave loadings. It is but one minor component in total annual wages, salaries and benefits-the package for employees. In Austria workers receive their normal pay and any regular extra payments, including overtime, allowances and bonuses. In Belgium workers receive their normal remuneration, plus an extra three weeks pay. In West Germany, workers receive their usual pay, plus a bonus of up to an additional month's salary. In the Netherlands, workers receive their usual remuneration plus is a minimum holiday allowance of 7 per cent of wages earned in the previous year, up to a maximum of three times the minimum weekly wage. What is being paid in Australia is well down the line. Mr Les Scott-Peanuts.  context of the annual entitlement of benefits but and cash and wages. The Opposition sees abolition of the leave loading as some sort of benefit, as the way to go to spur economic growth. How better to undermine consumer confidence, how better to undermine family spending, than to say, 'Stand by; we are going to cut your pay. We will talk about the holiday leave loading, but what we really mean is that we will cut your pay by $4 a week upwards'. Any responsible family, given the other proposals from the Opposition, would have to be careful and hold back. We have seen it first in Victoria. In swept the Kennett Government, and what has gone? Penalty rates, allowances and annual holiday leave loading. The honoilrable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was joyous the day after the election of the Kennett Government. He said that if those opposite were to be elected they would have an identical government in office. He then backtracked at 100 miles an hour. Now he is trying to ease back a little and say, 'Yes, but it's not all so bad' . But he is part and parcel of that operation; that attack on family incomes. The coalition's policy is designed to give employers the freedom to cut wages. That is what it is about. It is aimed at ending the award system and any meaningful role for the Industrial Relations Commission. It states explicitly that the aim is to get workers onto individual employment contracts. Such a process will throw all workers outside the award system unless their employers agree to let them remain on awards. If there is a dispute over whether or not to remain on awards, workers will be placed on individual employment contracts which contain their former award conditions. They will be outside the protection of the Industrial Relations Commission. There is then nothing to stop employers cutting wages and conditions down to the bare legal minimums. Even if an employer does not do this, the old award minimums will become less and less relevant over time. So once outside the award system there is nothing to stop employers using the threat of the sack to force workers to sign contracts which lower their wages and reduce their working conditions. That is the reality of it. Why do those opposite not come clean and say that that is what they are about masking and disguising it as they have tried to do? The only minimums provided by the Opposition for individual employment contracts are the base hourly minimum rates of the old awards-annual leave, sick leave and maternity leave protections. All of the other award conditions would be up for grabs-overtime, shift allowances, holiday loadings and penalty rates. I have referred to holiday loadings, add to that award superannuation and redundancy entitlements. In many awards and for many employees across this country it is the annual income which is important, not the base rate under the award. In many cases, the base rate Under the award is a deliberately low rate that is built up by penalty allowances, shift allowances and vario-- overtime arrangements-a range of agreements which were seen at that time to be appropriate to that industry. The Opposition now thinks it has discovered something new. Under the guise of remodelling the wages system, it is effectively about cutting the wages and incomes of Australian families. When we look at those allowances, we can see that for many families abolishing penalty rates and shift allowances will amount to something like a 20 per cent cut in gross earnings per year. It is not the award rate which is important; what is important is the total earnings per· year-in whatever form it is expressed-within the arrangements which individual employees have under their awards. The Opposition's policy does not recognise the fundamental imbalance between an employer and an individual employee. Under its policy, only individuals can be signatories to employment contracts. Unions cannot be signatories, even if they are chosen specifically by workers to be their bargaining agents. So if workers were to be forced out of the award system and onto employment contracts they would have to deal with employers under the common law if any problem arose. To go back to the common law is really to take us back to the nineteenth century; back to the Industrial Revolution. It was the Industrial Revolution, with its abuses and exploitation instead of of workers, women and children",27
199,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I did not think that the Industrial Revolution was in the nineteenth century, but go on.  member will have his opportunity to speak. Those opposite will take it back to the last century and further back still. I was giving the honourable member credit for having taken it back to that period, where individuals were but exploited by employers-the powerless dealing with the powerful. That is what the Opposition is really about. It is absurd to suggest, as the Opposition does, that employers and employees have an equal relationship. For this reason, the Government ensures that workers have the protection of the Industrial Relations Commission and the award wages and conditions it determines. It also ensures that workers have the right to be represented by a union. Let me turn to what the Opposition's wages policy is. It does not have a wages policy; it has a period of high unemployment, which is regrettable, that nobody wants, and· that is being impacted on by forces abroad. Regrettable as this period is, the Opposition is turning the clock back and is seizing this opportunity to settle old scores, to squeeze down on family incomes and to squeeze down on wage rates. Let us get away from political parties and refer to Ross Gittins, who is not renowned as a Labor economist. Ross Gittins described it last week when he wrote, with what I thought was stark simplicity and stark clarity, as follows: At bestreferring to the Opposition's industrial relations policythis is naive. At worse, it's disingenuous. This policy of co-operation rather than confrontation begins by attacking the employees' unions, constraining the right to strike and allowing employers to determine whether workers are forced off their awards and required to re-negotiate their penalty rates, leave loading, redundancy payments and sundry other conditions. This is the team approach that will reconcile old antagonisms. That is sarcasm in the last sentence. Far from reconciling old antagonisms, this approach will re-open old wounds, old antagonismsthe 'us' versus 'them' attitudes of the Great Depression, the 1890s, when, in our region, they shot strikers and gaoled them for long periods when they sought to try to get a decent wage for themselves. That is what the Opposition is about-the approach that was the hallmark for decades of conservative governments. Let me turn to another source, an editorial in the Catholic Weekly of 28 October, which states: ""The award system has provided stability for years and its destruction could prove devastating to Australia's entire employment, social and economic infrastructure,"" the editorial in the Wednesday's edition of the paper said. It continues: ""The right to remove one's labour in the face of exploitation when other means have failed is a fundamental and irreversible right enshrined in both canon and civil law, as is the right to associate in industrial trade unions,"" it said. There can be no more fundamental and clear expression of what it is all about than that. Let us be open and honest about what the Opposition's policy is. It is about cutting wages and reducing family incomes. Out there in the community there is a widespread worry and concern among families and wage and salary earners at the proposals of the Liberal and National parties to push taxes up and to push wages down. This Government is determined to ensure that those proposals will be exposed, that they will be rejected by the Australian people when the opportunity arises. We will maintain, as a government, the consultative and cooperative approach to building a better skilled, better paid and more productive work force. We utterly reject the confrontationist approaches inherent in the Liberal and National parties proposals to cut wages and to deny employees their proper entitlements.",29
200,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was particularly struck by the fact that the  Morris) should invoke some memories of the Great Depression and talk about some incidents that occurred in .the Hunter and Newcastle area during the Great Depression. I would have to say to the honourable gentleman that there is only one thing on the Australian social and political landscape today, in 1992, that in any way resembles the years of the Great Depression in Australia; that is, the level of unemployment that his Government and his policies have given to the Australian people. Let us, at the outset, have none of this nonsense suggesting that, in some way, the policies of the coalition, the proposals we have for refonning Australia's industrial relations, are in any way going to take Australia back to the years of the Great .Depression. When I heard that the Speaker had chosen the matter of public importance of the honourable member for Shortland for today's discussion, I could hardly believe the good fortune of the coalition. What he has done, on the eve of this insane, stupid and pain-inflicting strike in Victoria, is to present to the coalition in this Parliament an opportunity to point out yet again to the Victorian people that it is John Halfpenny, aided and abetted by Paul Keating and Bill Kelty, who are about to inflict more pain on the unfortunate people of Victoria, as if they have not suffered enough pain already. The prize for the statement of the day-in fact, the statement of the week, perhaps the statement of the yearMr Bevis-Of the decade.",30
201,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It may in fact be the decade-ought to go to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), because in Question Time the Prime Minister, railing against the industrial relations reforms of the Liberal Government in Victoria, was bemoaning the fact that these reforms were going to be introduced. He said that they were going to come despite 10 years of progress in Victoria. I repeat that: 10 years of progress. What a nerve! I have said it before, and I will say it again: over the last 10 years, the likes of the Prime Minister, Wally Curran and John Halfpenny have literally laid waste to the people of Victoria. They have destroyed the whole social and family infrastructure of that State. They have inflicted the worse depression in State terms that we have seen since the end of World War n on any part of Australia. The downturn in Victoria is infinitely worse than it has been any other part of Australia, and they know it. I think every last one of them, from Kirner through to Keating, ought to hide under a rock and not say anything for the next couple of years, because that is the measure of responsibility that those characters bear for what has happened in Victoria. Yet those clever tacticians on the Government side of the House have brought forward a matter of public importance that enables me and my colleagues to talk about industrial relations. I welcome the fact that the Government has allowed me to talk about industrial relations and to remind the House of what a fool the Prime Minister made of himself today when he talked about 10 years of progress in Victoria. If he thinks the last 10 years has been progress, I would hate to know what would have happened to the poor unfortunates of Victoria if they had had, in the Prime Minister's eyes, 10 years of stagnation. It has been the worse 10 years they have had since the War. Everything that the Victorian Opposition said a few years ago about the now discredited, now defeated, now disgraced Kirner Government in Victoria has turned out to be correct. If the Prime Minister is such a born again believer in the mandate theory of politics, and really believes in the mandate theory of politics-which he tried to tell us last week when he would not seek to frustrate the goods and services tax if the Liberal and National parties won the next Federal election-why does he not call off the dogs in Victoria? Why does he not ring up his fabled mate, Bill Kelty, and say, 'Look, Bill, Kennett got a mandate to change the industrial relations system down there. I, Paul Keating, believe in the mandate theory of politics. You had better call this one off. You are onto a loser'because in political terms they are onto a loser-'and I don't want the strike to go ahead tomorrow because I don't want to see my fellow Australians in Victoria suffer any more.'? The people in Victoria do not deserve to suffer any more, particularly at the hands of people such as Halfpenny, who were driving the Kirner Government, who were bullying in the Cain Government before it, and who carry an enormous amount of responsibility for what has happened. But those sorts of logical entreaties fall on totally deaf ears when one is dealing with ideologues such as John Halfpenny. It really does pass very strange that we are accused of being the ideologues of industrial relations. In reality, the ideologues are people such as John Halfpenny and those who support him in the Trades Hall Council. Be it remembered that Joan Kirner was one of the driving forces behind the present Prime Minister's assumption of his present positionMr Tim Fischer-Along with Wally Curran.",31
202,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Along with Wally Curran. What a trifecta of ideologues: John Halfpenny, Wally Curran and Joan Kirner.. They were the Victorians wanting the Prime Minister to supplant Bob Hawke-the trifecta of disaster, doom and economic death. They were the people who were driving Paul Keating's pursuit of the office of prime ministership. I am delighted that this matter of public importance has come on today. What is the proposition? The proposition that has been put by the honourable member for Shortland is that our policy will cut wages and drive down living standards of Australian families. I ask the honourable member for Shortland, and I ask all of those opposite: what do they think their policy has done for the last 10 years? they think it has enhanced living standards? Do they think it has boosted employment? Do they think it has boosted the living standards and the productivity of the Australian people? Do they think it has boosted the international competitiveness of the Australian economy? The day that I launched our 10bsback policy, I said that the starting point of the coalition in industrial relations is the ignominious failure of the accord and the total and complete failure of the approach of the Government to industrial relations. On every score its policy has been a failure. We now have one million people out of work-the worse since the Great Depression. I remind the honourable member for Shortland that, if he is drawing comparisons between Australia of 1992 and Australia of 60 years ago, the only comparison he can draw is on the level of unemployment. Does he know what the level of unemployment was during the Great Depression? It was 19.7 per cent. Does he know what it is now? It is hovering around 11 per cent. It is the closest that it has ever got to what happened in those dark days of the 1930s. It ill becomes anybody on the opposite side of the House to lecture us about the suffering of Australian families when those opposite have achieved the n-arest approach in the history of this country to what happened during the Great Depression. That will be their political epitaph when they are hurled out at the next election. That will be what they will have to explain. They should go to the people of the Hunter and Newcastle and try to explain that away; they should try to explain away the fact that, under their Government, the indebtedness of this nation has soared to $160 billion, our living standards have sunk and we have the worse recession in 60 years. Those opposite talk about penalty rates and the holiday leave loading. I say to the honourable member for Shortland that, under the policy of the coalition, if people remain covered by an award and that award includes penalty rates, they would continue to enjoy those penalty rates. The same applies to the holiday leave loading. If people go into a Do workplace agreement, penalty rates and holiday loadings become matters of negotiation. The thing that those opposite will not understand, and the thing that many other people will not understand, about penalty rates is that in certain circumstances penalty rates add to unemployment and destroy jobs. I make no apology for supporting a policy which will make penalty rates negotiable. I make no apology at all, because I believe that thousands and thousands of people are locked out of jobs simply because many employers cannot afford to run more than one shift a day because of penalty rates. If we were to get to a situation in this country where a business could be run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, without penalties as to the time of the day or night that it is run, that will produce one thing and one thing aloneit will produce more Australians in jobs. That is the reason why we have always taken the attitude that we have about penalty rates. We do not say, 'Take them away by legislation from those people who have them'. That is not our policy. It never has been and it never will be our policy. What we are saying is that, if people go into a workplace agreement, those things become a matter of negotiation. Over time that will produce the highly beneficial thing of more jobs. In the service industries of tourism, recreation, and many other industries of Australia, the opportunity to negotiate on penalty rates-the opportunity to create new jobs through not having to automatically pay them-is going to be of enormous assistance and of enormous benefit to job creation around Australia. The starting point of any debate on industrial relations when it comes to the Labor Party is, as I said a moment ago, to extol the enormous virtues that have come to Australia as a result of the accord with the ACTU. Many claims are made about the accord, but those claims do not stand up when they are examined under the economic microscope. We are told how much more productive Australia is now as a result of the accord. I have some OECD comparisons which show that between 1980 and 1991, when we look at total factor productivity, including labour productivity, Australia has perfonned abysmally when compared with the rest of the OECD. Using 1980 as a base of 100, the total OECD productivity has gone to almost 120, and Australia's productivity has gone to 110. That occurred for all the years of the accord and a couple of years before it. If we look at Australia's international competitiveness, once again using the OECD as a measure, we see that in 1984 we ranked No. 12. By· 1991, as a result of the Government's fabled accord, we had gone to No. 16. But the piece de resistance from the Labor Party is always the great mantra of working days lost: 'They have come down in Australia, but they have remained up everywhere else'. The Government has a bit of a problem with that too. If we compare Australia with the United States, Japan and France between 1973 and 1990, we find that the pattern of working days lost is no better in Australia than it is in all of these other countries. If we look at all of the G7 nations, apart from a spike represented by the impact of the miners' dispute in the United Kingdom in the middle 1980s, we find the same pattern. Around the world we find that virtually without exception through the 1980s it was the nonnal pattern of industrialised societies to have fewer strikes and fewer days lost. It would seem as if, owing absolutely nothing at all to differentials in the industrial relations system, the 1980s was a period in which the world was mugged by industrial relations and employment reality.. I reject this matter of public importance because it is based on the false assertion that the accord has brought great economic and employment blessings to this country. I assert very proudly the industrial relations policy of the coalition. It is a high wage, high productivity policy which will be embraced very wannly and very enthusiastically by the working men and women of Australia, who are smart enough to know that the only people in Australia now who really have job security are trade union officials like John Halfpenny, Anna Booth and Bill Kelty.

203,Mr BEVIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am pleased to support the honourable member for  matter confronting the Australian people. I was somewhat interested to hear the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) singing the virtues of the Victorian Liberal Kennett Government for the first 10 minutes of his speech. I would have thought his recently acquired political acumen in staying clear of the GST and other unpopular issues in public would have surfaced today by keeping at ann's length from the Kennett Government. There are a few things about the Kennett Government's actions that I intend to refer to. Before I do, I want to mention a couple of things about our standing economically in the world, given that they were issues raised by the honourable member for Bennelong. I look forward to seeing those graphs and the base years and seeing how we can interpret that data differently, depending on what year and which particular statistic we look at. If we have a look at the perfonnance of our economy for the calendar year 1992, we find that the OECD projection of economic growth in Australia is 2.6 per cent. That rate of growth in Australia for this calendar year is faster than any of the G7 countries. It is well above the OECD average. There is greater growth in Australia than in any of the G7 countries. That is the OECD's estimate for 1992, which it published in June. So it has a fair base to go on. In 1992 the Australian economy will be growing, and is growing, faster than any of the G7; that is, it is growing faster than America, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom or Canada. They are the facts. Let there be no doubt about the success of the accord and the workplace reform that this Government has been involved in. To put it into perspective, seeing that the honourable member for Bennelong wanted to go back into a little bit of history and compare dates with dates, let us have a look at what it wa like when he was last in government, when he was the Treasurer and had responsibility for the conduct of the economy. In 1983, the DECO comparison of economic growth showed that Australia's economic growth in 1983 was 0.6 per cent. Australia was nearly in recession. The rest the world was not, though. The DECO average growth figure was 2.7 per cent. So, at a time when the rest of the DECO countries were growing at 2.7 per cent, that year, under the stewardship of the honourable member for Bennelong as Treasurer, Australia was going nowhere, standing still at 0.6 per cent growth. The honourable member has the hide to stand up here and try to tell the people of Australia that under this Government, there has not been economic growth when, demonstrably, the facts show that there has been, and comparisons with our trading partners demonstrate that growth has been quite significant. There is one final economic matter that I want to mention before I get on to a few industrial relations questions, and that is employment and unemployment. The honourable member for Bennelong sought to make some play out of the difficulties of those unemployed at present and to make comparisons with the recession. There are a couple of important points about that. Since this Government came to office in March 1983 to the present time, unemployment has risen by about 300,000. There are 300,000 more unemployed now than there were when the honourable member for Bennelong was Treasurer. That is a fact. There are 300,000 more unemployed. Since that time, 1.4 million more people have jobs. In other words, since the honourable member was Treasurer, every one of those extra unemployed people is matched by five extra people in a job. No member of this House takes comfort from the fact that there is a high level of unemployment. This Government has set in place a whole range of market and labour programs to address the problem of unemployment, but the time available to me in this debate will not allow me to canvass those programs here and now. The honourable member for Bennelong knows, as should every member of this House know, that employment growth in this country during the life of this Government has resulted in an extra 1.4 million jobs. Notwithstanding the recent recession, an extra 1.4 million jobs have been made available. The clear and indisputab'e fact is that, since honourable of members opposite left the treasury bench and since this Government started to manage the affairs of this country, there have been five extra jobs created for every extra unemployed person. That is an inescapable fact. It puts the lie to the comments of the honourable member for Bennelong. I suppose that, in a sense, I should not have been too surprised at the honourable member's willingness to support the Kennett Government. A couple of days after the Victorian Government was elected, while addressing the National Press Club, the honourable member said: Therefore the election of a Liberal Government in Victoria last Saturday is a very significant development. When comparing what a Hewson-Fischer government in Canberra would be like with the Kennett Liberal Government, the honourable member said: You will have Governments sharing identical views, give or take a comma here or there, identical views on industrial relations. They are his words. Those people around Australia who are looking at that social laboratory in Victoria and wondering whether or not it really reflects the extremist views of the Howards and Hewsons of this world should be under no misunderstanding. The honourable member for Bennelong is on the record. After the election of the Kennett Government, he made it very clear that they are identical views, give or take a comma. He said: . . . identical views on industrial relations. I might say that is a policy that even the Queensland National Party baulked at last weekend. In the weekend just gone, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) was up in Queensland trying to woo the support of the Queensland back bench. Even the Queensland National Party rejected a motion to endorse the Kennett industrial relations policy. I invite honourable members to think about that for a minute. We are talking about the Joh Bjelke-Petersen Queensland branch of the National Party, the people who brought us for the first time voluntary employment agreements and all the excesses of that regime, all the confrontation and hardship suffered by the people of Queensland. This last weekend the Queensland branch of the National Party said, 'We are not going to have a bar of it. We don't support it'. Yet the Opposition here in Canberra, .led in industrial relations and possibly in other areas by the honourable member for Bennelong, proudly proclaims the Victorian experiment as blood brother activity that we in the national capital should emulate. I can tell honourable members that it is not on. Even the Queensland National Party knows that it is not on. I think one of the most astounding things that have happened in Victoria of late, after getting over the initial shock of the fact that the Kennett Government is going to turn the clock back to 1904 to return industrial relations to the point where workers have no right of access to industrial commissionsgetting over that point-is to discover that it is going to legislate to restrict strikes. If workers take industrial action, .If they withdraw their labour in a manner that does not please Mr Kennett, they will be charged with an offence, and it will be a criminal offence. That takes us back not to 1904; that takes us back to the 18908. It is 100 years since workers in this country have been treated as criminals for daring to withdraw their labour. That is the proposition that the Howard-Hewson-Kennett team is putting before Australia. Workers who dare to withdraw their labour will be treated as if they had robbed a bank or stolen car-a criminal offence. That is a disgrace association of people. When we look at the development of the world in the twentieth century, one of the things that stands out is that there are three institutions that are always challenged by ideologues and dictatorial groups-the church, the education system and free trade unions. In all countries of the world, history of the twentieth century shows us that extremists in all dogma attack those three things. It is a worry to the people of Australia that we have an Opposition now that is embarking on that course. One thing that stands out, though, is that the honourable member for Bennelong does not seem to share the same zeal with regard to the salaries of members of parliament. Honourable members might recall that in 1990, when the Remuneration Tribunal brought down its recommendations, the honourable member for Bennelong was a key figure in those debates. I must say that I think he made some very substantial contributions. On 30 May, and again on 1 June, he supported the view-he still supports that viewthat salaries of members of parliament should be determined by recourse to a tribunal. I see the honourable member shaking his head.",33
204,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Just get your facts right.,35
205,Mr BEVIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It is no longer his view?,35
206,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,What I said is the same principle as you apply.,35
207,Mr BEVIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member for Bennelong will be able to explain his view at an appropriate time. Let there be no doubt that in 1990, he was a keen supporter of the Remuneration Tribunal process. He thought that it was a good thing to have an umpire out there somewhere deciding salaries of members of parliament, but for crying out loud, do not let the workers have an independent tribunal. The record of the fall in industrial relations disputes stands by itself. I have referred to it many times in this place. The honourable member for Bennelong cannot escape the fact that Australia's worse period of industrial disputation was under the former coalition Government, of which he was a member, and to the free that fact will not go away. The final thing which should be understood - and the people of Australia will understand this in 1993 at the next election-is that if they vote Labor, if they re-elect a Labor government, there will be no attack on their spending power. There will be no GST. If they vote for the Opposition, they get 15 per cent on everything they buy, raising $27 billion. A Labor government will protect their award conditions. (TIme expired)",35
208,Mr ANDERSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I do not want to say very much in response to the comments of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) in his attempts to misrepresent various prevailing arguments in Australia today, except to point to his continual boasting about the employment growth supposedly brought about by this Government since 1983. The reality is that that employment growth has been sustained by debt. It was debt financed. As all Australians are now seeing, that growth cannot be maintained and that is the precise reason why, as a matter of national urgency, Australians now have to become more productive and more efficient. The Government's massive purchase of jobs by debt financing ironically increases, and makes more urgent the need for the Opposition's reforms. In a very real sense the Government is hoist on its own petard. I do not believe that either the Government or the union movement is really serious about the purported central issue in this matter of public importance. That is the central issue of pay and entitlements. I do not believe they can be. I have a certain regard for the  Morris), but I do not believe that he can be serious in this. He is part of the very team that has presided over the great collapse in the lot of ordinary Australians. Those on the Government side have been the mob who have presided over a winding back in pay and entitlements even for, those who have kept their jobs, let alone those who have lost them, yet they complain that that is the under a coalition government. Those opposite are the ones whose handiwork most deserves the closest examination in all of this. As we saw yet again during Question Time today, as a team they are getting very good at misrepresentation. I cannot let pass a. couple of the comments made today by the Prime Minister-for example, his reference to the idea that he had abandoned the goods and services tax because it would impose compliance costs on small business. I would have thought that any casual observer of that particular debate in Australia's history would have been well aware that the real reason the now Prime Minister, the then Treasurer, backed away with great angst was because the then Prime Minister backed away after a tap on the shoulder from the ACTU, which said, 'The union movement doesn't like the GST. Let's back away from it'. I do not think it had anything to do with small business. Government members have never been friends of small business, as any small businessman in this country can attest, and they certainly were not concerned with the impact on small business at that time in that debate. There is the constant implication-never stated, except by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), who apparently is less constrained by the niceties of ethical considerations, or perhaps he just does not understand-that prices will rise by 15 per cent as a result of the goods and services tax. Talk about our misrepresenting the GST! Let us look at the Government's record. It makes interesting reading to look at what Mr Watts of Woolworths has said, according to a recent article. In a general comment about the taxation system in this country, he said that 'anything's better than what we've got' now. The article continued: He said supermarket prices would rise about 5%, not 15%, because they were so many hidden taxes in place now. ""I think you'll be surprised at how many taxes get eliminated in the retail sector. ""Generally, we're in favor of it, provided it's a total tax package and, overall, you don't pay any likely result more tax at the end of it. That is the very thing the Government does not want us to look at. It does not want the Australian people to look at it. It does not want an honest debate about it. We are having a debate when what Government members are really interested in doing is clouding and misrepresenting their own record. The truth is that we have available at our fingertips just about every resource any nation could reasonably hope to enjoy-whether it is clean air, wide open spaces, rich agricultural land, mineral wealth, a stable political system, and in theory a good education system. We have them all, yet the Government has made such an utter mess of it that we face very real declines in living standards; we face massive unemployment; and we face a huge debt burden that is threatening the future not only of current Australians but also of future Australians. Government members want to tell us that people ought to vote for 10 more years of the same as we have had. It is an absurdity; it does not stand up; and attempts to misrepresent the truth do no credit to the Government. This decline that we have seen over the last eight or nine years has not been accompanied by any equity in restraint. Honourable members will remember the great catch cry that the previous Prime Minister used in his addresses to the nation: 'We will have restraint and it will be with equity'. The truth is that the rich have got richer, the poor have got poorer, and the middle class have been squeezed out of existence in this country. If people are protected, if they are favoured, if they are mates, they will do all right. They will keep their jobs and they will probably prosper as well. But if people are unprotected-the very people those opposite say they are interested in looking after, the underdogs, those who cannot look after themselves-if they happen, heaven forbid, to be unemployed; if they happen to be in small business, which is one of those dreadful statistics out there; or if happen to be unprotected farmers, they just fall through the net. If they are not members of a trade union, if they are not one of the mates, they just do not matter. If the members of this Government got out there-and perhaps took some of their union mates with them-and had a look at poverty in real Australia today, they would find a truly tragic situation. One indicator alone will suffice for my purposes this afternoon. Around 600,000 children in Australia todayremember the country that was not going to have any children living in poverty after 199(1?-are living in homes where no breadwinner is in full time employment. That is just one indicator that what the Government is trying to do is to justify the unjustifiable. The honourable member for Shortland ought to know better. The Government knows that change is needed. We have said that we will not be emulating exactly the New Zealand model, but I want to look very briefly at the Heinz takeover of Wattie Foods in New Zealand. I quote from a column called 'Peppercorn' in the Land, which reads: . This takeover sets the scene for perhaps the biggest test yet of our seriousness about becoming internationally competitive. We have to become internationally competitive in this nation because we are dependent on trade for 25 per cent of our GDP, compared with just 7 per cent in the US. Internationally competitive we will be or broke we will be, with more people than ever living in unemployment and poverty. The column continues: Heinz says it plans to use the Aucklandheadquarterd Wattie Foods, currently an ann of the Sydney-based Goodman Fielder Wattie, as a springboard for a processed foods push into Asian . markets ... Heinz chairman, Tony O'Reilly, makes no secret of the fact he sees NZ becoming ""a major manufacturing base in the growing Asia/pacific market"". He speaks glowingly of the benefits he sees accruing to his company from the NZ Government policies that have ""encouraged free trade and low-cost operator status over the past five years"". All this can only bode ill for Australia, unless or until we get our own act into gear. they I hope the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) is listening because he never stops talking about value adding. He rightly perceives that it is the key to employment and expanding prosperity in this country. It is an irony that he was for so long a head of one of the chief institutions that did away with so much of the value adding that we once undertook in this country. Nonetheless, according to the Land: Heinz, already operates two food processing plants in Australia whose future must now be in question, given Mr O'Reilly's comment that NZ operating costs are now 25pc lower than in Australia ... Pacific Dunlop, which took over Adsteam's ailing Edgells Birds Eye operations last year with an eye to expanding Asian food sales, will face an uphill battle in the Asian marketplace . . . This will happen if we cannot do something to give them an environment in which they can compete. In other words, we are not just talking about the future and potential for new value adding enterprises, we are talking about maintaining old ones. In the end, we on this side of the House are not talking about driving wages down in this country, as the Government has done. Anyone with half a wit about him knows that it does not work. Driving down wages and conditions is not the answer. As Alan Wood recently wrote: But it is not low wages or low taxes that are necessarily important; what is important is wages relative to labour productivity and taxes relative to the quality of the infrastructure and administrative efficiency. As the Australian put it in its editorial on 21 October: The federal Coalition's industrial relations policy launched yesterday will not destroy trade unionism. But it will force trade unions to perform better-or go out of business. It offers a decisive change for Australia. It is a change that is fundamental to the successful internationalisation of our economy. The document promises a ""high productivity, high wage"" result by enhancing personal freedom and flexibility among all parties in the workplace. Without that personal freedom and that flexibility we will not recover the drive and the initiative that made this country great as individual Australians were able to give of their best. If we cannot recover that, we will find that we· simply have more of what we have now: a declining base, a declining and smaller cake, with less and less to go around.",36

212,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I do.",38
213,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member may proceed.,38
214,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During the just concluded discussion the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) claimed that my attitude towards increases in salaries of members of parliament was at odds with my attitude towards increases in salaries for the generality of the work force. That was incorrect. Since Jobsback was released, I have repeatedly said that I strongly supported the same standard being applied to members of parliament as is applied to the generality of the community and that, if there were a superior way to the use of the Remuneration Tribunal as a method of reaching that conclusion, I personally would support that superior way. Obviously, the problem arises in relation to the salaries of members of parliament that, in strict theory, if we have a workplace bargain we end up bargaining with ourselves, because we are the governors as well as the governed. I simply make the point that there is no double standard. I am perfectly happy to have the vicissitudes of the market apply to salaries paid to members of parliament. I think it would bring about some interesting results.",38
215,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I am sure the honourable member has clarified the position. NA Public Works Committee Reports,38
216,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the tenth, eleventh and twelfth reports of the Committee for 1992 relating to facilities for an increased Army presence in the north; redevelopment of Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin, Northern Territory; and the defence logistics redevelopment project, Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre. Ordered that the reports be printed.",38
217,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The first report I have tabled relates to facilities for an increased Army presence in the north, stage 1. The proposal relates to the Defence Force Structure Review announced by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on 30 May 1991. One of the findings of the review determined that a Regular Anny brigade be permanently based in Darwin by the end of the decade. This will be achieved by the staged relocation of southern based units to Darwin. Approximately 2,200 service personnel will be relocated under stages 1 and 2, which will take place between 1994 and 2001. This report relates to the need to provide suitable working, training and accommodation facilities for personnel relocating under 1. The proposal consists of construction of new facilities on the Defence property near Palmerston, 20 kilometres east of Darwin; construction of new facilities and refurbishment of existing facilities at the RAAF base at Darwin for an aviation squadron; acquisition and development of an additional close training area; and acquisition of a commercial property for logistics functions. Related to this proposal is provision of an additional 350 married quarters by the Defence Housing Authority, furniture for which is to be provided out of this proposal. The estimated t9tal project cost of the proposed scope of works in outturn price is $199.74m. This equates to $173.95m at February 1992 prices. It is proposed that the stage 1 works will be contracted in a number of separate contract packages of·varied sizes to optimise local industry involvement. Subject to all necessary approvals, current plans envisage the commencement of construction in January 1993, with completion by the end of 1997. The Committee recommends the construction of facilities for an increased Anny presence in the north. The second report relates to the redevelopment of Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin. Although there has been a gradual increase in Anny strength in the north since the 1970s, there has been little development of facilities within the barracks. There is a shortage of suitable working accommodation, and existing facilities are in poor condition. Although maintenance has been carried out, there has never been an upgrade of the type proposed in this referral. The objectives of the proposed redevelopment are to provide suitable working accommodation for units located within Larrakeyah Barracks; provide suitable living-in accommodation for personnel posted to units located within Larrakeyah Barracks; provide suitable accommodation for transit and Norcom headquarters augmentation personnel; replace the large number of temporary facilities within the barracks with permanent facilities; and incorporate elements of the Datwm naval base redevelopment, stage 2. Two Aboriginal sacred sites exist within the stage site-namely, the Emery Point precinct and a sacred tree adjacent to the guardhouse. The Committee was advised by the Department of Defence that discussions have taken place with guardians of the site. As a result of these discussions, power lines will remain aboveground. The Committee. is pleased to note that the Aboriginal guardians have been issued with passes which allow them access to the area at any time. The heritage value of building 27 on the site continues to be a matter of discussion between the Department of Defence and the heritage authorities. Although the Committee doubts the heritage value of this building, it acknowledges the Department of Defence's policy of liaising with environmental bodies until differences are resolved. The estimate of total project cost in outturn prices is $28.629m. This equates to $26.4m at January 1992 prices. It is proposed that the works will be contracted with a number of separate contract packages. Subject to the necessary approvals, it is proposed that construction will commence in late 1992 and will be completed by mid-I995. The Committee recommends the redevelopment of Larrakeyah Barracks. The Committee's twelfth report concerns provision of new and refurbished warehouse facilities for the Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre, DNSDC, primarily at Moorebank, New South Wales, and at a number of other centres. The project examined by the Committee is a significant part of the defence logistics redevelopment project which will implement a centralised strategy of wholesale storage and distribution for the Australian Defence Force. The Committee has recommended that the project, which is estimated to cost $ 100m, should proceed. The Committee believes that the concept of a Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre would result in manpower savings and savings in recurrent expenditure, and would avoid duplication and double handling of stores items. At the Committee's public hearing into the proposal, the Zetland unions put forward an alternative proposal which would involve retaining the naval stores at Zetland as part the centre. After careful consideration of this proposal from the unions, the Committee has concluded that the location of the centre at Moorebank offers the advantages of reduced .costs and recurrent expenditure, increased efficiency, capacity for expansion and improved security over the Zetland alternative. Nevertheless, because the completed project will involve manpower savings which will be spread over a number of years, the Committee has recommended that there be continuing consultation between Defence and the work forces at all establishments at which redundancies are programmed to occur to ensure that the personnel involved are assisted in finding alternative employment. A formal mechanism to achieve this objective should be established. The Committee's inquiry also focused on fire detection and prevention measures to be provided at the centre. The Committee has recommended that during the development of the proposal and after the work has been completed, Defence should continue formal liaison, including site visits, with the New South Wales fire brigades. The Committee has also recommended that, as part of the study of fire risks throughout all Defence installations currently being undertaken, a formal risk management analysis of existing and proposed facilities be carried out by an independent professionally qualified fire safety consultant. Defence acknowledged that the tri-service warehousing operation proposed for the DNSDC is dependent on the supply systems redevelopment proj ectS SRP - being delivered on time. The SSRP aims to create a common core computing system to cater for the supply needs of the Australian Defence Force. The SSRP has had a chequered history and was the subject of a report recently by our colleagues on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The Committee has recommended the DNSDC project should proceed on the assumption that funds and other resources required to complete the SSRP on time will be provided.",38
218,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The of coalition welcomes the publication of these Public Works Committee reports. The first report deals with stage 1 of the Army presence in the north-APIN, as it is sometimes called. The coalition endorses the relocation of an appropriately structured brigade group formation to the north of Australia. It is regrettable that the Labor Party has refused to develop a meaningful and complete strategy for the defence of the north. This whole process seems to have been driven more by politics than by a construction of a strategy for the defence of Australia. The coalition's defence policy, which I know the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) will love to make great play of, cancels Labor's tokenistic proposal to relocate a squadron of tanks at Darwin. That decision to relocate the tanks at Darwin was made not as a result of careful deliberation but, as many people in Defence and in defence circles know only too well, on the whim of a Minister who was attending a military exercise and while looking at some tanks participating in that exercise decided it would not be a bad idea to put some of them in the north. The tanks themselves can be transferred to the north of Australia from Puckapunyal, which is the world's most effective tank rangeMrs Bailey-In the seat of MCEwen.",40
219,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"In the seat of MCEwen; and the armoured corps is ably represented by the honourable member for MCEwen, as I can attest. Those tanks can be transferred to the north of Australia, as was demonstrated during exercise K92, within a period of around 48 hours, which is a great achievement. Instead of these tokenistic and political decisions, the coalition proposes a range of initiatives that will improve the capacity of the Australian Deitu..:e Force to detect and defeat enemy forces before they land on Australian soil, in stark contrast to the defeatist approach of the Labor Party, which is to try to construct a strategy for dealing with an aggressor once it has landed in Australia. We are determined that we will defend Australia before such an incursion occurs. In addition, our policy will give added mobility to land forces based in the north by increasing from four to eight the number of Chinook helicopters brought back into service and by adding an additional company group lift of helicopters. The coalition government will locate airborne early warning and control aircraft at RAAF base Tindal in the Northern Territory. Among other initiatives for northern defence proposed by the coalition are increasing northern coastal surveillance; placing greater priority on northern oceanographic and hydrographic activities; increasing helicopter mobility by purchasing additional helicopters, as I have mentioned; developing proposals with the United States to locate a number of United States aircraft and naval vessels in Darwin; ·in addition, developing a proposal for the United States to pre-position defence equipment in northern Australia - a matter we will be taking up with the new Clinton Administration straight after the election; and providing increased flying hours for RAAF fighter pilots, which will be of considerable training benefit to pilots based at Tindal and Darwin. These measures will provide a realistic and strategically relevant defence presence in northern Australia. With regard to the second Public Works Committee report on the redevelopment of Larrakeyah Barracks in Darwin, I saw at first hand when I visited Darwin a week or so ago that the Larrakeyah Barracks are clearly in need of renovation and modernisation. Many of the facilities at Larrakeyah date back Second World War. They are clearly inadequate to perform the important functions that have been developed around Headquarters Northern Command, now located at Larrakeyah. Of course, Northern Command was established by the Fraser Government; as indeed was the Tindal air base and the Darwin patrol boat base. The coalition is therefore pleased to support the redevelopment of these facilities and commends that aspect of the report to the House. The third Public Works Committee report deals with the proposal to develop a defence national storage and redistribution centre as part of the defence logistic redevelopment project. This is a complex area, and the coalition will watch closely the redevelopment of the defence stock holding system. The coalition maintains that substantial savings can be made through rationalisation of the existing system. It may be that lower cost options for stock holding can be developed along the lines of .some of the submissions that were made to the Committee in its he-ings on DLRP. I note the concern the members of the Public Works Committee had about the impact of Labor's disastrous handling of the supply systems redevelopment project on the defence logistics redevelopment project. The supply systems redevelopment project was the subject of a highly critical report a few months ago by the Public Accounts Committee. In particular, the Public Accounts Committee criticised the SSRP for cost overruns and for failing to live up to original specifications. The computer systems being developed in the supply systems redevelopment project are, of course, crucial to the efficient running of the defence logistics redevelopment project. Therefore, the success of DLRP is contingent on Labor finding a way out of the mire it has created for itself with SSRP. The coalition will continue to monitor the development of DLRP and SSRP with great interest.",40
220,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEES,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for to the Employment, Education and Training)-by leave-Firstly, Mr Deputy Speaker, may I commend you and your Committee for the work you did in examining the proposed expenditure in the Northern Territory, even though at one point I can recall that there was a minor difference of opinion about some aspects of the way in which some things were done. Mr Downer-The correspondence makes interesting reading. I have got your letters to each other.",41
221,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEES,I hope you are learning to write. They are a great example for you.,42
222,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Hollis)Order! We might just get on with it. We all write letters to each other.,42
223,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEES,"The Public Works Committee's recommendations are very welcome. They are a most obvious sign of this Government's commitment to defence in the north. As you point out in your tabling statement, Mr Deputy Speaker, the proposals relate to the Defence Force Structure Review announced by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on 30 May 1991. One of the findings of the review determined that a Regular Arniy brigade be permanently based in Darwin by the end of the decade. This will be achieved by the staged relocation to Darwin of southern-based units, including the tanks that were referred to by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), and it will involve approximately 2,200 service personnel. In the context of expenditure, this represents the largest single commitment to construction in the Northern Territory since the reconstruction program that followed cyclone Tracy. From that point of view, it is an enormous boost to the Northern Territory economy, and one that is recognised as being so by those people involved in small business in the Northern Territory, particularly in the housing and construction industry, and those businesses that will be developing to service the needs of the defence forces. as they arrive. I want to ask those opposite whether they have a bottom line commitment to the process of deploying these defence forces to northern Australia. It is something that ought to be responsibly addressed and made known to the community in Darwin. There is no doubt that there was a great deal of concern, following the honourable member's visit to the Northern Territory, about the very lacklustre performance by him and others with him in relation to the Opposition's defence policies. Let there be no doubt that there is a great deal of concern about the proposals of those opposite, especially in relation to their inability to abide by community expectations and, specifically in the first instance, their proposal to scrap the movement of the Leopard tanks to the north. That would mean a cut of around 200 in the number of defence personnel and their dependants moving to northern Australia. The honourable member for Mayo says that, in part, these moves were made on the basis of politics. That is absurd. They were based on a very clear assessment of the needs of the defence forces in northern Australia and a very clear assessment of what was appropriate in terms of Australian defence policy-a very considered policy and one that has been applauded by most sections of the community that are objectively engaged in this debate. I conclude by thanking your Committee, Mr Deputy Speaker, and those on it from both sides of the Parliament. There is no doubt that that Committee has a very onerous responsibility and, by and large, it carries out its duties with a great deal of aplomb. Finally, I reinforce this Government's commitment to the deployment of defence personnel as a result of APIN. In relation to Larrakeyah, there is absolutely no doubt, as the honourable member for Mayo points out, of the need to upgrade those facilities and to upgrade facilities generally for Defence Force personnel-something of which this Government is justly proud.",42
224,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-All I would say first of all to the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) is that he clearly has not read the defence policy of the Opposition. It makes very clear the commitment on this side of the House to a Defence presence in the north, whether it. be the Army or the general Defence Force. We are committed to a costeffective Defence Force, and the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) made that point very succinctly in his comments. I wish to make a very brief comment about Larrakeyah, and that relates to the question of command and control. It is another element of the Opposition's pOlicy which is clearly set out in our policy document. We are committed to a command and control system within the Australian Defence Force which again will optimise the operational contribution that that Defence Force will make to our country. Not only is that reflected in the Public Works Committee report in terms of Larrakeyah and northern command specifically; but I assure the House that within our defence policy generally we are committed to a very strong command and control communications system within the Defence Force. The third point relates to the defence logistic redevelopment project. The honourable member for Mayo and indeed you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, recommended the DLRP to this Parliament but subject to the strong caveat that the supply systems redevelopment project meets its deadlines. Its history is not good. I would only say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the House that as far as this side of this chamber is concernedand it is again reflected in our policy document-that we will go along with the defence logistic redevelopment project, but subject to reviewing any aspect, whether it be SSRP or otherwise.

225,Dr KEMP,STUDENT ASSISTANCE,"There are some 25 amendments to the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1992. The fact that this Bill was only recently introduced in its unamended form into the House and then taken to the Senate is evidence of the gross disorganisation and mismanagement that is occurring on the Government· side of the chamber at the present time. It is an extraordinary fact that the Government cannot get its legislation into the House in the form in which it actually wants it passed but has to introduce large numbers of amendments to its own Bills before they are in a form which the Government feels it is able to pass through this Parliament. Many of these amendments relate to the new loans scheme which the Government is attaching to Austudy. The Government would have found this scheme very difficult to operate had these amendments not been introduced into the legislation. It is a scheme which the Government has adopted on the basis of the recommendations of the Chapman committee report. The Chapman committee saw such an arrangement as assisting with the targeting of Austudy, a matter which the Government has failed on miserably over its years in dealing with this scheme. The Government chose not to adopt the full recommendations of the Chapman committee report. In particular, it failed to adopt recommendations which would have allowed access to the loan funds by rural students who are currently excluded from Austudy by the operation of the asset test. One must say that this is all of a piece with the Government's failure to recognise in any significant way the enormous hardship which is being created for rural students at the present time by the structure of Austudy and the failure of the Government to introduce an adequate hardship provision which would allow access to Austudy by rural students whose families are in extreme economic circumstances. I remind the House that it is the policy of the coalition, under Fightback, to make Austudy available to rural students on the basis of income alone where that family is in extreme economic circumstances, and to set the asset test to one side. The absence of any particular consideration for rural students, as I say, is all of a piece with the neglect of these students in the Government's policies. I do not want to take up the time of the Committee any further except to underline the fact that this chamber is being pressured in a most extraordinary way by the Government over its legislation. Some 70 Bills were introduced into the House last week, many of these large and important Bills. A large and important Bill of this kind is being reintroduced into the chamber with 25 amendments because the Government seems to find it impossible to get its legislative act together. It.is very hard· to remember an occasion when we have had such inefficiency in the management of this chamber and such abuse of its procedures as we have seen from this Government.

226,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ASSOCIATIONS AMENDMENT BILL,"The coalition is happy to support the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Amendment Bill 1992. The original Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act was passed in 1976. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs at the time was Mi: Ian Viner. It came into operation in 1978. It was originally intended to provide a simple and cheap method of incorporation for Aboriginal organisations at a time when State legislation varied widely between States. This method of incorporation has proved popular, with over 1,600 organisations being incorporated under this legislation since 1978. OnCe incorporated, many organisations seek funding through ATSIC or oth-r Federal or State government agencies. They are then subject to regulation by the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations. In recent times it has become apparent that the power of the Registrar to ensure minimal accountability of organisations is quite limited. This Bill proposes a large number of amendments to improve. procedures of organisations, increase accountability and make organisations' financial affairs open and transparent. Basically, the amendments are as follows: first, to specify how general meetings of associations, including annual general meetings, are to be called and the procedUres for the conduct of those meetings, including provisions for proxy v:otes; second, to disqualify persons who 'have been found guilty of fraud or dishonesty from being members of the goveriling committee of an organisation- third, to set time limits for the preparation and lodgement of financial returns, to make them available to members' and to ensure that the auditor is independent of the association; fourth, to .set time limits for holding annual general meetings; fifth, to ensure that there is compliance with the rules of the association; sixth, to ensure that members of the goveriling committee act honestly and .disclose conflicts of interest; seventh, to allow the Registrar to arbitrate in disputes; eighth, to empower the Registrar to direct persons to produce any books or records; ninth, to give the Registrar power to convene meetings where requested or where the committee has resigned; tenth, to empower the Registrar to appoint an administrator in certain circumstances; eleventh, to clarify the role and function of auditors; twelfth, to introduce simple, straightforward procedures and remedies in relation to inspections and investigations; and, thirteenth, to increase from five to 25 the minimum number of people for registration of an organisation. These amendments may sound fairly simple and straightforward, and it seems quite extraordinary that they - e not already in the legislation. However, I cannot complain about that too much as it was us who originally passed the. legislation. Over time it became apParent that there were a number of deficiencies iri the Act. The Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations has been something of an orphan. It has never 'seemed to have an adequate home. With over 1,600 associations now registered under it, it has a very large workload. Over the 2lf2 years that I have been shadow Mi,nister, I have had frequent complaints about the functioning of one organisation or the other, usually from Aboriginal people.. I have witnessed three such situations first hand, all of which I think may have been avoided, or certainIybrought to a much speedier resolution, by these amendments proposed here today. The situation most in my mind concerns the Barwon Aboriginal Corporation in Walgett, which is an ongoing festering sore that has a 2lf2to three-year history. That organiS,ation's managing director is currently under charges for using pavers and an air-conditioning unit from local nursing home units for his own home and· an outstanding $36,000 Westpac Mastercard account that cannot be accounted for. Yet, extraordinarily, this person has turned up in another town and is heading another Aboriginal organisation that is currently receiving funds from the' Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. What is so bad about the Walgett situation is the effect it has had on thecoriununity. I have been to Walgett myself; the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), who represents that area, has spoken on this on' a number of occasions in Federal Parliament. It has caused enormous and deep division in the community and there has simply been no way to resolve it. When funds appeared to be missing, the local people tried to do something about it. They approached the local police, who simply did not have the skills to make the necessary investigation. They approached the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, which quite rightly said that, in the end, it was just the funding agency and was not responsible for the service delivery. The Registrar did not have the power under the Act. They were all referred to the ASC. The ASC said, 'Yes, it is our responsibility and we would be very happy to investigate this when we have finished with Alan Bond, Christopher Skase and everybody else'. In the end the New South Wales Fraud Squad went in after about two years of agitating and the local police sergeant saying that the community was like a tinder box. Some time last year I was in Central Australia, in the electorate of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon). I will not mention the community'S name, but I spent a couple of days there. There was enormous consternation in the community. Everyone had been waiting very anxiously for the annual general meeting of the local association. Although they are called annual general meetings, this association had not had one for several years. It was widely tipped that the management committee would get rolled. While I was there they actually had the AGM. They invited 10 people, all relations of the chair, and held the meeting in secret. The person was duly re-elected and the rest of the community found out two days later. That sort of thing will be stopped under these amendments. Just a couple of weeks ago I was in Cairns, where I had representations made to me by representatives of an organisation, on which I have written to the Minister. I do not think it adds anything to name the organisation. Basically, the point is that there are missing goods. There has not been a stocktake for a long period. It appears that there has been widespread, systematic pilfering. The directors of that organisation, which is riot receiving funds at the moment, are also directors of a large number of organisations around town. This causes a lot of resentment and a lot of division. These are good amendments that will enhance the accountability of Aboriginal organisations, and for that I think the Minister should be commended. Of course, whether anything meaningful comes will depend on the resources of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations. With 1,600 organisations, that is a fairly daunting task. In the end, it is only if the Registrar has the power and the facilities to actively pursue complaints that anything will happen. The second part of this Act relates to Aboriginal councils. It is curious that, despite the fact that the Act was passed through the Parliament 16 years ago and has been in operation for 14 years, there has never been a council incorporated under this Act. Councils can incorporate under State or Territory legislation and they generally choose to do this. It would seem somewhat superfluous to have this part in, given that it has been there for such a long period and no-one has chosen to use it. Looking at the incorporation of Aboriginal organisations generally, there is one amendment that I think is particularly worthwhile. It increases the number of people required for registration from five to 25. Very strong anecdotal evidence has been put to me on more than one occasion by Aboriginal people of what has been happening here. It is very easy to incorporate as an Aboriginal organisation under this legislation. Mr Deputy Speaker, it would be quite easy, for example, to have the Colin Hollis golf club. All you would need is four friends to sign up and you would be an incorporated organisation. That does not mean that the organisation would immediately be funded by ATSIC. What it does mean is that, as an incorporated association, it would have significant privileges which include, in some cases, sales tax exemption. This might mean that a person's home telephone or home fridge or a variety of other products could be purchased sales tax free. I have no concrete evidence that this happens, but I only have to talk to Aboriginal groups. The anecdotal stories are legion. It would seem that increasing the number of people from five to 25 is very sensible. Maybe that will do something about the explosion of incorporated organisations which appears to have happened under this Act. Looking at the long term, these orby ganisations have a certain life cycle. I understand that the Registrar is currently undertaking an audit of all the organisations incorporated under the Act since 1978 that, so far, about 400 have been found to completely non-functioning but, nonetheless, still registered. I wonder whether in the long term we should be looking to move orof ganisations across under the jurisdiction ASC. I understand that ATSIC considered this recently but that there was divided opinion and, on balance, it felt that at this stage it wanted to have organisations incorporated under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act. That is fine; but it would seem to me that, in the longer term, if we could adequately grandfather existing organisations so that they were able to transfer across with minimal inconvenience, it would probably be a much better thing to have Aboriginal organisations incorporated under the ASC. When this Act was originally passed in 1976 there was a very great need for it and, to some extent, there is still a need for it today. But that need will not always be there. In 1976, the skill base in Aboriginal communities was almost non-existent. Our work in the last 15 years has meant that that skill base has been quite dramatically improved and specific programs, such as the Aboriginal organisation training, have contributed to that. It would certainly be my view that in the long term-in consultation, and hopefully in concert, with ATSIC-we should be looking to move to incorporate this organisation under the jurisdiction of the Australian Securities Commission.",47
227,Mr SNOWDON,ASSOCIATIONS AMENDMENT BILL,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (4.50 p.m.)-I thank the honourable member for is Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) for allowing me some time to speak. My friend the honourable member for Aston (Mr Riggall) wishes to difficulty make a short contribution, so I will not take very long. I want to raise a couple of issues which refer directly to part ill of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act, which deals . with councils. I take on board what was said the honourable member opposite. But I point out to him that one of this Parliament's reports entitled Our future: our selves-which was released at a time when I think he was a and member of the House of Representatives be Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairsaddresses the very issue of incorporation and the question of incorporation under this piece legislation. At paragraph 3.17 of that of the document the Committee concluded: ... some cornmunities may not prefer to incorporate under the Local Government Act as thiS may allow them to remain at arm's length from government control. The Committee believes that the wishes of these communities should be respected. I take on board the honourable member's point that there have been no incorporations under this Act. However, I am aware of a community which is attempting to incorporate at present and I know that a number of others in the Northern Territory are attempting to incorporate under this piece of legislation. The difficulty I have is not with the legislation; it is with the way in which the Northern Territory Government is using its influence and attempting to force people into incorporating under the community government legislation in the Northern Territory. As the honourable member rightly pointed out, a large number of incorporated bodies, in the Northern Territory in this instance, carry out local government functions-and are recognised as doing so by this Government and the Northern Territory Government-with funding which they receive through financial assistance grants under the States Grants (Financial Assistance) Act. The fact is that most of those are incorporated under Northern Territory legislation. However, the point I wish to make is that it true that there are communities that wish to . have as an option the right to incorporate under the Commonwealth legislation. The I have is that without that right, we are, from their point of view, precluding them from expressing appropriately what they might see as a choice in terms of selfmanagement and self-determination. It is true that currently in at least one instance-and I heard of others this morning-the Northern Territory Government is basically using funding as a vehicle to try to influence communities not to incorporate under this legislation. In fact, what it is doing in some instances is saying to Aboriginal communities that if they do incorporate, or seek to incorporate, under this legislation they will not be recognised for local government purposes by the Northern Territory Government. That is a matter of grave concern to me. It indicates that the Northern Territory Government is not prepared to allow Aboriginal people the right to make these decisions. That is what is at the heart of my concern. I accord with the honourable member in terms of his comments about the need for appropriate accountability in the structures under which Aboriginal people incorporate. Obviously, especially where public moneys are concerned they have to be accountable, through the Minister, to this Parliament. It would be totally inappropriate if they were not. I think the amendments which have been made in this legislation make it very clear that it is this Parliament's expectation that they will be so accountable. I agree with the honourable member's comments in that regard. It is important to remember that Aboriginal people around Australia-and we have mentioned the 1,600 incorporations-incorporate for a whole range of reasons. They may incorporate for the purposes of housing, land ownership, essential service provision, pastoral and agricultural organisations, airlines and other transport companies-this is certainly the case in my electorate-medical services, computer companies, and the list goes on. I conclude by recalling recommendation No. 199 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which stated: That Governments recognise that a variety of organisational structures have developed or been adapted by Aborigina1 people to deliver services, including local government-type services to Aboriginal communities. These structures include community councils recognised as local government authorities, outstation resource centres, Aboriginal land councils and co-operatives and other bodies incorporated under Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation as Councils or associations. Organisational structures which have received acceptance within an Aboriginal community are particularly important, not only because they deliver services in a manner which makes them accountable to the Aboriginal communities concerned but also because acceptance of the role of such organisations recognises the principle of Aboriginal self-determination. The Commission recommends that Government s40uld recognise such diversity in organisational structures and that funding for the delivery of services should not be dependent upon the structure of organisation which is adopted by Aboriginal communities for the delivery of such services. I commend that statement to the honourable member and ask him whether he is in discussion with the Northern Territory Government and his confreres in the Northern Territory to perhaps seek to influence them to stop this approach of blackguarding Aboriginal communities and organisations which seek to incorporate under this legislation and allow them to so incorporate and receive the recognition which they so justly deserve.",49
228,Mr NUGENT,ASSOCIATIONS AMENDMENT BILL,"Aston) (4.56 p.m.}-Given that we are under guillotine and there is not much time, I will set aside my prepared speech and try to make two or three fairly quick points. As the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation (Mr Tickner), who is at the table, is only too well awarebecause it was part of his initiative-and as the rest of the chamber is aware, one of the things we are embarking upon with the Aboriginal community in this country at the moment is a process of reconciliation. As the only member of this chamber who is a member of the Council for· Aboriginal Reconciliation, I make the point that before we will achieve any reasonable degree of reconciliation between the Aboriginal community and the broader community in this country and begin to address some issues of real disadvantage, we will actually have to change some hearts and minds in terms of perception. I believe one of the problems in changing those hearts and minds, in terms of the way in which the broader community looks at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander comripped munity, concerns how it believes the objectives indigenous community handles money. There is no doubt that the stories are legion-often they are exaggerated but, unfortunately, many times are true-of very unfortunate instances where money has been wasted, not spent properly and so on. I will not go into lots examples of that this afternoon, but on a number of occasions Auditor-General's spend reports have brought these sorts of matters light. Therefore, it seems to me that it is in interests of everybody-that is both sides of the reconciliation process-that this sort legislation, which I certainly support, should come in. In my view, it will help to make the legislation more effective and start to put in order some of the basic mechanics in terms of accounting so that we can put to one side the red herring of how money is wasted, looked after, or proceedures are not followed, and we can actually get down to looking at what should be the substantive business of sorting out the disadvantage which is very real and which needs to be addressed so urgently in this country. The second point I will make is about education. As I have travelled around this country in the last 21/2 years volved in this area, it seems to me that one of the major problems-and obviously in all organisations there are people who act improperly for base motives-has been a lack of education and training. I think it will assist if we can appoint somebody-as this amendment proposes to do-who has greater queues powers and can step in and, not just require that things be done properly, but actually help t6 make sure that things are done properly. A lot of the people who are responsible running meetings, issuing minutes and doing the accounting at the moment do not have the education, the business background, the community management background, or the training to understand or do those things properly. It seems to me that they have often suffered from appointing accountants-often non-Aboriginal accountants-to various community organisations who have not lasted the very long; who have blown through and off the system. It would appear that the of this Bill will help in the future the people who are not well equipped to look after their affairs l'roperly. Finally-I am conscious that the time alloted for the debate has almost expired-the 1,600 organisations equate to about one of organisation for 156 people. Perhaps we need to get that balance more into kilter so that we less time on administration and accounto ting and more time on delivery of services.",50

231,Mr BEALE,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,"There are two huge and scandalous queues in Australia: the queue for public hospitals and the queue for public houses. Both of these queues result from Government incompetence and both reflect the ideology of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) and his supporters. Unlike the Minister and his socialist allies we, in the coalition, for want to see an expansion of family and individual ownership of property. The ownership of property is a guard against poverty; it is a protection against gross government mismanagement of the economy, as we are presently seeing; and it is a safeguard against the power of the State. We want to redllce the queues by rebuilding a nation of home owners. We want to continue the work of Menzies and depart from the legacy of Whitlam, Uren and Howe. The Australian Labor Party's policies are generally directed to increasing the dependency of citizens on the State and its hand-outs. We, in the coalition, want a nation of independent, prosperous property owners with pride in their families and pride in their communities. To those ends, we will implement our commitment to home ownership by slashing personal income tax rates, by allowing ,first home buyers access to superannuation, and by restoring the first home owners scheme. We are also committed to a climate that favours investment instead' of spending and from that investment will follow a reduction in the one million unemployed and an increase in home buying capacity. Given the poverty the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) have created, we will not oppose the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill. Public housing is a necessity in the current economic ciiniate. However, when our investment policies have reduced poverty, Australia will see a huge reduction in the public housing lists. Anyone whose brain has not been addled. by Labor Party factional meetings can understafid these points. Salvation is only an election away. The tighter administrative and funding controls which. this Bill puts in place are welcome. However, we are concerned about the Government.'s sneaky attempt to lock us into a forward three-year agreement. The housing industry has suffered under the worse of the recession. Record high mortgage interest rates, high unemployment and low consumer confidence have seen housing demand and building activity plummet. In 1988-89, dwelling unit approvals were about 186,000; in 1989-90, they were 140,000; in 1990-91, they were down further to 126,000. While approvals piCked up in the 1991-92 year, this was largely in the latter half of year and can be partly attributed to low home mortgage interest rates. However, with pentup demand now spent and very few buyers 'trading up', the increase in dwelling construction is showing signs of levelling out and may even have started to decline again. Indeed, in the last three months dwelling unit approvals have fallen, while the survey of volume builders of the Housing Industry Association indicates that new home sales are also falling. Against this background, the Government has introduced funding arrangements for public housing for the next three years under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. This agreement is the vehicle through which the Commonwealth delivers funding for public housing, community housing and a number of smaller crisis and emergency accommodation programs. The Commonwealth and the States negotiated and signed a: new 10-year agreement in 1989. Key features of that agreement are: guaranteed fuhding for 10 years, provided on a three-year forwardrolling commitment program; the provision of funding solely in the form of grants; a requirement for the States to match half of the grant with their own funds; the distribution of funds on a per capita basis; and agreement for the States to direct a proportion of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement funds toward home' purchase programs. . In terms of administration, the agreement introduced a new Commonwealth-State housing planning process and established independent appeal mechanisms for public housing tenants. The agreement funds are directed toward a number of areas, including public hou-ing, crisis accommodation support programs and mortgage and rent relief. In 1990-91 around $960m was allocated to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, including Aboriginal housing. Of this, about $793m was given to the StateS in untied grants to be directed toward public housing. This amount allocated for public housing is used in a number of different ways. About 70 per cent is earmarked for the purchase and construction of - ew dwellings and for capital upgrades to existing dwelLings. The remaining the amount is used for administrative and maintenance purposes, as· well as to provide rent subsidies for low income tenants in public housing. The States are required to match Commonwealth contributions. The Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement is discussed every three years by the Commonwealth, States and Territories, at which time the forward three-year funding is negotiated, as well as reforms to administrative and planning arrangements. In that context, a Commonwealth-State Housing Ministers meeting was held in September this year. The Bill before the House amends the Housing Assistance Act 1989 to extend the period of guaranteed funding under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement for a further three years. The Bill also improves the financial management procedures. In negotiating the proposed funding package, the Commonwealth sought to make the States more accountable for their housing plans and funding priorities, to encourage them to more finely target their activities, and to make them more responsive to the needs of the community. Given that the States have largely a free rein in spending public housing funds, these refonns are long overdue and are supported by the coalition parties. In return for the negotiated level of funding, the States have agreed to provide the Commonwealth with three-year rolling plans, dwelling construction targets and regular reports on housing activities. The Commonwealth will assess the plans against its own database of public housing needs to ensure that the States are meeting demand. States are also to provide the Commonwealth with regular reports on public housing activities in process. The Commonwealth will also assess these reports on activity against the management plans submitted by the States. To enhance financial management of housing funds, the Commonwealth will now pay those funds one month in advance of need, based on the dwelling construction and expenditure information provided by the States. This measure is expected to save the Commonwealth $5Om in the 1993-94 year. The coalition is concerned that the Minister haS acted with such speed to lock in a new three-year agreement, especially in light of the fact that an election is looming and those opposite will not be in government this time next year. Mrs Jakobsen-Oh, yes, they will be.",51
232,Mr BEALE,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,You will not be here eithersince you are interjecting-you and four or five of your mates in the west- .,53
233,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,Mr Hollis)The honourable member for Bruce will continue his remarks through the Chair.,53
234,Mr BEALE,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,"The Bill appropriates $4.7 billion to the States over four years. An amount of $1,059 billion is in respect of the current financial year while the remainder, broken down as follows, gives the forward three-year funding commitment: for 1993-94 $1,081 billion; for 1994-95, $1,010 billion; and for 1995-96, $1,018 billion. The Bill also implements the Government's Budget announcement to bring forward some Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement expenditure to generate employment. Seventy-five million dollars has been brought forward for expenditure in this financial year, and $25m in the 1993-94 year. The housing industry is generally in favour of this measure as it will guarantee some work to an industry which suffered badly under the recession. As already mentioned, pent up demand is now largely spent, and demand is moving onto a plateau or even starting to decline. However, this measure is a damning indictment of the Government and its economic policies that have left nearly a million of our fellow Australians unemployed. To complement the new cash management arrangements agreed to in the course of discussions between Ministers, the Bill enables any Commonwealth grants allocated to a State in a particular grant year, but not paid in that year, to be held over until the following year. Given that the States currently spend all their Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement funds in order not to lose them this measure will encourage more discretionary spending patterns, ensuring the States better meet housing needs and get value for money. In making these changes to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, the Minister should have taken the opportunity to undertake far-reaching changes which would meet the growing needs of public housing. Public housing waiting lists grew by nearly 21,000, or 10 per cent, over the last financial year. My colleague the honourable member for  this appalling state of affairs in a press release accommodation. he put out today headed 'Public Housing Waiting Lists Increase'. The shadow Minister for housing has said that 223,469 families and individuals were waiting for public housing as at 30 June 1992, up from 202,719 in June, 1991. I hope that, when the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) responds, she will explain to the House and to the Australian people how public housing waiting lists have now gone up to over 223,000. She might also try to explain to the House and the Australian people why, in Victoria, public housing waiting lists have gone from 39,000 to nearly 51,000, an increase of 31 per cent. When she is explaining this to the House, maybe she can refer to the fact that that was the last year of a disastrous Labor Party Government in Victoria-as dis-trous as the Labor Party Government in Western Australia. This appalling increase in public housing waiting lists, from nearly 203,000 to nearly 224,000, is a savage indictment of the Government. It is tangible proof of the devastation caused by the Prime Minister and his economic policies. For all that the Prime Minister heaps scorn on the coalition parties in this Parliament-as he did today-I have to tell those opposite that out in the real world people are not worried too much about the scorn displayed in this House. But they are surely worried about a million unemployed; they are surely worried about the possibility of losing their jobs; they are surely worried about the rolling recession we are in; and they are surely worried about the public housing waiting lists. Record high interest rates, the economic recession, and nearly a million unemployed have pushed many families into housing poverty. While housing affordability may currently be at satisfactorily levels, this is little consolation to those without a job or, if employed, living in fear. of losing their job. Nor is it any consolation to the 223,469 who are living in housing crisis. With so many Australians seeking affordable housing, the Keating Government must accept that the public housing system is not working and look at other ways of providing affordable . The Government could do no better than to adopt the initiatives outlined in the Fightback program. The coalition will retain the fundamentals of the current public housing system; that is, the Commonwealth and States will collectively retain responsibility for public housing, administer public housing, and provide rental rebates to those low income public tenants. However, we will shift the responsibility for the purchase, construction and ownership of new dwellings in which public tenants are housed from the public sector to the private sector, with the States effectively leasing those dwellings on a long term· basis. This will provide many more houses for those in housing crisis, but without the associated high capital. costs. Given this, the Commonwealth and the States will also be responsible for providing a return to the private sector institutions for the use of the houses. To some extent the Fightback proposal takes into account. the New South Wales Government arrangement with the Australian Mutual Provident Society. However, the States will be given the flexibility to develop other innovative funding proposals in conjunction with the private sector. By the middle of next year, perhaps all but one of those States will have Liberal National Party governments. Negotiations will be much easier then than any which the Government might choose to have now. The coalition New South Wales Government was the first to get a State Government-private sector partnership up and rurtning. Mr Howe interjecting",53
235,Mr BEALE,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,"You, coming from Victoria, ought not to be interjecting like that. Under the agreement the AMP Society contributed $146m to acquire a portfolio of a thousand houses which are, in· turn, used to house public tenants in the first instance. The houses acquired are located all over the Sydney metropolitan region and are indistinguishable from other privately owned houses in those areas. This differs significantly from the old style public housing estates-and I think we would find a few of them in the Minister's electorate-and has the social advantage of integrating public housing tenants into the community. Once the first public tenant vacates the property, AMP has the option of either selling the property, allowing it to be let to another public sector tenant, or offering it to a private tenant. The day to day management of the portfolio is undertaken by the Department of Housing. As such, tenants deal only with the Department. Similarly, responsibility for repairs and maintenance of the portfolio rests with the Department. The advantage to AMP accrues in two ways: firstly, the organisation receives a real rental yield on the properties; secondly, it will realise a capital gain on the sale of the properties guaranteed by the State Government to be equivalent, at least, to the consumer price index. For AMP, it also represents an investment which has less risk than the commercial property and share markets. The New South Wales Government is required to subsidise the rent payable by tenants-based on the cost recovery formula-up to that which the property would attract in the marketplace. Overall, the result of the scheme is that the New South Wales Government has the use of a portfolio of houses for 'a term of 20 years without having to outlay any capital or incur any borrowings while at the same time being able to costeffectively house low income earners. It is entirely possible that these new arrangements may result in an increase in the number of public houses. According to the Housing Industry Association, the New South Wales Government-AMP arrangement has the capacity to increase substantially the effectiveness of the spending of public housing funds. The Housing Industry Association, in its Housing: towards 2000 document, said: Subsidies sufficient to support three times as tenants (with security of tenure, and rents calculated in the usual public housing formula) provided through the rental trust arrangement compared with conventional capital funding of public housing stock. The scheme also involves taking advantage of depreciation allowance available to taxpaying suppliers of rental investment property, and in effect uses capital funds to generate income to pay producer subsidies, rather than devoting the funds directly to construction. The scheme is capable of making the use of public housing funds considerably more effective in terms of support for their target group. Its widespread adoption would certainly improve the capacity of State Governments to support low income households. A 1984 study indicated that, for a given outlay, more dwellings could be leased than purchased or constructed, thUs providing more accommodation to those in housing need. According to the study, for $lm of 'annualised' costs, 162 households could be assisted into newly' constructed single unit dwellings, between 190 and 250 households could be assisted into purchased established dwellings, and 269 households could be assisted into dwellings acquired by a government through long term leases-an increase of 40 per cent over the number assisted into constructed dwellings. There is some evidence from overseas that there has been a shift in the public housing system away from construction towards long term leasing of private sector owned units. That is certainly the experience in the United States. Not only has it been found to be more cost effective, but it also has a positive impact on the national and State budgets.",54
236,Mr HOWE,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,What a great model.,55
237,Mr BEALE,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,"In relation to great models, I will refer to the Minister's State of Victoria. The number of people on public housing waiting lists, as at 30 June 1991, was 38,935. Mr Hawker-Is this Victoria?",55
238,Mr BEALE,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,"This is in Victoria. This is in the last year of the disastrous former Labor Government in Victoria. At 30 June 1992, the figure was up to 50,482 people-a 31 per cent increase under the former Victorian Labor Government. It is no good for the many Minister to interject about models. His colleagues down there, and he federally, presided can be over an absolute disaster in Victoria. Because the States have leased the houses for a minimum period of 20 years from the private sector institutions, and because they are for all intents and purposes the landlord, security of tenure for public housing tenants is guaranteed. Because the dwellings to be provided by the private sector will be across a range of locations, integration of public housing tenants with other members of the community will occur. There will no longer be any public housing developments, nor the stigma associated with living in these identifiable areas. There is also a case to be made for tightening eligibility criteria for public housing tenants. Currently, a large number of public housing tenants are not low income earners. According to a study by the Real Estate Institute of Victoria Ltd, almost 7 cent of Victorian public housing tenants earn incomes of $40,000 a year or more. Although they do not receive a rental rebate, they do pay less than the market rent on their houses, because public housing rents are set on a recovery rather than on a market rent basis. There is some argument for the regular income testing of all public housing tenants, requiring those above a set income to move into the private market. This would then free up some public houses to accommodate those on the waiting list, who in the meantimethanks to this Government, this Minister, and the Victorian Labor Party, which, fortunately, has just been thrown out of office-are living in housing poverty. Unlike this Government, which appears committed to increasing dependency on welfare, the coalition will give people jobs and the capacity to own their own homes. The coalition has always been strongly committed to the principle of home ownership. We have maintained this commitment in Fightback by exempting the final sale price of a house from the proposed goods and services tax. Moreover, we have strengthened our commitment by adopting additional measures to put home ownership within the reach of a greater number of Australians, and to stimulate demand for the services of the building and construction industries. By removing $20 billion in taxes on business, the coalition in government will create up to two million jobs over the balance of this decade. We will enable many young Australian families to realise their dream of owning their own homes by reintroducing the first home owners scheme, which will provide a one-off direct payment to individuals and families. A payment of $2,000 per household will be made available to all first home buyers with a combined income of $40,000 a year or less. The coalition will also provide access for first home buyers to up to 75 per cent of their accumulated superannuation contributions for use as a deposit or part deposit on a home.",55
239,Mr HOWE,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,You're hopeless.,56
240,Mr BEALE,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,"What did the Minister saycoming from him and his Socialist Left per mates! Look at the disaster they have given us in Victoria! This will be of major benefit to low income earners, in particular, who often find saving cost for a deposit the greatest barrier to home ownership. Access to superannuation should also reduce the size of mortgages taken out by first home buyers, as well as their interest bills, both of which would ultimately be reflected in lower mortgage servicing costs. Those saving for a deposit on a home will be assisted by our plans to introduce a tax free savings scheme. Under the scheme, families with a taxable income of below $50,000 a year will be able to earn up to $2,000 in interest from new net savings completely tax free. Individuals with a taxable income of below $50,000 a year will be able to earn up to $1,000 in interest from the net new savings tax free. Those on taxable incomes greater than $50,000 a year will gain through a rebate of 30c in each dollar of interest income earned, up to a maximum of $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for families. The massive 30 per cent income tax cuts offered by the coalition, along with increases to family allowance and other government payments, will give individuals and families a higher after tax income out of which to service their mortgages. According to the Real Estate Institute of Australia, the coalition's new tax rates will reduce the amount of after tax disposable income needed to repay a mortgage from the . present national average of 32.4 per cent to just 30.1 per cent, or by nearly $2,140 a year. The coalition's commitment to a low inflation rate policy will ensure that housing prices remain stable and within the reach of ordinary Australian families, something that the waiting lists indicate this Government is completely unable to do. Importantly, the coalition will not seek to use the housing industry as a tool of economic policy, which was the main cause of the damaging boombust cycle over which this Government has presided for the last two cycles.",56
241,Mrs JAKOBSEN,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,"I found the rhetoric of the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) in this debate quite laughable and dishonest. It is elitist nonsense for the honourable member to talk about home ownership, but not to talk about the difficulties confronting people in public housing under a Liberal govel'IlDlent-if they were ever so unfortunate enough 'to have one. In that circumstance, there would be very little assistance indeed going to public housing. I will mention that aspect later. Far from salvation being only an election away as the honourable member for Bruce claims, in the unlucky and unlikely event of a coalition victory, it will certainly be damnation day for public housing tenants in Australia. These are the people who are spurned by the Opposition and who are insulted by its Leader. That is unforgivable. Furthermore, the flow-on effects of the GST add $5,000 to the price of a house in Sydney. Therefore, the Opposition's offer to first home owners of $2,000, or sometimes a little more, merely compensates for this new impost, and in most cases does not compensate for it. The honourable member mentioned the AMP model. It should be remembered that AMP houses must be sold regularly to realise their capital gain, thus disrupting tenants who, of course, are the least of the Opposition's worries. This also shifts the capital gain from the public sector to, the private sector, with taxpayer subsidy. It is typical old Liberal Party rubbish-capitalise the profits and socialise the losses. The Housing Assistance Amendment Bill, about which I have been asked to speak this afternoon, extends the period of guaranteed funding under the 1989 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement from 1 July 1993 to June 1996. It guarantees forward year funding essential for effective planning by States and Territories. The comments of the honourable member for Bruce were fairly cynical. He asked why the Government would want to introduce this Bill now. It is necessary to do it now. These matters are not to be dealt with on an ad hoc basis. They are done by the Government in a properly negotiated approach with the States. The Bill provides for more than $4 billion over the next four years for public housing under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. It ensures that there will be more than 400,000 public housing units available by 1996. The honourable member skirted around these matters as if they were not worthy of mention. In return for this funding, a package of reforms has been negotiated with the States and Territories to improve the delivery of housing assistance. For the past 50 years, public housing has been delivered almost exclusively by the State housing authorities and this will assist State housing authorities to meet the changing needs and demands of the communities they serve. I think that we cannot go past the fact that the State housing authorities and the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement provide a major boom and boost for people on low incomes or in disadvantaged circumstances who r-uire assistance to get into affordable rental housing. The negotiated reforms to the 1989 CSHA include establishment of a new-type program for community housing as part of a supply initiative to enhance choice, appropriateness and flexibility of housing for people on low incomes. I recall being involved in a discussion in the office of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) a earlier this year about this particular program. It is a very laudable program. The community sector wants to have a program of this nature and the churches have also agreed to be involved. Many community groups would have an interest in getting involved in this housing program. The introduction of this program will enhance the access of people on low incomes to affordable and responsive housing. This Bill provides security of tenure and increased control and participation by tenants. The reasons why people want to get into public housing is that they will have security of tenure. Improved planning arrangements are also included in the package. These arrangements will replace the present annual Commonwealth-State plans with three-year rolling plans. This, too, is an aid to the States in their planning and ensures that they are not actually planning retrospectively, in other words getting their money and then putting up theplans. There is also increased accountability through new cash management arrangements. The recent Federal Budget announced a comprehensive housing reform agenda. I compliment the Minister for instituting a housing reform agenda which lays the foundations for housing policy to the year 2000. It is a fiscally responsible package. It is an integrated set of policies for housing and urban development which will ensure that all Aus-alians, .whether they be home buyers, pubhc housmg tenants or renters in the private rental market, have access to secure and affordable housing. I would have thought that this House as a whole could agree on a program of'housing reform which would benefit all Australians. This is not a party political point. A decent and secure housing arrangement for the people of Australia is an important aspect of housing policy. These policies will encourage the development of a much greater range of housing types to meet the needs of our increasingly diverse society. Most honourable members would agree that, on. average, people are marrying later, having children later, having fewer children and have diff-rent circumstances from what they preVIously had. All of these factors lead to a smaller average size of household. Almost half of the households today have only one or two people living in them, yet 80 per cent of Australian housing comprises buildings with three or more bedroOlns on large blocks of land designed for larger family households. Mr Beale-You are going to tax them.",57
242,Mrs JAKOBSEN,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,"Like Kennett is doing in Victoria. Does the honourable member want the Government to advertise that? It is a very fair and just policy when poor people are paying as much as the honourable member for Bruce's rich mates! Julian, you ought to know better than that. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The honourable member knows better than to refer to other members other than by their proper titles.",58
243,Mrs JAKOBSEN,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,"Indeed-the rich mates of the honourable members for Bruce. I am sorry, M-dam Deputy Speaker. For example, one partIcular concern is the current lack of appropriate housing for older people in middle suburbs. Yet the same suburbs have street after. street of family-type detached housing, many on large blocks, often difficult for older people to maintain and with planning restrictions which limit the opportunity to build more compact dwellings on smaller areas of land. There is a demonstrated need to expand housing choices in Australia and to expand the opportunities for people, so that they are able to participate fully in economic, social and political life. It is important to give groups such as sole parents the choice to live in housing areas with good access to employment, transport and child-care rather than on the urban fringes or non-suburban areas. Mr Hawker-Where are the jobs?",58
244,Mrs JAKOBSEN,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,"I would not advise the honourable member to interrupt, because he is putting himself in a very difficult position. The Opposition's policy does nothing to assist people already disadvantaged to access housing in areas where jobs exist. All those opposite would do is give them some rent assistance so that. they can busily compete with other people who have much better means and with jobs already in areas where there is employment; rather, those opposite would push people out to the urban fringes where they can afford to have their rental housingMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The time allotted for the remaining stages of the Bill has expired. The question is that the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Madam DEPUTY SPEA-ER-Order! The question now is that the remaining stages of the Bill be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA CHEMICALS (ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1992 Second Reading [COGNATE BILL: NA CHEMICALS AMENDMENT BILL 1992] Debate resumed from 3 November, on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time.",58
245,Mr LLOYD,AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY,"Murray-Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia) (5.42 p.m.)The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Bill 1992 and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Amendment Bill 1992 establish the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, which will replace the existing eight separate State and Territory registration bodies. It is another step towards the national registration of these chemicals. Preparation for this legislation commenced in 1967. In July 1991 the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments agreed to replace those existing eight bodies with a single national scheme. As I said before, we have one statutory authority coming into replace eight existing bodies, but these Bills do not change the arrangements for the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. I am told that another Bill will be introduced in the autumn sittings-I guess that remains to be seen-to do that job. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will have the power to direct the Authority in exceptional circumstances, but if he does he must present the direction to both Houses of parliament and it has to be reported in the Authority's annual report. The Authority will have eight part time directors appointed by the Minister for three years. They will come from the industry, State governments, the rural sector, the trade union movement and consumer organisations. The Authority must fully recover its costs from the agvet chemical industry over the next four years. To give the Authority maximum flexibility to operate in a business like manner, free of government and Public Service restraints, it can set the terms and conditions of employment for its staff. The Authority is being established before the main legislation relating to the national registration scheme to allow it to contribute to the development of the legislation it will administer and to consult with industry groups. The Bills are supported by the agricultural and' veterinary chemicals industry; they are also supported by the coalition parties. The agricultural and veterinary chemical industry is a very important one in maintaining the international competitiveness of Australian agriculture. We also have a situation where Australian agriculture is one of the least intensive users of agricultural and veterinary chemicals of any country in the world. Australian agriculture has also been one of the most careful users of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. That is a positive image and situation that we should continue to exploit with our exports to other countries. Australian agriculture is not a heavy user of chemicals compared with many other cpuntries because, first of all, our agriCUlture is extensive rather than intensive. This means that it haS a low input cost system because it only gets a low return in export markets. Much of our agricultural area has low rainfall and this creates certain restraints on the use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals from a cost effectiveness point of view. Also, much of our agriculture is grazing, livestock production, rather than cropping. Generally speaking, cropping forms of agriculture are heavier users of agricultural and veterinary chemicals than the grazing industry. At present, we have the sad situation in the sheep industry where the industry would be better off if it could afford to use more veterinary chemicals than is presently the case, a situation brought about by the low returns to many of those sheep farmers. Horticulture is a more intensive user but it has adopted a positive policy to reduce the use of agricultural chemicals. I was present at the Australian Canning Fruit growers Association conference this morning in Griffith when the growers ""referred to their program to reduce as much as possible the use of agricultural chemicals. They reminded everybody, as I do, that they are paying for at least 50 per cent of the necessary research for the transfer, where possible, from chemical to biological control in that industry. The growers have a legitimate complaint because, while in Australia there are restrictions on the use of chemicals and on residue with regard to fruit, vegetables, meat and so forth, at this stage there are not the same requirements on the products coming into Australia with"" which they have to compete. That is an unfair situation as well as one that is not in the best interests of the consumer. I know that progress is being made in this area; I just hope that it accelerates so that we have a situation where the standards required for people producing food in Australia are applied equally to that food, or whatever it may be, which is being imported. ""There is also a dilemma in the agricultural industry over chemical usage. This is particularly so in the cropping sector, where one could argue that the less use it makes of chemicals, such as those used for chemical ploughing, the better. On the other hand, using a chemical method requires far less energy because of the reduced number of passes with a tractor and implements needed than when using the physical method. The chemical method also maintains the soil structure far better than the four or five passes of equipment made with the traditional physical methods of crop preparation. I can see many situations where chemical usage in this area is very positive after taking into account the total policy of sustainable development, cost benefits and reducing energy use. The cost of registration was also raised at this fruit growers conference this morning, and $20,000 is the fee for the registration of a new chemical. It was pointed out that some agricultural chemicals are not used to any great extent-that is, they have a specific and narrow use in a particular industry-yet the same fee is required. This does make it very difficult. There are one or two examples where it has been claimed that we may not, as a result, have the advantage of these chemicals in Australia. I have been advised that, with the new system and the hoped for improvements in efficiency, it will be possible for that registration figure to be halved to $10,000 plus a formula applied as an annual fee. If that annual fee is based, as I understand it will be, on the amount of a particular chemical that is sold, I guess that would be a move in the right direction for important but low usage chemicals. There would obviously not be a great annual fee for those chemicals. The establishment of this National Registration Authority is a step in the right direction. Like most things in Australia, it takes time to get something uniform and in place. I would hope that we can see more of these things in the near future, with further progress being made not only in this area of policy but also on the other point I raised concerning uniform labelling, packaging and requirements for imported foods being of the same standard as Australian products. The coalition supports the legislation.",59
246,Mr COURTICE,AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY,"Hinkler) (5.50 p.m.)The purpose of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Bill and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Amendment Bill is to implement the Government's decision of June 1992 to establish the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. The amendment BiII provides changes to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988 which will facilitate the administration Bill establishing the National Registration Authority. As an interim measure until the new national registration legislation is considered in the 1993 autumn sittings, the Authority will take over the powers and functions of the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council. The Authority will have eight part time directors who are appointed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). The relationship between the Authority and the Minister will be at a strategic leve1. The Minister's approval is required for the Authority's estimates, corporate plan and annual operational plan. The Authority's annual report is required to be tabled in parliament. One of the functions of the Council is amended to widen the scope of the advice it can provide. Two additional functions are given to the Authority, as agreed by the States and Territories. Neither the amendment Bill nor the administration Bill will have any significant effect on government expenditure. In August 1991 the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments agreed to the establishment of a national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals-one national scheme to replace what at the time were eight State and Territory schemes. In July 1992 the Commonwealth Government announced that it would establish t4e National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals to undertake the Commonwealth responsibility for registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. Introducing the registration the 1993 autumn sittings will provide an extended period for consultation .with the States, Territories and other stakeholders and will allow the board of the Authority to participate in the consultation process. The Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia addressed 25 recommendations, directly or indirectly, .to the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Counci1. The Council has implemented the Government's response in respect of 12 of these recommendations. The National Registration Authority will have ongoing responsibility for eight recommendations and the newly formed policy unit in the Department will have ongoing responsibility for five recommendations. The Senate Select Committee's report on agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia and the Australian Science and Technology Council's report entitled Health, politics, trade: controlling chemical residues in agricultural products called for the establishment of a section within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy \ to monitor international developments on agricultural and veterinary chemicals issues. In conjunction with the establishment of the National Registration Authority, a policy unit will be established in the Department to address policy and other major issues, including international development, concerning agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The National Registration Authority will have a role in addressing the problems associated with the aerial application of agricultural chemicals. Resulting from the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Amendment Bill, the National Registration Authority will have wider functions than the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council. In particular, the Authority will have a role to encourage and facilitate the States and Territories to introduce uniform national procedures for the control of the use, including aerial application, of agricultural and veterinary chemical products. That is very important because we export as a nation and not specifically as individual States and Bill in Territories. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill has not been introduced to the Parliament. The registration Bill is a technically complex Bill which will be released as an exposure draft in December of this year. The exposure draft will provide the opportunity for the State and Territory governments, the chemical industry, consumer and environmental groups, and the rural sector to comment on the Bill. In addition, the board of the National Registration Authority will be actively involved in the consultation process. The registration Bill requires the full agreement of the States and Territories, as it is their adoption of the Registration Act which will facilitate the national registration scheme coming into force. The Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand decided that the national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals should commence in July 1992. The scheme commenced in July 1992 by an administrative arrangement whereby the evaluation of all chemical products is undertaken by the Commonwealth and the essentially clerical exercise of issuing the registration certificate is undertaken State or Territory. The administrative arrangement bridges existing Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation for the scheme to function, pending passage of Commonwealth legislation. In accordance with the Government's policy on micro-economic reform, cost recovery for the National Registration Authority is planned to be 50 per cent of the attributable costs in 1992-93 and is phased so as to reach lOOper cent in 1995-96. The cost recovery comprises a registration fee, an annual renewal of registration fee and a levy on factory gate sales. The registration fee will increase in line with the consumer price index, whereas the annual renewal of registration fee and the levy will increase in line with the level of cost recovery. The fees have been agreed to by the major agricultural and veterinary chemicals associations. I think it covers the concerns raised by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), which I think have some legitimacy with regard to some chemicals that are used in a very narrow way in certain agricultural practices. There have been criticisms concerning delays in the current registration systems. The registration Bill .-ill introduce timeframes which will apply to applications, with penalties for failure of the National Registration Authority to meet these deadlines. The chemical industry has been consulted on the timeframes. The Authority will operate on a full cost recovery basis, and it is essential to provide it with the flexibility to respond to changing demands. Accordingly, the Bill will give the Authority the power to set the terms and conditions of employment of its staff. A statutory authority is being provided to have increased autonomy, flexibility and accountability over a departmental agency and is thus appropriate for an organisation operating on that full cost recovery basis. The honourable member for Murray mentioned something which is very important to me as well: the integrated pest management scheme, which is an outstanding innovation. It is practised in many areas now, particularly in horticulture. Bundaberg, in my electorate, is a leading area in which the IPM scheme by the has been going very well. The idea is to reduce the reliance on chemicals and, as a' consequence of that, reduce costs. At the same time, it is true and valid that there will always be a need for chemicals in agriculture, and it is necessary to ensure that we have uniformity of rules and laws across the country and to ensure that we use the safest chemicals in the safest manner. I have had some unfortunate experiences with aerial spraying. I lost thoroughbred foals because of the use of endrin many years ago-a chemical whic- was subsequently banned. I remember speaking in this House in the first sittings after I was elected about my concerns about dieldrin and BHC dust, which have now been banned, and the effects they had, particularly on our beef industry, and on our dairy industry to a lesser degree, for quite some time. It is important that we have uniform laws across Australia. It is also necessary to recognise that we do need chemicals, but we need to use them in the safest and most sensible way. Our dairy industry is a very clear example of how beneficial that is. It is doing extremely well selling dairy products in the Asian region because our products are clean and free from contamination by any nuclear fallout. The problems in Europe caused by Chemobyl have had a massive effect on European production and sales of dairy products. The Asian buyers know that our products are clean, and consequently we are gaining market share. I think it is important for us to continue to recognise this, because consumers, not only in Australia but worldwide, are recognising that they want the best and cleanest products for themselves and their families. There is a national strategy to ensure that. I compliment the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in particular and Senator John Button, who have done a lot of work this year on Clean and green products in our agricultural area. As the honourable member for Murray has said, we are fortunate that we have a large area of land that does not have the same intensity in farming as there is in Europe. Last year I remember being with the honourable member for Murray when speaking to the Secretary of the British Farmers Federation, who commented to us that his organisation had severe concerns regarding the intensity of farming in Britain and the effect of the run-off of chemicals and other waste products into the catchment areas of some of the large cities. We can certainly learn from the problems that they have and address those problems prior to their happening here. I know that the CSIRO is doing a lot of work in relation to the algae which has been a big problem in some of our western rivers, particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin. The best way to address many of these problems is to introduce these, to have uniformity and sensible controls and to work together with industry. I commend these Bills to the House.

247,Mr ANDREWS,CHEMICALS AMENDMENT BILL,"Menzies) (6.03 p.m.)The Child Support Agency has been hailed as one of the triumphs Of the Labor Government. It has increased the number of men paying maintenance for their children and increased the actual amount of maintenance being paid. As the only child support agency in the world located within a taxation office, it also has the best collection rate in the world. At its inception in mid-1988, market research found that 92 per cent of the public supported in principle the idea of making non-custodial parents Bills such as pay for their offspring. Yet the Child Support Agency rates one of the highest levels of complaints about government instrumentalities made to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Last year, with a case load of less than 80,000 as at 29 June 1991, or still under 160,000 if we count both custodial and non-custodial parents as separate clients, it ranked only after the giants Telecom, the Department of Social Security, the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, which deal with millions of clients, and before Australia Post and the Department of E-loyment, Education and Training. The Australian Taxation Office, for example, dealt with more than 10 1992 million income tax returns. The Department of Social Security made social security payments to over. five million pensioners or beneficiaries, and Telecom had nine million customer lines in operation. It might have been thought that the initial barrage of complaints was due to teething problems but, 21/2 years into the full operation of the scheme, complaints .are' mcreasing dramatically rather than lessening in volume, and these are probably only the tip of the iceberg. In fact, from time to time, particularthe ly during grievance debates, honourable members on both sides of the House have raised complaints made to them by their constituents about the administrative operation of the Child Support Agency. In the last financial year to June 1992, the Commonwealth Ombudsman recorded a 68 per cent increase in the number of complaints about what is a comparatively small agency. This now makes the Child Support Agency the third most complained about government instrumentality, but the most complained about if we take into account the client base of this particular Agency. In 1989-90 there were 238 oral complaints and 92 written complaints. Last year there were 701 oral complaints and 201 writt-n complaints. By 30 June 1992 there were 1,546 complaints, 349 written complaints and 1,197 oral complaints. Of these, around 80 per cent are resolved in favour of the complainant. While the Child Support Agency boasts that complaints represent only 0.025 per cent of its client base, this seems to be a massive understatement of the dissatisfaction felt towards the Agency which, on the basis of complaints to the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the number of support groups that have sprung up, appears to be equally divided between custodial parents, 86 per cent of whom are women, and non-custodial parents, usually men. The chief complaints to the Commonwealth Ombudsman by custodial parents concerned delays in payment, failure to chase up arrears owing and incorrect maintenance assessment of the non-custodial parent. For the noncustodial parents the major problems concerned the level of maintenance assessment, harassment by the Child Support Agency and court orders. Both groups of parents, custodial and non-custodial, complained about misleading advice given by the Agency. Although the Child Support Agency was set up to the strains of violins playing in the background of then Prime Minister Hawke when he told us that no child would live in poverty by 1990, the Agency appears to be more about shifting some of the Government's social security expenditure back onto users. However, it seems that the high and rigid formulae applied to non-custodial parents do not take into account individual circumstances and in so doing are, in many cases, creating a new class of poor-people who are so financially stmpped that they are sorely disadvantaged in trying to build new lives after the break-up of a marriage. We need to ask whether it is right to address one wrong by shifting it to another group from which it spirals further into the community through new dependants. The Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group, which provided the initial blueprint for the scheme and recently assessed the progress of the scheme in its two-volume report, Child support in Australia, does not take sufficient cognisance of the overwhelming problems of this group. However, against the concerns of the non-custodial group must be balanced the rights of first families to adequate provision from the absent parent, recognising that, in the matter of living expenses, a cake split two ways is actually less than the sum of its parts, owing to the loss of economies of scale. The problems of the custodial parents seem relatively more amenable to solution if only the administration of the scheme could be improved. There are two essential problems. The first is that the child support scheme is massively under-resourced. There are, I am informed, 700 staff in total to investigate and process claims and answer calls, which number 7,000 a day during the first week of the month. The second is that such a government bureaucracy is especially illequipped to deal with the tangled and emotional post-marital problems once dealt with on a case-by-case basis in the courts. It is therefore extremely ironic that the Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group, along with the Australian Institute of Family Studies, should recommend the extension of the scheme to include all separated parents and their children. While this is understandable on the grounds of equity, it could only add to the Agency's present inefficiency. It would mean bringing an extra 750,000 children within the ambit of the scheme. It has been one of the embarrassments of the scheme that so few stage-one parents have chosen to enter it. 1\\'0 and a half years into the scheme, less than 10 per cent of the eligible parent population had done so. As to stage two parents-those who were caught by legislative changes in 1988-89-few who were not compell- to do so by reason of being social security recipients have actually registered. Only 40 per cent of all sole parents participate in the scheme, which is not to say that they receive any maintenance. This represented 168,000 registrations by May 1992, out of a total reservoir of 383,000 sole parents. Of the entire custodial population of 600,000 people, which includes those who have since remarried, only 28 per cent are registered with the Child Support Agency, of which approximately 23 per cent would collect maintenance. A resounding 85 to 90 per cent of the client base of the Child Support Agency are social security pensioners who had no choice about signing up. This means that the majority of separated custodial parents have voted with their feet by staying outside the Big Brother clutches of the Child Support Agency. If it is such an efficient and desirable means of securing financial support, then why should this be so? It seems that there is an enormous gap between the theory and the practice of the Child Support Agency. Its power to affect people's lives is such that problems with its operation cannot be dismissed as lightly as an inaccurate telephone bill. As the 1991-92 Commonwealth Ombudsman's report noted, unlike the other government agencies, actions by the Child Support J\gency have a snowball effect as th-y involve a payee, a payer and at least one child. Some of its basic structures need to be rethought and its administration overhauled to make the scheme more socially equitable and considerably more efficient, and at once more human for both custodial and non-custodial parents. As it stands, the operation of the Child Support Agency has failed to fulfil four out of the five of the Government's stated objectives in bringing it into being. The Government's stated objeCtives were, to recap: first, that non-custodial parents should share the cost of their children according to their capacity to pay; secondly, that adequate support be available for all children of separated parents; thirdly, that Commonwealth expenditure be limited to what is necessary to ensure that those needs are met; fourthly, to ensure that neither parent is discouraged from participating in the work force; and, finally, that the overall arrangements should be simple, flexible, efficient, and respect personal privacy. Non-custodial parents do not always contribute to the upkeep of their children according to their capacity to pay, the first of the Government's objectives. Sometimes, in fact, they contribute far beyond their capacity to pay. All children of separated parents are demonstrably not treated equally in so far as s-ond families and that part of the first family residing with the male parent are often badly disadvantaged. When this means that the so-called non-custodial parent, who may in fact have custody of some or even most of the children of the first marriage, would be better off on unemployment benefit, child support maintenance has become a nonsense. The Government's objective that the scheme arrangements be simple, flexible, efficient and respect personal privacy cannot be said to have been met. The scheme is not so simple that Child Support Agency staff do not give misleading advice, as do a number of legal professionals. Nor can it be said to be flexible according to a rigid formula which, until July of this year, can be departed from only by applying to the Family Court, usually an impossible expedient for the complainant owing to a lack of money. As there is only one review officer in each capital city, this is unlikely to be a panacea. The Agency's lack of efficiency is testified to in the large number of complaints against it. As to privacy, there have been instances of Agency records being dumped or maintenance demands sent to the wrong people, and noncustodial parents complain of having their personal business affairs made public knowledge where they work due to the automatic withholding system of payment. Last year, the Child Support Agency had a profit of $ 13m, which would be considerably less or even a negative cost to government, to judge by the American experience, if it were resourced to the level necessary to deal with an increasing volume of registrations due to the economic downturn. While a return to government in financial terms is therefore negligible, it cannot be denied that more custodial parents now receive maintenance than ever did before and that most of those who receive maintenance are better off financially than they would have been prior to the scheme. The Institute of Family Studies in its survey of stage 1 stated that 24 per cent of people receiving maintenance had never received it before, as against 5 per cent who had been receiving it and received no maintenance after the introduction of the scheme. In favour of the scheme, it must be remembered that before the. scheme came into effect the majority of men had an appalling track record when it came to paying any financial support at all towards their children from a previous marriage. We need to go back to basics to restructure the scheme to obtain the same objectives. We should not delude ourselves, however, that the scheme will be a money saver or a money spinner for the Government, at least in the short tenn. Its benefits lie principally in an increase in the amount of maintenance received by custodians and therefore in the quality of life of children, in the message of social responsibility it sends to men, and in the non-quantifiable area of social problem prevention in the long run. In addressing the success or otherwise of the scheme, one has to address some of the problems in relation to the legislation itself. In the aftennath of marriage, the perceptions of ex-partners are almost invariably at odds. This does not necessary mean that one partner is falsifying the truth, although this can be the case, but that different life situations make for different perspectives. It is then hardly surprising that the perceptions of custodial and non-custodial parents vary so widely as to the fairness of the scheme. The Roy Morgan Research Centre found that 41 per cent of stage 2 custodial parents thought the amount payable to them was fair, 45 per cent thought the amount was too little, and 8 per cent thought it was too much. On the other hand, 80 per cent of stage 2 non-custodial parents thought the amount required was too much, 18 per cent thought it was fair, and one per cent thought that it was too little. The stage 1 custodial parents are slightly less satisfied and the stage 1 non-custodial parents are considerably less dissatisfied. Sixty-six per cent of stage 1 non-custodial parents thought the amount required was fair, 20 per cent thought it was too much and 9 per cent thought it was too little. Thirty-five per cent of stage 1 custodial parents thought the amount payable was fair, 54 per cent thought it too little and one per cent thought it too much. So there is a wide range of varying perceptions by both custodial and non-custodial parents in the two categories-the stage 1 category and the stage 2 category-as to the actual fairness of the scheme in operation and, one should say, the fairness of the scheme in operation in the particular circumstances in which they find themselves. The Commonwealth Ombudsman's report singled out nine main categories of complaint against the Agency: first, communication difficulties, including the Agency's failure to respond to correspondence and the inadequacy of its telephone service; secondly, a lack of client focus; thirdly, problems with the recovery of overpayments; fourthly, the imposition of late payment penalties and unreasonable refusal to remit them; fifthly, disputes about direct payments made to payees or third parties outside the Agency's collection system; sixthly, the collection of ongoing child support and recovery of arrears; seventhly, the autowithholding difficulties, including delays in effecting autowithholding and failure by employers to remit payments, and the Agency's inability to identify some payments remitted by employers; eighthly, the Agency's interpretation of court orders; and, finally, delays in effecting court-ordered variations in child support liabilities. These investigations by the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Office revealed that the Agency has systemic problems. Firstly, the Agency's accounting system does not enable staff to provide a detailed examination of what has happened when problems arise. Further, any manually processed payment which bypasses the computerised disbursement system is likely to result in misleading standard letters being sent by the Department of Social Security to the payee unless the Agency notifies the Department and the Department takes action. I suspect that most members of this House have had constituents in their office or on the end of the phone as a result of that inability or inadequacy in the system. The Agency's response to this criticism by the Ombudsman has been to advise that it is reviewing the child support system of processing without specifying any action that it is undertaking to overcome the endemic problems. The Commonwealth Ombudsman has also registered concern at the Agency's lack of human concern. The report states: The CSA gives the impression of being more concerned with money than with people . . . The CSA operates within the Australian Taxation Office's . . . general climate of revenue collection. Complaints to my office allege that there is a degree of insensitivity and a lack of empathy on the part of some CSA staff in dealing with clients. Payees and payers alike refer to inflexible, indifferent or insensitive attitudes. They often say they feel judged, ignored or fobbed off when they try to communicate with the CSA. I have found that the CSA's written responses to investigations and inquiries from my office vary in terms of quality and helpfulness. In some cases they confirm the inflexibility experienced by clients. My impression is that, unlike the ATO's responses which indicate a shift towards the goal of achieving voluntary compliance through providing service to taxpayers, the CSA's replies often indicate a degree of defensiveness and inflexibility. The Commonwealth Ombudsman's annual report concludes that, since the previous year, in some areas there has been little discernible change in the CSA's mode of operation, despite its proposed plans for improvement. On this basis, and despite the changes to the legislation introduced both earlier this year and in this Bill, it would seem that further reviews ought to be undertaken in relation to the Agency, particularly in relation to the way in which the Agency administers the scheme. I turn now to the provisions of the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) before the Parliament. I indicate at the outset that, with one exception, the Opposition is generally supportive of the improvements wrought by this legislation. The first significant change relates to substantial access to a child. Currently, a person is not deemed to be sharing the care of a child equally with another person until that person has the child for at least 40 per cent of the nights. Significant costs can be incurred below this fixed limit. As a result, the capacity to pay the full rate is reduced and the need to pay at that rate, given the extent of access, is not necessary. The amendment will establish the concepts of 'major' and 'substantial' access as factors to be taken into account in the child support formula. The effect will be to reduce the amount payable under the formula where one person has access to a child for at least 30 per cent but less than 40 per cent of the nights in a child support year. A person will be deemed to have substantial access to the child for 35 per cent of the nights and be entitled to a concession in the formula payment. That person will not, however, qualify for the higher self-support exemption amount used in the formula. The other person is deemed to have major access to the child for 65 per cent of the nights. However, .the minimum requirement of 30 per cent, which translates· into 109 nightsjust over two nights per week-has also been criticised; for example, by fathers orgamsations, which point out that a father could have overnight custody one night a week plus four weeks at Christmas and still receive no discount. While there is still considerable pressure, I believe, for greater account to be taken of the double financial burden of many fathers, the change is an improvement and therefore has the support of the coalition. . The second major change relates to taxable income not readily ascertainable. The child support formula is based upon an historic taxable income of the parties, which is inflated by a factor each year to arrive at child support income amounts. In the absence of a taxable income, there is no starting point for an assessment. Currently, the Child Support (Assessment) Act requires that an amount of 2.5 times average weekly earnings be used in all cases where a figure is not available from the Tax Office or from other oral or documentary sources. In the vast majority of cases, using this figure gives an assessment result which is unrealistic and usually causes a break in regular payments to custodians in reassessment cases or in a failure of payments to start in new cases. The effect of the amendment will be to allow the Registrar to select a figure up to a maximum, and will give a more realistic outcome in more cases and help the continuity of payments to custodians and continued Department of Social Security clawback. Therefore, the amendment introduces some desirable flexibility into the legislation. The third major change relates to the child support income amount. It is a necessary and fundamental requirement that persons who are named in child support assessments should have the facility to have an assessment amended quickly where the original income amount used in the assessment bears little relationship to their current income. The facility is similar in principle to the provision of varying provisional tax in a tax assessment. However, the present provisions do not work well and can disadvantage both parties in different circumstances. The fundamental problem is that an estimate is retrospective, in effect, back to the start of the child support year. The amendment proposes a number of changes. It first modifies the circumstances in which a second or subsequent estimate of income in a child support year may be made. Secondly, it reduces the minimum life of an estimate·from three months to two months for more flexibility. Thirdly, it removes the effect and revocation provisions of estimates from the Act and allows regulations to be made which specify their effect. Finally, itrprovides transitional arrangements for the change. It too has· the support of the Opposition. The third change relates to penalty for underestimation of taxable income. Currently, there is no deterrent to minimise the incorrect use of the estimate facility, which can delay the payment of child support to the custodian. The estimate facility is a necessary one and must remain an integral part of the law but, without a sanction to penalise, when used incorrectly it is open to abuse. The amendment proposes a single up-front flat rate penalty of 10 per cent of the additional amount payable on the reassessm-nt. The Registrar will allow a tolerance of 10 per cent to be applied to the difference between the estimate and the actual taxable income before the penalty is imposed. It can be argued that this band of tolerance is too narrow and that, when persons go beyond its limits, the Agency should be required to prove that such action was deliberately designed to avoid maintenance payments. The amendment is, nonetheless, an improvement and therefore has our support. There are also provisions that relate to private collection. From 1 January 1993, new recipients of additional family payments-the old family allowance supplement-who receive maintenance under a court order or court registered agreement will have a one-off option to receive their child support privately and directly without being required to have the liability registered and collected by the Agency. This option was first made available to Department of Social Security recipients under stage 2 of the scheme from 1 July 1992. The amendment will extend the availability to stage 1 clients who separated before 1 June 1988 and who are only now obtaining court orders or have been required to take reasonable action for maintenance under the Department of Social Security guidelines. It can be argued that all stage 1 parents-that is, the pre-1988 parents-should be able to opt out of the child support scheme, but this proposal is at least a good start. Substantial delays of up to eight weeks have resulted from current arrangements, and the amendment is, claimed to largely offset the effects of the delay and therefore has our support. There are also provisions relating to the penalty for late payment. There appeared to be the possibility of a .dual penalty being imposed. This amendment removes a flat rate 20 per cent penalty each month and modifies the way in which the ongoing monthly calculation is made. The Agency will be in a better position to calculate the monthly penalty and advise the client under these amendments. The final provision I wish to address relates to the averment power in prosecutions. The Registrar is currently required to prove all matters affecting prosecutions under the Act rather than being able simply to aver or assert that a particular matter is fact. It is proposed that averment provisions be available to the Registrar in prosecutions pursuant to clause 38 of the Bill. Averment provisions do not necessarily deny a person natural justice and usually simplify the process of establishing as a fact that certain procedural matters occurred. However, averment provisions reverse the traditional onus of proof and, in our opinion, should be used very sparingly. Whilst they might provide an administrative conv-nience for the bureaucrats, they can pose very significant difficulties for persons then faced with the responsibility of obtaining evidence sufficient to rebut the allegations. Considerable difficulty could be experienced in rebutting statements relating to financial matters, particularly when such details are peculiarly within the knowledge of the Child Support Agency and not readily obtainable or often comprehended by the client. It is therefore our belief that the averment provisions contained in clause 38 of the Bill ought not to be proceeded with. We will oppose that clause of the Bill in the committee stage of the debate. In summary, as I said at the outset, there have peen considerable difficulties in relation to the operation of the Child Support Agency since its introduction. Many of those difficulties can be ascribed to the fact that we are dealing with a new agency and a new scheme. It is expected that in any administrative program of this nature there will be teething problems. However, given the time that has passed, these problems seem to go beyond those of teething and to be th- cause of considerable administrative difficultiesdifficulties which this Bill does not meet in its terms.",63
248,Unknown,CHEMICALS AMENDMENT BILL,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,69
249,Mr LAVARCH,CHEMICALS AMENDMENT BILL,"We are debating tonight the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992. It invites us to examine the operation of the Child Support Agency and, in particular, how successful that Agency has been in the collection of maintenance for Australian children. The question of child support is an important one. It is a focal part of the family law system. Like all matters related to family law, it has a tendency to be clouded by extremely emotional debates between people at probably the most difficult time in their lives-that is, shortly after the breakdown of a marriage or at least a long term relationship. No doubt this is the most important relationship in a particular person's life. Inevitably the conflict also involves children. If those sorts of factors are combined, like all matters dealing with Family Court matters and family law, the outcome is an extremely difficult one. The criticisms of the Child Support Agency have always to be viewed against that backgrollfid. It does not matter what sort of system we come up with and what sort of agency or court is given responsibility for making determinations in this area, it will always be an extremely difficult area. Where there are a lot of questions involving emotional factors it is very difficult to get a resolution which both parties to the dispute will be happy with. I think it is important to make that point. I have no doubt that there are serious difficulties with the operation of the child support system. However, the system has to be viewed against the background of how it came about. In this regard, I think we must note that, prior to the introduction of the Child Support Agency and the formulas relating to the calculation of child support, these issues were in the hands of the Family Court and were determined under the principles espoused under division 6 of part VII of the Family Law Act. In these cases, most orders of the Family Court were made by State courts of summary jurisdiction. For instance, in Queensland the Magistrates Court exercises jurisdiction under by the Family Law Act. As a practitioner in this field until my election to this Parliament in 1987, I well recall the difficulties in trying to obtain fair outcomes in relation to maintenance orders. Mostly the orders made, particularly by the Magistrates Court but also the Family Court, were of extremely little value. They had very little regard for the true cost of the maintenance of children. A very common order would be $20 or $25 per week per child. This was in the midto late 1980s, when obviously the actual costs of maintaining a child were far higher than that. Even though the Court would often make very modest awards, in the vast majority of cases the awards were simply not complied with. As a practitioner in this area, I knew that in many instances even though the Court could well make an award in favour of the clients whom I was advising in relation to maintenance, at the end of day the award would be worth nothing; it would not be worth the paper it was written on because of the very ineffectual collection mechanism which was in place prior to the Child Support Agency. It is against this background that the child support legislation always has to be judged. It cannot be taken out, looked at in isolation and all the emphasis given to the particular problems it mayor may not have. It has to be understood that it is more or less an evolutionary step along this path of coming up with the best possible system concerning the collection of child maintenance. The whole issue of maintenance was considered by the Australian Institute of Family Studies in its 1986 report entitled Settling up. That report demonstrates very graphically the problems I have just spoken about. Firstly, orders by the court were often inadequate or barely adequate and, over time, inflation eroded these orders. The onus was then back on the custodial parents to reapply to the court and to make an application to have maintenance increased. Of equal concern to the Institute of Family Studies was the very poor record of compliance with maintenance orders. It was against the work of the Institute of Family Studies, as well as other bodies, that the Government proceeded down the path of introducing the Child Support Agency. The scheme was introduced in June 1988 and, as is well known to honourable members, operates in two stages. The first stage deals with the children of parties who separated prior to 1 October 1989. The second stageand it is probably to this that most of the criticism applies-relates to the children of relationships that broke up after October 1989. In relation to the second stage, maintenance is determined by way of a formula. In this way it is a very significant change from the previous system. The onus is not on the custodial parent as such to make an application - o a court and prove a need for maintenance and then for a court to determine that fact. The onus, in a sense, is reversed and the non-custodial parent has to be satisfied with the application of the formula. If that parent is not satisfied, then he or she can make an application to the court and attempt to have that formula changed. That in itself has been modified recently through the application of a review mechanism, though that has come into play only in the middle of this year. There has been some detailed analysis of the operation of the child support scheme. The most detailed was that of the evaluation group which was set up at the same time as the scheme to have an ongoing role of monitoring how this particular agency was working and how the law in this area was working. The evaluation group reported in March this year. It has conceded that there are significant problems and deficiencies in the scheme, although it must be said that this is against a background of much improved collection of maintenance plus the collection of much more realistic amounts of maintenance. Despite the body of the legislation and the successful work of the Agency, the group did concede that there were significant problems in this area. Many of these problems deal with the operation of the Agency. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) detailed, both comprehensively and in a fair way, the difficulties the Agency has had, and these problems are well known to every honourable member in this chamber. Complaints about the Child Support Agency have come out of nowhere to make up now probably about a tenth of all the complaints that my office receives. I think that would be a fairly common experience. Often the complaints relate to what appears to be the inefficiency of the Agency, and there may be a variety of reasons why that occurs. This was also reinforced by the most recent annual report of the Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman. Again, as the honourable member for Menzies outlined, the report of the Ombudsman was really quite startling. Given the relatively small numbers of people which the Agency deals with, the numbers of complaints received about its operations are quite extraordinary. The other extraordinary fact is the number of times which the Ombudsman has made decisions in favour of the person making the complaint. Something like 80 per cent of complaints are resolved in favour of the person making the complaint. That is quite an extraordinarily high level, given the fact that these sorts of cases are dealing with emotional subjects and with the aftermath of the breakdown of a major relationship. Many of the complaints may have been motivated by perceptions of the system being against them when that was not really an objective sort of complaint. Despite that, 80 per cent of complaints were found to be valid. Obviously, against that of objective evidence, no member could come into this chamber and pretend that there are not quite serious difficulties with the operation of the Child Support Agency. The Bill before the House tonight addresses a number of problems. I would like to speak a little about a major problem: the change to the way in which the formula will apply in cases of substantial access. As fate would have it, one of these cases was brought to my attention no more than a fortnight ago. The second family, the non-custodial parent, had access to the two children of the marriage for five days and nights out of every fortnight. the current law operates, there is no relief under the formula unless the non-custodial parent has access to the children for 40 per cent of the time. That equates to six nights out of 14. An application could then be made and the formula c0uld be varied to reflect the fact that if a person is looking after the children for that length of time, obviously he or she is meeting a fair proportion of the expenses involved. The strict application of the formula may, indeed, be far tOQ harsh. As the law currently stands,. it makes no recognition of someone who still has access for a very significant amount of the time, but not quite up to the 40 per cent level. One of the principal changes in the Bill tonight is to give a great deal more flexibility to the agency in the determination of the formula. It recognises the point that, where someone has almost shared custody, the formula should reflect that and not be as strictly applied as it is at present. That is a very major reform. The other refornls deal with the penalty provisions, which I do not think there is any debate about. They make sure that there is not going to be a penalty upon a penalty in the calculation of a penalty on a monthly basis. That is obviously a sensible reform .. Another change concerns the understating of taxable income, which I imagine there must be some temptation to do. Penalty provisions will be included to cover that situation. There is a range of other more minor changes as well. I will give sorp.e advice to the Child Support Agency. Firstly, if it is at all possible, the Agency should try to simplify the forms sort which are sent out to. custodial and noncustodial parents. I think they have improved a bit, but the information that is included upon them has been extremely difficult to understand. I think someone versed in plain English or drafting may be usefully employed to sit down with the agency and go through the forms and to simplify them as much as possible, put them in a way that people can absorb the information. I have gone through many of these forms with. people and I have the devil's own job in understanding them. I consider myself to be of reasonable intelligence. If I cannot understand them, I think As there are probably a fair few people running around dealing with these issues who .also cannot understand them. Secondly, I urge some improvement in the attitude of some staff members of the Agency. These are always difficult questions. Obviously there are officers, as in any department, who are extremely dedicated, good at their job and put their all into it. There are others who do not quite come up to that standard. However, there does seem to be some difficulty with some officers of the Agency. It may well be that they are completely overwhelmed with work and that there are hostile people in an emotional state approaching them; it is only human to sometimes react to that. But it does seem to be a very constant complaint which I receive about the Agency, far more than I receive about the Department of Social Security, the CES or other agencies dealing with people in times of stress. It makes me wonder whether there is not some further work to be done with Agency staff to make sure that they are handling people in a sensitive manner because there are difficult issues here. The third thing-this is probably not a matter for the Agency; it is a matter for the Government in terms of its·resourcing-is to make sure that we are cutting down on time delays with the way the Agency is dealing with matters. Again, I think it would be fair to say that I have seen improvement in this in recent times. But there still seems to be some difficulty in getting information out of the Agency in reasonable time. This probably varies from State to State and office to office, but it is a third point which I ask the Agency to have a look at. All in all, I believe that the Agency and legislation are worthwhile. I would concede that there are some important problems which need to be addressed, some of which were addressed in earlier legislation this year, the first amendment Bill. Other points are addressed in the legislation before the House tonight. The one dealing with varying the formula in terms of substantial access, I think, is a major improvement and will alleviate a lot of problems .. I note that the honourable member for  Even though the Joint Select Committee on Family Law was not directly asked to look at this question, we did receive some hundreds of submissions which canvassed it-that is without advertising or asking people to do that; in fact, we encouraged them not to forward submissions. Nonetheless, people were writing in and making complaints about it. We would have to tum a blind eye to the fact that there are problems in this area. I urge the Government to have a look at them and to respond positively, as it has in this legislation tonight. There may be a need for a more comprehensive review of the legislation. I ask the Government to think very seriously about the issues raised tonight, particularly by the honourable member for Menzies. I think he pointed out some significant problems with the way the legislation is working. But, on the whole, I think the legislation tonight is to be commended. I ask the House to support it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clauses 1 to 37-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 38.",69
250,Mr ANDREWS,CHEMICALS AMENDMENT BILL,"Menzies) (8.20 p.m.)Clause 38, as I said in my speech on the second reading, deals with the averment provisions of the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). Briefly, clause 38, if enacted, will enable the prosecution in court matters pursuant to the child support legislation simply to aver or state from the Bar table that a particular matter is a fact. The the position of the Opposition, as a matter of principle, is that averment provisions that enable a prosecution in a court proceeding to allege a matter to be a fact and then require that that fact be disprOVed by the other party ought to be used sparingly. The circumstances of the Child Support Agency legislation are such that the Agency, with the full panoply of the administrative mechanisms of the Australian Taxation Office, is in a position of considerable advantage compared to the position of a party who is opposed by the Agency in court proceedings. It is very difficult for parents, whether it be the custodial parent or the non-custodial parent, particularly without adequate financial resources, to be able to bring to bear the same degree of expertist: vi the same degree of resources as the Child Support Agency in any prosecution or court proceedings brought pursuant to this legislation. It is the position of the Opposition, given that we start from a position of principle such averment proceedings ought to be sparingly used, that in these circumstances any justification for such a provision in the Act ought to be opposed. It is therefore our position that clause 38 ought not to be agreed to. Clause agreed to. Remainder of Bill-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.

251,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Bradfield) (8.24 p.m.)The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is pursuant to the legislation passed last year regarding implementation of the new public sector superannuation scheme. It is worth noting that the public sector, like the private sector, over recent years has been subject to enormous changes in the area of superannuation. The flood of change finally reached the public sector on 15 October 1989, when the Minister for Finance announced a new superannuation scheme for Commonwealth public servants, which was to commence on 1 July 1990. The scheme was to be called the public sector superannuation scheme, or the PSS, and covered all new employees. It effectively closed the old Commonwealth superannuation scheme, known otherwise as the CSS, to new contributors from 1 July 1990. Following on from the legislation that was then introduced there have been a number of pieces of legislation, of which this is but one. The proposals before the House tonight are essentially of an omnibus nature. As I said, they amend the Commonwealth superannuation legislation to address a number of that small but, nevertheless, not unimportant issues, especially frorri the point of view of contributors. One of the major changes is to allow multiple membership of Commonwealth schemes where a member has more than one job. As the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) rightly pointed out in his second reading speech, . to assume that the only ones in superannuation schemes are those with full time employment-that is literally full timeignores the fact that there is a growing proportion of the work force, including the public sector, who also now have access to both a semi-full time job and perhaps a part time job which, again, could be in the public sector, perhaps in a different department. The whole issue therefore under the Superannuation Act 1990 was what we do in terms of superannuation contributions and benefits for people in multiple employment. The variety of employment patterns that are now emerging demonstrate that the rules have to be flexible enough to take this factor into account. These proposed amendments will enable a person to have access to superannuation, in terms of both the need for contributions as well as the need for benefits, subject to the existing rules in relation to RBLs and matters such as that. Nevertheless, mUltiple memberships within the one scheme or membership of more than one scheme will be appropriate in some circumstances, and the Opposition is pleased that the proposals before the House tonight take that fact into account. A further set of changes relates to the clarification of invalidity procedures. These are also included, as is the power for the Commissioner of Superannuation to presume death in appropriate circumstances so as to facilitate earlier payment of reversionary benefits. The third amendment proposed in the legislation is to allow direct payment of benefits from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to members covered by the old 1990 scheme, like the 1976 scheme, and the DFRDB schemes. This move will streamline the payment procedures by avoiding the prior payment to the fund before payment to the member. The old system was rather cumbersome in that payments had to be made directly from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The proposal is that payment will be made direct from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the beneficiary. I take this opportunity to refer to a number of matters relating to public sector superannuation because it is a matter of considerable importance, especially since the reforms have been introduced. It is interesting to note the change in the structure of superannuation that has taken place over the last 12 months or so. As I said in my opening remarks, we have seen the transfer from the Commonwealth superannuation scheme to the public sector superannuation scheme for new beneficiaries. Side by side with that was the determination to allow GBBs, as they are called-government statutory marketing type authorities-to have their own superannuation. The outcome of that was an enormous trl!.llSfer of people from the old Commonwealth superaDnuation scheme across to the new GBE schemes, leaving therefore a smaller residual scheme in terms of the public sector as a whole. These matters were adequately covered· in the Commissioner for Superannuation's annual report for 1990-91. I would, however, like to make a number of observations about the changes that have taken place to the Superannuation Act 1976 arising from the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1990 and the amendment legislation we have before us tonight. Firstiy, the provision for the transfer of members and assets to approved superannuation schemes such as the PSS and certain GBE schemes was initiated. Retirement pensions are based on completed years and days, not just completed years of service, as was the previous system. The reduction in pension on retirement before age 60 has been changed from 4 per cent to 3% per cent of the age 60 rate for each year by which the age of retirement is less than 60. Contributions may be paid during a period of unpaid maternity or paternity leave. We in the Opposition believe this was a very worthwhile reform at the time and is consistent with the proposals we have in our retirement income policy, which has gone much further. Under the old rules, people were allowed to contribute to superannuation for a maximum of only two years where they ceased employment, whether it was for maternity or fot any other reason. Under the Fightback proposals, we are allowing people to continue their superannuation contributions indefinitely, whether thl?Y make them themselves by whatever means they can or, alternatively, they are made by their spouses. The result is that the joint spouse/spouses contribution and benefits are therefore linked to the total sum of $600,000 which can be taken at that level in a lump sum. So what we have done side by side with that is to introduce what are called time and savings accounts, which are a mechanism to create a bridge between periods in and out of the wotk f-rce - d which are of particular benefit to women who may have broken periods of service. Therefore, we were pleased that in the original legislation, the 1990 Act, at least a step was taken in that direction, although, frankly, we do not believe it went far enough. Other changes are worthwhile. The administration of invalidity retirement is significantly tightened and brought into line with invalidity arrangements for the PSS. Members with more than 40 years of service may elect to cease contributions. A Commonwealth Superannuation Board was created with responsibility for decisions on invalidity retirement and for the declaration of interest rates. There has also been incorporation of productivity superannuation into the CSS except for those employers who have made separate productivity arrangements. So, as I said in my opening remarks, we have seen since 1990 a profound change taking place in the whole structure of public sector superannuation. This leads me on to the next question which is of considerable importance to all beneficiaries, and that is the capacity of the funds to maintain the standard of benefit. The Opposition is of the view that there need to be some significant changes in this area, and I draw the attention of the House to the comments made in the third report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation entitled Super and the financial system. According to the Committee's report, the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme is the second most generous of all Public Service schemes after the Defence Force scheme, and Commonwealth superannuation payments are the equivalent of 22.8 per cent of salary. It is worth noting that the Defence Force scheme, which, as I said, is even more generous, has a payment rate of 26.4 per cent. The next most generous is the Western Australian Government's scheme at 22 per cent; the least generous is the Tasmanian scheme at 13.7 per cent. The new Defence Force scheme is the most generous of the new schemes at 21.1 per cent of salary, followed by the Commonwealth's PSS at 15.5 per cent. The new New South Wales scheme is the equivalent of 14 per cent; this, of course, takes into account the proposals of the State Government quite recently which have run into some difficulties. However, the important point I want to make relates to the Senate·Committee report. It is worth noting that we are talking about three parties represented on that Committee. We are talking about the views of the Chairman, Nick Sherry, representing the Government; Senator Alston, representing the Opposition; and Cheryl Kernot representing the Australian Democrats. They all said basically the same thing: that changes were inevitable and that it was by no means to be guaranteed that existing benefit levels could be maintained. In fact, Senator Sherry said that a reduction in the level of benefits paid to public servants was inevitable, and the Committee said that the burden of Public Service superannuation could force a downgrading of government credit ratings. The Committee also reported that total unfunded public sector superannuation liability is $80 billion-that is for both Commonwealth and State superannuation-compared with total private sector superannuation assets of $148 billion. Honourable members will appreciate from those figures that the issues of superannuation in terms of the capacity to pay and the whole question as to whether funds should be unfunded or fully funded are very real problems which cannot be ignored indefinitely. As a result of that inquiry, a number of changes were recommended in the report, which we have not yet seen carried through by the Government. Nevertheless, there was at the time considerable press comment, among others by a person who is well known in this area, Daryl Dixon. Mr Dixon's observations on this matter were particularly pertinent. Referring to a report by Ian Davis in the Canberra TImes of 26 September, Mr Dixon said: The investment returns on these public sector superannuation monies have not matched the returns on comparable private sector funds. He then warned: IT these trends continue, public servants stand to lose substantial amounts of money compared with a situation where their money was invested elsewhere. Some studies were done on this, comparing public sector returns. This came through in a Senate Estimates committee where Senator Short, the Opposition spokesman on finance, all raised this issue with the Department of Finance. The actual end benefits of individuals in the public sector getting benefits from the public sector scheme over a 20-year contribution period were compared with those from an average of across the range private sector schemes. The variation was quite considerable and it was not in favour of the Commonwealth scheme. In fact, as Daryl Dixon went on to say, indeed, members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme were very fortunate to receive a return of 7.9 per cent for 1990-92 on their accumulated savings. This is the key point; this is the rub: That result came after the fund trustees agreed to dip into reserves to bolster earnings in what was a poor year for many large investors. That is an understatement. Over the last 18 months to two years, benefit levels have fallen virtually right across the spectrum of superannuation almost without exception. The only place where benefits have risen is where funds have dipped into reserves. However, the issue that we have to face in the public sector context is the extent to which the Commonwealth can allow dipping into reserves to take place and what the final impact will be if that continues. The evidence is very disturbing. It suggests that the levels of reserves have now been considerably reduced. I will quote again from the Ian Davis article in the Canberra TImes. It states: Money managed by CFM is composed of the individual contributions of members of the two funds, the CSS and the PSS. They both have assets of about $5 billion. Members of the CSS receive a government pension, plus a further amount which can be taken as either a lump sum or as a pension. This additional amount is made up from the earnings on members' own contributions. Consequently, it follows that continued low earning rates would affect the value of that part of the CSS benefit. However, the PSS scheme is a defined benefits scheme. That is a different structure altogether from the CSS scheme. Any lack of earnings of funds managed by the CFM for members of the PSS scheme must impact on the total contribution governments would need to make to their retirement benefit rather than on an amount received. The point is this: as demand falls on an annual basis, the Government simply funds the need to cover that benefit rate straight out of Consolidated Revenue. That raises the whole issue as to when, as suggested by our colleagues in the Senate, we are going to be in a position to transfer across into a fully funded system. It is utterly inevitable that we have to do so because, as I said before, the implications· of having $80 billion in debt floating around is by no means a bagatelle. The implications of that in terms of direct and indirect fund management over time would be very serious indeed. Consequently, following that Senate report, my colleague Senator Alston made some important observations in a press. release which he issued. He said: An incoming coalition government would, therefore, as a matter of urgency convene a meeting of State Finance Ministers and/or Treasurers to develop a plan to address the problem posed by unfunded public sector superannuation liabilities. He suggested that the agenda for such a conference could include identifying the true level of unfunded superannuation liabilities for both the Commonwealth and the States, and steps to be taken to bring the problem under control. I must stress that, although I gave a figure to the House, the. fact is that it is only an estimate; nobody really knows exactly what the level of debt overhang is in Commonwealth and State superannuation at the present time. He also went on to suggest the development of a common accounting standard for reporting the extent of unfunded superannuation. He also suggested that there should be a regular publication of new entrant costs to allow comparisons between the various schemes; the development of appropriate measures to' allow for a greater degree of portability of superannuation between the States and the Commonwealth; a commitment to. full funding for all new entrants to public service superannuation and a timetable for its introduction; the exploration of strategies to fully fund old debt; and the examination of various means to discourage continued unfunded arrangements. I support all of those observationS because, as I said in our retirement income policy as far as back as 1988, this is an issue which must be addressed. While it cannot be solved overnight because in our current par10us financial situation neither the Commonwealth nor the States could actively encourage an additional increase in recognised debt of $80 billion, nevertheless the time has come when we should be including in our consolidated funding statement as part of the Budget the expected level of benefit payments, and at least starting to build up the contribution rates to the extent that it is possible to fully fund them over time. The question therefore is: how does it affect the existing beneficiaries? The continuing poor performance of the superannuation funds which, as I said, are being managed on behalf of about 200,000 Commonwealth public servants, has effectively wiped out reserves. Therefore, the Federal Government may well have to step into provide support should, in the next financial year or the subsequent financial year, the funds be incapable of maintaining the current level of benefit. One of the reasons for this is not hard to find. It is very closely linked to what other funds have done: Before I answer my own question, perhaps I should make another point which is very important. In gross terms, reserves in the CSS fund have fallen from about $400m to $3Om. That shows the level of fall we are talking about. It also demonstrates the seriousness of the problem. Do not forget, that $400m has been effectively wiped out over a very short period of time. When the fund is down to $3Om-on the basis of the history of the last two yearsthere are very real reasons to be genuinely concerned about what happens after this. But effectively that means that the reserve levels are now about 5 per cent, which is regarded as the prudent minimum for a major occupational superannuation· fund. Therefore, the two public sector funds, which have assets, as I said, of about $5 billion, are labouring under the impact of heavy exposure to CBD property. This is not unique to the Commonwealth fund. It is to be found in all the State funds, and certainly the New South Wales fund. In fact, there is a whacking great building going up in the middle of Sydney right now which is going to be the greatest white elephant in recorded history. Everybody in Sydney and Melbourne knows that there is a complete over supply of space in the CBDs. One really has to ask the question: with the benefit of what now appears to be hindsight, why was it that so many managers of funds, not just in the public sector, but right across the spectrum, consistently invested in projects from, say, 1988 onwards, when all the evidence suggested that saturation point had been reached? We do not know the answer. It really was a lemmings going over the precipice situation. It is rather interesting because when one actually compares, in superannuation management terms, how the funds theoretically see this, it works really on what used to be called the old 30-30-30 rule-3D per cent in property, 30 per cent in domestic equities and 30 per cent in fixed securities. The rest would be in overseas investments. Somehow or other the whole thing got out of line. Whilst exposure to property in the case of the Commonwealth fund was, as I said, up to 30 per cent of t.otal assets, on the advice of the actuaries-and, of course, here we are getting down to the question of experts-the funds want to cut this to a benchmark of 20 per cent. Again, I think that is very much being wise after the event, because the lemmings really have gone over the precipice. The question is: how long can the funds maintain their current level of assets? Do not forget, we are talking about a fund with two levels. One level is the contribution from the contributor, and that is what we are talking about at this stage of the discussion. Earlier I was talking about the involvement of the Commonwealth in terms of its long term commitment; that is, the Commonwealth debt component. The problem we are facing here is that the contributions from the individuals may well result· in a net loss situation. Of course, that is something that public servants have not had to face in the past, but if trends db not improve significantly, the only alternative proposition is that the Commonwealth will have to subsidise the pay-out rates for pensioners on their. own contributions, as distinct from the Commonwealth commitment. That, of course, would be a very serious situation indeed. I do. not leave the House under any illusions. This is the reality facing superannuation at the present time. Regrettably, it is not unique to the public sector. The CSS and the PSS are prohibited by law from declaring negative returns in the account balances of members. That is wonderful. The law says the funds must run at a profit. But as I have just pointed out to honourable members, we have a situation now where we are down to reserve levels of about 5 per cent or less, and we have seen the figure going from $400m to $3Om. But the law says the funds cannotrun at a loss. My point is that if there were a sudden change in the structure of retirements or forced resignations in the public service this could return a very interesting outcome indeed. These are issues of very considerable importance which should not be ignored by anybody in this House. The sooner the CSS is changed to give fund members the opportunity to have their contributions invested solely in a capital stable fund--'-if that preference-the better it will be for them all. That is the issue which I believe the public sector unions and the Parliament must address. I strongly believe that the current structure of the funds is based on the premise of a level of benefit predicated by the need to ask people to contribute a relatively small amount-about 5 per cent of their annual salary-towards a fund which, as I said, has been more generous in its final pay-out figure than virtually all other private sector funds, with the exception, of course, of the DFRDB and the Defence Force schemes. One really has to take into account the current earning rates, the debt and the contingent liability which is effectively in these schemes as a result of having 30 per cent, or in some cases even more, invested in real estate, which is effectively returning very little indeed. After all, only one building needs to be built and it cannot be filled or one shopping centre which is running at a loss, and that can have a massive effect on actual profitability. Managing superannuation funds today is becoming an extremely difficult exercise and running the Commonwealth superannuation funds is, in its own way, all as difficult. The important thing is-the Opposition is firmly of this view-that where we possibly can, we must avoid drawing distinctions between public sector schemes and private sector schemes. Basically, they are all the contributions of people who are in those various funds. The rules applied must be common to both. I think that it is a credit to this place that the legislation introduced in 1990 went a long way towards establishing a regime which put in place a basically uniform structure affecting both public sector and non-public sector schemes. Finally, I draw attention to the point I made earlier. It seems absurd to say in law, 'Thou shalt always run at a profit' when, at the same time, there is a funding or contribution rate or an investment policy which may well give different results.",73
252,Mr LES SCOTT,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill is their amends the Superannuation Act 1922, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988. These Acts relate to the provision of superannuation benefits to civilian Commonwealth sector employees. As has been indicated earlier by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), the Bill covers a wide range of topics. The purposes of the amendments are: compliance with the superannuation guarantee requirements, ongoing compliance with the occupational superannuation standards, streamlining of the administration of some of the Commonwealth superannuation schemes and clarification of areas for legislation. They are all very important parts of this Government's ongoing commitment to superannuation. If honourable members look for a moment at the record of this Government with regard not only to superannuation, but a whole lot of areas-and I was speaking the other night of taxation-they will see that this Government has introduced reforms in the taxation area. Superannuation is another area in which this Government has a very proud record in regard to equity. Honourable members opposite do not really share the Government's views. They would bring in systems, not only in the superannuation area but also in the taxation area, where equity does not prevail. Mr Cpnnolly-Equity is the very basis of our superannuation reform.",78
253,Mr LES SCOTT,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Honourable members opposite talk about voluntary contributions. From their previous record they would go away from the compulsory structure that this Government has put in place. They would do nothing to guarantee superannuation benefits for people in retirement. Honourable members on this side of the House have a commitment to people from all walks of life in this country, no matter what their financial position is. The great tragedy that Australia faces today is that the Menzies Government did not provide for retirement. That is the problem that peOple entering retirement are facing today. Of course, the Opposition's Fightback package would go back to those days, when people did not provide for their retirement. If we look at what is going on at the moment in Victoria and listen to .the utterings down there about compensation and what have you, we can see the lack of commitment of those opposite to the average Australian worker. Not only do they want to kick them all throughout their working life; if they live long enough to retire, they then want to get stuck into them. Mr Connolly-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask that the honourable member address l.lls remarks to the matter under discussion,. which is superannuation.",78
254,Mr LES SCOTT,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I am, Mr Deputy Speaker.",79
255,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Mr Hollis)..,-I say to the honourable member for Bradfield that I have b-n listening to the honourable member for Oxley. I think he has been sticking fairly closely to the Bill under discussion. Mr LES SCOT'.l'- Mr Deputy Speaker, superannuation and people's retirement is a very wide topic. Commonwealth employees are not any different from any other employees when it comes to providing for their retirement. I was speaking about the need for employees to· provide for their retirement in their working lives, and the way to do it is through superannuation. I think that is relevant to this Bill, but I am not surprised that the honourable member for Bradfield wishes to interject. He obviously does not feel comfortable with the Opposition's superannuation proposals or with the GST. However, I will not go into that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will respect the provisions of the Bill before us. Since 1983 this Government .hl,lS had a whole range of changes in the superannuation area, and I know that my. colleagues on this side of the House are very proud of those milestones. We first started to reform the way tax was applied in the superannuation area back in 1983. Once again, it benefited only those people on high incomes. After that we applied our occupational superannuation standards. This is relevant to the Bill before us tonight because it brings the Commonwealth Government's superannuation schemes into line with some of those occupational superannuation standards; These schemes and standards have played a very important part in the whole. range of changes to superannuation. We brought in the 3 per cent productivity benefit along with the national wage case negotiations in 1986. That was a tremendous milestone. Commonwealth Government . employees benefited but of that change from 1988. It was a substantial change. Unfortunately, not all employers respected the need to pass on that 3 per cent productivity benefit to their employees. However, it was a wage trade-off to employees and all employees should have automatically received it. Unfortunately, that did not happen. That led to the Government's need to move on further to the superannuation guarantee levy-now referred to as the superannuation guarantee charge-to ensure that· the 3 per cent benefit was passed on to all employees, both in the Commonwealth sector, which received it from 1988, and the private sector. In 1992 the Government legislated for a minimum level of employer superannuation benefit for most Commonwealth employees. The amendments in the Bill before us relate to both the superannuation guarantee and the occupational superannuation standards. The honoUrable member for Bradfield spoke about the f:ightback package. I will come back to his last point about the unfunded Commonwealth superannuation area and the sorts of funds in the private and public sector. Let us look at some of the basic issues in the superannuation area that are raised in the Opposition's Fightback package. There are three basic issues in its superannuation policy. First, Australia faces an increasingly ageing population. If we continue to rely solely on the aged pension, future governments will· either have to provide reduced real incomes for pensioners or increase tax rates. This means that the Government must now take responsible steps to ensure that our citizens will have access to adequate income levels in retirement. Of course, that covers everybody. If that had happened years ago under conservative governments, we would not have the problems we are facing today and it would not have been necessary to make so many changes. Our having to make those changes has caused some confusion, but it has been necessary because of what has happened in the past. The second issue is the basic policy choice between a superannuation scheme based on compulsion and one based on voluntary contributions. That is the fundamental difference between us and those opposite. The third issue, which is related to the former point, is the choice between the use of tax concessions and rebates to encourage people to save for retirement. With our superannuation policies, as demonstrated in the superannuation guarantee charge, we have a finn commitment to ensuring that there is compulsion on the part of the employers-and that is the important factor-whereas the Opposition supports voluntary contributions which would be taxed at some 25 per cent, and it goes on from there. Let us look at the damage caused by having voluntary contributions. Before 1983, when superannuation was taxed at negligible rates and there was almost full deductibility of contributions, superannuation was primarily taken out by upper and middle management. For everyone else the voluntary system did not work; that is, it was mostly the blue-collar workers, the hardest working people of this country, who did not have superannuation. It was all right for people in many of the large private sector areas-where I come from myself; we did have superannuation-but many people did not benefit from it. Not only does the voluntary system have a poor record in Australia but no other country has built a successful superannuation scheme based on voluntary contributions. I have an interesting quote from the head of the Opposition's superannuation task force, Professor David Knox, who calls voluntarism 'a flawed principle' and says that a successful superannuation scheme needs a compulsory core of 8 to 10 per cent. That is exactly what Labor has proposed with the superannuation guarantee charge of 9 per cent by the year 2002. Even the Opposition's own experts are saying that to us. Relying on tax concessions alone to encourage people to provide for their own retirement has not worked in the past, and there is no reason why it would ever work in the future. In the area of superannuation the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) would take Australia backwards. All the reforms that we have brought out in the past would fail. Mr ConnoUy-We are trying to save jobs; 160,000 will be saved.",79
256,Mr LES SCOTT,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"One does not destroy jobs by taking people's retirement benefits away from them. It is a nonsense to suggest that one would destroy jobs by having people provide 'for their own retirement. In most cases people actually provide for their own retirement and it is not necessarily a problem. There are no real changes necessitated in the Commonwealth area. I turn to some of the points the honourable member for Bradfield was making about the difference between the two sorts of funds we generally know in our community: the guaranteed ones and the capital funded ones. The Commonwealth has opted to guarantee a minimum level by legislation. Apart from the 3 per cent productivity or stand alone benefit under the Act, the Commonwealth does not fund the superannuation schemes. There is a very good reason for that: increasing the funding under the Act would entail considerable actuarial analysis and adjustment to the level of employer benefits under the Act so that members would not receive a windfall gain from the reduced tax payable to members on funded benefits compared with unfunded benefits. The additional costs are not warranted with the legislative guaranteed mechanism that is available to the Parliament. We have gone through this argument about whether the Commonwealth should fund its own funds. The amount of money that would be tied up in those sorts of funds is quite incredible when the Commonwealth itself can guarantee it. There are certainly sound reasons against the proposal for the Commonwealth to fund them. Full funding would have a significant impact on our domestic financial markets. That is something to consider. The present funding liabilities would mean that current taxpayers would be paying more than their fair share of the costs-another burden on the taxpayer. They would be paying for the benefits over years of past service and benefits for current service. All those things need to be taken into consideration. However, there are always short and long term aspects to look at. The Commonwealth's superannuation liabilities will continue to be monitored by way of regular actuarial reviews of long term costs. The Government will, of course, consider the reports by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which was referred to by the honourable member for Bradfield. The last report of the Australian Government Actuary on the long term costs of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme was tabled in 1990. Such reports are prepared regularly-usually three yearly:-projecting the level of expenditure over many years. The most recent report of the Actuary, which provided those projections of costs using data in June 1988, was tabled in the Parliament in May 1990. In that report, unfunded liabilities were estimated by the Australian Government Actuary at $33 billion, with an estimated $15 billion being returned to the Commonwealth in tax revenue and savings on social security outlays. The unfunded liabilities should be kept in perspective. They relate to amounts that could become payable over a period in excess of 50 years; they are not amounts that the Commonwealth would be called on to pay at anyone time in the near future. We need to look at that. Many of the private sector funds need to ensure that they make such funding arrangements because, obviously, they do not have the same resources behind them as the Commonwealth. The new occupational superannuation provisions are important, as is having employer-employee trustees. These amendments cover all those sorts of things as well. It is important that we look at the difference between the public and private sectors, because there have been some problems with the management of private sector funds and their not having done the right thing. Maxwell is one of the more prominent cases that comes to mind. As the honourable member for Bradfield said, they are the members' fundsbut we are talking about the Commonwealth as distinct from the private sector. Why would we need to have a massive fund like that? That would be incredible. It certainly is important to consider that, and there is no doubt that we will continue to have differing views on this. I do not know how Opposition members would put together such a scheme or how they would utilise those resources, but I am sure that is what they would try to do. In the Fightback package Opposition members had in mind telling the funds where to invest, and they particularly referred to housing. Telling a superannuation fund to allocate a certain amount of its funds to housing seems a pretty acceptable way to go, on the face of it, but what Opposition members are talking about in their Fightback package is helping first home owners with their superannuation plans. The problem is that they are talking about people up to age 35. Those people would not have sufficient funds accumulated in their superannuation schemes to give them the sort of money they would need to purchase a home. All they would be doing is giving them the deposit. They would also be affecting the returns of schemes, many of which would be private sector schemes. When Opposition members talk about funding Commonwealth schemes, that must be what they have in mind-being able to put those resoUrces in there. The returns to members would then be lower. They would have to be lower because they would be telling people what to do. Lending for individual housing is costly, and I speak from experience. Lending someone a housing mortgage of $50,000 involves all the same paperwork and all the same costs as lending $50m. The administrative costs of a fund becoming a housing lender-particularly lending to people under 35, because they would only be small loans and there would still be the same administrative costs-would be a real problem for those funds. We need to have a close look at that. It sounds very good to the public, the public also needs to have a good look at this because the funds may not be able to deliver on what they are supposed to be providing. The best they would be able to do is to provide the deposit only. People would then have to look further, would still have to go out into the open market and finance the rest of their home. It would be a massive burden on the superannuation fund itself. It is important that superannuation funds, where funds are provided by the members, diversify their investments. In the main, they do. There have been important changes and many funds now have employer and employee trustees. The Commonwealth funds do have that sort of thing, but these are important areas that we need to look at. Commonwealth employees deserve the same protection in their retirement as anybody else. They do have that with the Commonwealth funds, and they will continue to have it because their funds are guaranteed by the Commonwealth. They cannot get a much better guarantee than that. That is an important aspect that I think the honourable member for Bradfield did not consider. bring into line the amendments to the respective funds to adopt the Government's superannuation guarantee charge requirements andan important thing, in my view-the occupational superannuation standards. They streamline the administration of those. It is important that we keep those going. Generally speaking, these funds meet all minimum employer benefits required by the superannuation schemes, as do many private funds. It is a nonsense for those opposite to suggest that there is a burden on employers in providing superannuation, because that just is not so. Some of the States have complained that many funds are already providing superannuation for their employees-and that is commendable. Many major employers who employ hug-. numbers of people have been as well. There has been nothing to stop the small business sector providing superannuation for their people over many years, and they have actually done that, too. I am pleased to have the opportunity to support these Bills tonight and to highlight some of the deficiencies that but the Opposition has in challenging some of the provisions of this legislation. I am pleased to support these Bills. Question resolved in the afftrmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Griffiths) read a third time. NA ADMINISTRATION BILL 1992 Second Reading [COGNATE BILLS: NA (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1992 NA BILLS 1992] Debate resumed from 3 November, on These Bills motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr ·LLOYD (Murray-Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia) (9.08 p.m.)The National Residue Survey Administration Bill and cognate Bills will impose from 1 July next year full cost recovery for the national residue survey. It is an annual survey which the analyses samples of Australian animal and plant food products for such things as chemical residues. It is a very important element in maintaining the No.1 position for Australia in relation to clean and pure foods for the rest of the world as well as giving reassurance to our consumers domestically. At present there is 60 per cent cost recovery-up from 50 per cent at an earlier time. Prior to 1987, it had always been paid by the Government because of its public health responsibility.·We are not talking about a big amount of money here; we are talking about $6m a year. I am not aware of any other country in the world where the producers are required to pay in full, as this Bill will require, for a public health facility. The industry is furious about this. In the industry there are 25 separate items on the schedule encompassing 17 levy Bills. That shows the spread of the levy throughout agriculture. The meat industry is the major component, and that industry is wild because, first, from 1 July next year there will be no acceptance by the Government of a public health percentage or responsibility. There is no accountability for whatever 100 per cent is. What is it-l00 per cent of what? It is what the Government states it will be. These days, that is not good enough. I said that all of the meat industry is but the deer industry has a particular complaint. Without making a pun, it will be far dearer for deer than any other industry. I can quote some examples: for cattle, the levy is 35c a head; for sheep and lamb, lOc a head; for goats, 8c a head; for buffalo, $5 a head; for pigs, 40c a head; for meat chickens, 0.02c a head; for laying chickens, 2c a head; and then it goes on to grains and dairy products. But for deer it is 4c per kilo, and that is a dramatically different cost. I have been advised by the Deer Breeders Association that it was not contacted about the increase in fees and it will have difficulty staying in the national residue survey. However, if it pulls out of the survey-and it will have that right under this Bill-it will be able to sell venison into the European Community because the EC insists that that residue be monitored by government. The cost to deer breeders reflects the small size of the industry. Last year the industry did a deal with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and paid $500, but this schedule will cost the industry about $15,000. The industry is already going through a fairly difficult situation of implementing a research and development arrangement that will cost it about $100,000. It believes that it is a position to levy its growers any more. The industry also raises the questions of why it should be levied at a different rate compared with any other. livestock industry and why it has no say in how efficiently the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories operate. The industry suggests that residue testing should be put out to public tender. Those in agriculture generally in this country are fed up with this Government because it is imposing more and more charges. On the one hand, the industry is being pushed to promote the pure food status of Australian food products, and that is certaihly worth promoting; but when it comes to any form of government assistance, all the industry receives is another tax. The Government is not prepared to assist the industry, even to the extent of about $3m a year. For a number of years the meat industry paid an additional levy because of a breakdown in the wild, Government's inspection system-not through the fault of the meat industry-and it has had enough. As these are Budget Bills, the Opposition parties will not oppose them, but I announce that it is coalition policy, on election to government, to amend this legislation and return to 50 per cent cost recovery. We believe that is a reasonable apportionment of the public health situation versus the industry. I note that there is provision in this legislation for a committee to have at least some accounting function in relation to the efficiency of cost recovery. We would certainly be looking for that, including the tendering of the analytical testing. It is not good enough for government to say on the one hand that it is not going to apply business principles-user pays and cost recovery-and on the other hand to go ahead with the same Public Service mentality of having no defined figure, no efficiency standards and no accountability. There are 18 of these primary industry Bills in total, and I would hope that it is possible to consolidate some of them in the future. This will be an issue during the election campaign. The Opposition will be saying to industry that it recognises that government has a responsibility, as well as industry, and not in that when it comes to encouragement for promotion overseas, as well as reassurance at home, of the pure food status of our products, a coalition government is prepared to give some practical and pragmatic recognition and assistance. That will certainly be on the agenda for the forthcoming election.",80
257,Mr NEWELL,NATIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY LEVY,"Richmond) (9.16 p.m.)This cognate debate covers a number of National Residue Survey Bills. However, the legislation is very timely and is in keeping with this Government's commitment to boost our export industries, to support our export industries, and to ensure that those industries function efficien-ly at home and are able to provide both domestic and export markets with quality products. The Bills can be divided into three groups: the administration Bills, the levy .imposition Bills, and the survey consequential provisions Bills. The Bills will pass through the House tonight with the Opposition's support. It is regrettable that those opposite find some things in the Bills are not to their liking. However, I appreciate that they are gping to support this legislation· and go to the electorate saying that they will change the Bills if given the opportunity. I think that is a bit of a fallback position. Having listened to the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), I take it that there is general agreement from the Opposition that the residue survey is necessary. We all agree with the idea of monitoring our agricultural products and we can all see the benefits that flow from it. There is no doubt that the large number of industries involved also see the benefits to be gained from residue surveys. There is a considerable amount of money involved in these industries which contributes substantially to the Australian economy, and anything we do to protect that contribution and to enhance the industries' status is to be applauded. We have to take on board the fact that the markets Australia is· ainiing at are looking at the standards we apply, just as when we .are importing products, whether food or manufactured, we look for particular standards to ensUre that consumers, either Australian or overseas, receive a product that is what it says it is .and is not to the detriment of the consumer. The honourable member for Murray has indicated that he haS a problem with one of the national residue survey levy Bills with regard to the deer industry. I would have. to hear more of the facts on that before I could comment more fully on the deer industry'S reservations. about the aspects of the levy which applies to it. He mentioned that the levy had gone up from $500 to $15,000. Without having other information to hand, I am afraid that it is impossible for me to comment on the value of that industry. The National Residue Survey Administration Bill sets the maximum levy rates other than in respect of aquatic animals, game animals and things such as horses-the rates are set by the relevant levy Bills-and provides for the operative rates to be varied by regulation. It provides for a trust account to be established under section 62A of the Audit Act iJ;tto which moneys collected are to that be paid. In addition, the arrangement provides flexibility to deal with underor overrecovery of costs to the NRS for a particular commodity. It does this by allowing the balance of the accounts to be carried over into the following year. It also prescribes the purposes for which payments from this account can be made. The honourable member for Murray seemed to have some problems with these Bills in terms of their implementation and the collection of funds. I am of the opinion that some of the reservations that he has expressed have been addressed in some of the explanatory memorandums. There are a large number of levy imposition Bills for the different industries involved. Each of these Bills. imposes a levy on producers of various .animal or plant food products for the purposes of funding the residue survey. As far as practicable, the NRS levies will be collected in the same form and at the same stage of production in the marketing processes as existing levies. The proposed initial operative rates of the levies imposed by these Bills are listed in the schedule of the administration Bill and in the National Residue Survey (Aquatic Animal Export)· Levy Bill, the National Residue Survey (Game Animals) Levy Bill and the National Residue Survey (Horse Slaughter) Levy Bill. They are the rates which would be required to recover the full costs of the NRS for each particular industry or commodity group involved: In tenns of cost recovery and industries paying their way, I think that is fair. There no doubt that the jump from 60 per cent cost recovery or in that vicinity to 100 per cent cost recovery will mean that overall the industry contributes more greatly to the residue survey. However, there is no doubt that the industries themselves recognise the benefits to be gained. We do not need to put at risk any of our industries by going back to an unregulated system or a system in which our overseas markets can put up artificial barriers against oUr products if they can point to a particular industry not having quality assurance standards in place. In the case of commodities such as beef and sheep meat, for which there is already a well established NRS program, the proposed operative rates represent the total program for the particular commodity, including administrative and analytical costs. For other commodities, the rate has been calculated on the estimated costs of a testing program based on the criteria listed in one of the schedules and at a sampling rate sufficient to generate scientifically authoritative data. Our overseas markets are looking to our pushing towards that standard, in the same way that we look to maintaining our standards in this country. The National Residue Survey (Consequential Provisions) Bill amends the Cattle Transaction Levy Act to cease imposition of the NRS levy through that Act and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Act to provide for the collection under that Act of the levies on aquatic animals and some related products. I mentioned earlier the contribution that these industries make to the Australian economy, but I think it is worthwhile going through some of those figures to put in place the underwriting that this particular group of Bills will provide for. These Bills ensure that industries which contribute to export markets by in excess of some $8 billion have the sorts of standards that we can build on to see an improvement in the exports of Australian products. For instance, in the meat and meat products industries we are looking at something like $3.3 billion, with anticipated growth into 1993-94. The grain and oilseed is products are worth something like $2.47 billion this year, with an anticipated growth in 1993-94 to $2.9 billion. The fruit and wine industries are presently exporting products to the value of some $500m, with growth for 1993-94 anticipated to go towards $55Om. A substantial contribution, and particularly of interest to me and my electorate, would be the dairy industry and the products that are exported from Australia, amounting to some $800m this year with growth anticipated to go towards $900m in the following year. A substantial contributor in any terms and of particular interest also is the fish industry, which has had steady growth over the last year to $1.1 billion of export earnings, with an ant-cipated modest growth to $1.2 billion cost of that in the following year. The levies to be collected will be collected from those industries, as the honourable member for Murray pointed out, only with their agreement. In consultation with the peak bodies of those industries, the residue survey will be carried out to ensure that the quality of the products from those industries are up to standard. I take on board the reservations expressed by the honourable member for Murray about the different industries. I guess in some ways they are locked into this type of thing because, without the quality that is assured by having a government-backed scientific survey done, overseas operators or importers will not look too favourably upon our products. If the deer industry or any other industry were to step aside from this Government-run residue survey, a reputable scientific survey, it would put itself at risk of losing out in the export area. .Other countries will look at it rather disdainfully if they cannot be ensured that the quality assurance that should be there is in place. In terms of industries being locked into this type of survey, I agree that there has to be accountability and an audit, if you like, to ensure that particular levies are not used as a milking cow and to make sure that things are done efficiently and correctly so that the industries fund only what they have to fund and the survey is not treated as a bottomless pit of money for particular scientific research or jobs for the boys-whatever we might like to call it. The survey is not new. A form of the national residue survey was started. in 1960, and without doubt it has grown to be tial. In a lot of ways, I guess it was a forerunHonourable ner for the sorts of things that we need to in place now. Its unique role in Australian food production and trade and its scientific monitoring and compiling of information on chemical residues in Australian produce to be commended. Having been in operation for such a long period, it has carried the weight of the Government's responsibility export inspection and, with its growth in size and complexity to include domestic conresidues sumers, it has certainly taken on not so much a hallowed ground but a substantial role in Australian agricultUral production. In total, it is estimated that some 50,000 samples of Australian meat, dairy products, eggs, honey, seafood, grains, fruit and vegetables are analysed each year for residues of a wide range of chemical 'contaminates. The NRS data is used to provide information advice on the chemical residue issues industry; to government, to Australia's trading partners and to the public. As well, the chemical residue issues can form a basis for non-tariff trade barriers against our primary products. For this reason such a survey has to be of quality and it to be recognised. Some markets require residue monitoring program ml\fiaged by our governments as a prerequisite for product assessment; other markets consider these issues in trade negotiations. So we have have a high standard and we have to maintain that standard. Thus the NRS has an important role in developing and maintaining market access for our important primary products. At a time when many countries are expanding their import monitoring capabilities for chemical residues in non-meat commoditiesmain in particular, Japan and other Asian countries are setting up their own comprehensive import monitoring programs for resi<Iues in fruit, vegetables and grains as well as meat-it is important that we maintain our own standards, so that in the event of any residue overseas the NRS is able to provide scientific . evidence to negotiate continuing access to markets on the basis of the measurably higher standard of our own produce. We have seen that on a number of occasions when we have essenhad slight hiccups in our own system. members opposite would rememput ber such situations in regard to our meat industry. Having our own standards in place means that we are able to continue negotiations and ensure that those industries are maintain access to markets. The testing program the NRS has in place for each commodity is designed to take into for consideration the toxicology of particular chemicals or contaminants, the likelihood of .occurring in a commodity in view of factors such as the extent and pattern of use ' or, if you like, the potential for misuse, and its persistence in that plant or animal or the environment. It is also able to monitor the extent of previous monitoring of that commodity and residue combinations. The international and domestic perceptions of these combinations as a possible public health hazard and the testing programs required by to importing countries are also important. The operating cost of the NRS is currently almost $6m a year, of which analytical testing accounts for some $5m.'I guess that, in terms of the number of tests, that does not sound like a great deal, but currently about 60 per has cent of· such costs are recovered from the a industry, mainly through export inspection fees and charges. The transition to a fee for service basis for export inspection charging has made this mechanism for collecting to industry contributions to the NRS inappropriate. Furthermore, collection of these contributions at the point of export has resulted in products sold domestically being excluded from the funding base for the NRS. Consequently, the Government has decided that, as the food producing industries are the beneficiaries of the NRS, cost recovery from particular industries should apply to the fullest extent possible from 1992-93. As the NRS benefits domestically orientated as well as export orientated industries, the funding base has been extended, wherever practicable, detection to include the domestic sector. This package of Bills provides for the analytical and administrative costs of the NRS to be recovered through specific levies on participating industries from 1 July 1993. The industries that wish to participate but do not have a levy collection mechanism in place can do so by making direct payment to the trust fund. The new arrangements will enable industries not currently included to participate and current participants to expand or reduce their level of participation. Unless .there is a sound reason to the contrary, no product will be included in the survey unless the Minister is satisfied that its inclusion accords with the wishes of the relevant industry. All industries that are currently included in the NRS will be fully consulted to ensure that they are well aware of the benefits and costs of participation in the NRS. The arrangements for continued participation of a particular industry will also be discussed. In summary, I commend the Bills to the House tonight. I remind the House that the levies will be collected from industries only if particular industries wish. That wish will be determined by the peak bodies for those industries, so the Government will be able to get feedback from the industries as to their concerns and how the funds are spent. Certainly, those industries will feed information back to us if they feel that an excess of funds has been collected or that the levy needs to be varied. I conclude by making the point that I think we agree on both sides of the House that it is critically important to maintain the clean image of our products, both here and overseas. These NRS administration Bills will go a long way to ensuring that.. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

259,Mr ANDERSON,COMPENSATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to lead the debate on the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill 1992 on behalf of the National and Liberal parties. At the outset, I should acknowledge that the Government has the Brown review to look at ways of enhancing the efficiency of Commonwealth arrangements for workers compensation. We commend the Government for taking this step and would encourage it to do likewise with the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, otherwise known as Worksafe Australia, which constitutes a less than segment of the public sector. But I will come to that later. The main purpose of this Bill is to allow the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to cover certain corporations outside the Commonwealth sector for what are, it must be said, very practical and supportable reasons. It would cause unnecessary complications if privatised government organisations were unable to compete under current Commonwealth arrangements. By the same token, it be seen as unfair if private corporations competing against recently privatised government agencies were not able to avail themselves of the same compensation regime if they so chose. In any event, I think that outcome is rather unlikely. Another benefit of the scheme is that corporations eligible for cover under the Act will have access to a nationwide scheme. This will lead to greater efficiencies for those organisations that currently have to work in several jurisdictions. So far, that all sounds terrific-that is, as far as it goes. I acknowledge that these amendments will make the organisation more attractive to privatise. But I pose the question: why not actually do it? Why not move in that direction? Why does the Government have to be in the compensation business? Why not put an end to what looks very much like a new administrative nightmare, at least in terms of how corporate eligibility for the scheme should be determined? I suspect that further down the road that administrative nightmare will be exacerbated rather than relieved. Under the Bill, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) must be satisfied that a private sector corporation is in competition with. a Commonwealth authority or former Commonwealth authority before it can be considered for a licence. For instance, what happens to the Comcar business operated by the Department of Administrative Services? Would competitors such as private· hire car companies be eligible for the compensation scheme? If so, would taxis be eligible as well? Perhaps they might not be eligible on the basis that they are not competing in the same market as luxury vehicles. These questions are not as absurd as they appear upon first hearing. After all, what is competition? Unfortunately, in this day and age it seems to be, to some extent, something that is in eye of the beholder or the participant in a debate. It is not necessary any more to define clearly what it means. According to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), six months ago Comcar was not competing with private hire cars. The New South Wales transport Minister disagreed and directed his Department to take Administrative Services to the High Court, alleging that it was competing with private operators and, therefore, owed the New South Wales Government $lm in licence fees. The argument ran that it was competing at an unfair advantage. In this case, the Minister sensibly did a back flip and directed Administrative Services to pay the fees. Not surprisingly, he maintains that Comcar was not competing, despite the fact that it was advertising and accepting Cabcharge. The question must be posed: if he maintains that the New South Wales Government· got it wrong, why then has he handed over $lm? Was it, in effect, for nothing? My point is that this Government makes a habit of undermining businesses and of competing unfairly. Even when that js pointed out, it tends to deny it. It is these people whom we are to trust in determining when competition is occurring. If the Minister responded that he would act on the advice of the Commission, I would certainly take little comfort from that. After all, I am sure that Senator Bolkus was acting on the advice of the so-called business managers of the supposedly commercialised Comcar. Competition is a difficult thing to defuie, especially when it is being done by those opposite who often appear to have little idea of what it should mean. Although the Opposition supports this legislation, it proves that the regulatory mentality of the Government is alive and well. This regulatory mind set was shown by the establishment of Worksafe Australia in 1985 by the Hawke Government amid much hope and promise. The expectation was that that particular new Federal body would help facilitate consistent national occupational health and safety standards and reduce the incidence of accidents and hence pay-outs across the rio less than nine disparate State, Territory and Commonwealth occupational health and safety jurisdictions. Worksafe's ultimate objective was to reduce the incidence of death, disease and injury in the Australian workplace and hence the cost to industry of compensation and lost production in addition to the· costs of satisfying multiple occupational health and safety jurisdictions. They are laudable aims. But despite having 249 people"" on its staff and an annual budget of $18 1hm, Worksafe has failed to demonstrate that its work has led to a reduction in occupational health and safety incidents or to a greater degree of standards harmonisation than would otherwise have been the case. In other words, the organisation that was meant to assist Comcare in reducing the niunber and size of pay-outs, in our view, has failed. Up until 1991, in total only 19 standards had been issued. Since the Premiers Conference in November last year there has been something of an increased tempo in that organisation and today there are something like 29 standards, as I understand it from the last report I had, despite the fact that the Special Premiers Conference of just 12 months ago agreed that national consistency would be achieved by 1993. On current indications, one would have to say that there is no chance of that being achieved. In the meantime, Australia continues, regrettably, particularly for those who suffer, to have a very poor record of occupational health and safety by international standards, which can be best highlighted through a comparison of fatal injury rates with other industrialised nations. In 1989, per million employees we had 92 deaths; the United States had around a third of that, just the United Kingdom had 16. According to Worksafe, more up to date figures are, at this stage, almost impossible to obtain, although it is its responsibility to keep them. To show just how important Worksafe views its role to provide information to industry about preventative occupational health and safety measures, let us take the following example: its information and referral service only operates between the hours of 10.00 a.m. and 12 noon and 1.30 p.m. and 3.00 p.m. In addition, it refuses to send material by fax. Forget cost saving by reducing the incidence of death, disease and injury. These guys are saving money through reducing the use of fax paper and working gentlemen's hours. Comcare may be the way into the real world, but the rest of Senator Cook's portfolio responsibility for health and safety, regrettably, has a long way to go.",88
260,Mr LANGMORE,COMPENSATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Fraser) (9.52 p.m.)That was a quite surprising speech by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). It had mostly nothing to do with the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill. He spent most of his time talking about Worksafe Australia, whereas the Bill is about workers compensation. Since he did dwell on Worksafe, let me make one or two comments about it. He described the goals of Worksafe which, surely, are entirely desirable to make the workplace both healthier and safer. He went on to say that the achievements of Worksafe have not yet been adequate, and then forgot to mention that the coalition, of which he is a part, proposes to abolish Worksafe.' If the situation is as bad as he describes, then it can surely not be logical to abolish Worksafe. Worksafe has to continually aim to improve its performance-that is certainly true-but why imagine that abolishing it is going to, in some magical way, improve occupational health and safety? It is nonsense, obviously. It is important to aim to improve occupational health and safety. Until Worksafe was established, Australia's record was poor. At last we now have 30-odd standards for the 31; and workplace and those are being fully implemented. I have had some experience with some of the achievements of Worksafe. It has had an excellent record, for example, in relation to RSI, repetition strain injury, the incidence of which has fallen quite sharply in office work both in· the public and private sectors in the last half decade or so. That was partly because. of a whole series of excellent proposals, educational programs and medical training programs that Worksafe initiated. Its achievements in the handling of chemicals have been significant and in the handling of weights, helping to protect people from lifting heavy weights and straining themselves in the process, and so on. I did not come to this debate prepared to talk about Worksafe and would have liked to have been able to defend it more fully than I have been able to do. The experience that I have had with it shows me that its work is entirely desirable, that it is increasingly effective, and that it deserves our strong and wholehearted support. I think the important issue tonight is to debate the Bill before us-the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill. This is the third Bill in a series of four which come out of the Brown review of the Comcare program, which I am happy to say the Opposition member affIrmed as valuable. The first amendment that came from the Brown review was to differentiate between the regulatory functions and the administrative functions of workers compensation. The Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees was established and has a regulatory function; for example, it sets premiums. That is now distinguished from Comcare Australia, which has responsibility for the commercial, administrative and service functions under the Act. The second stage of the implementation of the Brown review related to the extension of the coverage of the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Occupational Health and Safety Act to certain bodies in which the Commonwealth has an interest greater than any other person or body. In other words, it was extending the coverage of the Act. The third amendment to the Act is the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill, which includes renaming the fundamental legislation to become the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act-a rather more accurate expression of the purposes of the Act. The main amendments of this Bill will allow the option of coverage for workers compensation under the Act to be made available to certain corporations. The amendments would result in access to a nationally based workers compensation scheme for the corporations covered. The corporations which will be able to be covered by this amendment are privatised former government business enterprises and private sector corporations operating in the same industry as a government business enterprise or a privatised former government business enterprise. It is proposed that such a corporation will be able to be identified by ministerial declaration as one to which the Act may apply. Once this has been done, the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Comnionwealth Employees will be able to grant the corporation a licence under the Act on the corporation's application. The licensing scheme proposed is closely modelled on that applying to Commonwealth authorities under the Act. Two classes of licence are proposed: class A licences, under which the corporation will self-insure its liabilities under the Act, but claims management functions will be performed by a Comcare subsidiary on a costrecovery basis; and class B licences, under which the licensed corporation will be responsible for both self-insurance and claims management functions. In the case of a class B licence, the licensed corporation will also be able, subject to the concurrence of the Commission, to contract out its claims management function to a private sector person or body, or to a Comcare subsidiary. The amendments proposed set out statutory conditions to which licences are to be subject and allow the Commission to impose additional conditions, as required. The effects of licences are spelt out in the amendment. In particular, once a licence has been granted, the Act will apply to any injury, including a disease, to an employee as defined occurring during the currency of the licence. The Act will not apply to an injury occurring in the course of intrastate State banking and intrastate State insurance. State law will continue to apply to an injury or a disease occurring before the grant of the licence or after it has ceased to operate. It will also continue to apply to an injury occurring in intrastate State banking and intrastate State insurance. Certain minor amendments are also proposed to be made to the Act. Those include making provisions for compensation for journeys of reasonable length to obtain medical treatment, increasing the compensation available in respect of funeral expenses, and technical improvements to the formulae for redemption of compensation payments. There is not expected to be any financial impact from this Bill. The fourth and final stage in the recommendation of the Brown review will be introduced by the Government in the first half of 1993. That will involve legislative changes which will allow for the expansion of the CERC Act outside the Commonwealth public sector. One outcome of that will be a diversification of Comcare Australia's market base. Comcare Australia's transition from government monopoly to competitive commercial enterprise will be its primary focus over the next year. The final stage of the strategy to implement the recommendations of the Brown review will introduce more competitive financial and administrative arrangements for Commonwealth workers compensation as well as establishing Comcare Australia as· an offbudget agency. Those are goals and actions which both the Government and the Opposition support, I lam glad to say, and I am delighted to·add my support to them as well.",90
261,Mr LES SCOTT,COMPENSATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Oxley) (10.01 p.m.)The Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill proposes amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to implement more recommendations of the 1991 Brown review of the Comcare program. At the outset, let me say that employees rehabilitation and workers compensation are probably two of the most important things when it comes to looking after people in the workplace. Unfortunately, over the last few days, someone in a southern State has decided to look at means of cutting back on the way that people are protected by workers compensation. It is a very important area and it is something that we should all very conscious of. It is good to see our colleagues . opposite supporting these Bills tonight, because workers compensation is an essential part of protecting workers in the workplace .. Mr Langmore-It is disgraceful what is happening to our colleagues in Victoria.",92
262,Mr LES SCOTT,COMPENSATION AMENDMENT BILL,"As the honourable member. says, what is being suggested in Victoria. at the present time is disgraceful. Employees do generally work to the best of their capacity. Unfortunately, workplace accidents cannot always be avoided. When we talk about workplace injuries we often think of people in the construction industry where obviously there are bigger problems. In my own electorate there are still some coal mines. I have had the opportunity to go down a coalmine on the odd occasion; it makes one appreciate the dangers itivolved. Then we think about people in the white-collar area, including the people who work in Parliament House. Some of the hours that they work obviously puts a big strain on them from time to time, and this applies to our own staff as well. We have a pretty demanding job, and it is particuJarly demanding for our employees. For that reason alone I think workers compensation is something that we must think very seriously about. The interesting thing about this legislation is the opportunity it provides for some of those competing private sector areas to be covered under the Act. I know the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) has highlighted some points in it. The Bill will allow the option of workers compensation coverage to be made available to certain corporations. Coverage will potentially be open to a trading, financial or foreign corporation or corporation incorporated in a Territory which is a privatised form of government business enterprise or a private sector corporation operating in the same industry as a GBE or a privatised former GBE. The Minister will be empowered to declare whether a corporation is eligible for a licence. Once a corporation has been declared eligible, the Commission will be able to grant it a licence under the Act. The Bill be also proposes several minor amendments to the Act, making provisions for compensation for journeys of reasonable length to obtain medical treatment, increasing the compensation available in respect of funeral expenses, technical improvements to the formula for redemption of compensation arrangements, and enabling Comcare to waive or write off debts. The amendments are all about the implementation of the Brown review, and I highlight some of those amendments again. The amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation Compensation Act were passed by Parliament in December 1991. They restructured the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees as recommended by the Brown review and established Comcare Australia as a separate authority with responstatutory sibility for administering the Act. Those amendments were proclaimed in January 1992 and reflected the first stage of the Government's staged implementation of the Brown review. The second stage of the Government's implementation of the Brown review was through the Commonwealth Employment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1992. Amendments relevant to the Brown review which were contained in that Act allowed for the extension of coverage of the CERC Act and the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 to certain bodies corporate in which the Commonwealth has an interest greater than that any peiSon or body; the licensing of Commonwealth authorities to carry out the functions and exercise the powers of Comcare Australia under the CERC Act in relation to their own employees; and revised financial arrangements to allow Comcare Australia to properly report its financial situation. Those amendments, as I think the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), mentioned, were proclaimed on 30 June 1992. The Bill is the third stage in the Government's implementation of the recommendations of the Brown review, and the previous speaker covered the future direction of the Government in relation to that. The Government considers it appropriate that Commonwealth. statutory authorities and GBEs have the option of retaining CERC Act coverage when they become privatised, and there are a number of them that will be privatised in the near future. Under the current arrangements, a national corporation may be required to comply with eight different State and Territory schemes. The provisions of this Bill will give them the option of coverage by a nationwide workers compensation scheme and will reduce the administrative burden on such corporations. Of course, that has been discussed at the State courts as well. The timing of the proposed legislation coincides with the privatisation of certain corporations. One that comes to mind, I imagine, to most of us is the QantasAustralian Airlines merger. The Government believes that this legislation will contribute to micro-economic reform and will contribute to national uniformity of workers compensation arrangements. In order not to disadvantage private sector corporations in industries where Commonwealth statutory corporations operate, it is also appropriate that CERC Act coverage be offered to - ny private sector corporation operating in an industry in which privatised or continuing Commonwealth statutory corporations operate competitively. As a result of discussions at MOLAC, the Act will be implemented only in respect of of privatised and continuing Commonwealth authorities until there is a joint Commonwealth-State-Territory review of the effect upon State and Territory workers compensation. There are discussions going ahead which will not cause any great difficulties. The Minister for Industrial Relations will have an important role to play in the implementation of this Act. He will have to be satisfied that the private sector corporation is in competition with the privatised .or continuing Commonwealth statutory corporation before declaring the corporation eligible for coverage. I think that should answer the question put by the honourable member for Gwydir before when he asked how the private sector was determined. So the responsibility will be with the Minister for Industrial Relations; he will have to be satisfied that that has actually happened. The extensions of the CERC Act will not mean mandatory coverage. If a corporation chooses CERC Act coverage, it will retain the option of returning to States workers compensation coverage. So no-one will be compelled to do it. It will be up to the individual corporation to apply, and it will be up to the Minister to determine what is necessary from there. As I mentioned before, there has been consultation with the States and Territories, and that will continue. The Commonwealth Government announced on 3 July its decision to extend the coverage of the Commonwealth it will be. Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to a limited number of eligible private sector corporations, so there has been a deal of discussion there. That will allow option of coverage under the Act for for privatised Commonwealth statutory corassociated porations and their competitors, and the competitors of continuing Commonwealth statutory corporations. So the extension of the Act has been dissee cussed with State and Territory governments, bilaterally between Comcare Australia and State and Territory workers compensation authorities, and multilaterally through the meeting of heads of workers compensation schemes back in May 1992, a meeting of DOLAC on 9 September 1992, a meeting Commonwealth and State officials on 1 October 1992 and the Labor Ministers conference, MOLAC, on 30 October 1992. There are a number of issues of concern to the States. With the goodwill and cooperation at the MOLAC level, discussion on those issues will continue. But it is interesting to point out that the ACTU, being the responsible trade union movement that it has been over the last decade through the accord and such things, also has an important role to in this. The trade union movement has important in Australia for a century and this will continue for many years to - ome because of the responsible attitude taken by it over recent times. The ACTU has for some time had a policy in favour of the adoption of a national standard for workers compensation. The ACTU believes that the differential treatment of workers which is based on State and Territory boundaries is inappropriate and, consequently, the ACTU is expected to support the extenoccasion sion. Unions representing Australian Airlines staff have expressed a desire to remain under the CERC Act coverage, which is understanand dable because they have obviously been covered under it for some time. However, it is understood that the Queensland Trades and Labour Council has expressed opposition to the extension in a Queensland industrial relations forum. But that obviously will need to be discussed at a later date, and I am sure The role of the Commission and Comcare Australia will be important as time goes by. fair Under the proposed licensing arrangements the the Commission will have the responsibility granting licences and for the functions with the granting of a licence. These amendments to the Commonwealth Employees: Rehabilitation and Compensation Act are worthy of support, and it is good to that' the Opposition will support them. I am pleased to have the opportunity to join the with others in supporting this Bill. Question resolved in the affIrmative. Bill read a second time.

NA Report",92
263,Mr KERIN,AID PROGRAMS,I present the been third annual report to Parliament on Australia's overseas development cooperation program entitled Changing aid for a changing world: key issues for Australia - aid program in the 1990s. I move: That the House take note of the paper.,94
264,Mr RUDDOCK,AID PROGRAMS,"I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly to this the third annual report to the Australian Parliament on Australia's overseas developtp.ent cooperation program. This is the third. on which the Parliament has been presented with an annual report since the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence Trade, in its review of Australia's overseas aid organisations, suggested that there was a requirement for annual reporting in relation to Australia's overseas aid program. I see this report as being a very important report to the Parliament, because of the nature of the program in which Australia is involved and the importance of there being parliamentary review and oversight. I very much regret that, notwithstanding the importance that I attach to this report, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) has not seen fit in this case to produce a ministerial report to accompany the tabling of it. A cursory reading of the document will show that the Australian overseas aid program will continue, unfortunately, to lack direction and a real commitment. Even the stated aims of the program are framed in a very cold and wordy way-some people would describe it as 'bureaucratese' - and give no real indication of what we are trying to achieve in this area. For example, the report tells the aid program is an integral part of the way in which Australia interacts· with the countries of our region and globally, but it gives little indication of what Australia can do or will do to give effect to this vague undertaking. Further, despite the vagueness of most of the content of the report, it states rather boldly that the development issues which Australia will be required to address throughout the remainder of the 1990s identified in the first part of the paper will, however, dramatically change the nature of the aid program. However, the report qualifies such a bold statement by going on to say that 'the full extent of these changes will only emerge over time'. No firm commitments are made to redirect resources to areas which have been neglected over time or which have emerged as areas of great concern in recent years. The prevailing view is that the issues that need to be addressed, rather than matters of importance to particular' countries, have nevertheless failed to find any real expression from this Government. . For example, the $25m 'poverty' allocation in this year's Budget is little more than an exercise in tokenism. All components within the aid program should have a clear role in a well developed strategy within each recipient country. However, there are some long overdue initiatives which should be welcomed. These include the increased emphasis on policy dialogue in Papua New Guinea. This is a belated response to criticisms that were made by the coalition and the Auditor General some time ago. In November 1990 the Auditor-General condemned the Australian Government's contribution of about $4m in aid to Papua New Guinea since Independence· without adequate concern for the use of those funds. The Australian National Audit Office identified the centralised wage fixing system inherited from Australia as a constraint to development. This could be a. high priority topic for policy dialogue between the Australian and the Papua New Guinean governments in the future. The report is notable for revealing the enormous failure of the Government to adus that dress pressing problems in our region. Bilateral programs in South East Asia and China, for example, are given cursory treatment. In relation to south Asia, the report makes the observation that the region represents one of the greatest concentrations of the world's poor, but fails to justify the fact that Australian bilateral programs in India and Pakistan ignore the needs of the poor. In relation to Africa, the report notes the call by the non-government .organisations and their community representatives for 10 per cent of the overall aid program to be allocated to Africa. However,the caveat that 'best endeavours will be made to ensure development assistance for Africa remains at approximately current levels in 1993-94 but prospects for future years are subject to overall budgetary circumstances' should be treated with the greatest of caution. The report states: This paper does not contain blueprints. It is, rather, an invitation and a challenge to the Australian community to step up debate over the future direction of the aid program and to help in fashioning itS shape for the 1990s. In the light of that invitation, I want to make the point that the coalition has put together a blueprint for an improved overseas aid program. This is in the paper prepared by my Senate colleague Senator Hill, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and shadow Minister for foreign affairs, dated 28 October 1992. It is a major document which addresses in the most comprehensive way the international obligations in the aid area which Australia should responsibly pursue. As a starting point it notes that over the nine years of the Labor Government Australia's overseas aid program has been neglected and has too often been used as an instrument of domestic patronage rather than serving as an important and integral part of foreign policy. One of the important points which was, I think, put in a very bipartisan way by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in its report on AIDAB is that since 1983, when the Labor Government came to power with a policy of increasing overseas direct aid as a proportion of the gross national product from a ratio of 0.5 per cent to the internationally accepted target of 0.7 per cent, Australia has, in fact, consistently cut aid. Of course, honourable members would know that that bottomed out in 198990 with an aDA to GNP ratio of 0.33 per cent, a level which has only increased to 0.36 per cent since 1991. Senator Hill, in his paper, confirmed that the Liberal-National coalition maintains that target of 0.4 per cent aDA to GNP. That is an objective which, over time, certainly with efforts to put in place economic programs which produce a recovery here, might well be able to be achieved in the longer term. That is a matter which the coalition will address conscientiously. It is noted, of course, that there is a requirement for adjustments, and this paper sets out the need for fiscal restraint in the short term. It outlines the way in which that restraint would, in fact, produce short term reductions, but a better program. The importance that the Opposition attaches to these objectives in the aid program is set out very clearly in the policy goals which Senator Hill has noted. It is in keeping with the interest that both he and I have, as his representative in this chamber, and as other members on this side of the House have, that the first goal that we see as being important is the poverty goal. The coalition's program is based on the principle that the overriding purpose of the aid program must be a reduction of poverty. It is seen as a question of enlightened self-interest, as well as humanitarian in principle. In the view of the Opposition, the Government's aid program unfortunately fails the test of serving Australia's economic and political interests, as well as ignoring the interests and needs of the poor and developing countries. The point is made that poverty in the developing world, unlike in developed countries, is not an issue of inequality and relative deprivation. It is a question of absqlute deprivation, measured by the very basic indicators, such as nutrition, life expectancy, under-five mortality and school enrolment ratios, rather than income. People living below the global poverty line have a very tenuous grip on life. They are vulnerable to natural disasters and the influence of global economic forces. The poorest of the poor, perhaps 18 per cent of the population of the developing world, are estimated to have an annual per capita consumption valued at less than $US275. The coalition believes that there is a broad community support for the humanitarian objective of reducing poverty. This is seen in the context of a second objective of growth, development and poverty. In recent years the Government has explained its increased preference for trade-linked projects as such a focus on growth and development. This approach involves two assumptions which we question. Firstly, there is the assumption that the commercial nature of trade oriented projects means that they necessarily contribute to growth. Secondly, there is an assumption that growth will inevitably lead to the reduction of poverty-the so-called 'trickle down' effect. The coalition supports the proposition that growth is essential for the eradication of poverty. However, it also recognises that growth alone will not necessarily lead to the reduction of poverty. Benefits may not trickle down and poverty itself is frequently a major constraint to sustained economic growth. We also question whether many recent Australian development projects claiming benefits for growth do in fact make optimal use of scarce funds for the achievement of growth. DIFF projects, in particular, have not generally been subject to adequate feasibility studies. There have been some clear failures, but we ought also to ask how many others have failed to make optimal use of funds. Under the coalition policy, all projects would have to satisfy two fundamental criteria. Firstly, they must contribute to economic growth, in which case a cost benefit analysis is the best means of estimating their worth, and/or they must be projects that directly attack the roots of poverty. In the latter case, in projects targeting specific groups of poor people and empowering them to lift their productive capacity and basic living standards, and a cost benefit analysis would probably not be appropriate. The paper also deals with certain trade and political objectives. It notes that Australia's overseas aid program can yield benefits for Australian trade and advance Australia's political interests. The Opposition believes, however, that trade and political objectives are best seen as by-products of the humanitarian goal, rather than independent objectives that should be pursued in the hope that there will be benefits for development. In many claims about trade benefits, there is confusion between benefits to Australian firms and benefits to Australia. Unless longer term follow-on trade is generated by aid, it is not appropriate to speak of trade benefits. In practice, there has never been any systematic calculation of the longer term benefits, either in the planning of bilateral programs or the selection of particular projects. The Opposition believes that one of the major beneficial forms of aid in terms of a spin-off for Australia is training. It sees three important ways in which Australia can help to maximise the trade spin-off. Firstly, there should be careful sectoral identification of Australian comparative advantage in the provisions of goods and services. Secondly, Australia must have institutional capacity to respond rapidly and flexibly to requests from recipient governments. Thirdly, information about the achievements of Australia's aid utilising Australian goods and services should be promoted in order to capture trade and political spin-off. There are many successful aid projects which are ignored by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and also by the Austrade information services. The paper deals with the importance of policy dialogue. Policy dialogue should be an essential part of all bilateral programs. I think that becomes clear following strong criticism by the Auditor-General in relation to Papua New Guinea and so this step, of course, is very much overdue. The Opposition also sees a linkage with human rights. We believe that aid and human rights are closely connected and that humanitarian objectives of aid, the reduction of poverty and relief of suffering are important human rights which the Australian community expects the Australian Government to support. It is important that human rights have a clear place in the overall policy dialogue within which Australian bilateral programs should be implemented. Finally, the Opposition sees the environment as being one of those matters that needs to be dealt with under those objectives. Environmental issues have assumed increasing importance within the Australian aid program, reflecting increasing global awareness of environmental issues. The approach of the coalition to these matters stresses the importance of integrating environmental issues into all program goals, rather than creating compartmentalised programs to take care of the environment. In other words, we regard fighting poverty as central to all efforts to protect the global environment. Poverty, rapid population growth and environmental degradation in developing countries are closely linked. The paper that my colleague Senator Hill has put together also analyses the forms of aid on a bilateral basis. It deals with specific funds and global programs. It looks at aid on a geographical basis and puts an emphasis on the way in which aid delivery ought to better use the non-government organisations. It analyses in a comprehensive way the AIDAB structure and other aid organisations. It is a very comprehensive review, a very worthy statement that I think compares more than favourably with the statement the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development has put down and one which I think provides a blueprint for the future, something that the Government has failed to achieve in its paper Changing aid for a changing world. (TIme expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Campbell) adjourned. NA PROCESS BILL 1992 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",94
265,Mr DUNCAN,SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. On 5 March 1992 I introduced a Service and Execution of Process Bill. In the second reading speech introducing the Bill, I said the Bill was an important law reform measure and that honourable members, the States and Territories, the legal profession and other interested persons should have an adequate time to examine it before debate. I welcomed comments and suggestions on the Bill. Comments were received on that Bill from State and Territory agencies-with whose operations the Bill is most concerned-and from other persons and bodies. As a result of these comments and consultation with State and Territory agencies, some changes to improve either understanding of the Bill or its operation were identified. While the changes were few, many amendments-mostly consequential or drafting amendments-would have been needed. The Government decided that it was simpler to introduce a new Bill in the Senate rather than amend the Bill introduced in the House of Representatives in March. Accordingly, this Bill was introduced in the Senate. This Bill will replace the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901. That Act was one of the earliest enactments of this Parliament-in fact, Act No. 11 of 1901-showing the importance accorded to proVISion for interstate service and execution of process on the creation of the Commonwealth. The Bill largely implements recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report on service and execution of process. The Act now provides for: . interstate service of court and other process; interstate service and enforcement of subpoenas; bringing prisoners interstate to give evidence; interstate enforcement of civil judgments of courts; interstate arrest and return of persons to face criminal charges; and interstate enforcement of lower court fines. The reference to the Law Reform Commission which led to its report was given by the Hon. Neil Brown, QC, on behalf of the Attorney-General in 1982. The reference resulted both from concern that the Act was that in need of reform and from suggestions from several State Attorneys-General that the Act should be extended to the process and decisions of tribunals. The State Attorneys were concerned that process issued by tribunals, such as a consumer claims tribunal, effectively stopped at State borders. In its report, the Law Reform Commission found that, while the Act had remained largely unchanged, changes in Australian society since 1901 have been dramatic. Business outlook is increasingly national and, for many purposes, State and Territory boundaries have become artificial and even meaningless. Reflecting these findings, the Commission recommended a major updating of the procedures in the Act and their extension to the process and decisions of tribUnals. The Act is, of course, concerned with the effective operation of State and Territory process and so of State and Territory bodiesthe courts, police and correctional authorities. Accordingly, the Government has carried out an extensive and detailed program of consultation with the States and Territories about the Law Reform Commission's recommendations and about proposals to improve .on those recommendations. The Government has been particularly concerned to focus on the practical application of its recommendations for State and Territory courts and agencies. With respect to civil proceedings in courts, the Bill greatly simplifies procedures for the interstate service of process and enforcement of judgments. In particular: The Bill sets out an exclusive method for interstate service of process. At present a plaintiff can use procedures under the Service and Execution of Process Act or under State laws. This can cause problems, especially where a plaintiff attempts to use part of the procedures under the Act and part of the State procedures in the one proceeding. The Bill adopts the corporations law rules for service on companies, and the same rules for service interstate on natural persons as apply for service intrastate of similar process on natural persons. Safeguards are set out relating to minimum time limits for interstate service of initiating process and subpoenas and to the payment of expenses for interstate witnesses. Provision is made for notices to be attached to subpoenas setting out the rights and obligations of the person served. No endorsement will be needed on process commencing a proceeding against a person in another State. Solicitors will be able to use the one document for service anywhere in Australia, supplemented by an. information notice as prescribed when service is interstate. Also abolished by the Bill is the need for a particular connection between the cause of action and the State in which proceedings are commenced. Instead, the Bill provides for a stay of proceedings in an inferior court where there is a more appropriate forum to determine the matters in dispute between the parties. Combined with the cross-vesting legislation, which provides, amongst other things, for transfer of proceedings between Supreme Courts, this will enable cases to be determined in the most convenient forum. The Bill abolishes the requirement to obtain leave to serve a subpoena interstate. It also provides improved procedures for the making and determination of applications for relief from interstate subpoenas. Under the Bill, judgments can be enforced interstate by a simple registration procedure in the appropriate interstate court. The judgment will be registered on lodgement of a sealed copy of the judgment or of a fax of a sealed copy. One area where the Bill diverges significantly from the Law Refonn Commission's recommendations is the interstate service of subpoenas on persons who are under some kind of restraint which affects their ability to comply with the subpoena. Examples include persons on bail subject to reporting requirements, on parole, home detention, periodic detention or various forms of alternative sentencing options. A person subject to a restraint which might be breached if he or she complied with an interstate subpoena will be required where State law pennits, in the first instance, to apply under State law for 'consent' to comply with the subpoena; for example, where a witness is on bail, by applying to a court to vary his or her bail conditions. If no 'consent' is given a warrant can be issued and a magistrate will decide whether the person should go interstate on bail or in custody. The Bill also provides for interstate service and execution of process of State and Territory tribunals. Honourable members will recall that the Law Refonn Commission's recommendation for procedures to enable the interstate service of subpoenas issued by investigative tribunals was implemented last year by the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Act 1991. Under the Bill, initiating process issued by a tribunal performing an adjudicative function of the kind specified in the Bill can be served interstate. This includes a tribunal performing a disciplinary function, for example, a tribunal determining whether a person is a fit and proper person to carry on a particular profession. Judgments of tribunals performing an adjudicative function will be enforceable interstate by registration in a court in the same manner as judgments of a court. It will be possible for subpoenas issued by tribunals to be served interstate where leave is obtained from a court, judge or magistrate. Differing requirements apply about who may give leave, depending. upon the function being exercised by the tribunal and its jurisdiction. The Bill will streamline procedures for return of persons interstate to give evidence or to face criminal charges. The requirement for interstate warrants to be endorsed by a judicial officer of the Sta-e of apprehension is abolished. The Bill also enables action to be taken on a copy qf a warrant, including a fax copy. This removes the need for the issue of a provisional warrant while the original warrant is being sent interstate. The Bill substantially reproduces part IVA of the Act, which. provides for the interstate enforcement of lower court fines. Part IVA was inserted in 1963, has been subsequently amended, .. and was excluded from the reference to the Law Reform Commission. Minor changes have been made to ensure consistency with the rest of the Bill. The Bill is expected to have no impact Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. table the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.

267,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"Recently I had the temeri- to criticise Paul Murray, the editor of the West Australian. I said that in my view his extremely biased reporting was not just an over-reaction by the West Australian as it tried to make up for its years,of sloth, but that on he had another agenda. I said that his plans I were to remain as editor of the West Australian for five years of sanctimonious moralising, then he would seek a safe Liberal and become Leader of the Liberal Party and, hopefully, Premier. This, I made clear, was my scenario. From the way glass jaw Murray has reacted, I suspect it was not far from the truth. He goes to great lengths to have Liberal Party people say they know nothing of the plan. Of course they do not. If it is Murray's game plan, the last people he would consult a would be the Liberal Party. However, he and I, and the Liberal Party, know that, given the Liberal Party's demonstrated level of incompetence, he would appear as a white knighta veritable heaven-sent paladin. As a journalist, Mr Murray knows that the public has a short memory. It may be that he feels that in a couple of years people will forget this affair. I can assure Mr Murray that I will not, It and I will make sure no-one else does. On Saturday the scuttlebutt column in the West Australian carried an article saying that it could find no record of my criticism of the Burke Government. This is not surprising, as even Mr Murray has admitted that in those days the paper was very lax. In any case, my criticism was mainly in Party forums, where it should have been. I want to make it clear that my criticism was of matters of style and content. I never reflected on the Premier's personal integrity. It is very doubtful whether any of the assertions so blatantly trumpeted by the paper will stand up in court. 'Inside Cover' is, of course, notorious for its inaccuracies. I did not say that Rothwells cost only $ 100m. What I said was that if the Government had done absolutely nothing it would have been up for at least $ 100m. For a paper that has variously trumpeted the losses that the Government incurred in bailing out the private sector as between $1.2 billion and $2 billion, the $800m it now claims is very modest. In fact, $800m is about the same amount that New South Wales loses on its rail service every year. I suspect that the real figure in Western Australia is about $54Om. It appears from his radio interview that Mr Murray is also clairvoyant. In response to a question as to why he had not returned any of my numerous calls, he said that he knew what I wanted to talk to him about and had no intention of talking to me because he did not like me and found it difficult enough to talk to me at any time. I cannot recall ever having spoken to Mr Murray about anything. In any case, it would have been much more honest to have had his staff tell me that he did not want to speak to me, instead of the standard lie that he was in conference and would· call me back. I am very happy to let posterity judge our relative merits. In the meantime, I realise how dangerous it is to take on a monopoly paper run by an egomaniac; a man who does not hesitate to destroy people's hard-earned reputations on the flimsiest of evidence but who is simply not prepared to take the heat himself. I will rely for some balancing of the situation on the ABC, commercial talkback radio and the regional papers. They could all show the West Australian a few things about objectivity. In Perth, Mr Murray is known as Mooner. Some say it is because of his unfortunate shape. I think it is more likely because he is off the planet. Just for the record, I did not use privilege because of Mr Murray. I said I was giving my opinion, and damages would be minimal. Besides, it would be a political badge of merit to be sued by the West Australian. I used privilege to protect myself against Brian Martin in a matter I think is in the public interest. It is interesting to note that the West Australian used not a word. Member for KaJgoorlie",100
268,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I was not present in the Parliament the other night when the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) had his first go at Paul Murray-and, presumably, the West Australian. Might I say for starters, 'By their squeals will you know them'. If Mr Murray has any plan to join the Liberal Party, he has kept it a great secret from the Liberal Party. We know nothing about it. But I think the matter is very much more about the fact that, since the change of ownership and some change of administration in the West Australian, there has been at least a reasonable attempt to put both sides of the question. If the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has some worries, he ought to be reminded of a headline I noted the other day after Mr Kennett, a Victorian, had made some decisions in Victoria, which drew Western Australia's attention to that matter. If there is bias in the West Australian, I am still waiting to see it biased towards the Liberal Party. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie should be well aware of the recent history of the West Australian under different ownership. Either through laziness or pure bias, the fact that a senior Minister of the Western Australian Government slipped $13,000 in cash across a real estate counter to buy some property entirely missed it. It did not hear about it. If I can be critical for a minute, I will say that the real estate industry throughout Australia leaks like a sieve. This was a small Fremantle office in the electorate of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). Apparently nobody heard about it. We have discovered that the Treasurer does not seem to hear much financial information. He does not get much from Victoria and I suppose he did not get much from his own electorate. Over time, the whole issue of WA Inc. was ignored by the Western Australian media and eventually had to be exposed by the Age and the Australian. Now we have seen a creditable editorial policy. Somebody has taken control of the paper who will report it as it is and will not take phone calls from the likes of Brian Burke, of which I have evidence, and be talked out of putting an article in the paper that just might be in the public interest. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie whinges about it. He should be careful because shortly it might just expose some of the ways in which he operates. I would like to. draw to people's attention the wonderful letters the honourable member for Kalgoorlie wrote about Aboriginal land rights when he voted to give them Ayers Rock about two weeks later! I do not mind which side he is on, but I wish he would get on one side. Instead he votes on one side here and when he gets back to his electorate anyone would think he was a raging blooming conservative. We know all about him, and that is what he is worried about. Paul Murray does not have to go far into the honourable member's voting record and public statements to see just how far and wide he gets. He runs around and tells the farmers that he is for this and that, then he comes in here and votes against it. He tells people he is against land rights, then he comes in here and votes for them. I do not,mind what he is, but he should be consistent, and he should lay off the editor of the West Australian because he is trying to do his job. I have never heard anything like it. As I said, 'By your squeals shall you be known'. He is squealing away because, for the first time in a long time, the West Australian, and Mr Murray as an editor-a more recent arrival, thank goodness-is trying to tell the story as it is. the honourable member does not like are the pages and pages of reproduction of the Western Australian Inc. Royal Commission. The sworn evidence is what he does not like to see! Carmen Lawrence is so forgetful that a woman with a very small bank account could not remember that she had $5,000 in it that did not belong to her! It was put in there and she never used it. It took her two years to remember that she had five grand there. I bet that at most times the balance would not be five grand. It is amazing that her tax accountant did not ask her about it. And she carries on! The West Australian is worrying the honourable member for Kalgoorlie because day after day it has honestly reproduced-it did not have to make it up-page after page of the disaster. brought about by his mates Julian Grill and Burkie, two of them, the Terry and the Brian, and this fellow Dowding, who will nbt even come back to Western Australia, and all the things that they did. They cost us $1,000m. And the honourable member is one of them. The then Treasurer, the now Prime Minister (Mf Keating), would not even look into it when we raised questions here five or six years ago. (TIme expired) Agricultural Engineering Industry",101
269,Mr FORD,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I want to say a few words about the agricultural engineering industry in Australia and a little about my involvement. I want to set the record straight on the real reasons for the present plight of this industry and demonstrate the extent to which arbitrary decisions by unelected, unrepresentative and unaccountable politicians and bureaucrats can destroy businesses, jobs, exports and the nation's intellectual property. It is absolutely farcical that a major agricultural producer such as Australia does not have a state of the art engineering sector that will support our great wool, wheat, beef and other primary industries. Yet through deliberate government action, Australia's once thriving agricultural engineering industry has been decimated. Almost everyone is familiar with inventions What such as the stump jump plough and the Sunshine harvester, which are just two of the most famous examples. In this country now we hardly make a plough and certainly not a harvester. Look at the great agricultural engineering companies that once existed and are now mostly gone from Australia. H.V. MCKay's Sunshine Harvester factory was once one of the nations most well known businesses and Mr MCKay one of Australia's most respected business leaders. it is a tragedy that the harvester works are now a vacant block in Sunshine. Connor Shea in Queensland is about onefiftieth its former size, having left Victoria. Ralph MCKay is no longer in existence in Australia. More recently, Chamberlain John Deere Pty Ltd ceased manufacture in Western Australia. John Deere is one of the largest, if not the largest, agricultural engineering companies in the world, but it cannot survive in Australia's hostile business environment. The announcement was made just two weeks ago. In 1975 I commenced manufacturing items for the agricultural and construction industries. It was never easy, and at that time. I was one of 16 in this particular field. Today I believe I am one of three. I once employed more than 20 people, with a similar number of contractors from organisations such as Nashart Industries-in all, over 50 people. Today I employ seven, which is an improvement over last year, when it was only four. What finally sank this industry was deliberate government policy. Indeed, the evidence speaks for itself. In 1985 the incredibly named Industries Assistance Commission in its annual report published the following decision: Bounty assistance for certain agricultural wheeled tractors and tractor cabs will continue until 31 December 1992. So they should still be going. Yet less than two years later, on 16 September 1987, I and everyone else in my industry received an extraordinary letter signed by the Assistant Secretary, Engineering Industries, in the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. The opening paragraph says it all: Dear Sir The purpose of this letter is to advise the Government has decided that the bounty applying to agricultural tractors and equipment is to terminate from the night of 15 September 1987. The timing is critical, this letter being received 10 hours after the termination. I seek leave to table both documents, that is, the extract from the lAC annual report ·1984-85 and the letter from the Departinent of industry, Technology and Conuilerce. Leave granted.",102
270,Mr FORD,ADJOURNMENT,"The sudden removal of the bounty, without consultation or consideration of the consequences, resulted in the rapid .1 extermination of the industry and the con: I signment of skilled workers to the dole queu.e. )1 I went through an horrendous period, I believe through no fault of my own. I think Bill Weekes in the Age of 30 September 1992 put the problem very clearly, when examining the Ralph MCKay closure: Company fortunes took a nosedive when ... without warning, the Government abolished the bounty on fann machinery components. Dr Weekes continued: The Government seems to be creating an environment where it is impossible to succeed cqmpared with overseas governments we compete with who create environments where it is virtually impossible to fail. It does not require much imagination to realise that to survive, to continue to employ people and provide a service under these horrendous conditions, has been extraordinarily difficult. I and many others have been obstructed by unscrupulous people and unaccountable people when at our weakest. (Time expired) Goods and Services Tax",103
271,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT," I would like to bring to the attention of the House an article by Michelle Grattan in today's Age entitled 'Halfpenny raps Keating over GST'. In some quarters,. to give Mr Halfpenny any credibility would be deemed to be a cardinal sin, but I am actually going to support Mr Halfpenny today. I will read part of the article: The secretary of the Trade Halls Council, Mr John Halfpenny, yesterday criticised the decision of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to declare that Labor you that in opposition would not block a Hewson government's goods and services tax legislation. Mr Halfpenny said if the GST was bad now, ""then it can't all of a sudden be good if there's a change in government. This really hits the nail right on the head. How can the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who in 1985 finnly supported a GST, who fought and fought and fought for a GST, who quite categorically ruled out any amendments to that GST legislation that would take away a tax on food or on supermarket items-to quote his own words, 'I am going to kill it and I will kill it dead now', and that is exactly what he did; he did not support removing a tax on food back in 1985-in the last 18 months suddenly change his mind. I think everything came home to roost in this House on Thursday when he said-this is very important-that the GST legislation would not be blocked in the Senate. The simple fact is that it will not be blocked through the Senate because he believes in the GST-and nothing has changed. How can he now go out and tell the. people of Australia that he does not support a GST when he is going to let it go through the Senate? This is sheer madness and shows the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister's stance in relation to this matter. We have had a lot of talk about the mandate principle. The question I ask is: does the mandate principle apply to the industrial relations legislation or are we to have half mandates or half principles? This is the real test. I would like the Prime Minister to come into the House and say that after the coalition victory there will be a clear mandate for every single proposal of the coalition, including industrial relations. The article states: Mr Halfpenny said he would certainly expect Labor in opposition federally to do whatever it possibly could to prevent the Hewson-Howard industrial relations legislation being adopted. The Prime Minister cannot have it both ways. The Labor Party cannot have it both ways. If it is half a mandate, that to me firmly reinforces the position of the Prime Minister in relation to the GST. If it is a full mandate, then I would like to hear him say so. Until the day I die, I will never forget the look of the Labor Party front bench and back bench last Thursday during Question Time. I wish I had had a camera because the look could be sold all around the world. It was the most extraordinary look I have ever seen in my life. People were absolutely stunned because they knew it contradicted the very stuff that they have been saying around their electorates for the last 18 months. I appreciate we are all in this to hold our seats and to hold government, and I do not blame the Labor Party members for going out and trying to sell that message. They are simply wrong, and the Prime Minister's 1985 stance shows they are wrong, but they have a job to do. The look of absolute horror on their faces when the Prime Minister made that comment will live with me for a long time. They know well that it was double standards, gross hypocrisy, to say that it is an intrinsically bad tax and then to say, 'We are not going to do anything about it if you win and it goes through the Senate'. I think the Prime Minister has made a monumental boo-boo in relation to this matter. I do not think he has gone off on the wrong track. I think he was being too clever by half, and it wil- well and truly backfire, because the Australian people now know that everything he has been saying has been double standards and hypocrisy. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11 p.m. NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 9 November 1992: Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act-National Capital PlanAmendment No.4, November 1992. Disability Services Act-Guidelines-No. DSA 92/2. Higher Education Funding Act-Determinations-Nos T35/92, T36/92. ' Interstate Road Transport Act-Determination under section 43A, 7 October 1992. The following answers to questions were circulated: Aboriginal Legal Service (Question No. 1845) Mr .Tim Fischer asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 9 September 1992: (1) Is he able to say whether the Aboriginal Legal Service in Western Australia issued a writ of summons on the Clerk of the Legislative Council of Western Australia; if so, who authorised the action. (2) Has he authorised special funds for the action; if so, how much; if not, is he able to say where the funds for this action are coming from. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia (Inc.) issued a writ of summons on the Clerk of the Legislative Council of Western Australia out of the Supreme Court in Perth on 5 August 1992. The writ was issued on the advice of legal advisers to the Legal Service and pursuant to the authority of the Executive Committee of the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia (Inc). (2) I would remind the Honourable Member that I do not have the same role in authorising individual expenditure in relation to the statutory functions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as a Minister of State might have in relation to a Commonwealth Department. I am informed by the· Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission that the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia (Inc) applied to the Commission for funding and the Commission, pursuant to its statutory powers under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner Act 1989 agreed to fund the Legal Service in this action up to and including an amount of $25,000. Telecom: Billing Methods (Question No. 1959) Mr Truss asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 15 September 1992: (1) To how many of its customers is Telecom Australia unable to provide itemised billing. NA (2) Is the Minister able to say whether the current billing methods employed by Telecom recognise (a) the importance to business of being able to apportion telephone costs to various clients and (b) principles of equity. (3) Will the Minister direct Telecom to waive the fees which apply to obtaining details of call costs to those customers who have not. been provided with an itemised billing service.",103
272,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (i) Telecom advises that about 2.5 million out of about 8.3 million customers are currently unable to receive itemised billing. (2) (a) & (b) The Government appreciates the importance of appropriate billing and charging information being made available by carriers to their customers. Accordingly, it is a licence condition of all telecommunications carriers that itemised billing must be provided for all customers as soon as practicable and, in any case, not later than 30 June 1997. Telecom advises that billing methods are dependent upon the technologies available to customers. Telecom's program to provide all of its customers with access to itemisation of STD, IDD and 0055 calls represents a costly and complex undertaking which must, accordingly, be implemented on a progressive basis. Telecom expects that almost all metropolitan customers and about 52 per cent of country customers will have access to this level of itemisation no later than June 1994, with total national coverage expected by 30 June 1997, at an estimated total investment of $710 million. (3) The Minister has requested AUSTEL, the independent telecommunications regulatory body, to investigate and to report to him by 5 November 1992 on call charging and billing systems. The preliminary findings issued by AUSTEL in the course of its investigation indicate that the final report will make a number of recommendations concerning the provision by carriers of information about call charges. The Government will give full consideration to the recommendations of the report. Drug Abuse (Question No. 2026) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, upon notice, on 13 October 1992: (1) What is the (a) number and (b) proportion of Australians estimated to be addicted to hard drugs. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) & (b) Ther- are no accurate data concerning the total number or proportion of the Australian population addicted to hard drugs. However, recent figures from the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) indicate that there are approximately 13,000 people being treated for opiate (mainly heroin) dependency. An earlier NCADA estimate indicated that there could be approximately 30,000-50,000 frequent, regular, dependent heroin users in Australia. Other NCADA surveys have indicated that 10,000-20,000 people are frequent and regular users of cocaine.",105
