1,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,I ask the Prime Minister if he will make a clear statement as to what is proposed in regard to the Christmas holidays of casual employees ?,5
2,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The casual employees will be treated in the same way as the permanent employees of the Government in regard to the Christmas holidays. The original question asked on the subject was whether the special concession would be given to temporary employees which was given in 1912. My reply to that question was "" No . "" The concession was absolutely abused, and will not be given again. The statutory holidays will be cheerfully allowed to all concerned, and will be paid for. LIGHTHOUSES.",5
3,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Minister of Trade and Customs has announced that it is in tended to impose light dues, when a three-months' notice has expired, and that that notice will commence before the end of the month. Therefore, it must be contemplated to take over the lighthouses from the States within about three months' time. I ask the honourable gentleman whether, before the issue of a proclamation for the taking over of the lighthouses, he intends to have a clear and definite understanding with the States as to the basis of the valuation of transferred properties? The Minister will find that in one particular case there was some dispute regarding a quarantine transfer, the basis of valuation not being fixed beforehand. To make matters perfectly clear, does the Minister intend to get a definite agreement from the States before this transfer ?",5
4,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If we are to wait until all the States have come to a definite decision regarding the valuation of the properties to be transferred, the transfer may be postponed for ever. The Defence, Customs, and Post Office properties which were transferred to the Commonwealth at the inception of Federation, were not valued for several years afterwards; and I do not think that any difficulty will arise with regard to the valuation of the lighthouses. I do not consider it wise to postat 11 pone the transfer any longer. DUTIESON FODDER.  Trade and Customs read the following paragraph in reference to the duties on fodder published in this morning's Age. This is the report of a statement made by the Premier of South Australia: The Minister of Customs, if he had been correctly reported, had made a mistake regarding South Australia. At the instance of the Grain and Fodder Board, the Government, on 20th November, telegraphed to the Prime Minister ordering 6,000 tons of chaff to be imported to this State. No reply having been received, a further telegram was sent on 7th December, and that has not been answered. Has the Minister seen that paragraph, and has he inquired why the telegrams were not answered ?",5
5,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I read the paragraph, and at once inquired about the telegrams. I find that South Australia was the only State that replied affirmatively to our in quiry, though Western Australia sent a message regarding maize, with which I have already dealt. The telegram from South Australia was, however, pigeonholed by the clerk who received it from the Prime Minister's Department, and neither the Comptroller, the Secretary of the Department, nor myself, was aware of its existence until this morning. The telegram is as follows: With reference my telegram, Oth November, 6,000 tons of hay chaff will not be required to be imported from New Zealand provided it is guaranteed of good quality and subject to shipment immediately after next harvest. Apparently, the "" m y "" should be "" y o u r , "" and the "" not "" should be omitted, these being mistakes in coding.  message ?",5
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It is dated 20th November, and was sent from the Prime Minister's Department to the Customs Department. The explanation of the officer who received it was that he was waiting for the reply from the other States, thinking that no action was necessary until all the States had replied.  sent from South Australia on the 7th December.",5
7,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I have not seen that telegram on the file.  that has not been searched ?,6
8,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The telegram that was sent by the Prime Minister to all the States, except Victoria, was dated 6th November, and is as follows: With reference to conversation with Minister of Trade and Customs at recent conference, would you be good enough to state quantity of oats' chaff or other fodder you desire should be purchased in Now Zealand on your account? Telegraph reply, please, with least possible delay. On 7th November, the Premier of New South Wales repliedYour telegram yesterday re fodder. My Government do not wish participate. That was referred to the Customs Department. From Perth this telegram came from the Deputy Premier on the 9th NovemberReply your wire, 6th instant, re New Zealand fodder, have been negotiating with Argentine for 6,000 tons maize. If sanction of this not approved, would like to secure its equivalent in cats or other concentrated fodder. Unable, at present, estimate amount of chaff required. Can you indicate price? The Premier of Queensland telegraphed on 11th NovemberWith reference your telegram 6th November, under the present conditions think no occasion to make provision specially for oaten chaff. Lucerne is n. popular fodder in Queensland. Present cutting good, and, given summer rains, we shall have monthly cuttings of lucerne. Still, will you give me idea of price? Could lie landed at Brisbane, Rockhampton, Townsville, or. if this is not practicable, give me quotation free on bourd New Zealand. That was sent to the Customs Department on the 12th Noven.ber. Then there was the telegram from the Premier of South Australia, which I have read; and on the 23rd November a telegram from the Premier of TasmaniaReferring to your telegram of the seventh instant seeking information quantities of oats etc., to be purchased from New Zealand, I regret that owing action legislative council fusing pass Foodstuffs Commission Bill it is impossible ascertain quantities produce now in hands of producers, merchants, and other thereby preventing accurate calculations as to requirement of this State; there is little doubt however that we will be in urgent need of considerable quantity of wheat during next twelve montlis. As I stated the other day, I saw Mr . Hutchinson and Dr Cameron on two occasions, but they did not make any definite statement as to what would be done. This letter was sent to the Premier of Victoria on the 24th NovemberWith reference to your conversation with - my colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, at the recent Conference, I shall be glad if you will be so good as to state the quantities of oats, chaff, or other fodder which you desire should be purchased in New Zealand on your account. The favour of an early reply would be appreciated. No reply to that letter has heen received. I made a mistake in my reference to the telegram of 7th December. The Premier of South Australia wired on that date.Referring to your telegram of 6th ultimo and my reply of 20th ultimo, shall be glad to learn whether New Zealand chaff has been secured. I did not see this file until this morning.",6
9,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"In view of the fact that more than one State has applied for the free admission of fodder, particularly Western Australia and South Australia, and as there is a likelihood of Queensland requiring a similar concession, will the Minister reconsider the matter of allowing the free importation of fodder during this period of drought ?",6
10,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I will be pleased to submit that matter for the Cabinet's consideration. Later of the Minister of Trade and Customs lo secure the chaff which the South Australian Government have ordered ?,6
11,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"On account of the publicity which has been given to this matter, the reason for secret negotiations with the New Zealand Government has disappeared, and as the South Australian Government is the only Government requiring the importation, I think it would be better if they could do the trade directly. The matter of the remission of the duties is one for subin re- mission to the Cabinet in view of the action taken, over which I can assure honourable members. I had no control. STATISTIC AL PAMPHLETS .",6
12,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"Will the Minister of Home Affairs undertake to have issued to members copies of the small pocket edition of statistics issued by Mr . ""Knibbs?",6
13,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"I gave an instruction to Mr Knibbs some time ago to have that little volume republished, and members sliould receive copies in a few days. NA FORCES INEGYP T.",7
14,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAYMENT OF EXPEDITIONARY,"A statement been *published in the press that arrangeturing ments have been made by the CommonTrade wealth whereby Australian troops i Egypt may cash Australian bank notes. minion ? Will the Prime Minister inform the House how many Australian notes have been so cashed, and if it is intended to pay our troops in Egypt with Commonwealth notes?",7
15,Mr FISHER,PAYMENT OF EXPEDITIONARY,"No arrangement for the payment of Australian troops in Egypt by notes particularly has been - made. Before the troops left Australia to that country last year. an arrangement was made by the Gosort vernment through our London agents to in these days. allow of the immediate payment of our troops wherever they landed, whether in Egypt or elsewhere. Arrangement was also made for the provision of savings banks in the camps, so that every facility would be given the troops to deposit their money. There is no intention allowing Australian notes to wander all over Egypt, nor is that desirable. the information which the honourable member has referred to is an indication that Australian paper currency is good sented to the Australian public ? in any other country. WOO LEXPORT .  Trade and Customs seen the statement in the press that the prohibition of export of Australian wools to America has been removed. If so, is it that since that removal the restriction good as those elsewhere. has been enforced ?",7
16,Mr TUDOR,PAYMENT OF EXPEDITIONARY,"The Prime Minister's Department cabled last week to ascertai n whether the press statement that the prohibition had been removed is correct. We have only the one source of official information on a point like that, and that is the British Government. When the British Government say that the restriction can be removed, so f it concerns the United States America, it will be removed.",7
17,Mr FENTON,PAYMENT OF EXPEDITIONARY,"Some time ago the Commonwealth prohibited the export of wool to certain countries, amongst them Japan, Canada, and New Zealand. Recently the prohibition was withdrawn with regard to Japan and Canada, but it was allowed to continue in regard to New^Zealand. As a considerable quantity of Australian merino wool has is required in New Zealand for manufacpurposes, will the Minister of and Customs withdraw the emn bargo on the export of wool to the Do",7
18,Mr TUDOR,PAYMENT OF EXPEDITIONARY,"Speakin g from memory, I think I gave authority a few days ago for the shipment of wool to New Zealand, but each quantity to be shipped has to be approved by me. I may say that on© place on another Continent to which we were asked to ship wool was ordering over a thousand times as much as went That is the of tiling we have to guard against NA FILMS.",7
19,Mr HIGGS,DUTY ON CINEMATOGRAPH,"Before making any reduction in the duty on cinematograph films, will the Minister of Trade and of Customs make inquiry as to whether there is not sufficient theatrical talent in AusB u t tralia, and a sumcient number of photographic experts, to produce many of the dramas and comedies which are now preWill he also see that any proposed reduction he may make will not be so low as to prevent Australian manufacturers establishing a new industry?",7
20,Mr TUDOR,DUTY ON CINEMATOGRAPH,"I certainly think there is sumcient histrionic talent in Australia the to produce the comedies and dramas I have seen at picture shows. I also think a fact that the photographic artists here are as But the Government received information which led us to believe that a mistake had been made in the values of the films, and the question. I have to consider is whether we should rectify that mistake. NOTE ISSUE .",7
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY ON CINEMATOGRAPH,"What is the reason for a Gazette notice authorizing a r as the issue of £16,000,000 worth of Ausof tralian notes? Is that intended to cover a new issue ?",7
22,Mr EISHER,DUTY ON CINEMATOGRAPH,"The Treasury is not authorized to issue any notes without a Gazette notice covering the amount. think that we have gazetted, from time to time, £4,000,000, £6,000,000, £12,000,000, and so. on, until we are now gazetting the issue of £16,000,000, and if the issue were likely to increase to £17,000,000 or £18,000,000, we should have to publish a Gazette notice permitting an issue to that extent. In addition to the law allowing an unlimited issue of notes with a statutory reserve in gold, there is also provision which makes it necessary for an Order in Council to be made that a certain amount shall be issued. PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE . siderable",8
23,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,DUTY ON CINEMATOGRAPH,"Will the Prime Minister inform the House what publio works, if any, the Government in tend to remit to the Public Works Committee for inquiry during the forthcoming recess ?",8
24,Mr EISHER,DUTY ON CINEMATOGRAPH,"The Government have in contemplation the passing of a resolution remitting to the Committee certain works, which, I think, will occupy their time sufficiently and well. Parliament will probably have to exclude from the consideration of the Committee the Works Estimates for 1914-15, leaving it to deal with prospective works.",8
25,Mr HIGGS,DUTY ON CINEMATOGRAPH,That means a short amending Bill .,8
26,Mr EISHER,DUTY ON CINEMATOGRAPH,"It means an amendment of the principal Act, which was passed in 1913, and provided for the clusion of the Works Estimates for that year. The Public Works Committee, however, was only appointed a few days ago. H ad the Act been passed during the current financial year, no doubt the Works Estimates for 1914-15 would have been excluded from the consideration the Committee. This is a matter, howexplanation ever, that can be dealt with according Ihe general consensus of opinion of the House. POSTAL REFORMS.",8
27,Mr SHARPE,DUTY ON CINEMATOGRAPH,"Is the Postmasteras General favourable to a conference of the Deputy Postmasters-General, which might be able to make suggestions that would assist him in carrying out the reforms the Department which he has in view?",8
28,Mr SPENCE,DUTY ON CINEMATOGRAPH,"There are some reforms which we believe necessary, and if I it is thought that it would be advantageous to have a meeting of the Deputy Postmasters-General in order to urge them to carry out those reforms we may convene one. NA ACROSS THEMURRAY .",8
29,Mr SAMPSON,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,I wish to ask the Attorney-General if the reported action of an officer from New South Wales in destroying a barrage placed across the Murray River at N y a h is not a breach of section 98 of the Constitution?,8
30,Mr HUGHES,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"A matter of conimportance is raised by the honourable gentleman's question. The authority of the Commonwealth under the Constitution to deal with navigable rivers and the control of waterways is very considerable, and extends, no doubt, to the power to deal with obstructions to navigation. To what extent we may deal with an Act of any State interfering with the right of other States to the use of waters for i r r i gation or navigation purposes, I should not like to say off-hand, but I shall look into the matter most carefully, ask for furthe r particulars, and let the honourable member know the result. AUSTRALIAN NOTES FUND.",8
31,Mr ANSTEY,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"I notice that the payments into and withdrawals from the exNotes Fund prior to the outbreak of the war amounted to about £250,000 a month, but that since the outbreak of the war many millions have been paid by the banks into the Notes Fund. In August about £2,250,000 was paid in , and last month the payments were about the same. I deof sire to ask the Prime Minister what is the of this enormous pouring in to of gold since the outbreak of war? Is it the outcome of any arrangement with the banks?",8
32,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"U p to the present time no substantial amount has been received the result of the arrangement made. Small amounts have been received in respect of the banks and the States, and they do not aggregate more than £750,000. of I think that they have confidence in the Commonwealth. NEW ISSUE OF NOTES.",8
33,Mr KELLY,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"Will the Prime M i nister state how long the new issue of £ 1 notes, which is obviously of only a temporary character, will be kept in circulation ? How long will it be before the Government printing press will be able to turn out the permanent instead of the temporary notes?",9
34,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,In the emergency that arose both the paper and the dies of the old bank-note issue had to be employed.,9
35,Mr KELLY,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,But when will the new issue of Commonwealth notes take their place ?,9
36,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"They are being printed rapidly. A new machine which was ordered by the Government of which the honourable member was a member, is now being installed, and in twelve months we shall be able, I think, to cover the issue.",9
37,Mr FENTON,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,Is not the trouble i lation to the supply of paper?,9
38,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"There is always trouble in the matter of the paper to be used less arrangements are made well in adthe vance for a proper supply, but that trouble now is nearly at an end. AMENDED LAND TAX. EFFECT OF INCREASE.  of an apparent misunderstanding regarddisadvantage. ing the increase of taxation under the Bill to amend the Land Tax Act, I to ask the Prime Minister what will the increased rates on properties of a total unimproved value of £5,500, £6,000, and £10,000?",9

41,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,I shall be very glad do so.,9
42,Mr MASSYGREENE,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,The right honourable member has not the information at hand ?,9
43,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,No .,9
44,Mr MASSYGREENE,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"Then the question put by the honourable member for Indi was "" rigged up . """,9
45,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,I told the House lhat I had been advised by the honourable member for Indi that he proposed to ask the question.,9
46,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,I call upon the honourable member for Richmond to withdraw that remark.,9
47,Mr MASSYGREENE,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,I withdraw it . OLD-AGE PENSIONS : NE W ZEALAND RECIPROCITY.,9
48,Dr MALONEY,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,I should like to know from the Prime Minister whether the Government are willing to reciprocate with New Zealand in the matter of old age pensions 1,9
49,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"D u r in g my previous term of office, the then Minister of Cusn retoms of New Zealand was in Australia, and we came to an arrangement for reciprocity. That arrangement, however, unwas not approved by our successors on ground that the Commonwealth, as it was stated, would gain no advantage.",9
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,On the ground that the Commonwealth. would lose so much by the arrangement.,9
51,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"But that the Commonwealth would be rather placed at a I am exceedinglv anxious that there should be a reciprocal treaty wish of the kind, and I am in hopes that we be shall soon have a satisfactory one. STATISTIC AL PUBLICATIONS .",9
52,Mr FINLAYSON,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"The statistical works issued by Mr Knibbs are becoming very popular as books of reference, and supI think it would be very desirable, if inforsome arrangements were come to, by which these could be placed on sale in the various capital cities. Increase. Mr ARCHIBALD - T h o s e books are on sale at the present time, b ut I shall is. d. make further inquiries into the matter. NEWZEALAND FODDER.",9
53,Mr MASSYGREENE,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"I should like to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs whether the idea underlying the correspondence which he read a little while ? ago was that fodder should be purchased to in New Zealand by the Commonwealth Government and made available for the States of Australia ? Mn. TUDOR - That was the idea which I submitted to the Premiers of Ihe Sbates, and which they all agreed represented the best plan under the circumstances. It was felt that there should be only one purchaser instead of four or five in New Zealand. It was suggested that the arrangement with New Zealand should be similar to those purchases we have made with the South A f r i c an and Indian Governments in regard to other commodities. ""Unfortunately, any good that might have been done by such an arrangement with New Zealand is, I am afraid, now impossible owing to the publicity that has been given to the matter. WHEAT MERCHANTS.",9
54,Mr MATHEWS,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"H as the Prime Minister seen in today's newspapers, an account of a meeting of dealers in wheat? Does the right gentleman think there must be some mistake in that report ? People can scarcely believe that there is so much roguery carried on in the wheat trade as the report of that meeting would suggest?",10
55,Mr EISHER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"I read the account of the meeting, but I regarded it more as a light entertainment than as a declaration. I hope I am not asked to make any comment on how the merchant princes carry on their business in Australia. DIVERSION OF GERMANTRADE . good one.",10
56,Mr SHARPE,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"Has the Prime M i nister had brought under his notice some cable messages which appeared in the morning newspapers a month or six weeks' ago, previous to the new Tariff, showing what business men in other parts of the. world are doing for the purpose of trying to capture the Australian trade previously in the hands of the enemy. The cables were as follow: GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN GOODS. Mr Milne, on behalf of the Board of Trade, has collected 430 samples of foreign hardware, holiowware, and aluminium goods, mostly German and Austrian, which compete with British goods in the Australian market. These are now being exhibited in Birmingham and Sheffield, and later on will be exhibited in London and other industrial centres. DIVERTED ENEMY TRADE. ABRITISH SCHEME. Lord Desborough and influential business men in London are forming a league for the purpose of handing over to Britain's Allies all the trade diverted from the enemy which cannot be carried on in Great Britain. Will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of appointing a Committee of this House for the purpose of organizing, in the same direction as in London, because, in my opinion, such a step would, be most beneficial to the people of Australia 1",10
57,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"This is a very large and important question. I have the pleasure of the acquaintance of both the gentlemen referred to. Mr Milne is a representative agent of Great Britain here, and Lord Desborough has been alwaysassociated with interests of the kind. I am of opinion that it would be better to. have a Committee appointed from outside Parliament. It is rather dangerous, for Members of Parliament to be directly associated with inquiries concerning duties, of Customs and Excise which may affect honourable their own particular interests. It is better to have a delegation altogether apart from the Legislature, but, as regards the policy, the Government are entirely in favour of it .",10
58,Mr SHARPE,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"Will the Prime M in isber take into consideration the assignment to the Inter-State Commission of the inquiry that I have suggested, so that new industries may be established in Australia ?",10
59,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,The suggestion is a I shall ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to refer it to the Commission.,10
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"In view of the admitbedly imporbanb character of the work to be undertaken in the making of an inquiry into our industrial occupations, to see if we can become self-contained and capture the enemy's trade, will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of reconstituting the Royal Commission of which Mr Deakin, Mr Dugald Thomson, and Mr Knibbs LONDON, Saturday. were members? They were engaged on this work when the Prime Minister terminated their commission.",10
61,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,I do not think that that body would be the proper one to which to refer these matters. WHEAT DUTY.,10
62,Mr RODGERS,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"Will the Minister of Trade and Customs now admit that his LONDON, Friday. action in removing the duty on wheat has had no effect whatever in the way of providing a cheap loaf for the people of this country ? Has the honourable gentleman noticed the gazetting of the proclamation of the New South Wales Government fixing the price of wheat at 5s. per bushel, and the price of the 2-lb. loaf from the State bakery at 4d., with an addition of l ^ d . per loaf in some places to the rate ruling before the war.",10
63,Mr TUDOR,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"As to the first part of the question, I do not believe that I have made a mistake in abolishing the wheat duties.",11
64,Mr RODGERS,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,I did not question. Shall I put my question again ? RECIPROCITY: NEW ZEALAN D AND CANADA.,11
65,Mr FINLAYSON,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,H as any progress been made in the negotiations with New Zealand and Canada in regard to reciprocal trade?,11
66,Mr TUDOR,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"No . The Government were busy with the Tariff until three or four weeks ago, and since then there has been a general election going on in New Zealand. I believe that the gentleman who conferred with me on this question has beeu defeated, and it is quite uncertain as to which party may be returned to power. C OCKBU RN SOUND NAVAL BASE . QUESTIONS WITHOUTNOTIC E.",11
67,Sir JOHN FORREST,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"Is it possible for the Assistant Minister of Defence, before the rising of the Houses, to lay upon the table the plans and specifications and report relating to Cockburn Sound Naval Base ? I should also like to know whether it is true that the Government propose that the Naval Board shall review those plans and specifications, and are prepared to act on any recommendations of the Board, which may be against the opinion of the eminent firm of Sir John Coode and Company ?",11
68,Mr JENSEN,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"I have communicated with the Minister of Defence, and he agrees with the attitude I have taken up in this Chamber, namely, that the plans and specifications, together with the report, should first be considered by the Government and by the Nava^ Board. From what I know, it would be impossible to lay those documents on the table today, or, I am afraid, tomorrow. I may inform the right honourable gentleman that on the Naval Board there are members who are quite capable of dealing with the report and the plans. The [73] first member of the Naval Board is Admira l Sir William Creswell.",11
69,Sir JOHN FORREST,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"Is,h e an engineer?",11
70,Mr JENSEN,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"He is a man of wide experience. We have also on the Board qualified gentlemen in the persons of Captain Pring and Captain Clarkson. The Board has been constituted solely for advising the Minister, and putting certain things before him. ask that Sir JOHN FORREST - It has not been constituted to give engineering advice.",11
71,Mr JENSEN,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,Captai n Clarkson is an engineer.,11
72,Sir JOHN FORREST,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,He is only a mechanical engineer.,11
73,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"The honourable member for Swan has asked his question, and now seeks to reply to it . Seeing that the honourable member evidently knows all about this matter, it was not necessary for him to submit a question to the M in ister. A f t e r submitting a question the honourable member should remain silent while it is being answered.",11
74,Mr RODGERS,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"On a point of order. If a Minister says that he has not grasped my question correctly, am I in order in putting it again ? I was prevented from doing so.",11
75,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,When the question arises I shall deal with the matter.,11
76,Mr JENSEN,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"The Minister of Defence and I , after a conference, have decided that the Government, the Naval Board, and the Minister should first decide on a certain course of action with regard to these important plans before they can be placed on the table.",11
77,Mr KELLY,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"Can the Assistant M in ister, representing the Minister of Defence, say what qualifications or diplomas in engineering, outside ordinary marino engineering and the looking after an engine-room of the ship, are possessed b j any member on the Naval Board ?",11
78,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"The time has arrive*! when I should intervene in connection with these questions. The question ?""bmitted by the honourable member is not one which can be put. Later",11
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"The Assistant Minister told us yesterday that he would do his best to lay these papers on the table before the adjournment. May we expect them ? Will the Minister say "" Yes "" or "" No "" ?",11
80,Mr JENSEN,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"My reply yesterday was that I would try to comply with the request of the honourable member for Swan, but I have since consulted the M in ister of Defence, and I find that it is impossible to do so. '",12
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,You mean that you will not do it ; that is the plain English of the reply.,12
82,Mr KELLY,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"On a point of order. Does the refusal to allow me to put my question just now mean that honourable members are, in future, not to be permitted to ask Ministers at question time what are the qualifications of officers of a public Department?",12
83,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"When such a question arises, I shall give the honourable member my ruling . Mar. SHARPE - May I ask question in connection with one I have a lready asked ?",12
84,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"Owing to the fact that honourable members may ask questions without giving notice of them, a dozen questions are sometimes founded on the reply given by the Minister. There can be uo finality to questions in such circumstances. . Ministers are not blameless in the matter. They should ask for notice to be given. Questions will then come on in the ordinary way, and be answered, which will put an end to what now occurs. While I am anxious to give honourable members every latitude to get all the information possible, they must see that some step must be taken to curtail the practice of founding a number of questions on the M i nister's reply to a question asked without notice.",12
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"On a order, is it your function, Mr Speaker, to say what should be done to terminate this business? The Standing Orders give honourable members the privilege of asking questions without notice. As you have just pointed out, the remedy is entirely in the Ministers' hands. They can regulate the matter; but I submit that you cannot interfere, so long as honourable members obey the Standing Orders. To a degree, these questions might be curtailed, but any step taken with that object in view should be taken by Ministers. They encourage this sort of thing by the speeches which they are constantly making.",12
86,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF BARRAG E,"Order ! Part of my duty is the conduct of business, and the prevention of the abuse of privileges.

As to the quality of the work to be done, every honi n orable member on both sides of the House is equally responsible to this country. According to the right honourable gentleman's motion, all we have to do is to agree to the most preposterous things, and he says, "" They are my responsibility, not yours.""

I am not one of tliose who believe that we should rise this week merely to allow the Government to finish their programme as they think best. that deals with the war I am prepared to pass after a reasonable protest. We cannot do more because the numbers are against us, and, after all, the chief responsibility rests on the Government. But the Commonwealth Banking Bill is not one of these. It is not a measure for which any ground of urgency has been raised in the House. It is not connected in any way with the crisis through which we are passing, and from which I hope we shall soon emerge. But it paganda measure which suits the desires of honourable members sitting opposite, and, to some extent, suits the views of many of their constituents.",17
167,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,Order ! The honourable member is going beyond the question before the House.,17
168,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"I was going to say that the Banking Bill , according to my judgment, is distinctly a party measure, and in that spirit some of us must endeavour to meet it . I am speaking only for myself, and in no menacing way. But, as it is the intention that honourable members shall separate in good-will and reassemble early in the new year, I do think that the discussion of a financial measure of such far-reaching importance as this may very well be deferred t ill then. If we are to push on with the Bill now, we, who are opposed to its provisions, must meet it with that opposition which we owe to our convictions and our responsibilities.",17
169,Mr WE ST,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"East Sydney) [12.17] - I rise with the idea of assisting the House out of the tangle into which it has got. First of all, I tliink honourable members would like an intimation as to who is the Leader of the Opposition to whom the the Prime Minister can appeal when he is desirous of making any arrangement in regard to the business. We have just listened to one of the Opposition's new leaders, a gentleman who is evidently not familiar with the forms of the House, and is not accustomed to a chamber in which That the Leader of the Opposition is treated with respect by the head of the Government and by the party behind him. That being so, we can quite understand the assumption of the honourable member for Balaclava that he speaks on behalf of the Opposition in regard to the Banking Bill . I say emphatically that nothing on the business-paper has been so pointedly emphasized to the House by the Government as has that particular measure. Any Bill The Government intimated clearly that they desired to see the Bill pass before the House adjourns. And there are reasons for that course. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - What are they ?",17
170,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"I certainly think it would be desirable that members of the Opposition should retire and decide amongst themselves who shall be their real leader. If they will do that, we may be able to have an understanding beis a protween the members on this side of the House, who are anxious to proceed with business, and those on the other side, who, perhaps for party purposes, desire to delay the business with a view to influencing the opinion of the electors in the forthcoming contest that has been necessitated by the death of a member of the Government party. that the Commonwealth Bank B i ll will be passed; that, true to the traditions of our party, every opportunity will be given to honourable members - to discuss every measure submitted to the House, and that there will be no resort to that brutal instrument, the "" gag,"" such as took place last session. I have ways been opposed to the use of the "" S S>"" but ^ honourable members of the & Opposition show an utter disregard of the interests of the people whom they are sent here to represent, I am afraid I shall have to depart from a principle which I have always cherished.",17
171,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,Is that a threat?,18
172,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"No ; but when those whom I represent are made to suffer, it is my duty to review the position I have taken up in this regard. I should like the Opposition to have regard to the season of peace which we are now approaching. Some of them have expressed a desire that the business of the House should continue; but this apparently does not meet with the approbation of all their colleagues. no wish to lecture the House, but 1 desire to bring to bear on honourable members opposite my common-sense business capacity. I do not pose as a model of political purity, but I believe that the people have confidence in me, and if the Opposition will accept from me a few pearls of wisdom the result will be beneficial to our proceedings. think we should deal with this question in a purely jocular spirit. We should think seriously of what is likely to be the result of our action. The honourable member for Balaclava is new to this House, but not to parliamentary procedure. He should recognise that much business remains to be done, and that while it may be amusing to him, as a representative of this State, to keep the representatives of other States away from their homes, there is a strong desire on our part to get back to them and to our families. We are making big personal sacrifices. Honourable members who are able to return to their homes each night should have some sympathy with those who are not in that happy position. There should be no attempt to impose too great a strain on the health of honourable members, or to retard their efforts to concentrate their minds on the great problems which confront this ParI hope liament. I hope that all these measures* will be allowed to go; and that honourable members opposite will release themselves from their party ties, and recognise that they are not likely to gain much of an advertisement by talking as some of them have done.",18
173,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"Wentworth) [12.15] - ! aldo not wish to accept the challenge just thrown out by my distinguished friend, the honourable"" member for East Sydney. I echo the hope with which he concluded his brilliant peroration, that all the Bills which the Government had succeeded in passing would be permitted for the time to continue. We are concerned, however, not with the measures which the Government have passed, but with those which they wish to carry. I confess that I am not going to be deterred for one moment by the threat of the honourable member to make certain sacrifices to expediency and to outrage his conscience by voting for the "" gag."" I wish now to put it with all good feeling to the Prime Minister, that if the Government feel it tlieir duty to proceed with certain measures which, for some I have occult reason, are regarded by them as supremely important, although baving norelation to the war, and which some members of the Opposition, consistent with their duty to the country, are prepared to discuss, then they should be considered in the open light of day, when the press can report the debate, and when the discussion which emanates from the I do not very serious purpose apparent on both sides will reach the ears of the public through the ordinary channels. I would urge it upon the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth Bank Bill should not be rushed through in an all-night sitting.",18

175,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,Yes .,18

When the resolution was before the House, we had the extraordinary confession that the calculation given by the in his Budget speech was quite is wrong. In other words, the Treasurer told us, in his Budget speech, that it is was expected that £1,000,00 0 would be",19
201,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"I have already explained how bhat error arose, and how the Treasurer was led into ib. The Treasurer was not desirous of imposing a probate'duty that would yield more than £1,000,000 per annum, and his instructions were that such a duty was to be levied as would yield that amount.",19
202,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"That means a revenue of £500,000 for the present year, and to that extent we are £500,000 oufc in our calculation.",20
203,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,The yield may be more or less.,20
204,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,I was going to say that it is very difficult to estimate probate revenue.,20
205,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"The difficulty is intensified in this case by the fact that we haye been unable, perhaps naturally, to obtain any information from the State authorities.",20
206,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,I am astonished to hear that.,20
207,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,We are working in dark.,20
208,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,The Treasurer could obtain quite a number of interesting tails apart from the probate offices States; but the only real calculable details must come straight from probate offices.,20
209,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,I repeat only what Commissioner told me.,20
210,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,The differences in mode of increasing the graduation have to be carefully studied in considering the two taxes.,20
211,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,But a careful study shows such a divergence between the systems that it is impossible to base a Samuel Hordern. Commonwealth system on any one of them.,20
212,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"If harmony between the Commonwealth Government the Governments of the States ""had been established, there would have no difficulty whatever in a couple of expert men from New South Wales and Victoria, the two more popular States, providing the Treasurer with an estimate which, allowing for the conjectural data, would have been sufficiently approximate. I doubt the estimate of the Treasurer, I think the original calculation, is nearer the States. right than the amended one. This is a very stiff tax, rising to 15 per ""cent. maximum in Victoria is 10 per and, while the State Government tax estates under £1,000 and the Commonat wealth does not, the heavy loads on the top of the ramp will bring in a mendous revenue.",20
213,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"That is not borne out by the data at our disposal, which show that the bulk of the revenue comes from the estates in the middle.",20
214,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"I did not know that this Bill was coming on today, and, therefinancial fore, I cannot conduct an analysis of that k in d ; but I speak with some experience, both of the difficulty of estimating probate revenue, and of the wonderful results from it when heavy estates f all in , even at 10 per cent.",20
215,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,It is speculative at best.,20
216,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"I admit that, and, therefore, I put it on one side as not settling anything. All direct taxation is speculative, and when we are dealing with life and death it is more so than usual; but we are bound to calculate whether the revenue will be large or small, and I think the the yield will be much more than the Treasurer anticipates. If my idea be correct, the yield will be £1,500,000 in a normal deyear, and approximately £2,000,000 in a of the full financial year.",20
217,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,That is not borne out the State by our information.,20
218,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"The total probate revethe nue for Australia, in the year 1912-13 amounted to £919,000, and, in the year the before, £973,000; and in neither of those years, so far as I know, was duty paid on any very heavy estates in either of the principal States.

222,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"Speakin g froni memory of Victoria, and with some familiarity with the procedure in other States, I think the two years I have mentioned were normal years, and it must be remembered that the proposed Commonand wealth tax is much heavier than any in",20

224,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"I know there is a stage which the tax is heavier: the angle reaches further, and it is steeper in the treend; and the whole question is what happens in the case of an estate of, say, £40,000 and £100,000 and over. such, estates as these the Commonwealth yield will he vastly in excess of that of the States.",20
225,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,But the bulk taxation is not derived from,21
226,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,The bulk of the yield in abnormal years is frequently from such estates.,21
227,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"Betwee n 75 per cent, and 85 per cent, of the revenue is derived from estates other than those between, say, £80,000 and £100,000.",21
228,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"If we take estates below £80,000, then we should probably get 75 per cent, of the revenue in any given year; but the big estates to which I have referred destroy and reverse those calculations. This is a year in which we are going to have a crop of disaster. We must speak frankl y in financial matters; and while no Treasurer would desire the death of citizens merely for the purpose of reaping revenue, there must be a crop of deaths in a time of war, drought, tribulation, and taxation.",21

234,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,Is that so? something to that effect.,21
235,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"Yes , I understand it is a fact.",21
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"I rise to a point of order. The honourable member for Balachear lava ought to be confined to the before the Chair, and whether the Prime Minister is going to England or not, has nothing to do with the discussion of the probate duties. Such interjections as we have heard are merely wasting the time of the Committee. I reason why it is suggested that the Prime Minister is going to England.

237,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"The Leader of the Opposition has raised a point of order, of the and as the honourable member for Balacsuch es- lava was certainly not discussing the question before us, I call him to order. I am exceedingly pleased that the Leader of the Orrposition called my attention to the matter; and I shall, in the future, rely on his active assistance in maintaining order.",21
238,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition will willingly co-operate with the Chair, and I promise to assist him in every possible way. I regret having transgressed the rules, but I was led a%vay by the interesting interjection of the Prime Minister. I was pointing out that the disaster, conflict, and anxiety under which we are now labouring, wil l no doubt have their effect in connection with direct taxation of this kind. In a tram-car the other day I met a respectable citizen who told me that he is eighty-four years of age. He is a man who pioneered Australia in the early days, the rain and, according to current rumour, he has amassed a considerable amount of property, both real and personal. He spoke in tones of the deepest stress of the taxation which this Government are imposing in the way of a land tax and probate duties; and certainly such a man as he is h it hard while he lives, and doubly hard when he dies. I remarked to him that he would be worried into his grave, and he said, "" I am worried half-way there already."" Such a view may be unreasonable, and I think it is; but it is real, and will have i'3 effect. A p a r t altogether from taxation, there is no doubt that, in times of great national upheaval, we find greater mortality than at other times amongst the I heard more mature of our population. The honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill should have taken more reasonable steps to furnish the Committee with the grounds of his estimates; and I am astonished to that the State oflicers have refused question to supply him with data.",21
239,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,I do not think it is quite accurate to say that the State oflicers have refused to supply any information.,21
240,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,The information that do not know the has been given to me,21
241,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,I must ask the At torney-General not to interject.,21
242,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"I thought it would be helpful if we kuew the attitude of the State officers in regard to these proposals. All I am anxious to ascertain is whether or not the rate provided for in the schedule is likely to yield us an amount of revenue vastly exceeding the calculation of the Treasurer. In my judgment, if all the data were supplied, that would be found to be the case; and it would have been advisable to have the assistance of the Tax Commissioner in Victoria, who is a man of wide experience, with full charge of all the taxation in that State, and in immediate touch with his colleagues in the otlier States. There is no doubt that this gentleman could, and probably would, have supplied thoroughly reliable data on which we might calculate the probable yield. As this is the first occasion, as I hope it will be the last, on which the Commonwealth will embark on this form of taxation for emergency purposes-for so the Prime Minister originally told us- I think we should be careful not to disturb sources of revenue on which the States rely so much. If we had better information, we should probablv have wiser legislation.",22

259,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,The r e is no point of order. Will the honourable member for Balaclava proceed ?,22
260,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"Speakin g for myself, Mr Chairman, I shall swiftly obey any order you may make, whatever it may be. Surely it is permissible to make comparative estimates and recommendations when taxation measures are before us ? For in stance, in regard to this proposal, one honourable member may wish to point out thab the rate fixed is double what it should be, on the ground that other means of raising the revenue could be substituted. That course is very often followed. Honsir, orable members may wish to show that this proposal is wrong, because better sources of revenue can be found that will be more equitably distributed over the community. Before this Bill disappears from this or the other Chamber, the At is constant torney-General should get from the Victorian Taxation Oflice an estimate of what this tax will probably yield, because, it that information were obtained, it would probably be found that the realization would be likely to be greater than the Treasurer's expectations. I have, in a descriptive sense, and not in an abusive way, described both of the propositions for direct taxation as vindictive. H a d the"" Treasurer been desirous of squaring the ledger only instead of serving party purposes as well, he could have found much more reasonable, and much fairer, means of taxation.",22
261,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [12.52] - A . statement of what this tax is supposed to do, what we expect to derive from it , and what alterations we propose to make in its incidence, should facilitate business, and shorten discussion. No doubt considerable advantage would be derived if information could be obtained from the State officials, as suggested by the honourable member for Balaclava, but I have been informed that it has been found impossible to get such information. The estimate of the amount of revenue-roughl y about £1,000,000 for the year-is , owing to the absence of complete data, only an estimate. Both here and in Great Britain no data can be obtained as to the proportion in which estates are bequeathed to widows and children, to collaterals, and strangers, though in making an estimate of the revenue to be obtained from such taxation, such data are vitally important. As the Government have decided to exempt all gifts and bequests to charitable, educational, and scientific institutions, and the estates of all persons who during the present war may die on active service, or as the result of disease or wounds incurred while on active service, and also to concede to widows, children, and grandchildren a substantial concession over collaterals and strangers-the rate suggested is two-thirds-the amount of revenue as now estimated will fall from £1,000,000 in a year to somewhere below £700,000 per annum.",23
262,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,Y o u cannot form that idea without data.,23
263,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"We are working on data which we admit to be incomplete, but which are all that are available to us.

It will press much more lightly than any State tax on moderate estates with values up to £40,000. In the circumstances the propose] of the Government is one that should receive the support of honourable members, and I hope that that support will be given with as little discussion as possible.",23
264,Unknown,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.SO p.m.,23
265,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"Wentworth) [2.30] One feature of this proposal which is worthy of consideration is its effect on the State Treasuries. The Commonwealth estate duty will be the first charge on an estate, and will have priority of the State duties. These are now imposed on the value of the difference between the assets and the liabilities of the deceased. It would be interesting to know how far the revenue of the States will suffer as the result of our legislation. B y way of illustration, let me point out that at the present time an estate valued at £100,000 is liable for probate and other duties on the whole amount, but when this measure becomes law, it will probably be found that the taxable value to the State of such a property will be only £85,000, that is, the original taxable value less the 15 per cent, levied in estate duty by the Commonwealth. It seems to me that there is a good deal in this point. Thra Commonwealth estate duty will be a debt like any other debt. This raises tion whether we should adopt this method of raising revenue when there are so many amendments. other methods which could be adopted.

272,Mr WATT,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"The position seems to be similar, though I do not know whether the legal effect will be the same in both cases. The war has badly dislocated the timbergetting business. In Victoria large numbers of men have been thrown out of employment because of the impossibility ot' finding an outlet for timber. We do not know how long this state of things will continue, but it should be our endeavour to assist rather than to retard native industries. We should avoid the infliction of hardship in this case, even at the risk of loss of revenue. suggest that the Attorney-General should consider carefully the effect that this provision is likely to have on the in dustry of timber production.",25
273,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"Flinders) [2.45] - Eve n if timber leases are in cluded, which I think is a great mistake, certainly under the provisions of the present Act, lessees would not be entitled to deduct the royalties paid to the Crown from the value of their leases. The only things which under section 28 the lessees can deduct are mentioned in the proviso of that clauseProvided that, whore onerous conditions for constructing buildings, works, or other improvements upon the land, or expending money thereon, are imposed upon the lessee That does not cover it or where any fine, premium, or foregift or consideration in the nature of fine, premium, or foregift, is payable by the lessee, the Commissioner may assess the amount (if any) which ought, for the purposes of this section, to be added to the value of the rent in respect thereof, and the value of the rent shall be deemed to be increased ""by that amount accordingly. [2.42] - The words "" fine, premium, or foregift "" do not include royalties. As is well known to lawyers, the term refers to a lump sum payable, not in the nature of rent, but as a condition of getting the lease. But the royalty is usually based upon the amount of timber obtained.",25
274,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,Would that not be a condition of the lease?,25
275,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"It is a condition of the lease, but it would not come under the proviso to section 28. The royalty is not rent, and it is not a fine, premium, or foregift. An alteration should be made in this regard, otherwise royalties will not be deductable. I submit that it is wholly undesirable to in clude the timber leases at all. The same argument applies to timber as to mining leases, but it applies in a much stronger way. In this case' we are dealing with a perishable asset, and the right given by the Crown is a riglit given to an in dividual to destroy something and make it his own. Another practical difficulty in connection with timber leases is that some of the greatest timber concerns do not work on leases, but get concessions or licences, and this proviso would not apply to them. The whole matter requires further consideration before the Government attempt to include timber I would leases under this taxation. This may involve a considerable dislocation of the timber industry, and that possibility does not seem to have been considered. If the timber lease is to be included, an alteration ought to be made to give ""the lessee the advantage of any royalties he pays.  should like to invite from the Attorney General - an expression of opinion in regard to certain timber leases in Tasmania. I believe that in that State there is a certain kind of timber lease that is in close association with the closer settlement policy, and one of the conditions attaching to the lease is that ths lessee has to prepare and make available certain areas which are to be returned yearly to the Crown for closer settlement purposes. It seems to me that by including leases in the Bill we are likely to interfere with the closer settlement policy in Tasmania. I should like the Attorney-General to inform the House of what is likely to be the effect of the clause on leases of that character.",25
276,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"Cowper) indeed. [2.52] - The inclusion of timber leases within the operation of this clause opens up a very wide field, because through the States there is a great difference in the conditions governing the management or control of timber cutting. No two States have precisely the same regulations or give the same facilities for cutting timber on Crown lands. New Soutli Wales the leases which this clause may be expected to cover are leases given by the Crown of the exclusive right to cut timber over certain areas. There is the ordinary Licence to cut timber on Crown lands at a small fee, and there is another licence, for which a larger fee is payable, which permits the holder to cut timber on timber reserves. Then there are what are known as leases giving the - exclusive righ t to cut over certain areas. In all these cases the licensee has not only to pay a fee for the licence to cut, but he also pays a royalty of so much per superficial foot of timber cut, so that the amount tliey pay for the right to get timber cannot be calculated from the amount set down in the lease. To that amount must be added the sum they pay in royalties. The Prime Minister stated that the taxable amount would be the difference between the rent paid and the economic value of the lease. But I desire to know whether the amount which is paid in royalty for the exclusive right to cut timber is to be calculated in additipn to the rent, so that the economic value will be ascertained after making allowance for both. I can claim to have more timber men working in my constituency than there are in any other district in the Commonwealth, and I know they are operating under very disadvantageous circumstances. A great deal of the timber we have been marketing for some years, particularly piles and timber for wharfs and large structures, has been sent to Germany, I and some of the mills were almost exi clusively engaged in cutting that class of material. Since the war the orders from abroad have not been carried out, and consequently, with the exception of local orders, the mills are without work, and a great many men are idle. If the timber industry is to be handicapped by a further charge, as it is suggested the provisions of this Bill will impose, the industry will have a ""ery bad time. I may add that it is also likely to meet with a further difficulty in connection with the re-arrangement of the Tariff. Another fact to be borne in mind is that, as a rule, the timber areas are in very inaccessible places, and the reason for giving the exclusive right to cut is that the ordinary means of taking the timber out will not answer. In Large sums of money have to be spent, generally in the construction of tramways, and other works, to carry the timber from the gorges and places which are in accessible by ordinary transport. All these things add to the cost of the in dustry, and should be taken into consideration when the value of the leases is being assessed. It should be remembered that not only is the timber being marketed and employment being found for a large number of people, but when the timber is cut off the timber-getter assists in the development of the country by placing at the disposal of would be settlers land wholly or partially cleared. I hope the Attorney-General will be able to pay particular attention to the royalties and other charges on exclusive timber areas and leases of that character.",26
277,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"Richmond) [2.56] - I am astonished that the Government should propose to tax timber leases at all. The position in my electorate is somewhat the same as that in the electorate of Cowper. There are large areas over which certain individuals have the exclusive right to cut timber, and I should like to heaj from the Attorney General whether it is possible under the valuation clauses to make deductions for the expensive works that very often are necessary in order to get the timber. Por instance, there is a licence granted by the Government of Western Australia to a company that is supplying firewood to the mines on the eastern gold-fields. That company has very large timber leases, and it has about 180 miles of tramway, a considerable length of which is not on the lease at all , because as the timber is cut out the tramway is extended into the forest beyond. I am not sure whether the provisions in the Bill would allow of the necessary deductions being made in a case of that sort, and yet the lease without such a Ion? line of tramway would be absolutely valueless. In regard to the question of royalty, I am not at all clear that the present clauses of the Bill do permit the. necessary deductions being made for royalties paid, but they certainly should be made.  worse position than mining leases.",26
278,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"I admit that. Attorney-General says that the deductions ought to be made, but I ask him to point to the provisions of the law that clearly state that they can be* made.",27
279,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [3.0] - There seems to be a misunderstanding of the effects of this measure upon leases. The basis of value remains the same in all leases. There is no difference in principle between a timber lease and any other kind of lease. A timber licence, however, is quite a different thing, and is not taxable. Most of the discussion this afternoon has had relation to timber licences which are not within the scope of this measure. Broadly speaking, the principles that apply to the valuation of a pastoral or any other kind of lease apply to a timber lease, but the honourable member for Cowper and the honourable member for Richmond, if 1 know anything of the circumstances existing in New South Wales, have been referring, not to' a timber lease, but to a timber licence.",27

281,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"Very well. honourable member for Richmond spoke of one covering 180 miles of railway. That would be quite a considerable lease. It is obvious that a timber lease covering such an extent of country must co-exist - with other leases over the same area for other purposes-grazin g and the likes.nd the value of most of such timber leases granted will be below the taxable value, and so exempt. In any case, I submi t that no hardship will arise. DiflSculties-practica l difficulties and difficulties of assessment-ma y occur.

293,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO POET AUGUST A,"What else have I said ? When I put the honourable member's statement into nlainer language, to find out whether he meant anything at all, he avails himself of the opportunity to indulge in a little abuse, and is immediately backed up by a very appropriate supporter. We owe it to the taxpayers that they should know exactly where they stand. We should not pass legislation exposing them to certain obligations, and at the same time hold out a vague hope of putting things right before they are called upon to send in their assessments. Every taxpayer, no matter how much or how little he may support the party in power, is entitled to know clearly what is expected of him. Our legislation should be clear and unambiguous. It is admitted, however, that this Bill is ambiguous. It does not carry out what the Prime Minister himself said would be a fair thing, namely, that these royalties would be deducted. That being so, why can we not put the matter right, and let the men concerned know where they stand ?",27

(4) Property(a) which passed from the deceased person by any gift infer vivos or settlement made within three years before his decease, or, being property comprised in a settlement under which he was tenant for life, the life interest of which was surrendered by him to the remaindermen within three years before his decease . . . shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be part of the estate of the person so deceased.

In perusing the Bill I noticed this grave omission, and have, therefore, submitted the amendment.",28

A soldier might contract typhoid immediately before the termination of hostilities, and die some time afterwards.  be added to meet such cases. This is not a Liberal or a Labour question. It concerns all classes of the community. Wofind dying in the trenches persons of every creed ancl of all political views. Australia's noblest sons are going to the front, - giving up all that is near and dear to them in order to fight for their country, and they should' receive every consideration. To some of our brave men going to the front the facing of death is a mere detail compared with the wrenches that take place when they have to part with their wives and their children. We have at the front peer's sons and commoner's sons, squatters and boundary riders, members of the State Parliaments, and, I am proud to say, a member of this House. proud to hear from Colonel Eyrie, who is leaving us to serve at the front, that, Amongst the soldiers in his regiment is a number of gentlemen who occupy high positions in this country. One case he - cited was that of a gentleman who owns .it station estate worth something like £40,000, and who is accepting 6s. a day as a private, and paying another person £400 a year to look after his property in Australia. This is only one of many similar cases of men in good positions who, along with the humblest boundary riders in their service, are prepared to Weed and die in the trenches for the ties of their country. If a person has property of considerable value, and he happens to meet his death while performing the noblest duty he can on behalf of his country, his wife and f a m i ly should not be penalized. I notified my intention yesterday morning to move this amendment, and I am pleased to think that it has the sympathy of the Prime Minister, while the Attorney-General has signified his intention to accept it . I congratulate the Government on their action in the matter.",28
309,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [3.17] - It will shorten the discussion if I now state what amendments the Government propose to make in this measure. I quite agree with the contention of the honourable member for Calare. It would be a most unworthy return for the patriotic services that our soldiers are rendering on behalf of the Commonwealth and the Empire to impose on tlieir estates and on their dependents the additional burdens contemplated by this measure. It is, therefore, proposed to exempt altogether such estates from the operation of the tax, and to do so in the following terms, which go further than proposed by the honourable member for Calare: Nothing in this Act shall apply to the estate of any person who, during the present war, or within one year after its termination, dies on active service, or as a result of injuries received or disease contracted on active service, with the Military or Naval Forces of the Commonwealth, or any part of the King's Dominions. This covers the whole of the ground, in cluding men who are incapacitated, or would die from disease or wounds within one year.  I was that amendment.",29
310,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The honourable member for Darling Downs proposes that the duties shall not be assessed on estates devoted to charitable, religious, scientific, or public educational purposes, and the Government are prepared to adopt that suggestion in the following terms:In respect of so much of the estate ns by will, intostucj', gift inter vivos, or settlement, passes to the widow or children or grandchildren of the deceased estate, duty shall be assessed and payable at two-thirds of the rate whioh would otherwise be payable. This seems to cover the whole field, in cluding gifts inter vivos, the mode very liberfrequently selected by wealthy men to endow public institutions. It is further proposed to differentiate between estates passing to widows and children, and estates passing to collaterals or strangers, by making a special concession in favour of the direct descendants to the extent of one-third. This means that in the case of the widow and children, the payment will be two-thirds of the rate otherwise payable. That amendment is couched in the following terms: Estate duty shall not be assessed or payable upon so much of the estate as is devised or bequeathed or passes by gift inter vivos, or settlement for religious, scientific, public, charitable, or public educational purposes.",29
311,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Does that apply to estates of any size?,29
312,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Yes . The Victorian Act, for which, I understand, the honourable member for Flinders was responsible, provides that, while beneficiaries other than the widow and children pay 10 per cent, on £20,000 and upwards, the direct descendants pay, on the same sized estates, £6 4s. per cent., or about two-thirds. It is impossible to have a system that will fit in with the systems of all the States. I mentioned this morning how far the proposed amendments to which I have just referred would affect the revenue. Roughly speaking, it reduces the total estimated to be derived from this source by one-third. It is proposed to make amendments in one or two other clauses to which allusion was made yesterday. Clause 24, which provides that the Commissioner may, with in three years after the last payment on account of duty, make any alteration or addition to the assessment as he thinks necessary, is to be amended so as to make the period one year, the reason being that the clause as it stands will tend to embarrass administration by hanging up estates. Ample provisions for dealing with cases of fraud are made. The Government are having another clause drafted to take the place of clause 53, in order to materially reduce the penalty for evading the duty.",29
313,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Will clause 54, which provides that the Governor General may forfeit an estate for fraudulent also be amended 1",30
314,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"It is proposed to leave out the forfeiture provisions in clause 53, and, therefore, clause 54 will also go.",30
315,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Darling Downs) [3.26]. - I desire to direct attention to subclause 4 of clause 13, and to suggest to the Attorney-General that he follow the Victorian Act and reduce the period, as applying to gifts inter vivos, from three years to one year.",30
316,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,I should like the honourable member to tell us why.,30
317,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Sub-clause a should, in my opinion, apply only after the commencement of the Act , and it should be amended to that effect; otherwise it may be held to cover more than is intended.",30
318,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,The State laws do not do that.,30
319,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I think the Queensland law does. This is a Bill for the purpose of taxing estates, the intention being that the tax shall fall on estates at the time of death. It is considered fair and proper that the community should take a portion of the wealth left at death, for the purpose of the government of the country; and, inasmuch as this may be evaded by persons making a settlement during lifetime, this clause is inserted. It seems to me that a period of twelve months would be a fair one to allow.",30
320,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"If the honourable member means twelve months after the passing of the Bill , I do not agree with him .",30
321,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"No ; I do not meant that. What I say is that this clause should apply only to al] settlements made after the passing of the Bill, if made within twelve months of the death. It seems to me that the Attorney-General is following too rigidly the land-tax procedure. According to the Victorian Act , all such gifts are taxable if made within twelve months immediately preceding the death.",30
322,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"In the Victorian Ac t it is twelve months, whether before or after the commencement of the Act ; and it is vital whether it is before or after.",30
323,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"In the case of the States there is a previous series of estates and duties, but in the case of the Commonwealth we are starting this class of legislation. I understand that an evasions, amendment was made in New South Wales to apply the duty to settlements made "" after the commencement of the> Act.""",30
324,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The honourable member has referred me to the Victorian Statute. I have looked at it , and it says ' ' before or after.""",30
325,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I did not refer the honourable member to the Victorian Act for that point; I , first of all, referred him to the period provided in the Victorian Act, namely one year, and I now refer him to a New South Wales Statute in regard to the point of making the duty apply only to gifts and to settlements effected "" after the commencement of the Act . "" As we are starting with a clean sheet in regard, to this legislation, we should not make the duty apply to distributions which could not have been made with the purpose of evading our taxation. We cannot; assume that persons have attempted to> avoid our tax by making these distributions before the passage of our measure.",30
326,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"There are settlements covered by the State law which would not be covered by onr Bill , because they have been made "" before the passing of the Act.""",30
327,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"But the Victorian Act was passed in 1903-; and the State had"" had previous probate duties; but in they case of the Commonwealth we are making a start upon these duties.",30
328,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I refer the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs to the honourable and learned member for Flinders, by whom the Victorian Bill was introduced.",31
329,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"If the honourable and learned member for Flinders says that I am right in my contention, will the At torney-General agree to it?",31
330,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,1 refer the honourable member to the attitude of the honourable member for Flinders in 1903.,31
331,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"If a man dies a month after the passage of this measure, an examination of his property may disclose the existence of a g if t inter vivos which was made three years ago. That g if t will come under this sub-clause.",31
332,Mr BRENNAN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"If so, it is open to very grave objection.",31
333,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I think so. The man obviously could not have had any intention of evading the duty proposed in this Bill . There are two points at issue. I maintain that the Bill should only apply to settlements made after the commencement of the Act , and my next point is that the period should be shortened from three years to one year. The intention of the Attorney-General should be to get at the transmission at the time of death, and not at a bond fide settlement intended to operate during life. To tax settlements extending back for three years, as against one year in the case of Victoria, will mean covering a tremendous period. The Attorney-General has shown a reasonable spirit in regard to other suggestions made, and I am sure that if he cannot take into consideration my first point, he might accept the second.",31
334,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Flinders) [3.36] - In connection with the Victorian Act, passed many years ago, the At torney-General has referred to my authority as against the contention of the honourable member for Darling Downs, but the A ct of 1903 was merely au enlargement of the same class of duties that had been imposed for many years, and which, by making settlements inter vivos, there had been many attempts to evade, and as it merely continued a precautionary measure rendered necessary prior to that time, there was no reason why it should not come into operation with regard to settlements made before the in crease of duty was imposed. In the case of the Commonwealth, however, we are starting, as the honourable member for Darling Downs says, with a clean sheet; and if we pass the measure as it now stands it will considerably affect bond fide settlements or gifts made within the past three years. If they are not bond fide, if any interest in the property still remains to the testator, of course they do not get the benefit of our legislation. They must be proved to be real bond fide gifts, in which the testator gives away the whole of his property. If this clause is agreed to, then, in the case of a man who made a settlement three years ago, giving away his entire property-settle ments usually mean dividing into smaller estates-eac h of the people who have been enjoying the estate in severalty will be faced, not only with the obligation to pay duty in respect to the interest they receive, but also with the necessity to pay duty on a higher rate than that applicable to the original property. I cannot imagine anything more unfair.",31
335,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Did it not apply in the Victorian case?,31
336,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The Victorian Act went back for twelve months only, but it merely increased the application of a particular kind of taxation which had been in force for years.",31
337,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Does the honourable member say that as we are starting with a clean sheet we should not adopt this provision ?,31
338,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I think not. The Bill might be made to apply to settlements made after the first announcement of the introduction of this tax. We can contemplate that some people, in anticipation of this measure coming into effect, might be making settlements now. We might fix the date as after the 1st December last, in order to meet the case of people who, in contemplation of the passage of this legislation, get r i d of their estates.",31
339,Mr FENTON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,There might have been some suspicion of all this during the gene1*3.1 ©lection,31
340,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I do not think that there could be any reason for suspecting it during the general election, because the honourable member's party went to the country on the general prin ciple that there would be no necessity for imposing unusual taxation. At all events, there was no suggestion that honourable members were going to impose heavy succession duties on top of the State taxation.",31
341,Mr FENTON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Every one realized that the raising of extra revenue would he necessary.,32
342,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The honourable member knows very Avell that no one at that time suspected that there would be huge new succession duties i m posed by the Federal Parliament. fix the date as after the introduction of the Bill is not unreasonable. If we place it further back, we are creating an absolute injustice, and imposing a tax, not on the estate of the person who dies, but on the portions of that estate which have been enjoyed for a long time, and at a higher rate than would have been imposed on the whole estate in other circumstances.",32
343,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [3.42J - The enthusiasm of honourable members in their attempt to make this a perfect measure is a little overwhelming. Every concession given them, instead of sating their appetites, only stimulates them to press further suggestions upon us. are evidently inspired with the noble purpose of making this Bill the most perfect piece of legislation that has ever emanated from any Legislature. no doubt is an extremely laudable ambition, but at this stage of the session I do not feel myself called upon to encourage it. I noted with great interest the fatuous admiration of the honourable member for Darling Downs for Victorian legislation-in patches. It appears that this legislation is sown with tares and wheat in such curious and unequal proportions that whenever the honourable member for Darling Downs stoops down he gets a handful of wheat, but whenever I stoop down I get a handful of tares. The honourable member directed my attention to section 11 of the Victorian Act of 1903, but he resolutely declines to look at more than one part of the section. The measure was piloted through the Legislative Assembly by the honourable member for Flinders, and distinctly provides that every conveyance or g if t by any person made before or after the commencement of the Act is covered by the provisions of the Act. The honourable member says that this was proper in the circumstances, because the Victorian Act was only amending the existing law, but that had Victoria been starting from the beginning they would have acted very differently. The honourable member for Flinders, in supporting his measure, said the best he could of circumstances which no doubt he has totally forgotten. His memory limps most curiously in this matter. Lest he should labour under that difficulty any To longer, I shall take the liberty to refresh his memory from the pure well of the original Act. The session has been long and difiicult, and many things have happened, and the honourable member has forgotten section 115 of the Administration and Probate Act of 1890, which Ms Bill of 1903 amended. It was a consolidation of the law relating to probate and administrative duties. Section 115 is as follows: If any person has made or shall hereafter make any conveyance or assignment, gift, delivery, or transfer of any estate, real or personal, or of any money or securities for money with intent to evade the payment of duty under this part of this Aet, in case such person should, die, the property comprised in any such conveyance or assignment, ov the subject-matter of any such gift, delivery, or transfer shall, They upon the death of such person, be deemed to form part of his estate for the purposes of this part of this Act, upon which' duty shall be payable under this part of this Act, and the payment of the duty upon the value of such This property may be enforced against sueh property in the same way as duty under this part of this Act is enforceable and as if such person bad bequeathed or devised the said property to the person to whom the same may have been conveyed, assigned, given, delivered, or transferred. Not only are all transfers and settlements made twelve months before the passing of the Act liable to duty, but all transfers and settlements made at any time are so liable.",32
344,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,On l y if made with intent to evade the payment of duty.,32
345,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The honourable gentleman evidently did not follow the reading of the section. It is unfortunately all too clear for the honourable member and his present contention. The wording isAny conveyance or assignment, gift, delivery, or transfer of any estate, real or personal, or of any money or securities for money already made, or which hereafter may be made either in escrow or otherwise, to take effect upon the death of the person making the same, shall be deemed to have been, or to be, made, as the case may be, with intent to evade the payment of the duty under this part of this Act, "" shall lie deemed to have been made with intent to evade the payment of the d u t y . "" These words are clear as Holy Writ. Sir "" WILLIAMIRVINE - That is, i ""within one year previous to the death.",32
346,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"No time whatever is stated. An y conveyance made at any time before death is deemed to be an attempt to evade payment. The section continuesAll property of any kind whatsoever the subject-matter of a donatio mortis causa, shall upon the death of the person making such donatio mortis causa, be deemed to form part of his property for the purpose of estimating the duty payable under this part of this Act, and duty shall be paid upon it as upon any otlier part of such person's property, and the payment of such duty may be enforced against such property the subject-matter of such donatio mortis causa in the same way as against any other property, of or to which such person may die seized, possessed, or ontitled. In the Ac t which the honourable and learned member's measure amended, the principle to which he objects was embodied without any limitation at all ; so that any property passing under any g if t or settlement, whether inter vivos or by will, was affected, whether made before the passing of the Act or not. As to the point mentioned by the honourable member for Darling Downs, I shall be very pleased to make the term twelve months instead of three years, provided that the words "" before or after the commencement of this Act "" be in serted.",33
347,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Flinders). -[3.50] - The latter part of the provision which the Attorney-General read refers to donationes. mortis causd, or gifts made in the immediate anticipation of death. Such gifts, even though the person who makes them may not die immediately, are regarded as part of his estate for the purposes of duty. That part of the section which has relation to the question which we are discussing is thisIf any person has made or shall hereafter make any conveyance or assignment, gift, delivery or transfer of any estate, reai or personal, or of any money or securities for money, with intent to evade the payment of duty . . . the property . . . shall upon the death of such person, be deemed to form part of his estate for the purposes of this Part of this Act. I am in no way responsible for Acts which were passed long before my time. The Act of 1903, which is the authority on which the Attorney-General relies, in dealing with gifts before the coming into operation of the measure now under disf made cussion, was an amendment of laws that had been long in force. It readsEvery conveyance or assignment, gift, delivery, or transfer . . . shall-(a ) if made within twelve months immediately preceding tlio death of the person so dying; or (6) if made at any time relating to any property of which property bona fide possession and enjoyment shall not have been assumed by the donee immediately upon the gift, and thenceforward retained to the entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise be deemed to have made the property to which the same relates chargeable with the payment of the duty payable under the Administration and Probate Acts as though part of the estate of the donor. That was a reasonable provision, and one which might well be adopted now. In cases where there has been an absolute g if t , and property has passed to the beneficiaries, it should be free of duty if made before this Bill comes into operation.",33
348,Mr BKENNAN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Such property in some cases may have been dissipated or redistributed.,33
349,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Yes . In any case the interest is much smaller than that of the original possessor, and it should therefore be taxed-if taxed at all - n t a lower rate. The revenue is absolutely protected. It is open to the Attorney-General to udopt the same principle of operation in regard to this Bill as is adopted in regard to a T a r i ff measure, and make its provisions applicable from the date of introduction. I have not made an examination of the laws of the States, but I think that they afford no authority for the step which the Attorney-General wishes the Oommittee to take. This provision would operate with great harshness upon persons who for years have been enjoying in their own right what was once a part ofanother person's estate, but has long since passed to them. Amendments (by Mr HUGHE S) agreed toThat in sub-clause 4, paragraph o, after the word "" made,"" line 8, the words '* before or after the commencement of this Act "" be inserted. That the words ""three years,"" twice occurring, be left out, with a view of inserting in lieu thereof the words "" one year.""",33

Estate duty shall not be assessed or payable upon so much of the estate as is devised or bequeathed or passes by gift inter vivos or settlement for religious, scientific, public charitable, or public educational purposes.",33
351,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Flinders) [4.3] - What is the"" meaning of the word "" p u b l i c "" in relation to "" c h a r i table "" ? The term ""charitable purposes"" has » perfectly defined meaning in law, and the use of the - word ' ' public ' ' before it may give some undefined limitation.",34
352,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Thes e words are taken from the Victorian Statute.,34
353,Mr GLYNN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Angas) [4.5] - The At torney-General will remember that when the Land Tax Assessment Bill was before the House in 1910 we then debated for a couple of days the question of the distinction between "" p r i v at e "" and "" public "" in relation to the word "" charitable."" Eventually the House decided to use only the word "" charitable,"" because the qualifying word might exclude a large number of persons from the purview of Parliament's intent. Paragraph e of section 13 contains these wordsAll land owned by or in trust for a charitable or educational institution, if the institution, however formed or constituted, rs carried on solely for charitable or educational purposes, and not for pecuniary profit.",34
354,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"West Sydney-Attor - on the face of the Statute. ney-General) [4.7] - The Amending Act of 1907, section 3. «ubney-General section 2, says1.

In this section the term "" public charitable bequest"" or "" public charitable settlement"" means devise, bequest, or legacy, or settlement in the section. of real or personal property of whatever description to or for any free public library, any free public museum, or any public instiStatute. tution for the promotion of science and art (including working men's colleges and schools of mines), or any public university, or any public hospital, or any public benevolent lum, or any public dispensary, or any woman's refuge or ladies' benevolent society, or miners' benevolent fund. Mr GT.YNN - A great many charities will not be covered by that.",34
355,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"That is the meaning of "" p u b l i c charitable settlement"" i the Victorian A ct of 1907, but the meanback three hundred years. ing of the terms generally applied is not limited by that Act.",34
356,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Darling Downs) [4.9] I hope the Attorney-General will omit the word "" public,"" because it will rereasons strict the interpretation of the measure.",34
357,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,I will stick to the Victorian phraseology.,34
358,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Then the honourable member ought to define the words "" public charitable."" If the honourable member takes the words from the Victorian Act , he must insert the Victorian definition. Take the case of the Salvation Army, to which a man may leave large sums of money for the establishment of some in stitution like the Bovs' Home. Or there is the instance of Dr Barnardo's Home. Institutions of that character are established by private bequest, and are governed by the deed or charter that creates them. But by inserting the word "" public "" in this sub-clause, that institution would probably not come within the definition of a charitable institution. By the omission of the word "" public,"" the Attorney-General will get nearer to his intention than if he allows the amendment to remain in its present form.",34
359,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Balaclava) [4.10] - As the Attorney-General has referred to the Victorian Statutes, 1 would remind him of one or two occurrences that are not visible As a result Victorian of the use of the terms which the Attorhas quoted, tliere was a celebrated law case, the only case we had in in the reference to the payment of duty under That was in conpubnexion with the estate of the late Mr . any Forrest, formerly a member of the Vicbequest torian Assembly, who, tempted by the or wording of the Act, made a will in which he bequeathed £100,000. to charities.",34
360,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,The definition in that case was limited by the meaning set for t h It would not necessarily or have that meaning in the Commonwealth,34
361,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"In that case the testator's will was upset. The payment of duty had asyto be made, but the charities did not get any of the money that had been willed to them. From every point of view the Act failed to meet the intention of Parliament. As a result, another Act was passed last year giving the Courts greater freen dom from the old case law, which stretches The word "" charitable "" is as clearly defined in case law as any word in the language, but the words "" public charitable "" were very confusing to the Court. There were several why that will was upset, but that was one of them. I think it would be better, in view of the experience we have had, if the established meaning of old words were adhered to and the word "" public "" were struck out.",34
362,Mr GLYNN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Angas) [ 4 . 1 3 ] - I also hope the Attorney-General will strike out the word "" public,"" because I can assure him that a great many charities which are exempt under the State law will be brought under this taxation if that word is allowed to remain. The English Courts have discussed, particularly in the case of The Commissioner of Taxes v. Pemsel, what wore charities within the meaning of the Act. The greatest confusion has always been introduced by qualifying the private character of charitable institutions. In the South Australian District Councils Act and the Municipal Corporations Act the word "" charitable "" is used without any qualification. I think the same' wording is adopted in many of the English Statutes. I do hope that we shall not prevent gifts of money to charities, by declaring that, although the object of the gifts is admirably subserved by the character of the institution, whether private or not, we shall exclude them from benefits that ought to be given to all kind."" of charities. .1. am quite sure the public sense of the community will recognise that the insertion of the word "" public "" will place upon what ought to be the intention of Parliament a limitation which they never would sanction.",35
363,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [4.16] - I can only say that my experience should be a salutary warning to those who endeavour to meet the wishes of honourable members opposite. I introduced an amendment practically upon the lines laid down by them, and am now face to face with positively hideous dangers. The bowelless purpose of this measure is exposed to the full view of a horrified public. It would appear to have its claws thrust into the very vitals of gentle charity. All this is very affecting; but with every desire to follow out the amiable and well-intentioned suggestions of honourable members opposite, I do not know what I am to do. The term "" p u b l i c charitable purposes"" is very wide. As to what extent it is. narrower than ' ' charitable purposes ' ' I cannot for the moment say. Questions continually arise in the Courts as to what is a "" charitable "" g if t or settlement. Is i intention of my coad jutors to suggest that the word "" p u b l i c "" ought to be struck out before the word "" e d u c at i o n "" ? Is that, too, wrong?",35
364,Mr GLYNN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,I should prefer to see it omitted.,35
365,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Rathe r than have any more bother about the matter I am prepared to strike out the word "" public "" before the word "" charitable."" I can hardly conceive of any educational purpose which would not be public. The word "" p u b l i c , "" as used here, does not mean "" S t at e "" or "" National , "" as opposed to "" Denominational,"" but has a very wide significance. Amendment, by leave, amended accordingly.",35
366,Mr GLYNN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Aneas) [4.19] - I think that the word "" p u b l i c , "" before ""educational,"" should also come out. I do not wish to cite too many State Acts, but there is plenty of precedent for my contention. In the Municipal Corporations Act of Adelaide we have reference to any church, chapel, or building used exclusively for public worship, any building belonging to an academical institution which shall have obtained an act of incorporation, if such building be used directly for the academical purposes of such institution, and any other building, or part of a building, used exclusively as a school, "" whether public or private."" That leaves no room for doubt. The object is not to tax people who are not making education a commercial enterprise.",35
367,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Sho w me the Probate and Succession Duty A ct of South Australia, or any other State, and I shall be willing to follow it .",35
368,Mr GLYNN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"They are not identical. I do not wish to speak of any Act with which I am not quite familiar; but some of the definitions under the South Australian Act are not in line with those to be found in this Bill . I would refer the honourable member to the District Councils Act of South Australia, and also to the Water Conservation Act of 1886, under which a question as to what wa9 the meaning of "" charity "" arose in a case in which I happened to be engaged as counsel. In all these the in tention, and. in most of them, the expression, is to give the benefit of exemption to private, as well as public, instit the tutions of the kind. In order to prevent any doubt arising with regard to the schools covered by them the words ''whether public or p r i v at e "" are used. Why should we throw upon the High hospital, Court the almost impossible obligation of able institution. finding out what is in our minds in regard to this expression ? The AttorneyingGeneral's benevolence towards Christmas should extend at least as far as I sugby gest, and if he will agree to strike out the word "" public,"" before the word defined "" educational,"" we shall accept it as letter, something of a Christmas box. Even the sub-clause be amended as I propose, it will not exempt as much as is exempted under the State Rating Act, and the State Taxation Acts. I think that the South Australian Taxation A ct 1884 contains a similar exemption of public charity, butcharitable lands, and that under it they are not liable to taxation.",35
369,Mr BRENNAN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Batman) [4.24] I hope the Attorney-General will adopt the suggestion just made by the honourable member for Angas, and strike out the word "" p u b l i c "" appearing before the word ""educational.""' If he does not he will create difficulties for himself in regard, first of all, to the determination of what are public educational trusts. There are many, certainly, that are on the border line, and there are many also which are of a distinctively private character, but are recognised by the States, in those cases where compulsory education prevails, as affording a sufficient standard of education. I cannot understand why there should be this limitation, insisting upon "" p u b l i c "" educational institutions. One has only to stir one's imagination to recall large numbers of well-known educational institutions of a distinctly private character, and yet recognised as of the very highest standing, where students of all creeds and classes are educated ; and one cannot understand why the Attorney-General should insist on the retention of the word "" p u b l i c "" in connection with education any more than he should insist upon its retention in connection with the word ""charitable."" I hope that he will not.",36

As a general rule, a friendly society, even of if it has honorary members, is not a if it receives voluntary donations and be founded for members in distressed circumstances or otherwise in povertyi t would be regarded as a public charity. Then, again, we find "" public education "" defined at page 1605 as includingEducation provided in return for periodical payments, as well as purely gratuitous or free education. There the term is applied whether there is a payment for the education granted or whether there is none. It is not material that such education should be controlled by the State. The Statute from which the honourable member for Angas quoted is of no use to us in this connection, since we are dealing with the disposition of estates. If a testator, by a certain form of words, could so dispose of his estate as to wholly escape the payment of estate duty, that would be to defeat the purposes of this law. If a testator devised his estate to be used for the purpose of educating his own family, would the honourable member, as a lawyer, say that that would not come within the amendment suggested by him, and the estate wholly escapes payment of estate duty ? We must safeguard the revenue; and I take it that it is not the intention of the honourable member for one moment to permit any wholesale evasion of the Act by a mere disposition of property covered I , tlierefore, suggest that "" public educational"" is the If it should turn out that sufficient authority can be adto support a contrary view, and a form of words can be inserted which 3, will safeguard the revenue, I shall be quite - willing to insert them. am not wedded to the word "" public,"" perfectly satisfied. although it is a well-known word, and has a definite meaning.

It unlooses the obligation on the personal estate, and impliedly makes it a charge on the realty. The laws of the different States vary upon this point. In Victoria the primary liability of the personal estate for probate duty is uot exactly the same as the provision in South Australia, and the question that arises in my min d is whether, for the purpose of raising this duty, we can declare the law of liability, and so alter the existing law of liability which the State prescribes.",39
388,Mr BRENNAN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,In Victoria the duty is payable out of the general residue.,39
389,Mr HUGHES,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"In the Land Tax Assessment Act provision is made for taking land in certain cases, and under it the power of the Commonwealth has been asserted to a great extent.",39
390,Mr GLYNN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"There is no doubt about our power as regards land. This does not refer to any priority of obligation that may be imposed by the terms of a will. I see difficulties about these matters, and therefore draw attention to the point. The provision does not save dispositions made by a will. My opinion is that we cannot abrogate the provisions of the will ; that this must be sub' ject to them.",39
391,Mr GREE NE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Richmond) [ 5 . 2 ] I hope that the Attorney-General will look into this matter very closely. A will might declare that certain legacies bene- should be paid in cash immediately. This difficulty might then arise. The executors, to pay the duty, might have to use the whole of the available cash, and would then have to sell the land, under perhaps disadvantageous circumstances.",39

It is the penalty that is provided for knowingly aud wilf u l l y making or delivering any false returns and other similar offences. In my opinion, it is too severe, and is also too severe for the offence of refusing or neglecting to attend and give evidence or to produce any book, document, or paper. Clause agreed to. Clause 52(1) Any person who, with intent to defraud, in any return understates the value of any estate, shall be guilty of an indictable offence. Penalty: Five hundred pounds and an amount equal to treble the amount of the duty which would have buuu evaded if the value stated in the return had been accepted as the value of the estate; or forfeiture of the estate involved or any part tliereof. (2) Where the value stated in the return is less, by 25 per centum or more, than the value as found by the jury, the value shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have been understated with intent to defraud. Amendment (by Mr HUGHES) proposed - That all the words after the word "" who,"" line 1, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :"" (a) with intent to defraud, in any return understates the value of any estate, or (b) by any wilful act, default, or neglect, or by any fraud, art, or contrivance, whatever, evades assessment or duty, shall be guilty of an indictable offence.

Debate resumed from 15th Deceniber (vide page 1902), on motion by Mr . JENSEN That this Bill be now road a second time. Mr JOSE PH COOK (Parramatta) [5.13] - In my judgment, no Bill of this session will compare in importance with the measure now under discussion. I take no exception to the cold statement of figures made by the Minister in moving the second reading, but his speech might well have been warmed with some reference to considerations entirely outside those of finance. If by pensions is meant, as is ordinarily meant, payment to the full of services rendered to the State, the Bill is misnamed. We can never pay for the services these soldiers render Australia in the war, and, tlierefore, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, "" pensions,"" v/ii may not express exactly our relationship to the soldiers in this particular measure. I am one of those who believe that the proposals set out in this Bill are in themselves meagre enough, and If r a n k ly confess that I should like to see them made a little more liberal. I know that we treat all matters relating to pensions very charily in this House, and one has only to mention the subject to be the but t of obloquy and scorn. But when we are faced with the grim realities of a struggle for our national existence, I hope we shall approach the matter in a very different manner from the way in which we have approached it in times gone by. At any rate, the outstanding fact remains that some of our finest men have given up all they possessed, have left their occupations behind them-som e of them at sacrifices which in themselves are very likely to be of a ruinous character-and have surrendered all material prospects in l if e to go abroad to fight for their country at this time. Therefore, I say that when we talk of payment of this kind, the word "" pensions "" is a complete misnomer as applied to a condition of affairs in which a man, without considerations of any kind but those of love for his country and realization of his <luty to his country in this time of national peril, goes for t h to sacrifice his life, if need be, so that his home, his country, and its institutions may be made secure. Accordingly all sides of the House, and, I think, every member in the House, approaches this Bill in only one spirit, and that is a desire to do the best we possibly can for these men, and, for the rest, to give them our blessing in the arduous undertakings of the war. The scheme of pensions outlined by the Assistant Minister slightly from a d r a f t which Liberal Government left behind them when they surrendered office. help feeling that this Bill is very much belated. Just why it should have been kept for the closing hours of the session I do not know. I have an impression that this should have been the first legislation - of the session, and there is no reason why it should not have been.",40
398,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Would it have made any - difference ?,41
399,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I do not know that it would in a pecuniary sense; but I do think that man who went to the war should have known that he was leaving this provision behind him, ancl there was no reason at .all, except the dilatoriness of the Department and the Government, why this should not have been brought forward long ago. However, it boots nothing to be critical as to that point now. We are face to face)with this measure, and I do not think it will take very long to pass it through this Chamber. I have already stated that this inatter was under our consideration, and that we left behind us a d r a ft which was not quite complete; but, so far as it went, it was more liberal than this Bill in some respects, and perhaps a little less so in others, although the aspect in which it was less liberal was due entirely to an oversight on the part of the Minister of Defence. It was decided that the amount for the widow, even in that scheme, should be £ 5 0 ; but the Government considered that the man who was totally in capacitated should have more than the widow for this reason: A man who has lost both hands, or both legs, or his eyesight, or has suffered total incapacity of any kind, is a much more helpless being in the world than a strong woman who has no children, and is able to make her way in the world with the help' of a £ 5 2 pension. That was the consideration which induced us to make the amount for total incapacitation £75, in stead of £52, as this Bill proposes. I frankly do not think that this is a sufficient provision for the man who is totally incapacitated. All he will get under this Bill will be £ 5 2 for himself, and £ 2 6 for his wife.",41
400,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,And something for the differs children. the,41
401,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Yes , if there be I cannot any; but in considering the pensions of the seniors I prefer to leave the children out of account. Honourable members must remember that we have not h u r t ourselves yet over this war; all we have done is to give a little of our abundance. There has been no real sacrifice, so far as the nation as a whole is concerned; nor do I think that this Bill represents a burden the liquidation of which to the uttermost farthing will h u r t the country in any way. I cannot help feeling that we every could have been a little more liberal with the man who is totally incapacitated than this Bill proposes that we shall be, and I would strongly urge on the Government, even at this stage, to consider whether it would not be wise to make the amount for total incapacity £ 7 8 per annum in stead of £ 5 2 . Even that would be only £104 for the man and his wife, and that is not too liberal a pension for a man who has been made utterly unfit for any occupation by giving his services in the defence of his country. I appeal to the Government to consider whetherthey will not make the amount for total incapacity a little more liberal than the Bill proposes. A p a r t from that, I shall have little to say about the amounts of the pensions, except to remark that perhaps the amounts set down for officers are very small indeed in comparison with the Imperial pensions. So, indeed, is the pay we give our oflicers. Australian oflicers above the rank of captain receive much less than the oflicers in the Imperial Army. If we are going to standardize our Army right through, the least we can do is to pay, officer for officer and man for man, a little more than is paid in thp Imperial A r m y . Instead of that, we are actually paying them less, and I should not be surprised if , later on. in consequence of that fact, we have an exodus of some of our officers to the Imperial Army.  tween the private in the Imperial A r my and the private in our Forces.",41
402,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,I admit that; but I am speaking of the way in which we pay for military direction.  money from the private soldiers and give it to the officers.,42
403,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"But the honourable member must have seen that the Imperial Government have quite recently doubled the pensions, and provided for the appropriation of an additional sum of £100,000,000 sterling for the payment of pensions alone. To realise how little the war is hurting us, one has only to contrast our payments on account of the war during the year with those of the Mother Country. Our total outlay for the whole twelve months is calculated at £11,700,000, but we have already read that the Imperial Government have raised a loan of £350,000,000 , which is to meet the war requirements until May next. In addition to that, the sum of ""£100,000,000 has been appropriated, or hypothecated in some way, for the payment of war pensions. therefore, my honourable friend suggested, as he was perfectly right in doing, that the totality of our pensions would run into over £1,000,000 sterling, he stated what is a very small amount indeed. A f t e r all, Australia has one-ninth of the population of Great Britain, and all through their figures show that Great Britain is expending nearer twenty-nine times what the Commonwealth is expending. I remember that when I was talking some time ago about the number of soldiers we were sending to the war, the Prime Minister quite properly reminded me that we had already a Navy in Australia. The reply to that is very simple: So fa r our Navy has cost us only about £1,500,000 annually for the last four years.",42
404,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,More than that.,42
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"No . cost Australia about £4,000,000 for the construction of the Navy, and about £2,000,000 at the outside would cover the cost of administration. In those four years the Mother Country has spent nearly £200,000,000 on the Navy, so that the introduction of the Navy into the comparison does not help us much.",42
406,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The right honourable gentleman compared Australia with Canada, and the later figures from the Dominion show Australia to be in the front.",42
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I never mentioned Canada in that connection. I said that, in my opinion, the whole of the Dominions could do a great deal more than they are doing. M.ay I remind the right honourable gentleman that the people in Canada appear to be doing more than we are with the land forces just now ?",42
408,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Has the honourable member seen the latest oflicial figures for Canada?,42
409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Yes ; 106,000 men.",42
410,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,We have under arms or in training more than that.,42
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I understand that Canada has already undertaken to send two armies of 30,000 each to the seat of war. We are only proposing in Australia to maintain an effective army in the field of 33,000.",42
412,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"There is no l i m it to the number we will maintain if more men be necessary. When, Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The right honourable gentleman knows that more men are necessary. Any man who says that every soldier we can send away to the seat of war is not necessary does not realise the gravity of the situation. Sir WILLIAM IRVINE , - A i u i the necessity exists now.",42
413,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"And every man is being trained and prepared to be sent to the war. Canada is only a hop, step, and a jump from the scene of the war.",42
414,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,I am not sure that every man is being obtained and prepared. I hope that this criticism will not be considered as intended to be anything but helpful.,42
415,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"If there is to be any c r it i cism, I wish it to be before we adjourn. It has Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I am making: the criticism now. I do not agree with the Miuister of Defence and the Prime M in ister that we should aim only at sending such men from Australia as we can equip ourselves from local resources. I think we ought, if necessary, to rake up equipmany ment anywhere we can find it in the world. privates. The whole world is being laid under tribution by the fighting armies today, and it is not a matter of confining selves to our own country when we desire to get soldiers ready for the war. buy wherever you can obtain what is quired in the shortest possible time. all-important essential is celerity in the despatch of troops.",42
416,Mr BAMFORD,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"What would have haptions pened, supposing the men who have been lauded at Egypt had not been equipped",43
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,It would be most absurd to send away men who were not equipped. The question and how to obtain your equipment in quickest way.,43
418,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Not only has Australia equipped its own men, but it has supofficers, plied others with equipment, as the right honourable member himself knows.",43
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Quite so. The Prime Minister is referring to the despatch of motor equipment?,43
420,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"To the supply of matewas, rial of every kind.",43
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I do not know oo what else the right honourable gentleeven man is referring. This, however, is a tle wide of the question immediately before us. The point that I wish to emphasize is that, since we are sending out a limited number of men to the war, and since apparently the war is not going to cost us very much, so far as the actual equipment and despatch of troops are concerned, seeing that it represent only £11,700,000 for a whole year, we might well be a little more liberal with the pensions that we pose to provide. The Treasurer should make the minimum pension in the case of total incapacity, not £ 5 2 a year, £78 per year. That would mean that a man who was crippled and a derelict, so far as the ordinary occupations of life the Imperial army. are concerned, would, with his wife, receive £104 per year. I do that this little addition would h u r t us very much, but it would mean much the man who had left everything behind him to go to the war, and had come back fit for nothing. We should not forget the kind of men we are sending, nor doubled recently. [<4] should we forget the position that many of them occupy. It is well known that with big fortunes are serving as That is an argument for conno pension at all, perhaps, since men so situated will not need one. But beourtween the two extremes - between the man who has 'nothing but his labour to You depend upon and the man at the other reend of the social scale, who has a forThe tune - there are many occupying good positions in our social and industrial life. Some of them have given up posiwhere they were receiving £ 1 0 per week, in order to go to the war, and ? while on active service they will receive 6s. per day. Since all gradations and ranks and degrees of capacity for earning is where money are among these men to whom the the lower rates of pay apply, I plead again that the scale of pensions should be a little more liberal where they are totally incapacitated. W it h regard to the I think that the proposals of the late Government were a little more liberal.",43
422,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Yes .,43
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Our maximum I think, £ 2 5 0 ; here it is £156 per annum. As the Minister very properly showed the other day, these payments, if they were raised, as proposed by l it - us, to £250 per annum, would be much below the Imperial rates, which, in special cases, go up to very high amounts. The scale which the Minister quoted the other day related, I think, to colonels; but above tliem there are other commanding officers who, I think, have special pensions allotted to them, in additiou to the liberal ones quoted by the wil l honourable gentleman. Our officers who go to the fron t will be very much below the oflicers of the Imperial army in this promatter of pensions. Not only are they working for less pay here, when following their military occupations, but when but they go to war, and suffer, we propose to give them far less than half the pension they would receive if they were in Altogether, our scheme of pensions cannot be said to not think be particularly liberal.",43
424,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"It is, if we take the to minimum and the maximum rates.",43
425,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Eve n then I do not think it is particularly liberal. In the Old Country the pensions have been  only at the rate of ls. for the loss of a limb. Before it was only 6d. a limb,43
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I am speaking not of the loss of a limb, but of cases where death or total incapacity occurs. I understand that in the Imperial Army, in the case of total incapacity, a man with a wife and children would receive up to 24s. or 25s. per week. That would be quite as liberal as the payments we propose to make, having regard to the difference in value.  very much. They pay for all the allowances they receive.",44
427,Dr MALONEY,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,How many of heroes of Balaclava have died in the workhouse ?,44
428,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Quite so. I recognise all that; and I am urging that we should be more liberal. I am suggesting a higher rate of pay in the case of death or total incapacity. I was very much interested in the figures quoted by the Assistant Minister of Defence the other day, as showing the probable drain upon this fund. He referred, I understand, to deaths, and not to the total casualties.",44
429,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Yes ; I quoted the figures relating to casualties and cases of invalidity.,44
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Then there must be a tremendous amount of invalidity which the honourable gentleman did not explain.,44
431,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,There are three such cases t.o every death.,44
432,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"May I remind the honourable gentleman of the figures he gave me the other day regarding the number of men we propose to send to the front. ""We have 42,000 men provided for in respect of the financial year. Of these, 20,000 have gone, 13,000 are going this month, and during the next six months there are to go only three batches of 2,000 each. Of this total of 42,000, 9,000 will be reinforcements. ",44
433,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,It is true. I am putting before the House the statement made by the Assistant Minister in answer to a question put by me in consequence of somo remarks made outside by Senator Pearce.,44
434,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"More are to be sent, if necessary.",44
435,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"All trained men will be sent as soon as they are fit to go, and we arc training as many as Ave can get.",44
436,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The fact remains that we are only aiming at having 33,000 effectives in the field for the year. I also asked the Assistant Minister of Defence what reinforcements it would take to maintain these 33,000 effectives in the field. His answer was, ""About 2,000 per month."" That shows for the twelve montlis a war wastage of 24,000 in 33,000. The wastage of war altogether is very terrible. ""When I held office as Minister of Defence it was estimated, I the think, at 68 per cent, per annum. I think, therefore, that there must be many kinds of invalidity other than those which the Assistant Minister of Defence mentioned when introducing this Bill. His figures seem to bear out that view. He said that to keep these 33,000 effectives in the field we should require to supply, roughly, 2,000 a month.  margin.",44
437,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"It is. I think that before the year's end we shall find Canada doubling the number of men which she has already provided. But the point that is relevant to this discussion is as to how we can help in a practical way those we send to the front and who suffer in consequence. I find that in the Old Country there is a whole system of pensions payable to soldiers. The honourable member for Maranoa, himself an old soldier, will recollect that if a man there in peace time is incapacitated he is entitled to a scale of allowances for the rest of his life. The officers also, after so many years' service, receive very high allowances in the shape of pensions. I saw it stated the other day that an officer in the Imperial Army who has served eight years, may leave, and, if he joins one of the territorial arms of the service, is entitled to a pension of £100 a year for ten years, or a total pension of £1,000 for having served in the Army for eight years.  sion for the private.",44
438,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"That is so. It is material for us to know whether an Imperial soldier, who is incapacitated in the war, will receive this peace pension, to which he would have heen entitled had he l e ft the Arm y at the time the war began, in addition to the pension which he will receive as a consequence of any disability incurred in the war. Are those pensions concurrent and' cumulative, or does one displace the other? If the Imperial soldier gets the two pensions, he will be treated relatively better than our own men.  pension, and also the pension for active service.",44
439,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Does not the honourable member see that these two pensions together, in the case of a decently long service  long sei-vice here.",45
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I know. I am now only speaking of the relative positions of our men and the men in the I m perial Army. If the Imperial soldier gets the two pensions he will be quite as well off in point of money, to say nothing of the money value, as our own men in Australia. In a matter of this sort we ought to have some information. But I know rhat when I was at the Defence Department, it was marvellous what little information could be obtained about the other armies of the world. I could not get any; ancl one of the last things I did  the details of the Imperial pensions scheme, so that we might set about arranging one for our own Foroes. We are only tinkering with our Defence Forces if we do not secure some retiring allowance for them. We can never have that circulation of ability from bottom to top unless there is something for the men to leave the A r m y on. It is not a fair thing to keep a man in the service for years, and then allow him to go out to beggary; and the result is often that we keep him in .  in the industrial army get when he has spent his l if e there ? Ten shillings a week.",45
441,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"There are numbers of men in the industrial army who can make three or four times the money that men in the Defence Forces can make. If a man is an expert militar y officer, thoroughly trained, with a complete [74]- 2 knowledge of his business, his ability in civil lif e would, in many cases, have brought him much higher pay than he can receive as a soldier. In our A r m y and Navy we are now giving an education equal to that of a university. We are turning out men with such knowledge as would enable them to obtain a bachelorship of engineering at any one of the seats of learning. Altogether, we are giving them such a scientific training, in retiring both A r m y and Navy, as would enable them to command respectable positions in the scientific and professional sections of our civil life.  much use without that training.",45
442,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Quite so; and, therefore, we must keep that fact in m in d when we are considering the pay and pensions we propose to give them. In the British A r m y , and, indeed, in every A r m y and Navy in the world, the men have either to get on or get out; they must keep going up or go, the idea being that there shall be the highest ability constantly circulating from the bottom to the top of the service. Therefore it is that provision is made for them in the shape of handsome pensions. I met a doctor of the I m p e r i a l Navy some few years ago, who informed me that he was entitled to a pension of £ 1 a day after twenty years' service. That is the way in which officers of the I m perial N a v y are treated.",45
443,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Does the honourable member seriously advocate that we should engraft such a system on our democratic Defence Forces?,45
444,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,I say that we cannot have the best ability in our A r m y and Navy unless we do.,45

Mr JOSE PH COOK - Some of the most brilliant men in the British A r m y today have risen by their own unaided efforts. The days for commissions by purchase are passed.,45
447,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Purchas e in the British Army was abolished in 1868, I think . Mr JOSE PH COOK - I have yet to learn that a pension scheme such as prevails in the Imperial A r m y , and every other Army in the world, is inconsistent with the spirit of Democracy. The pension is only a payment for services rendered-par t of line salary. Democratic countries^pensions are paid, so that all over the world, according to the Prime Minister, the spirit of Democracy is being flouted. All this, however, only in directly bears on the question of our officers' pensions. According to this Bill , an officer of the highest grade is to be paid £ 1 5 6 a year as a maximum pension. I suppose the Government have made up their minds on the point; but we certainly thought that a maximum of £25 0 was littl e enough to pay men of great skill and ability, who are leaving so much behind them in the way of civil opportunities",45
448,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Thos e officers have a better chance to make provision in the way of insurance, and so for t h , than have the poorer classes; and they do make such provision.",46
449,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,And why ? Because they have earned more.,46
450,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Certainly . Every oflicer going to the front is heavily insured, simply because he has money to pay for the insurance.",46
451,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Is that any reason why we should not do _our duty in the matter?,46
452,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,The fact ought to be taken into consideration.,46
453,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"That reasoning would lead us to keep the pension away from every man who does not need it . However that may be, I see that the widow's allowance is to cease on remarriage; and, personally, I do not think that ought to be. The pension Is the widow's right, whether she remarries or not, and it ought to continue to be paid so long as she cares to receive, it .",46
454,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Does she not get her loss repaired with another husband?,46
455,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I do not know: she may or may not; and we cannot legislate on an assumption like that. This pension is the woman's right, and not a charity; and I understand that my friends opposite believe in equal payment for both sexes. ",46
456,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I do not think I was ever on thicker ice. opinion, the woman is entitled to the pension whatever she may choose to do in the f u t u r e ; it is a right vested in her by the sacrifice of her former husband in the service of his country.  In most fellows chasing her to marry her !",46
457,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,That does not say much for the honourable member's sex.  sex is no better than it ought to be.,46
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I recognise the necessity for getting this Bill through at the earliest possible moment. The pensions, I see, are to be administered by the Minister of Defence, together with a Board, which, I presume, will be a M i l it a ry Board.",46
459,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Not necessarily.,46

488,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"In my wildest dreams I never thought that the Leader of the Opposition would. He spoke of the Government and our contingents. Australia has been singularly fortunate in what it has been able to do. It has been able to send forward a very large contingent of men, equipped in everything needed to make them a first-class fighting force, and it has been able to help in other ways both on sea and on land in a way that no other Dominion of the Empire can, but that does not relieve the Government, whoever they may be, at the present time from doing everything they can to send additional contingents. That is being done. I have told Parliament already that every available officer capable of training men as soldiers is being secured and set apart for that purpose. Indeed, some men are now being trained in order that they may train others, with the object of having our contingents thoroughly trained to before they leave Australia and during the period when we have not the means to of conveying them to the seat of war. We are losing no time in this direction, and there will be no end to the number of men being trained, provided that they are otherwise fit to be soldiers.

496,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I know that.

The Minister of Defence informed me quite recently that he is taking every step possible to increase the number.",48

498,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"In fair l y good numbers, quite equal to the present capacity of the Government to train them. However, in a very little while we shall have other officers and other training camps, that will enable us to train the men more expeditiously. We are incurring considerable expense in. order to provide training omcers and training camps that will provide larger contingents if necessary.",49
499,Mr FENTON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,I suppose that there has been a considerable depletion of officers.,49
500,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The Minister has taken in all the competent subordinate non-commissioned officers and placed them in a special training camp, so that they, on their part, may become training officers to give training in other camps. I believe that the principle he is following is quite sound, ancl that it will have a good effect. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the administration of this measure should be uncier the Treasurer. Obviously the failure of the American system was lack of proper control. tliink that a Naval and M i l it a r y Board ought to decide doubtful questions, and make recommendations to the Executive.",49
501,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I think that Naval and M i l it a r y Forces should be represented on a Board, but I do not think that it sbould be a Board exclusively of naval ancl military officers.",49
502,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"T be point may be determined from time to time, as we see how the system works, but I should not like to be in the Treasury if every case had to be determined by the Minister. The determination of many questions in regard to invalid and old-age pensions is often difficult, but in this case there will be military reasons for certain injuries that come within the law, and also for injuries that do not come within it which it should not be the sole function of the Treasurer to determine, but which should be determined from recommendations bysome competent tribunal. The Leader of the Opposition also raised the question of taking the pension from the widow who marries again. I admit that this is a question on the borders of doubt, but I think that the larger measure of protection for the widow will lie in not give paying the pension after her marriage. I hesitate to go into the reasons that may appeal to the minds of many people at the present time. A lover wishing to become a husband desires to make provision for his wife throughout her life. I do not think that widows will suffer if we allow this provision to remain.",49
503,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Flinders) [6.16] - This is a measure which we can all approach without the faintest shade of party feeling. I congratulate the Government on having introduced it . One of the most shocking things of the past has always seemed to me, and no doubt to many honourable members, to be the fact that some of those who have fought the battles of Empire have been left in old age to devices for obtaining a livelihood which were unworthy of the country which they had served. The substantial provision made for the widows of men in the lower ranks is by no means too large, having regard, not merely to the service to the country that is being performed by their husbands, but to their own wants. I cordially support the view of the Leader of the Opposition that the GoI vernment might well consider whether it might not be possible to make some addition t.o the provision, in cases of total disablement,, when in a f a m i l y there will the be at least two mouths to feed instead of one. I have nothing to add to the arguments which he put forward, except to say that this is a matter in which we should not count the cost too much. Of all duties that f all on Parliament, the gravest is that of making provision for those who have lef t us to take the terrible risks of the war. Among both privates and officers are many men who have made great sacrifices by giving up means of livelihood dependent upon their skill in business and professions which they may never full y recover. For that reason I conceive that the Government has reasonably not made the pensions of the widows of officers as high as they would be under the Imperial scheme. I do not think that we ought to slavishly follow that scheme in this matter, but I ask the Prime Minister to consider whethere some extension might not be made for the reason that some of the officers who have gone awray have, to some extent, gone under expectations grounded upon the usual practice in the Empire. It would be an unfortunate thing if they had to carry on their extremely responsible duties under a sense of reasonable disappointment. I wish to add a word or two on the point referred to by both the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister as to the aid that we have sent to the Mother Country in this struggle. I believe that the Government is endeavouring to do all that is possible. I think that the Prime Minister recognises-as we all do-that this is the hour of trial for us, and for every part of the Empire. I have no doubt whatever that the interests of Australia are perhaps more deeply involved than those of any other part of the Empire, and that the maintenance of our liberty and of our possession of the Continent depends almost immediately on the success of the Allies. We look to the Prime Minister, as the leader of Australia, to lead, not merely in the administrative work of doing what can be done in the recruiting and training of men, but also to direct the public opinion of Australia by impressing upon our fellow citizens on every possible occasion the supreme necessity and duty that rests upon them. I asked the right honourable gentleman how the volunteers are coming in , and he replied that they are coming in as fast as we are able to train them. I do not come here' to criticise in this matter. It is the duty of all of us to assist the Government in every way. We are all anxious to follow the lead which the Prime Minister can give in arousing, and keeping aroused, patriotism of the people, and the feeling that a supreme effort should be made, and must be made now.",49
504,Dr MALONEY,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Melbourne) [6.20] I desire, in the first place, to compliment the Assistant Minister on the clear and logical speech with which he introduced the Bill , and which impressed other members besides myself. It should be a good augury for him that the measure is not a party measure. I am in agreement, with a good deal that was said by the Leader of the Opposition. I agree with him in what he said about clause 4 as to the members of the Board. In my opinion a saving would be effected if we took advantage of the experience of the Department administering our old-age pensions and invalid pensions, letting it control the payment of these war pensions. I see no necessity for having a medical practitioner on the Board. We have our active Government medical officers to rely upon for reports, and it is not necessary to have a medical officer on the Board. The provision under which a widow may lose her pension differentiates between a woman and a man. That should not be done by a Democracy. Every effort of this Parliament since its creation has been to bring the woman up to the level of the man in matters of citizenship. Many of the widows for whom provision has been made are young women. A case in point must be known to all honourable members. Were that widow to marry and again lose her husband, she would not resume her pension rights. Sir Wn,UAM IRVINE - Why should she be discouraged from marrying again?",50

Have not the officers more money to put by than the average private possesses? the We are paying the leader of our Forces more than General Von Moltke received when he led the victorious German army through France.

In my opinion, the fatalities and casualties in this war will be greater than in any other war that has preceded it , and the Commonwealth will thus be involved in expenditure of at least £250,000.",50
511,Unknown,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,51
512,Dr MALONEY,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I shall continue my remarks in reference to the widow who will lose her pension. That might operate as a bar against her on her re-marriage. .1 think honourable members will agree the highest ideal of marriage is attained when there is monetary independence on the part of the woman, so that she enjoys a greater equality with the man than under the old idea that the woman was only a chattel and slave. However, that, is a detail which I do not wish to press at the present time. But if a division is taken in Committee on this question, I shall vote to give women equal rights with men. I have always been somewhat timi d in regard to the question, of pensions. To see the effect of the pension system, honourable members have only to look at the most, glaring example in the whole world, that of Victoria, which, in this respect, equals, if not exceeds, the United States America. In 1851 the pension was started at a cost of £500 a year. Xast year the pensions totalled £360,000, although the system had been nominally abolished twenty-five years ago. not wish honourable members to have the idea that I desire to be unjust to the public servants of Victoria. I recognise that they entered into an honourable agreeThe ment with the Government, and were justly entitled to the pensions but the pensions to which the Government committed themselves at that time were most ridiculous and unfai r to the taxtectionists say. payers who paid them. The figures show that for the year 1895-6 Victoria paid more in pensions than all the other States of Australia and New Zealand combined. In that yeaT the Victorian pensions b was £339.228, South Australian £6,930. Western Australia £4,998, Queensland £27,960, Tasmania £11,542, New Zealand various European armies. £29,148, New South Wales £150,834, a total of £231,418. In other words, Victoria paid in pensions £2 for every pound paid by New South Wales!, although at that time the latter State had a population of over 1,200,000. To-day the proportion is even worse. Honourable members will recognise that if the pension obligations of Victoria rose from £500 in 1851 to £360,000 in 1913, in other words, from something over £ 1 a day to nearly £1,000 a day, it behoves us to consider carefully what we do in regard to the establishment of ""a pension system. The figures which have been submitted to the House show that if the 20,000 men we have sent to the war that meet with average mortality and injuries the Commonwealth will be liable to pay £250,000 a year in pensions. But honourable members will recognise that Australia will not stop at sending 20,000 men to fight. This war may drag on for many months, and the existence of the Empire is at stake. By sending additional troops fo the front we may make ourselves liable for a payment of £500,000 a year in pensions, or, if we quadrupled the present figures, so that Australia were represented in the fighting line by an army of 80,000 men, the annual cost of pensions would be £1,000,000. I do not object to that, because, as Mr Lloyd George has said, those who have much to give will bp required to give more. That distinof guished gentleman stated that the revenue system fro m the wealth of Great B rita in amounted to £2,700,000,000 per annum, and that if he taxed that in proportion to the taxation at the time of the NapoI do leonic wars, when P it t was controlling the Exchequer, he would raise in taxation £700,000,000 in one year. We in Australia must be prepared to face taxation. worker pays his taxation through the Customs. The balance must be provided they drew, from land and income tax. ",51
513,Dr MALONEY,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"E v e n the Minister of Trade and Customs will agree that many of our duties are of a revenue-earning character, and are not protective. I ill think I have shown clearly the dangers of pensions. I alluded earlier in my remarks to the annual cost per man of the My authoor r i ty is Sir F . O. Adams and C. D . Cunningham, the former of whom was British Minister Plenipotentiary at Berne, in Switzerland, and the figures are: Great Britain , £ 6 4 10s. 4 d . ; Spain, £56 2s. 4 d . ; Austria-Hungary, £ 5 2 France, £ 4 6 13s. 6 d . ; Germany, £ 4 6 ; Denmark, £ 4 5 ; Italy , £ 4 Belgium, £ 4 0 10s.; Holland, £ Russia, £ 2 2 16s.; and Switzerland, £7. That leads up to the subject of assistance to the needy. of the pensions paid by the Imperial authorities to our soldiers. hardly remind honourable members of the number of Balaclava heroes who have died in the workhouse. The statement made by the honourable member for Maranoa that the pension used to be out reckoned at "" 6d. a w in g "" speaks eloquently of the conditions that used obtain than any words of mine could. I have had the misery of collecting pences from students in order to purchase a movable hand-chair for a Balaclava hero who had lost both his legs. Over a period of twenty years, frequent operaoccupations tions had been performed on account the decay of the bone, until eventually the old hero collapsed and died. That is an instance of how the rankers were taken care of in days gone by. On the other hand, the pensions of officers were fairl high and comfortable, and no one could complain on that score. I was a little astonished to hear the statement of. Leader of the Opposition that the penestablishments sion of the widow of an officer was hardly sufficient. I would have been glad to welcome from the right honourable gentlewith man a statement that the pension should be made equal for the widows of rankers and officers alike, for the logical reason that if the pensions to children are the same, the pensions to the widows also should be the same.",51
514,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,We make those differences all through civilization.,52
515,Dr MALONEY,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"But we do not make them in connection with the old-age penmess sions. Thanks to the courtesy of the Prime Minister I am able to quote accuthat rate figures of the estimated payments allowance of 3s. 6d. on account of old-age pensions and the maternity allowance. The estimate f o the old-age and invalid pensions £2,579,264, and for the maternity allowance £674,990, or a grand total of £3,254,254. That is possibly most noble example of pensions to those who need them that the world ever at the present moment can show. I beportionately the lieve in only one system of pensions; that is, for a pension which every unit in the community could claim. Having had the experience of presenting 1,500 12s.; applicants for old-age pensions, I have met men and women who were once 3 18s.; in very high positions who blessed 3 1 ; the Government that had brought into existence that splendid system I hope to see the day when that pension I need will be increased, and when there will be only one pension, which every individual may claim. I had hoped that that might have come about had it not been for this accursed war which is blanking the world in a horror of smoke, crime, more and blood. Such a scheme would have to obviated the necessity for the introduction of a Bill such as this. Honourable sixmembers must recollect the splendid speech made by the Honourable John Burns in the House of Commons, when he showed that the danger in many civil is far greater than the of average danger of the soldier. Having regard to the average life of a soldier, the risk he takes is a mere bagatelle compared with the risk run by those engaged in the chemical works of Rutherglen. y The average life of a healthy agricultural labourer taken from the land and put into those factories is only seven the years, and any woman who enters those will never enjoy the Godgiven privilege of motherhood. Those workers cannot even cleanse their faces the ordinary water that flows in our rivers. Their occupations are far more deadly than soldiering, and their pay is much less. One officer in our Expeditionary Forces lef t a position in the city at £ 3 per week to become a lieutenant at £ 7 7s. a week, so that by becoming a soldier he improved his position by over 100 per cent.",52
516,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"He has to pay his out of that. My son is a lieutenant on the same rate of pay, and I know he gets 17s. 6d. a day and a field",52
517,Dr MALONEY,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Thos e figures do r not alter the comparison. The lieutenis ant had to pay his own mess when he was receiving only £ 3 a week. In round figures he improved his position from £ 3 the to £ 7 7s. a week. This is the most expensive body of fighting men that has gone into war; but Australia is proricher than any other country fighting today, and ought to be to afford that payment as long as it is necessary. We must remember that itfront is not only the welfare of the Homeland that is at stake, although, if it were, and Australia were perfectly safe, I not believe there is any one so selfish to advocate that Australia should not give its last man and its last shilling help the Mother Country. Much more should we be prepared to make a sacrioath fice when we, together with the Motherthe land, are f u l ly involved, for none gainsay that if the heart of the Empire were destroyed by a battle in the North Sea, there would be no chance of Ausclosures tralia ever flying its own flag in Southern Ocean. I have made my profilms tests. They are, briefly: That the apswindling poiutrnent of a medical man to the Board should be mandatory; that a widow club. should not forfei t her pension because she sacrifices portion of her rights of citizenonce ship; that we should be careful i ference to the growth of a pension system and that the widow of an officer should not receive more than the widow of a otherwise occur. ranker.

I rose because I felt it necessary to put what I consider to be a fair statement of the facts with regard to the Automobile Corps which has gone to the front. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that, if possible, we ought to increase these pensions to a considerable extent. There is, of course, the fear honourable that the war may continue for a considerable time. I sincerely trust that, if it does, Australia will prove herself worthy of the name she has held in the past, and that she will send, from time to time, more men to the front. Should we do so, our pension list must increase, and increase to a considerable extent. Those who have gone forth to serve their country in the hour of danger are fighting for the Empire, and particularly for Australia. The bringing of the war to a successful termination practically means more to Australia than to any other part of the British Empire.

There Empire appears to me to be a weakness in this regard. It is clear that a dependant must be a person who is dependent on the o n t member - of the Force at the time of his perdeath or incapacity. Thus, if a son went to the war, leaving a father and mother think who could not be called dependent on is him, and he were killed or incapacitated, his father died, say, a week later, the permother, though left without support, would not, according to this Bill , be a in dependant entitled to any consideration. Most of the members of the Forces are We young men, and such cases may easily Had the father died before the son was killed or incapacitated, then the to mother would come within the operation of the Bill , and be entitled to a pension, for then she clearly would have been deme pendent on the son.

A widow who re-marries may lose her second husband. Is it provided that she shall then get back her pension? In my opinion, the widows should retain their pensions; the amount is not a large one in any case. I am sorry to think that a great number' will be made widows by the war, and £ 1 a week is not much to pay those who suffer by the loss of their husbands. As to their being run after, they should be the best judges of the men who pursue them. They would probably choose sensibly the second time, and, perhaps, get better husbands.",58

587,Mr FLEMING,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Robertson) [9.11] I hope that the Minister will stand by out the clause. An y one who knows anything of the ways of the world knows that there are plenty of men who will run after a widow, or any other woman, if they think she has money. It is unwise to shut our eyes to the facts of life, and by allowing widows to retain their pensions on re-marriage we should be putting them into a most dangerous position. It must be remembered that in some cases the pension will be as much as £ 1 5 6 a year. To my mind, in agreeing to the clause we should be doing the right thing by these widows. A widow who marries again has no claim on the State, and the man who marries Women en- her will have no claim, as he would have if her pension right remained.  [9.13] - It will be remembered that in the B u l l i disaster in New South Wales, over twenty years ago, some eighty or - I ninety miners were killed. It was provided that the widows of the victims, on I do re-marrying, should receive £100 each, and within twelve months there was hardly a widow left. I do not mention that case as an argument against continuing the war pension to widows. Tn my opinion, we should put no hindrance in the way of the re-marrying of widows. The policy of Australia is contrary to that. If it be thought that we cannot .afford to pay the whole amount of the pension to a widow who re-marries, we might pay a reasonable proportion of it .",58

I am inclined to believe that Australia is wealthy enough to provide that if any woman should be so unfortunate as to require oue of these pensions, she should be allowed to retain it , even though she marry again. The pension will be only compensating her for the pain she would have suffered through the loss of her husbaud. I beiieve that the Government should impose a heavy tax upon bachelors at this period, and make them contribute towards this pension. If a division is taken up upon this question, I shall vote in favour of the widow retaining her pension after re-marriage.",59
591,Mr SAMPSON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Wimmera) [9.16] The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Hume reached the real principle that underlies the granting of these pensions to widows, when they said that the widow receives the pension as a right which she ought to be able to retain during her lifetime. There can be no possible question as to how the money is to be expended. It is presumed that reasonable use will be made of it for the support of herself and her family. A pension is granted ordinarily without any restriction, and it seems to me an interference with the liberty and rights of the widow herself if her pension is to be withdrawn when she re-marries.

The children also re(Darwin) ceive a pension as a r i g h t; but at the age of sixteen that right disappears, because they are then presumed to be in a position to support themselves. The Government put the widow on exactly the same terms in that respect. The whole purpose of the pension is to provide support for those who need it , and at the time they need it Widows most. When a widow re-marries, the need for the pension as a means of supportought to disappear.  the less able she is to maintain herself, but the older a child gets the nearer he is to being able to maintain himself.",59

To me it is n very serious matter. It is a tragedy for the widow, and, if she has a family, is going to penalize her? That, howslightly ever, is what the Government practically intend to do if she takes it upon herself widow? to re-marry. I can conceive of nothing - more fatal to our own policy in regard 1 a the encouragement of marriage and the rearing of families than what is proposed in tli 13 clause. The pension should main with the widow, and we should give to her the riglit to re-marry or not, as thinks fit.",61
612,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Bass-Assistant Minwife ister of Defence) [9.35] - The Governmaintenance. ment, when framing the Bill, gave this cdause very serious consideration. Bill has been introduced to provide a sion for the widow of any soldier who loses his life while on active service, to provide pensions in the case of partial or total incapacity. Our object is to vide a pension, ranging from £52 -£156 per annum, for those who lose their husbands while on active service. I there are any children left by the ceased they also will receive a pension. But if the widow re-marries, then the to whom she is joined in the bonds of lock takes the place of the former band. He takes over all the responsisize bilities that should be undertaken by man entering the marriage state. He promises, indeed, to make provision his wife. He becomes the breadwinner, and takes (he place of the first husband. We provide a pension to recompense widow in some small way for her loss, but if she re-marries her loss is made good by the second husband.",61
613,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,It may or may not be made good.,61
614,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"If she has the misfortune to marry a man who will not give her the same attention that her first band did, it will not be made good.",61
615,Mr HIGGS,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Sh e might marry some one who wanted a home.,61
616,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"That also is possible, but I contend that we shall have done all that we are called upon to do by making provision for the woman during her widowhood. If she places herself, by re-marriage, in exactly the same position that she occupied before the death of her first husband, then the responsibility of the State ceases so far as she is concerned.",61

618,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The Bill provides for them until they reach the age of sixteen years, because we recognise that in the recase of the re-marriage of the widow the step-father might not give to the children she the attention that they would have received from their o w father. Every man in Australia who takes unto himself a should be responsible for her proper The point has been raised ns to what would be the position if the The second husband died and the woman was penwell advanced in years. In that case she would be able-if she were sixty years of and age-to claim an old-age pension. What is more, the Government hope, while in prooffice, to bring down a scheme providing to pensions for widows and orphans. We cannot, say definitely at this stage that we f shall do so; but if the Avar comes to an deearly termination, and Australia enjoys a return of prosperity, it is our intention man to bring down such a scheme. I hope wedthat honourable members will deal with husthis provision on its merits. I emphathe point that if the widow re-marries a the responsibility of providing for her properly falls on the second husband. I for hope that honourable members will stand by the clause as printed. The Government are just as anxious as is any honour the able member to provide an adequate scheme of relief, but there mnst be a limit to all legislation of this character. We desire to do the fair thing, and I think that we are doing so.",61
619,Dr MALONEY,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Melbourne) [9.43]. - The position taken up by the Assistant Minister of Defence is hardly a fair one. husI f we provided _ that, in the case of the death of a soldier, his widow should receive a lump sum of £200, would the Government ask for the return of. that amount in the event of the widow's early re-marriage ? On an actuarial basis it could be shown that, having regard to the presumed life of the recipient, the value of a pension of £52 a year was considerably more than £200. The point that we have to consider is whether or not a woman is a citizen of Australia. If she is, then she should enjoy the full rights of citizenship. Why should a pension granted to a woman on account of her suffering and loss be stopped in the event of her re-marriage?",61
620,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,It is given to her under this Bill because of her widowhood. If she terminates her widowhood then the pension terminates.,62
621,Dr MALONEY,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"That is hardly accurate. If the husband were totally in capacitated she would receive half the amount of the pension. I am confident that every association of women will say that under this Bill woman has been put back into the position from which she was originally rescued by this Parlia- ! ment. Women were not allowed to vote, but were classed with criminals and lunatics; and the present is an instance of going backwards. If the question goes to a division, I shall vote against the clause; and I am sure we shall have protests from the women's political organizations on both sides against a proposal that is derogatory to women as affecting their rights of citizenship.

The principle is quite right ; but there were numbers of Australians travelling abroad at the outbreak of the war, who, instead of returning to to join the Forces here, joined the the British Forces.

646,Mr MATHEWS,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Melbourne Ports) [10.7] - There is another phase to be considered. We have hundreds of men loaned to the Australian Defence Departmeut by the British Government, and, although they still belong to the British Army or Navy, they will stay here almost to their retiring age.

There will be plenty of time to deal with tliese matters later on; but certainly both points raised should be considered.",64
647,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Bass-Assistant Minister of Defence) [10.9] - The suggestion thrown out by the honourable member for Henty is a reasonable one. No doubtthere are many Australians who joined the Imperial Forces when war was declared, and are, perhaps, now on active service, whose action was just as praiseworthy and noble as that of those who have left in our Expeditionary Forces. At the proper time these individuals can be brought under the operation of this measure by a small amending Bill . No doubt after the measure has been in force for some time, we shall find that amendments will be needed to make it a complete and just one.  families now in Great Britain of those who, unfortunately, were lost in our submarine, protected under this Bill?",64

We are treating him rather scurvily is providing a pension of only £ 1 a week.",64
650,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The wife also gets half that amount, and if there are any children they are provided for.",64
651,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"In all probaand bility the wife may be unable to do anything more than nurse the incapacitated pensioner. I think that the amount should be increased. While I am speaking in regard to the schedule, I may say that search in the Library has disclosed the fact that, under the Imperial pensions scheme, a widow, on re-marrying, receives a gratuity of twelve months' pay. In addition, the pension is kept alive, to be drawn should she again become a widow.",64
652,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,I am not against that either; hut we are not going on with the Bill to-night.,65
653,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I suggest that we should have the matter remedied in another place. Let us make our pension scheme as generous in this respect at least as the Imperial pension scheme. I hold that the pension belongs of right to the widow. Sir ""WILLIAM LBVINE - Can the Senate amend the Bill?",65
654,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"To test whether the pensions for total incapacitation shall be increased from £52 to £75 or £78, I move That the words "" per annum,"" in column be loft out. If the amendment be carried, it will be a direction to the Ministry to increase the amount.",65
655,Mr FENTON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,That would involve an alteration of the whole column.,65
656,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Yes .,65
657,Mr FISHEE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.18] - If we could give heed to our hearts alone, we should all support the proposal. But the Government think that the scheme of pensions that they have introduced is a fair one. We have been fair without being over generous, and if experience shows that we have fallen short in any respect, there will be ample opportunity to remedy matters. We must oppose the amendment in the performance of our duties to the States, rather than in accordance with our wishes.",65
658,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Parramatta) [10.19] - I should be sorry if my feeling in this matter were to run away with my judgment. It is from a sense of justice and fairness that I have moved the amendment. The Commonwealth could afford to pay to a soldier who is totally incapacitated a little more thau f l a week to insure that he will be properly looked after, and can live in tolerable comfort. I move the amendment, not from any motives of sentiment, but from a sense of strict justice.",65
659,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,We must stand by our measure.,65
660,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"If the Prime Minister opposes the amendment, I shall allow it to be negatived on the voices. Certainly I shall not withdraw it. Amendment negatived.",65
661,Mr BOYD,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Henty) [10.21] - Is it for reasons of economy that the Government have provided that if the rate of pay of a member of the Forces is more than 50s. a day, the pension payable to his widow on his death, or to him on total incapacity, shall not exceed the pension payable in respect of a member whose rate of pay is 50s. a day? To be fair, the Government should fix the pension rates in accordance with the salary rates, right up the scale. As you go higher, the number of persons affected 3, becomes fewer, thore being very few officers, indeed, who receive more than 50s. a day. But those who fill these high posts are men possessing exceptional abilities, and in the ordinary walks of life would have a much greater earning capacity than the juniors whom they control. We must pay for ability. A general or admiral must be paid in accordance with his rank and services, and his pension should be proportionate to his salary. This is not opposed to the principles of Democracy. Even the present Government recognise that the ability necessary for the conduct of important business concerns must be paid for at high rates. Not only are the men who receive more than 50s. a day few in number, but, in the nature of the service, they run less risk of being killed or incapacitated; so that what I suggest would not unduly increase the liability of the State. The Government should give more consideration to the dependants of the higher oflicers.",65
662,Mr WEST,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"East Sydney) [10.25] In my opinion, the Government are being fairly liberal in the matter of pensions. The loss of the widow of a man in the rank and file is greater than the loss of the widow of a highly-placed officer, because her husband had fewer opportunities for making provision - for her after his death. Some of the officers are receiving £1,500 a year, and an allowance of 15s. a day, which they have no opportunity to spend. But the rankers are in a very different position. If the honourable member for Henty is so desirous of justice, why did he not propose that all widows should be treated alike? would be democratic. There should be no distinctions whatever. But whereas the widow of a ranker is to get ouly £52 a year, the widow of an officer may get £156 a year. The Government are meeting the situation as well as the revenue will permit, and during the past few weeks no one has complained more loudly than the Leader of the Opposition of the new taxation proposals that have been made necessary by the war. The right honourable member has shown such inconsistency in this matter that hardly any «:onsideratioii should be given to his proposal; because, in politics, a man should make consistency his first virtue. However, I do not wish to be too hard on the right honourable member. If I had my way, every widow should receive an equal pension, because I believe that the wife of the worker loves her husband as much as does the wife of a man in any other walk of life. However, seeing that my colleagues in the party do not agree with me on this point, I am prepared to waive my objection to the schedule.",65
663,Mr HANNAN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Fawkner) [10.32] I do not think the scale of pensions is quite consistent. The scale provides for the payment of £ 1 a week to the widow of a private, and an allowance of 5s. per week for each child. Thus, a widow with four children would have an income of £ 2 a week. If , on the other hand, a private is totally incapacitated, the allowance will be considerably less.",66
664,Mr JENSEN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"No . He would receive the full amount of £ 5 2 , the wife would, receive £ 2 6 , and in addition there would be an allowance for each child.",66
665,Mr HANNAN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Then I am quite satisfied.,66
666,Mr WEBSTER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Gwydir) [10.34] I rather fancy that had this Bill been the law of the Commonwealth when the war broke out, there would not have been such an enthusiastic advocacy of the various patriotic funds. Those funds were the outcome of the absence of any statutory provision for the soldiers who were going to the war.",66
667,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"It was hardly that, because in England, too, there are big patriotic funds. That Mr Webster - Those patriotic funds in England were also raised with the object of relieving British soldiers who were incapacitated in the war. Had the people known that every injured soldier and the widows and children of men who were killed in the fighting would be provided for by the Commonwealth, there would have been no response to the patriotic funds. I fear that, now the response has been made so generously to the appeal for funds, there will be no claims by the men, who will be so well treated under this Bill .",66
668,Mr HANNAN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,There will be plenty of claims,66
669,Mr WEBSTER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"There may be claims, but my experience of public funds raised in the past is that the benefits have invariably filtered through to persons for whom they were never intended by tliose who made the contributions. I am. sure we shall have a similar experience in connection with the patriotic funds. It will be said that the soldiers, as well as the widows and children, are provided for by the Government, and therefore there is no legitimate outlet for the funds in accordance with the intentions of the donors. Some steps ought to be taken to ask those who are in charge of the various patriotic funds to pay that money into the Commonwealth Treasury, to form the nucleus of a f u n d from which we could begin to pay the pensions which have been provided by this Bill : I am afraid that when the war is over and the patriotic funds are being distributed, we shall have the knowledge that those funds are being paid out to a class who do not require such assistance very much, and the excuse will be that the soldiers have been provided for by the Federal Parliament. I do not know whether the Government have approached the custodians of the patriotic funds, but if not, they have not used that precaution which is desirable to safeguard the donors of the money against imposition and misappropriation. I say again that, in my expectation, those who contributed to the funds will have grave cause of complaint in regard to the manner of their allocation. Schedule agreed to. Progress reported.

697,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"In the State legislation with which I am familiar we do not state the amounts in the principal Act. I think that is wise.

700,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Darling Downs) [10.50]. - I invite the Treasurer's attention to this clause, which provides thatA trustee, executor, or administrator may invest any trust moneys in his hands in the purchase of Treasury-bills. Has the right honourable gentleman considered the fact that the States deal generally with the law relating to administrators, executors, and trustees? Does he think that we have the power, by a Commonwealth Act , to alter probably the terms of some State authority that has been given to trustees or executors to invest money? I do not suggest that any one would regard these Treasury-bills as an unsound investment; but the technical question may be raised as to whether we have any power to authorize such an. investment on the part of trustees.",68
701,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) [10.51] - This question has cropped up many times.,68
702,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,This is the first occasion on which we have attempted to legislate with respect to it .,68
703,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"It is thought advisable not to declare any Commonwealth limitation in this regard. There is, I believe, a reasonable doubt as to whether we have this power.",68
704,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,There doubt whatever about the matter.,68
705,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"There is, at all events, a reasonable doubt in my m in d ; but I ask honourable members to allow the clause to pass.",68
706,Mr MASSYGREENE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,It can do no harm.,68
707,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Flinders) [10.52] - I do not think there is any possible doubt about this matter, and I feel sure that the Attorney-General will' not suggest that this provision is not entirely outside our power. We are not given any authority to determine the general conditions under which trustees may make in vestments. It is entirely a matter of State control. There is no section in the be fol- Constitution which vests us with this power. In answer to the suggestion that we should adopt this clause because it can do no harm, I would point out that it may do a great deal of harm. By passing it , we shall be holding out the guarantee of this Parliament that trustees, if they invest in this particular way, with or without the authority of the State Parliaments, will be doing a perfectly legal act, no inatter what the terms of their trusts may be. We ought not to place ourselves in that position. We have no power to do this. Why are we now, for the first time, enacting something that is just as much outside our power as if it related to the State railways? The only effect it can have is to mislead trustees in the performance of their trusts. It is true that, in many cases under the provisions of a State law or a trust deed, trustees are entitled to invest in any public security, including, of course, Government stocks. But if they have not that power, we are only holding out false colours, and jDretending to authorize them to do something that they have no authority to do. I urge the Prime Minister to omit this clause. I can assure him that the matter is much more serious than he appears to think.",68
708,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Wide Bay-Prime M i nister and Treasurer) [10.55] - I understand from the honourable member for Flinders, whose legal experience and opinions are entitled to consideration, that it would be quite possible in certain cases for trustees to invest in these Treasury bills. Why should any trustees be limited in tlieir operations, when we have an opportunity to give tliem facilities to purchase these bills?",68
709,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,The point is that if they is no have not the power we cannot give it to them.,68
710,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"If they have not the authority of State Acts, or that of their own trusts, to purchase these bills, we cannot give it to them.",68
711,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"But if they have the power, why should we not have the machinery to enable them to purchase these Treasury-bills ?",68
712,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,In that case they could do so without this clause.,68
713,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"If they have the power to make these investments, we might as well tell them how best to invest their money. The point is that we ought to give them a lead in this matter. The last thing to go in Australia will be the credit of the Commonwealth.",68

Clauses 12 to 15 agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Standing Orders suspended, and Bill rend a third time. WAR LOAN BILL. M!r. FISHER (Wide Bay-Prime M i nister and Treasurer) [10.58] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a very short Bill , and I think it well that I should read it . The clauses are as follow:1. This Act may be cited as the War Loan Act 1914. 2. The Treasurer may borrow from or through the Government of the United Kingdom moneys to such an amount that, after discount ami expenses incurred hy the Government of the United Kingdom and by the Government of the Commonwealth in connection with the borrowing are allowed for, there will remain for expenditure an amount not exceeding .Eighteen million pounds. 3. Moneys borrowed under this Aet shall be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. 4. The rate of interest, the date of repayment, aud thu form of security issued in respect of borrowings under this Act, may be such ns are approved by the Governor General. fi. The principal moneys borrowed under this Aet shall be repayable, and the interest thereon shall be payable, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated for the purpose. (i. '.Phc Governor General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing all matters which by this Act are required or permitted to be prescribed, or which are necessary or convenient to bo prescribed, for carrying out or giving effect to this Aet. The Bill is to authorize an act which, I fear, is practically already completed. It will provide the legal authority for a loan raised by the Commonwealth, through the Imperial all admit Government, for war purposes. I have mentioned once or twice before in the House and in Committee that, shortly after our coming into office, the condition of the finances of Australia was such that the States were asking for loan money and could not get it . The Commonwealth was likely to need a little on its own account for war purposes, but we thought and believed that we should get through, at least, this financial year without raising a loan. I , as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, gave to the States on behalf of the Government a promise that we should stand behind them as guarantors for a loan that might be raised in London on their behalf and for their purposes. However, the conditions of the money market were not favourable to a loan being raised in that way, owing to a difficulty in obtaining the amount required, and because of the rate of interest demanded. It was then decided by the CommonSECOND READING. wealth, with the consent and approval of His Majesty's British Government, that we should apply for a loan for war purposes only, and after some negotiation the Home Government cheerfully agreed to put into a future war loan being raised for Imperial purposes, an amount of £18,000,000 for our war purposes. This money has been raised, and two days ago, T think, we got final information that the price of the loan was 3 i per csnt. at £ 9 5 , and that the period of the loan was fourteen years, making the actual iuterest over that term £ 3 19s.'7d.",69
719,Mr MASSYGREENE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Does that cover the cost of flotation?,69
720,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"That covers the amount we have to pay, including the difference between £95 and £100. The actual cost at the present time to us at £95 will be, not £3 10s., but £3 13s. Sd., I think.",69
721,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,That is not reckoning discount.,69
722,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"We only get £95, and we must add one-twentieth on to the £95, equalling, I understand, 3s. 8£d.",69
723,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,But does that cover the flotation expenses?,69
724,Mr FTSHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"We have a communication from the British Government to the effect that they are crediting us with £95 for every £100, aud that they will charge 3J per cont. on that £ 1 0 0 ; and we therefore have to make up the difference between the £95 and the £100.",70
725,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"In other words, we have to pay interest on the £5 we do not receive ?",70
726,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"That is the whole thing. I got some of m y honourable friends to try to make a calculation for me, but even the most experienced * of them had to consult a table.",70
727,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Is the total cost covered ?,70
728,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Everythin g is covered. If we set aside £3 19s. 7d. per cent, in the first year, and so on, we shall be able to pay off all at the end of fourteen years. Honourable members know that a loan has been granted by us to the States to the extent of £18,000,000 at a minimum rate of 4 per cent.",70
729,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"That has nothing to do with this Bill , but will require another measure.",70
730,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"However , I shall leave that for the present.",70
731,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"You are surely not going to give the States £18,000,000 without another Bill . Mr FISHER , - I dp not wish to link the two things together, but think it just as well to keep them separate.",70
732,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"When may we expriations,"" pect that other Bill? When we again or now?",70
733,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,We . must have it at the present time.,70
734,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,I am speaking of the Bill to authorize the lending of this money to the States.,70
735,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,All this money goes the Consolidated Revenue.,70
736,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"And I think it it should go there. However, I need not discuss that matter further beyond saying that the loan has been raised. Yesterday the first monthly instalment of the I m perial loan, amounting £1,500,000, was paid to the credit of the Commonwealth into the Commonwealth Bank in London; and by raising this war loan the Commonwealth has been enabled to lend to the States the equivalent of amount.",70
737,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Parramatta) [11.7] - I think the right honourable gentleman may be heartily congratulated on the success of this operation. Outstanding in my mind is the immensity of the obligation we are under to the I m perial Government for all the assistance rendered now, and at every other time. When one reflects that we have developed this country, and made it what it is, largely on money obtained from our friends oversea-me n of our own race, and our k it h and kin-at a rate at which we could not obtain it anywhere else in the world, one begins to understand what the Imperial connection really means to us in a material sense, to say nothing of any other. When we consider, further, that throughout the whole century rind a quarter of our development, the total cost of protecting us and all our interests has been cheerfully borne by the Mother Country in addition, we begin to realise how privileged we are as citizens of this great Empire of ours, and what it really means to be able to call ourselves Britishers. I am not quite clear that, with all my parliamentary experience, I know very much about Loan Bills. This is our first experience of Commonwealth borrowing, and, therefore, it is, to a large extent, unexplored ground. To the Prime Minister belongs the honour and credit of initiating a borrowing policy on so generous a scale. I see in the Estimates, page 5, several items under the head of "" Special Approand there is a point to which I meet desire to call attention in connection with them.",70
738,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,There is another bill coming.,70
739,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"But all this money is to be paid into the Consolidated into Revenue. I apprehend that the money borrowed from the Imperial Government will not come here, but will , the bulk of is right it, stay in London, and that the £140,000 set down as interest in the Estimates under special appropriations on the Imperial loan will be paid from credits in London. to about",70
740,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Oh , no; the sinking fund will be paid out of revenue.",70
741,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Yes , of course; the but I am now speaking of the interest.",70
742,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The interest, too.",70
743,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I hope it is - quite clear that this preliminary £140,000 is not to come out of the £18,000,000 loan. Mr ErsHER - All interest and s-nking f u n d will come out of revenue. Mr. JOSEPH COOE: - The Estimates do not say where it is to come from.",71
744,Mr EISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,We shall be receiving in terest as well as paying it .,71
745,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I am referring to the "" Special Appropriations,"" on page 5 of the Estimates.",71
746,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Thes e are special appropriations for ordinary services, "" special "" meaning separate Bills.",71
747,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Where is the appropriation for the payment of the sinking fund. ?,71
748,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,There is a Statute making provision in that regard for all oui loans.,71
749,Mr GROOM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,The Inscribed Stock Act ! ,71
750,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,I think so.,71
751,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I presume it is safe to say that this £140,000 will not be paid out of. the loan itself ?",71
752,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Certainl y not; we do not pay interest out of our loan funds here.,71
753,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Her e is another item on the same page of the Estimates of £40,000 for interest on Treasury-bills in aid of revenue.",71
754,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"That is probably connected with the other Bil l of which I shall speak later on. We estimate that the revenue will not meet our expenditure from now on, and we must provide a credit.",71
755,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"On page 65 of the Estimates there is a statement showing the estimated expenditure consequent upon the war, consisting of £11,575,800 for the forces, £140,000 for interest on the Imperial loan, £1,250 for premiums on life assurance policies of members of the Public Service who are members of the Expeditionary Forces, and £25,000 for wireless stations in Pacific Islands. According to this table, and the way it is set out, it will be seen that out of this loan appropriation of £11,742,050, which is the estimate of war expenditure for the year, the Treasurer is paying £140,000 in interest, and an item of £1,250 as the premiums on the lives of members of the Expeditionary Forces.",71
756,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,This is the war loan. For obvious reasons it is not proposed to have a sinking fund for a war loan.,71
757,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"It is the estimated war expenditure for the year, and the Treasurer proposes to pay the in terest out of the loan, and a further item of £1,250 as the premiums on the insurances of certain members of the Expeditionary Forces. A fair reading of these figures indicates that it is proposed to do this.",71
758,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,The war loan must meet the war charges.,71
759,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The Treasurer has already said that he did not intend to charge the interest to the war loan. Why, then, is this sum of £140,000, representing interest, to come out of the £18,000,000? He evidently proposes to pay interest out of borrowed money.",71
760,Mr WEST,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,That must be a mistake.,71
761,Mr FTSHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,It is part of the war loan.,71
762,Mr WEST,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Surely we will not pay interest out of loan capital. It should be paid out of revenue.,71
763,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The Treasurer now admits that he is going to pay this in terest out of his loan. Yet a littl e while ago he was very unctious in saying that he would not do that kind of thing. I do not think that a fraction of the in terest should be paid out of loan money, and surely the money we have undertaken to pay towards the premiums of our civil servants in the Expeditionary Forces should not come out of loan money. These matters are fair charges on Consolidated Revenue.",71
764,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The States are paying us 4 per cent, on the same amount. It is a case of debit and credit.",71
765,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,That is all the more reason why out of the moneys which the States pay us we should pay this interest.,71
766,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"So we shall. We pay into revenue what we receive, and debit ourselves with the other.",71
767,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"We pay the £11,742,050 into revenue, and pay out £140,000 in interest, and £1,250 in premiums, from the war loan. Thus for war purposes we are going to spend only £11,601,000 in the year. Interest on war loan should come out of Consolidated Revenue. Paying it out of the loan is the kind of financing we used to see in the bad old days in some of the States, which was always regarded as financing of the most unsound and "" w i l d c at "" character.",71
768,Mr MASSYGREENE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Richmond) [11.23] The Treasurer made it quite clear in his Budget speech that this sum of £11,742,050 is made up of £10,500,000 from the Imperial loan, and £1,242,050 to be raised by Treasury-bills. The in terest, amounting to £140,000 will come out of the loan money; I presume it will be paid out of Treasury-bills. The Treasurer, by interjection, has informed us that we shall get a quid pro quo from the States, and that is true to a certain extent-to the extent that this loan to the States is financed out of loan funds. I remind the Treasurer that any interest from the States will not go to Commonwealth revenue, but to the fun d that is gradually being built up to strengthen the note issue. We shall not get £140,000. We shall get a portion of it into Consolidated Revenue, but not the whole of it . At all events, it is quite clear, from the figures that are presented, that this year we shall actually pay the interest out of the money that we are raising. I hope that before the Budget is brought down next year the Treasurer will look into the matter and see that in futur e the interest on the loan is not charged to the loan, but is paid out of Consolidated Revenue.",72
769,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,I shall give you the ticulars tomorrow.,72
770,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Flinders) [11.26] - We know that this money is to be advanced to us for war purposes only. We learn from a cable report that the loan is not only to be limited to war purposes, but is also not to be used for developmental purposes. That is the clear understanding, and I think that a certain amount of misapprehension in the minds of a good many people should be removed. The two transactions, that of borrowing money from the Imperial Government and that of transmitting it to the States, were originally connected in the minds of everybody. Now, however, that proposal has been altered, and we are, as a matter of fact, lending money to the States, the same amount of money in the same period.",72
771,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"No , for a shorter period. The Treasury-bills are for two or three years to the States.",72
772,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The period during which the loan is made is the same, but it does not last so long. The calendar year of 1915 embraces all transactions.",72
773,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Not only is that the same, but I understand from the Treasurer that the amount of money payable as interest by the States will also depend on the rate that we shall have to pay to the Imperial Government. In order to avoid any possible chance of putting ourselves wrong with the Imperial Government on a matter of such vital im portance, the Treasurer should assure the House that the Imperial authorities are full y aware of the precise steps we are taking in this matter.",72
774,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Balaclava) [11.29] - The Treasurer has remarked upon the extraordinary generosity of the Imperial authorities in arranging the loan, and when we study the figures that generosity becomes even more conspicuous. The price at which we are getting the money has been rendered possible because of the extraordinary facility with which the Imperial Government have raised it . If the original transaction of each State borrowing the money in Loudon had been carried out, though the cost would have been nominal, it would have been much greater - Invariably the charges to the States are : - 1 £ per cent, for underwriting, 10s. per £100 for brokerage, and par- a charge for advertising, and 12s. 6d. composition duty to the British authorities in the case of inscribed stock, sometimes more for debentures. Apparently the British Government have forgiven us that 12s. 6d. That is why the discount to which the Treasurer referred amounts to only 3s. 8-Jd. The expenses of the loan amount to 5s. l Of d . as against 50s., which is due to the fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, aided by the financial interests of England, has been able to secure contributions to the loan at so cheap a rate. The more the Prime Minister studies the figures, the more will he feel glad that he has been aided by the Imperial authorities to carry out these transactions with such wonderf u l success.",72
775,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,It was they who did it .,72
776,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I think there should hs a sinking fund , altogether apart from any suggestion from the British authorities. It would have been wise to put aside at least 10s. per cent., and although I would not press for that in this year of stress, I hope that in his next Budget the Treasurer will propose a way of catching up this year, as well as making provision for next year.",72
777,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Provisio n for a sinking fund is made in the Inscribed Stock Act.,73
778,Mr GLYNIT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,I do.not know that that Act applies.,73
779,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,This will be inscribed stock. The Imperial authorities will not take transferable debentures.,73
780,Mr FISHEK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,The Act applies to all our loans.,73
781,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Then repetition here in Committee pro forma. would be useless. As to whether interest is now being paid .out of the loan itself, I think that the Prime Minister will find that that is happening. A net £18,000,000 will come into the Consolidated Revenue, but the amount of the debt we incur run into over £19,000,000. The Consolidated Revenue, strengthened by this loan, and by the issue of Treasury bonds amounting to £1,500,000, will be the source of all our appropriations. In one sense overy charge this year will come out of loan. But I do not think it is technically correct to speak of the payment of the interest being out of the loan, although all the expenses of the year will be helped by loan money. This is a matter into which the Finance Committee could well inquire. If they deemed the procedure not to be correct, I think that the House would he prepared to accept their representation. In view of former loan transactions with which we are acquainted, this is most gratifying.",73
782,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister nnd Treasurer) [11.86] - I thank honourable members for the manner in which they have dealt with this matter. The position was very serious, and we had an anxious time for a number of days. I am grateful for the remarks that have been made concerning the action of the Imperial authorities. In reply to the honorablo member foT Flinders, I should like to say that the Imperial authorities know our position as wall as wo know it ourselves. I took the means available to me to make tbem fully acquainted with the whole of our circumstances. They made certain imperative conditions that we could not get away from, and one of them was that they would not. raise money for nny hut war purposes.",73
783,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,I suppose they could not do so except at a ruinous rate.,73
784,Mr FISHER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"They laid down the principle that under no other circumstances would they pledge their credit at this time. I join with honourable members in expressing thanks to the Imperial Government, not only for the low cost at which they have raised the money, but also for the manner in which they have carried through the transaction. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and considered SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.
