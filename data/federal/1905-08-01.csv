Mr MCDONALD presented five petitions from certain residents of Cloncurry, praying that stringent legislation be enacted to prevent the importation of opium for smoking purposes into the Commonwealth. Mr FOWLER presented a petition from the Western Australian Chamber of Manufactures, protesting against the provision in the Trades Marks Bill for legalizing the use of union labels. Petitions received. BURSTING OF MILITAR Y RIFLES.  senting the Minister of Defence, without notice:«. Is it true, as reported in the press, that several military rifles have burst? 2. If . so , what is the cause? 3. Who are making the cartridges? 4. What inspection have they undergone ?5. What is proposed in future to prevent these accidents ?",12
1,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The following are the replies to the questions of which the honourable member gave notice to the Prime Minister :i . Five rifles are reported by the Commandant, New South Wales, to have burst within the last few weeks. 3. A Military Board is inquiring into the cause, but all the damaged rifles have not yet been received for inspection. 3. The Colonial Ammunition Company. 4.. Until the Board has taken evidence it cannot be stated what particular ammunition was being used when the rifles burst; but all nition obtained from the Colonial Ammunition Company is inspected by the Inspector of Ordnance and Ammunition, in Victoria, before it is shipped to other States. 5. Until a report has been received from the Board as to the cause of the accidents, no action can be taken in this direction. I also.desire to say that the fullest information, will be given to honourable members later on. NA HARVESTERS.",13
2,Mr JOHNSON,INCREASED DUTY ON,"I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs when the papers relating to the increased duties levied on harvesters will, as promised, be laid upon the Library table. They were not available up till within a short time before the House met. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - They will be laid on the table tomorrow. PACIFIC CBE CONFERENCE.",13
3,Mr KNOX,INCREASED DUTY ON,"I desire to ask the Prime have Minister whether he is in possession of fuller information than appeared in the follows:press yesterday with regard to the result of the Pacific Cable Conference, which comforms menced its sittings in London on 22nd changes June last?",13
4,Mr DEAKIN,INCREASED DUTY ON,"I am not yet in possesstructions sion of fuller information. We were not informed of the meeting of the Conference, although previous notice had been the date upon which it would assemble. Unless a report of what transpired comes to hand within the next day or two, I pose to communicate with London with a view to obtaining particulars. NA",13
5,Mr DEAKIN,TRADE WITHTHE MARSHALL,"I desire to make communication to the House upon a matter of considerable, importance to this country, and of great interest to honourable members. available. The following cablegram with reference to the .Marshall Islands dispute has been received by His Excellency the Governor General from the Secretary of State for the Colonies :- Referring to your telegram of 22nd July, note received from German Government couched in conciliatory tone, main points as follow :Acquisition of land from natives in Marshall Islands forbidden since 2888 to all persons, including Jaluit Company. Action of Governor in sanctioning lease of land to company was illegal, ammu- and has been declared void. For the present only land that can be bought or leased consists of those areas which, before German occupation, belonged to non^native owners. German Government, however, intend to extend conditions as to acquisition of native land by permitting leases of land for trading stations, so that Burns, Philp, will find it much easier to establish domicile; at the same time, instructions will be sent to Caroline Islands to grant Burns, Philp permission to lease land for trading .stations, but owing to difficulty of communication between Germany and South Sea protectorates, firm must wait for permission till October. German Government, while maintaining that action in Mar-' shall Islands has not infringed Declaration of 1886, further state that they are now occupied in revision of fiscal legislation for Marshall Islands, in which guiding principle will be communicated Burns, Philp through German Consul General at Sydney. Trust your Ministers will agree. German note seems to afford prospect of settling questions at issue with regard to future trading in Islands. Despatch follows by mail. I may say that I have taken the liberty of suggesting a speedy method by which the agents of the Jaluit Company can be reached, in order that trading rights may be granted at the earliest possible date. I . since received a telegram from Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, Sydney, as Acting Consul-General Germany definitely in press has received official information that desired by Australia in Marshall Islands will be given effect to by October 1st, and in that effect now on way to Jaluit. This is satisfactory, we presume settlement claim compensation will follow is due course. given of REPORT OF TARIF F COMMISSION.",13
6,Mr MAUGER,TRADE WITHTHE MARSHALL,"I should like to know from the Prime Minister when the report of prothe Tariff Commission, and the accompanying evidence, will be made available to honourable members?",13
7,Mr DEAKIN,TRADE WITHTHE MARSHALL,"The report has already been published in extenso in the press, and ISLANDS. a copy has been laid upon the table of this a House. The evidence is contained in three or four bulky volumes. I shall inquire qf the Government Printer when copies will be NA",13
8,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether he will lay upon the table of the House the contract which has been entered into between the Government and the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand for the conveyance of mails between Tasmania and the mainland ?,14
9,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,I have no objection to doing so. LAPSE DBILLS : PRIVILEGE .,14
10,Mr ROBINSON,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN," I . desire to bring under the notice of the House a question affecting its privileges. I refer to the interpretation which may be placed upon two standing orders passed by this Chamber upon the last day of the last session namely, standing orders 214A and 21413, which read: 214A. If , in any session, the proceedings ou any Bill shall have been interrupted by the prorogation of Parliament, the House may, in the next succeeding session, by resolution, order such proceedings to be resumed at the stage to which the Bill had been advanced in the previous session, provided a periodical election for the House has not taken place between such two sessions. 2(411. Any such Bill may be sent to the Seriate as if it had been introduced and passed by the House in the second session. Now it is possible, I believe, under these standing orders for the other Chamber to restore to its business-paper Money Bills in such a way as to seriously limit the privileges and powers of this House in regard to its control of public expenditure. For instance, a Bill appropriating public money might pass this House and be transmitted to another place and. not be finally disposed of in the one session. Then in the next session an attempt might be made- I do not wish to refer to a specific case, because that would be out of order-to revive that Bill, and it might be urged that the only control which this House could exercise over it would be by the discussion of a fresh message from the Governor General. It is extremely doubtful whether the standing orders referred to can cover Bills which appropriate public revenue. In the Victorian Parliament I may say that similar standing orders obtain,' and last year, when a Bil l appropriating public monev was before the Legislature of this State-I . refer to the Water Bill-it was passed by the Legislative Assembly, it was the intention of the Government, as notified in the press, to take it up in the Legislative Council during the next session. MAILS. Upon consideration, however, by the President of the Legislative Council, 'the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, and the Law Officers of the Crown, it wad decided that the standing orders in question-whic h are practically a copy of those to which I have just drawn attention-di d not apply to Bills originated by message-that they could not be applied to them in that way, and that the only way in which any Bili appropriating revenue could be dealt with under those circumstances was by introducing it afresh into the lower Chamber. Sec tion 56 of the Commonwealth Constitution Act states that the purpose of the appropriation must, in the same session, have been recommended by message of the Governor General to the House in' which the proposal originates. I do not think that that section would cover any attempted action under the before mentioned standing orders to which I have referred. Obviously the matter is a very important one, and if the interpretation of the standing orders to which I have alluded can be held to relate to Bills which appropriate public money, it means that the control of expenditure by this House, under the forms which it now possesses, must then vanish, because the only control which we could then exercise over expenditure would be by consideration of a fresh message from the Governor General, and that message might be submitted at the fag end of the session, and in a thin House.",14
11,Mr MCDONALD,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,It might not be debated.,14
12,Mr ROBINSON,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"As the honourable member for Kennedy says, it might not even be debated. I was one of those ""who took objection to the standing orders in question last session, but I did not think of the point which I am now raising at that time. The point I am now raising - was brought forward for the first time in the Victorian Parliament this year, when we saw a Government which is supposed to Ine a conservative one take action for the purpose of conserving the privileges of the lower House. This question is an important one, which should be considered very carefully. I do not raise it in anv antagonistic spirit, but I think that it is a matter upon which a special Select Committee, consisting of a few members might reasonably; be appointed to confer with the President and Mr Speaker, and to report to this House-the main question for consideration being whether it is possible under these Standing Orders to revive in another place in the next session a B i ll which appropriates public money in any'shape or form.",14
13,Mr DEAKIN,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN," Havin g received no notice that this question was to be brought forward today, I am .naturally not prepared-eve n if it were desirable-to enter upon a discussion of it at the present time. Nevertheless, I beg to submit that there can be no doubt as to the constitutionality of the Standing Orders which have been adopted by this House. Reference to section 50 of our Constitution shows thatEach House of the Parliament may make rules and orders with respect to1. The mode in which its powers, privileges, and immunities may be exercised and upheld : 2. The order and conduct of its business and proceedings, either separately or jointly with the other House. That is an absolute authority for this House to govern its own procedure, and we have decided our own procedure by the adoption of these Standing Orders. So far from this House being deprived of any control of public expenditure, as a matter of fact, a message from the Governor General must have teen submitted, and a Bill passed by this Chamber before the standing order can apply. The only object which the honourable and learned member for Wannon can have in suggesting that standing orders 214A and 214B should be altered is to allow of a second discussion taking place in this House, if by any chance a measure approved in one session by us was noit passed by the other Chamber in the same session. The very object of these Standing Orders is to enable that procedure to be dispensed with, if we think fit to do so, and it can only be dispensed with by our consent. Under cover of them we arrive at the same point in one stage-that is 'to say, if a majority of this House think fit.",15
14,Mr WATSON,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,That stage would practically constitute a fourth reading.,15
15,Mr DEAKIN,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"It might be termed that. No measure involving a grant of money can come under the operation of these Standing Orders unless it has first been passed by this House in one session, and unless it has been restored by the other House to the place that it previously occupied in that Chamber. Of course, in that case no second resolution is necessary in this House. I say that, because my reply to the interjection of the honourable member for Bland might possibly convey another impression. In making that reply, however, I was referring to the period when the measure was in an incomplete stage in this House. In that case, it could be reinstated here only by what might amount to a fourth reading. The suggestion that these Standing Orders were intended to apply only to measures which do not involve the expenditure of public money seems to me to be based entirely upon a misconception. AVhatever restriction may be imposed upon the powers of 'the States Parliaments in this connection certainly does not apply here.",15
16,Mr ROBINSON,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,It is merely a question of interpretation. The Standing Orders are the same in each instance.,15
17,Mr DEAKIN,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"That fact does not make them the same Standing Orders unless the Constitutions of the States confer the same authority as the Commonwealth Constitution. Of course, even then the adoption or non-adoption of these Standing Orders rests with Parliament.",15
18,Mr ROBINSON,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,The same power is con tained in every State Constitution.,15
19,Mr DEAKIN,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"If so, the State Parliaments exercise it as they think fit. If the honourable and learned member wishes this question to be further examined, the proper body to which to refer it is the Standing Orders Committee, upon whose recommendation the orders were passed. That body' had previously considered them although they were passed at the instance of the late Government. If the honourable and learned member wishes there can he no objection raised to 'the adoption of that course, because any such action taken by this House ought to be, and is, open to review. We do not desire by these Standing, Orders to accomplish anything except to expedite the transaction of business upon which Parliament is agreed.",15
20,Mr ROBINSON,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN, I desire to ascertain if I shall now be in order in moving that this matter be referred to the Standing Orders Committee?,15
21,Mr SPEAKER,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"It would have been competent for the honourable and learned member to conclude his speech by moving such a motion, but as he resumed his seat without doing so, I do not think that he ought now to be permitted to move it. Probably some other honourable member will take action on his behalf.",15
22,Mr DEAKIN,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,I should be prepared to do so if I were not in the same position as - is the honourable and learned member for Wannon.,16
23,Mr CONROY,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN," I trust that the Prime Minister will very seriously consider this question, which relates to the privileges of the House, and does not involve a party discussion in any sense. Within a few years, the question may become one as to whether the control of such measures as that to which reference has been made, should pass to another place, or remain with this House. It may seem a very small matter at the present moment, and so far as the measure is concerned to which the .question more immediately relates, I do not know that many of us would offer much objection to the course proposed. We have to remember, however, that we are proposing to lay down a precedent that oucrht not to be established. Although at present money Bills must originate in this House, the Senate itself has control over a great many matters, and it is hardly to be doubted that in the near future disputes will arise between the two Houses. That being so. we cannot be too careful to see that we adhere strictlv to the constitutional provision in regard to money Bills originating in this Chamber.",16
24,Mr WATSON,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"If we have already agreed another place must deal with the matter - at a later stage, and carry out our desire.",16
25,Mr CONROY,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"Does not the honourable member see that a difficulty of the kind to which I have referred, might occur in relation to a Bil l which we had passed twelve or eighteen months previously. Let us take many of the measures that were before us twelve months, ago.  lating to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey scheme.",16
26,Mr CONROY,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"That is one of the matters which might possibly come up for consideration, and an opportunity should be afforded us to more fully consider the question. We ought to be extremely jealous of our privileges.",16
27,Mr THOMAS,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,Shoul d not the late Government have explained all this to the House when they brought forward the Standing Orders?,16
28,Mr REID,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,Surely the honourable member can drop this party vendetta now that we are out of office?,16
29,Mr CONROY,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"I am afraid, that the honourable member for Barrier, in dealing with this question, has not exhibited his usual judgment, but I feel satisfied that as soon as he gives it his serious consideration he will recognise that it relates to a matter as to which many difficulties may possibly arise. If we leave this question as it stands, the action proposed to be taken in another place will be quoted before many years have elapsed as a precedent. If we allow the course proposed by the Governmenfl under these Standing Orders. I feel satisfied that on many occasions, when we should be glad to have questions brought before us for further consideration, that course will not be possible. If the House thinks it is a matter of any consequence it will be perfectly within its power to say 90. While both branches of the Legislature are elected directly by the people, this is the only House that represents the Commonwealth in proportion to the number of people in the various States. The Senate merelv represents the States as such. There may! be a very serious dispute within a short time between the two Houses as to the point now at issue, and if we do not take action on this occasion our power will probably drif t away from us. It is clear that if any "" manager "" of Parliament sought to take action he would not waste his time by seeking to deal with this Chamber; but would devote his attention to the smaller Chamber, where he could count heads, and know exactly how many members he had to deal with. There the number of members for or against, any particular question could be more readily ascertained, and he would be able to deal with what in America are called the ""mugwumps."" If we desired to prevent such a state of affairs we should take care to guard our privileges. The suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Wannon is a good one, and I propose to move that the matter be referred to the Standing Orders Committee.",16
30,Mr SPEAKER,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"Althoug h mv ruling has not been called for. I should like to d'rect attention to the fact that the action to which the honourable ancl learned member for Wannon referred as one that might be taken by another branch of the Legislature would in no sense rest upon any Standing Orders we have passed. It would depend upon those which the Senate itself had passed, and that being so, the question would be one, not as to our own Standing Orders, but as to those of both Houses.",16
31,Mr CONROY,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN," In view of your suggestion, Mr Speaker, I move That standing orders 214A and 214B, and all Standing Orders of both branches of the Legislature affecting the same matter, be referred the Standing Orders Committee.",17
32,Mr REID,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,But can we refer the Standing Orders of another place to the Committee ?,17
33,Mr SPEAKER,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"Perhaps , as the honourable and learned member for Werriwa has not handed me his motion in writing, 1 may be permitted to suggest that it should be framed as follows:That the question of the Standing Orders of both Houses in relation to lapsed Bills be referred to a joint meeting of the Standing Orders Committee of each House.",17
34,Mr CONROY,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"By leave, sir, I will amend my motion on the lines you suggest. Question, by leave, amended accordingly.",17
35,Mr MCDONA LD,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN," I would ask the Prime Minister to take into consideration the fact that the ruling given by| the President of the Senate was not altogether that the Government proposal was either in or out of order, but that the interpretation of section 56 of the Constitution was not a matter with which he was called upon to deal. If the question is to be referred to the Standing Orders Committee, I think it would be wise to obtain the opinion of the Crown Law officers upon it, for it is undoubtedly one of importance.",17
36,Mr MCCAY,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN," As the Prime Minister has agreed to, and, indeed, bas signified his willingness to move, the reference of this question to the Standing Orders Committee, and as the matter at issue might arise, at any time, in reference to lapsed Bills, I should like to ask him whether the Government will stay their hands-if they have in contemplation, proceedings with regard to Bills which do require a message, and require, also, to originate in this House-pendin g the consideration of the point by the Standing Orders Committee. If the Standing Orders Committee brought up a report declaring, say, that it was not advisable that the Standing Orders in question should be followed in the case of Bills requiring a message, a difficulty would obviously arise if the Government had at the same time been using them in connection with such Bills. I would suggest, therefore, that it would be reasonable, for the Government, if they have in contemplation, proceedings of this kind, to stay their hands for the week 6r more necessary to enable the matter to be considered by the Standing Orders Committees. I would remind him that as leader of the to Hpuse, he is the custodian of our privileges, and that in any case of doubt as to whether the privileges of this House are being infringed in any wa\\ it is his duty to err upon the side of caution. It is upon that ground only that I make this suggestion to him. If confirmation of mv view be necessary, it will be found on turning to Plansard, page 1479, Vol. 2', Session 1901, where a distinguished member of this House is reported as follows: I think that, at the very outset we ought to take our stand upon the position that this House represents, in a special and perfect degree, the taxpayers of Australia. We ought to be very careful, lest by withdrawing what are called forms, but which are really more than formswhich have been spoken of as danger signals, but which, I think, should be regarded as standards marking out our territory-w e surrender the rights of this House. We cannot be too careful, lest argument be piled on argument, and surrender called for after surrender. These observations were made by the present Attorney-General in connection with the preamble and first clause of Supply Bills, and it is to that aspect of the case I draw the attention of the Prime Minister., feeling quite sure that the quotation will carry at least as much weight with him as anything I could say. I would, therefore, earnestly suggest that if any such procedure.be proposed with regard to Bills which do require a message at some stage or other of their passage through the Houses, the Prime Minister should delay acting upon these Standing Order?, in another place, at any rate, until the matter has been considered by the Standing Orders Committee and reported upon.",17
37,Mr WATSON,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN," I trust the Standing Orders Committee, in the event of this matter being referred to them, will not take the view that it is the unanimous desire of-, the House to have any alteration made in these Standing Orders. If there were any attempt being made to limit our privileges or to undermine in the slightest degree, the predominance which this House must necessarily occupy with regard to financial measures, I should be one of the first to assist in making a protest as effectively as possible. But what does thisposition amount to? After having considered a message from the Crown in respect to the Bill about which the present controversy has arisen, we proceed to pass it. It goes through all its stages here, and presumably the House has distinctly made up its mind as to what its attitude is. And it is now seriously suggested that in regard to this class of measure we should insist upon going through the whole process again. That view will not commend itself to the people in the constituencies. Surely they have no reason to complain of any undue speed being exhibited by this Parliament, of any undue haste, or of our rushing business through. reason, I trust the sensible rule which is in existence in ail the State Parliaments, or in most of them, as far as I am aware, will be given effect to, ancl will not be emasculated in the fashion suggested by the honourable and learned member for Wannon.",17
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"Parramatta) What the honourable member for Bland has said would be all right if it were not for standing order '214B, which seems to me to contemplate that in all matters of this kind the Bill must come back to this House before any other message can go to the Senate. Standing order 214A prescribes what may be clone with regard to these Bills, ancl then the next section saysAny such Bill may be sent to the Senate as if it had been introduced and passed by the House in the second session. That, I submit, requires the Bil l to be brought back here in order to be sent again to the Senate, to be restored there to the position which it had reached. Moreover, that is in accordance with the Constitution, which unquestionably, to my mind, ties (he message to. the Bill . They must both originate in the same place, and in the same session. If the message lapses, therefore the Bill lapses, so far as its progress is concerned. I submit that the Bill must come back here, and be originated as before.",18
39,Mr REID,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN," I see no objection to the course which is suggested by the motion; but I should like to ask you, sir, whether our Standing Orders or rules dealing with things done in another Chamber differ from the practice which prevails in some of the Stats Parliaments. For instance, sir, as you know well, if one House of a State Parliament wishes information as to a Bill or other matter in the custody of the other House a certain procedure has to be adopted in order to ascertain what the state of facts is. We do not wish to raise any question of etiquette between the Houses. I observe that we are asked to refer the Standing Orders of another place to the Standing Orders Committee. In the first place, are these Standing Orders before us in any way; have they been laid upon our table ? Is it competent to us to refer Standing Orders of the Senate even to a joint Committee? I do not raise the point as a substantial one, but we wish to avoid taking any course which is not in accordance with' parliamentary procedure. In New South Wales, when one House wished to find out what the state of For that things was in the other House, a Committee had to be appointed to search its records. I do not know whether under our present rules there is any necessity for taking, that course.",18
40,Mr SPEAKER,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"It would be impossible for us concerning any measure or any matter of business to obtain information as to what was proceeding in another branch of the Legislature without appointing a Committee to search its records. I listened carefully to the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Wannon. So far as I could gather from his speech he made no reference to any Bill or other matter which is now before the other House, but simply referred to cases which might arise from time to time under the provisions of the Standing Orders to which he referred. I think it would be proper, if I may sav so, for the House to ask the other branch to concur in its resolution.",18
41,Mr CONROY,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,I have no objection to the sucffested addition to the motion.,18
42,Mr SPEAKER,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"I shall, then, put the question in this form : That the Standing Orders of the Senate and the House of Representatives relating to lapsed Bills be referred to a joint meeting of the Standing Orders Committee for consideration and report, and that a message be sent to the Senate seeking their concurrence in this course.",18
43,Mr REID,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"I do not wish to be technical j but may I suggest to you, sir. that there is still this difficulty to be faced, that we first adopt a course and then ask the other House to concur in that course. I would suggest that the other House should not be asked for its concurrence to a thing which we have already resolved shall be done. We ought first to affirm the desirability of making a reference to the Joint Committee, ancl then to order a message to be sent to the otherHouse asking for its concurrence in that course.",18
44,Mr SPEAKER,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,The right honourable ancl learned member can move an amendment to that effect.,18
45,Mr REID,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"I move That after the word "" that,"" line i , the words "" it is desirable that"" be inserted.",19
46,Mr CONROY,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"I accept the amendment. Amendment agreed to. Question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative. TELEPHONE SYSTEM .",19
47,Mr WATSON,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General, without notice, whe'ther, in view of the complaints so frequently heard about the telephone systems in Sydney and Melbourne, and the possibility of adopting something new in connection with the exchanges, he will give us an opportunity of perusing the report of the officer, who, I understand, recently went round the world with a view of .making inquiries into that and cognate matters.",19
48,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"The report of the officer is not quite complete,.but so far as it is complete there is no objection to laying it upon the table for the information of honourable members. I shall take that course at the earliest possible moment. ELECTOR AL ACT .",19
49,Mr WEBSTER,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether in view of the fact that the Premier of New South Wales has intimated his intention of introducing a Bill to remove the embargo, which prevents a member of the Federal Parliament from contesting a seat in the State Parliament without first resigning his position, the Government of the Commonwealth will agree to remove from our Electoral Act the embargo which debars the members of a State Parliament from contesting a seat j n the Federal Parliament?",19

Its removal another State would not put the members of the Federal Parliament generally on take, but as there is an objection the same footing as the members of all the States Parliaments.

52,Mr REID,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN," The objection I have to the course proposed does not 'arise from my objection to the Bill itself, because, from what f know of the measure, assuming it to be practically the same as that under consideration before the previous Government resigned, I shall perhaps be able to support it : but what is now suggested may become a precedent of a most objectionable kind. We must guard against that. I wish to point out that once a Bill has been laid before Parliament, there is no rough ancl ready means such as a mere request, by which that Bill can be withdrawn from Parliament and another Bill substituted which has not been laid upon the table. I see danger more, perhaps, in the future than in this particular case. It is necessary to avoid inconvenient precedents.",19

Whether it is true, .is slated by a writer in the Age of the 22nd ultimo, that "" the Defence Department had just imported a laTge shipment of leather accoutrements for the use of our Defence Forces, which our local saddlers were f u l ly capable and anxious to make""; and that "" during this last week "" (week immediately preceding date of letter-as t July, 1905) ""the Defence Department has received tenders for artillery harness and saddlery, and has notified the contractors that they can quote for above with a large proportion of English ironwork and buckles, which can, and have been, made here?"" If so, what was the value of the leather accoutrements imported for the use of the Defence Force during the past twelve months?",20
60,Mr EWING,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"I am instructed with regard to the honourable member's questions to reply1. 4,650 sets of infantry, 300 sets of Light Horse equipment, and twelve sample sets of saddlery ordered in March, 1904, have recently been received - from England. When ordered, there were no samples in the Commonwealth, and being urgently required, and a charge against the 1903-4 votes, there would not have been time to get them made in Australia. Local tenders have just been received for the harness and saddlery. Prior to the receipt of these tenders, at the urgent request of several firms of saddlers, intending tenderers were notified that they could submit alternative tenders on the basis of some of the metal parts being imported; but it is not anticipated that there will be any necessity to depart from the first intention, that all the metal, as well as the leather work should be of local manufacture. 2. j£4,ooo. PERMANENT ENGINEER CORPS.",20
61,Mr CROUCH,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Is it a fact that rations are not provided for members of the Permanent F.ngineers Corps when away from their station instructing Militia at Easter and other times? 2. Will he direct that this be done in future? 3. Will he direct that extra pay and travelling allowances be made for these duties? 4. Is it the custom to charge permanent engineers gd. a day for their rations when their duties take them to Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, contrary to the regulation that rations and quarters will be provided, or travelling allowances in lieu thereof, to all men away from their stations on duty ?",20
62,Mr EWING,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"I am instructed with regard to the honourable member's questions to reply1 and 2. Rations are provided, but any men drawing consolidated pay are charged the cost of same just as they would be if supplied at their own station. 3. Extra pay is not provided for under the regulations. Should the circumstances call for special remuneration the cases would be considered. Travelling allowances are provided for, and are paid when the conditions of travelling come within the regulation. 4. When men drawing consolidated pay, which includes rations, are sent from their station at Swan Island to Victoria Barracks, and are provided with rations while there, they are charged with the cost of same; but if not""drawing consolidated pay they receive three rations, as they would at their own station. No additional allowance is granted in these circumstances. PUBLIC SERVICE APPEALS.",20
63,Mr HUME COOK,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon noticeWith reference to the following question and answer on Wednesday lastPUBLIC SERVICE APPEALS.",20
64,Mr HUME COOK,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"It is asserted that effect has not been given to appeals to the Appeal Board, instituted under the Public Service Act. I therefore ask the Minister of Home Affairs if it is true that, 'although certain appeals have been unanimously upheld by the Appeal Board, they have nevertheless been set aside by the Public Service Commissioner.",20
65,Mr GROOM,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"Yes ; but the Commissioner, in arriving at his decisions, had to view each case as it affected others throughout the Commonwealth. He alone has a full knowledge of the circumstances of the other States and of the effect of the appeals on the public expenditure. 1. Were not the Appeal Boards constituted for the express purpose of hearing and redressing any grievances of the Civil Service? 2. If the findings of the Appeal Boards are not to be sustained, does the Government propose 10 abolish the Boards as expensive and useless bodies? 3. In view of the action of the Public Service Commissioner in this matter, will the Government undertake that some means will be adopted whereby the unanimous decisions of the Appeal Boards may be reconsidered ?",20
66,Mr GROOM,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No ; the Appeal Boards were constituted for the purpose of hearing evidence of aggrieved officers, and forwarding it with their recommendation for the determination of the Commission. 2. It does not follow becausej in some instances, the report of the Board was not adopted in its entirety that the Boards were useless. As a matter of fact, out of 2,217 appeals dealt with there were only forty-eight cases in which the Commissioner could not see his way to adopt the recommendations of the Boards of Appeal. In eighteen of these cases the Boards recommended lhat positions of officers be raised in classification, while in thirty cases the Boards disallowed the appeals, but the Commissioner, with a wider knowledge of the circumstances, decided in favour of the appellants, despite the contrary recommendations of the Boards. 3. The Appeals Boards in the different States may give recommendations divergent on similar occasions, and it is the Commissioner's province to make the necessary adjustment, and determine such matters. The Public Service Commissioner is the authority constituted by law to determine the appeals. FREMANTLE FORTS.",20
67,Mr CARPENTER,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"the Minister appointed representing the Minister of Defence, ufon notice I. Whether it is the intention of the Government lo proceed with the erection of 6-inch at the Fremantle and North Fremantle forts? 2. In view of the fact that modern war vessels are being armed with guns of a much greater calibre and longer range, will the Government consider the advisableness of substituting heavier guns at these forts, in order to make these fences more effective?",21
68,Mr EWING,CONVEYANC E OF TASMANIAN,"I am instructed with re-' gard to the honourable member's questions the to reply1. It has been decided that the 6-inch mark VII . guns shall be placed at Fremantle, and two seven-point two-inch guns at North Fremantle forts. The emplacements for these guns are now being constructed. 2. This important matter will receive the fullest consideration. NA",21
69,Mr JOHNSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"the Minister of tion Trade and Customs, ufon noticeIn view of the rales now paid for overtime in the Customs Department, is it the intention of the Government to put into force the regulations regarding overtime rates referred to in a recent Gazette notice, under which officers working overtime will be entitled to remuneration at the rate of 2s. per hour from 5 to 10 p.m., and 3s. per hour from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. ?",21
70,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"In reply to the of honourable member's questionIt is presumed that the Gazette notice referred to is one published in the Gazette of 3rd June, 1905, with regard lo overtime rates in the Excise Branch of the Customs. The rates therein referred to have not yet become law, and whether confirmed in their present form or not, will affect the rates fixed under the Customs Act by. Regulations which came into force on the ist July, 1904. PUBLIC SERVICE: FEMALE OFFICERS.",21
71,Mr RONALD,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"the Minister of Home Affairs,, ufon notice I. Does the nature of the work or the sex of the worker determine the Divisions under the Public Service Act into Clerical and General? 2. Is it a fact that the duties of female clerks in the General Post Office have been placed in the general division, and in the case of certain work performed by men in other States it is classified clerical; where performed by women in this State it is classified in general division? 3. Is sex an insuperable bar to promotion. Promotion for female clerks is blocked unless clerical positions are available to them in the 5th class, clerical division (100)? 4. Is it a fact that positions for clerks in the 5th class have been advertised, and, notwithstanding the fact that female clerks have applied for such positions, male clerks who have passed the clerical examination in recent years have been to them. That is, is it true that appointments have been made neither taking the candidates in the order of time nor in the order of merit? 5. Is it a fact that according to the Federal guns Postal Act, female clerks who have passed the minimum wage examination were entitled to rise by annual increments to the maximum of their class (£160 per annum), and . the first of such increments were due from ist July, 1903, so that female clerks were entitled to ^120 per deannum twelve months prior to the reclassification scheme being issued? 6. Is it. a fact that by placing their duties in general division, and by not appointing female clerks to a proportion of the vacancies in the clerical division as they occur, all chance of obtaining these increments is lost; and, as a that matter of fact, female officers in the general division are now being paid ^114 per annum, while female clerks receive only ;£iio, though gazetted at ^114 in reclassification report? 7. Is it a fact that female clerks have been required to qualify by passing both Clerical Entrance Examination and Minimum Wage Examination for Clerks while general division DEPARTMENT. officers have been made clerical in reclassificareport without having passed either of these examinations?",21
72,Mr GROOM,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. The former. 2. No, but where the work performed by certain female officers in the General Post Office, Melbourne, is of an ordinary routine character, it has been classified in the general division. All such officers who, under the State, possessed a clerical status, have had such status conserved to them. I am not aware that there is any difference of classification in the other States where the work is the same. 3. Sex is not a bar to promotion. 4. Applicants, whether males or femaleSj are appointed according to efficiency and aptitude not for the particular position to be filled. 5. No ; the minimum and maximum salaries for 5U1 class of the clerical division are ,£40 and J£I6O respectively, but the salary of an officer may be fixed at any amount between the minimum and maximum rates. Increments are discretionary and manifestly should not be given, unless the work or other circumstances warrant them 6. Officers whose work has been classified in the general division are, so long as they continue to perform sujjh work, 'entitled to increments according to the scale prescribed for such work. There is nothing unusual in certain general division officers being paid higher salaries than certain clerical division officers. Everything depends on what positions they respectively fill. Female officers with clerical status, who, under classification, have been raised from £110 to ,£114, will be paid the higher amount when the classification is approved by the Governor General. 7. Yes, where the nature of the work warranted it. PATENTS ACT.",21
73,Mr JOHNSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, ufon notice I. Is it a fact that the Patents Act and Regulations require the appointment of a local agent and a statement of address to be filed with each application for a patent, and is this information available to the public, and if not, why not? 2. What fees do registered Patent Attorneys pay? 3. Is there any objection to noting in the Register of Applications for Patents and in the lists of same in the official publication the names or initials of registered Patent Attorneys acting in the cases?",22
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"In reply to the honourable member's questions1. Patents Regulation No. 9 provides for the filing of a statement of address with each application to which all notices, requisitions, and communications of every kind may be sent by the commissioner. This regulation further provides that such address shall be within the Commonwealth, and, if the commissioner so requires, in or near to the city in which the Patent Office is situate. A local address is only asked for when an applicant fails after the tender of advice by the office to grasp the requirements of the law. The Australian Official Journal of Patents, published on Tuesday of each week, contains a list of applications for Letters Patent filed in the Patent Office up to and including those lodged on the preceding Wednesday. This list gives the names and addresses of applicants, together with the title of their inventions, for which applications for patents are made. 2. An annual fee of £2. 3. There is no register of applications for patents. Section 20 of the Patents Act 1903 provides only for a Register of Patents, and in this book, which may be inspected on payment of the prescribed fee, there are entered the names and addresses of grantees of patents, and other proceedings connected with the applications, together with all subsequent transactions relating to patents required by the section of the Act mentioned to be entered in the Register. In order to preserve inviolate the secrets p f inventors the Commissioner of Patents considers it objectionable to reveal anything relating to an application without the authority of the applicant. POST-OFFICE FEMALE EMPLOYES.",22

Is it a fact that tfiere are nine (9) female clerical officers, who have been employed in the Victorian Postal Department for - twenty (20) years, who have not been given the minimum wage-£11 0 per annum? 2. Has one of the female clerical officers who faiied to pass the examination been classified at ;£ii4 per annum, and, if so, why? 3. Have officers been raised from the nonclerical to the clerical division and given a salary of £120 per annum without passing any examination?",22
76,Mr GROOM,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"In answer to the honourable member's questionsx. Yes, for the reason that they have not passed the examination required by law to entitle them to that payment. 2. Yes, because it is considered the work is worth that amount. 3. Yes, where they were performing duties classified as clerical and worth that amount. TELEPHONE FACILITIES.",22

Debate resumed from 28th July (vide page 346), on motion by Mr DEAKINThat Statutory Rules Nos. 12 and 23, under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, laid on the table on 26th July, be printed.",23
85,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Macquarie) I do not intend to detain the House at very great length. I admit that the matter has been fairly debated, but there are a few questions which deserve the consideration of honourable members ancl of the country. During this debate there has been a good deal of misrepresentation by some members' of this Chamber, and also"" on the part of the press outside. Before proceeding to discuss the general question, I may be permitted to make a few remarks as to the reasons for the coalition which recentlyeventuated. When the Federal Parliament was first elected the Protectionist Party represented about thirty-two votes of the direct supporters of Sir Edmund Barton ancl Mr Deakin, and the Labour Party numbered sixteen, consisting of eight free traders and eight protectionists; while the free-traders numbered twenty-six. This meant forty-two votes in favour of a protectionist policy as opposed to thirty-five votes on the other side. The Tariff was, therefore, framed by protectionists, although I have heard some people say that the free-traders interfered with the protectionists in their work. If is true that we free-trader's fought as hard as men could in favour of the policy in which we believed, endeavouring to bring about reductions which we thought to be in the interests of the country, and we could not have brought about any reductions had it not been for the occasional support of a number of protectionists. I wish to show that the Tariff was not framed by the free traders. No doubt we helped to modify the Tariff, and make it more acceptable to the community, but it was a protectionist Tariff, framed by a protectionist Government, and supported by a majority of protectionists in the House. The Tariff having been adopted, the then honourable and learned member for Hunter, Sir Edmund"" Barton^ and his Government determined to have what they termed a fiscal truce. Mr. Deakin, when Prime Minister, went to Ballarat, and there made a long speech in favour of a truce. The honourable and learned member asked honourable members to leave the Tariff alone. The protectionists had fought for the Tariff, and were satisfied with the'result of their labours, and, therefore, they asked the people, not only of Ballarat. but throughout the Commonwealth, to return to Parliament a body of men who would be prepared to sink the fiscal issue for the time being-wh o would be prepared to maintain the Tariff as it then was during this Parliament. Notwithstanding that appeal made by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, the Deakin party returned to the House with their membership reduced to, I think, twenty-six; while the Labour Party had gained seven votes, which were practically taken from the protectionist side of the House. It will thus be seen that at the opening of this Parliament the protectionist' or Deakin party had only twenty-six votes, as against twenty-six on the side of the free-traders, and twenty-three in the Labour Party. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We got two protectionists from Western Australia.",23
86,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I am not going into that question. I am showing the state of the Labour Party at the time the honourable and learned member for Ballarat met the House. When the Watson Government was formed an alteration took place in the state, of parties. were then twenty-seven on the side of the Government, twenty-three representing the Deakin party, and twenty-five of our party, one of our members, the honourable member for Grey, having transferred his allegiance to the Labour Party. When the Watson Government met the House, the Labour Party had a following,_ including the members of the Government, 'of twenty-seven members. Then we had the combination known as the Watson-Isaacs party; but the honourable and learned member for Ballarat expressed his dissatisfaction at the state of affairs. He pointed out that it was impossible for the business of Parliament to be carried on with three parties. The honourable and learned gentleman made some very strong statements on this subject. I remember reading one which he made, in this House, I believe, in August, 1904, when the Labour Government was in power. He said : Those most closely allied with the Labour Party, those who make the greatest sacrifices for them, who stand closest to them, and who most wish to help them, are always, the first to be sacrificed by them. One may help the Labour Party for one month, two months, three months, or four months; but the moment one stops, or makes a single independent step, he is treated as a bitter enemy. That was the honourable and learned gentleman's opinion of the Labour Party in 1904, and I wonder what he proposes to do now. The honourable and learned gentleman has not now a following of thirty-two but only of nineteen, including honourable members who are anxious to sit as close as they can to the cross benches. I believe there are only four honourable members who have the courage still to sit directly behind the Government. All the rest I notice get as near as possible to the cross benches. Nofwith'standing this the honourable and learned member for Ballarat apparently is now quite prepared to accept the three-party arrangement -. He further said of the Labour Party: After having been apparently trusted, he will be treated as if he had been suspected from the first moment; he will be condemned as if he had attacked them from the outset. This is the treatment which follows alliances with political machines. When you come to deal with the machine you are dealing with something which has no loyalty, no conscience, and no judgment. That was the opinion of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat of the party that is now keeping him in power. The honourable 'and learned gentleman eviThere dently held that opinion for some time, because, when the proposal to include railway servants in the Arbitration Bil l was carried he took that as a vote of censure, and retired, and he has pointed out since that it \ras impossible to carry on the Government in a satisfactory manner, and impossible for a man to exhibit any independence of judgment or action in the House constituted as it then was of three parties. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat ancl the right honourable member for East Sydney then formed an alliance, and so far as the fiscal issue was concerned,, it was decided' that there should be a truce. Honourable members supporting the right honourable member for East Sydney were in this matter giving up more than the protectionists, because it must not be forgotten that the protectionists had had the arrangement of the Tariff by reason of the majority they commanded in the first Parliament. They were able practically to pass any Tariff they pleased - of course in a fair way-and a Tariff was framed with which they were satisfied, and which they accepted. Still we were willing to have a fiscal truce, though in New South Wales and some of the other States it was well known that a majority of the people were in favour of a revenue Tariff. In order to carry on fair legislation, without respect to class interests, and in the interests only of the community as a whole, we arranged for the time to give up our fight for free trade. Although the Tariff was a protective one, we assented to a fiscal truce, and therefore gave up a good deal more than did the protectionists-in fact they gave up. practically nothing. Honourable members are aware that I was one of the persons who met the right honourable member for East Svdney, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and the right honourable member . for Balaclava in connection with the proposed coalition. A plan of campaign, and the policy it was thought best to adopt, in the event of both parties agreeing to the coalition proposals, were arranged. Every one understood-at all events, I did - at the outset that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat would be a member of the coalition Ministry. thought that the honourable and learned gentleman would be one of the members of the coalition Government, but after a time. I gathered that he would not consent to join the Government.' I do not know what his reasons were, and the honourable and learned gentleman did not state them. We found,, also, that the right honourable member for Balaclava was disinclined to join the Government. We were then in this position: that the two prominent members of the Deakin party who had met us in conference practically decided not to join any coalition Government. Honourable members will understand that it was impossible in such circumstances to arrange^ any satisfactory coalition.  fixed it up all the same.",24
87,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I am coming to that. We generally do something when we set about it. Eventually, at the earnest and strongly-expressed desire of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, the right honourable member for Balaclava consented to join the Reid-MCLean Government. On that point the honourable and learned member for Ballarat states that 1 that is not a fact.",25
88,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"That was the first time, not the second time.",25
89,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I shall read what the honourable and learned member for Ballarat said I have no hesitation, and had none even during the time the Prime Minister was speaking, in contradicting the statement that I had dragged the right honourable member for Balaclava into the Ministry. At another stage of his speech the Prime Minister stated that I had implored the right honourable gentleman to join the Government, and he also stated that I had forced him into the Government, after having myself refused to accept office on the score of ill health. None of those statements are true, either in relation to the right honourable member for Balaclava or any other member of this or any other Government that was ever formed. I never yet advised any man to join any Government-eve n a Government formed by myself. That does not refer to three months ago, or to any particular time. The honourable and learned gentleman said that he never advised or induced any honourable member to join any Government, even his own Government.",25
90,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable and learned gentleman was referring to the last occasion. I Mr SYDNEY SMITH - There is no qualification whatever in the honourable and learned gentleman's statement.,25
91,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Surely the honourable member does not doubt that there is a qualification ?,25
92,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I do not know. We have heard so many qualifications and statements lately that it .is difficult to follow them. At all events, the present leader of the Opposition made a statement which was contradicted by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, ancl the right honourable gentleman then said that he understood the matter in that way, but that he would leave it to be dealt with by his right honourable colleague, Sir George Turner. The right honourable member for Balaclava did contradict the denial of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. He rightly pointed out that he had been induced to join the Government, and that it was at the urgent desire and special request of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat that he consented to do so. What, therefore, becomes of the statement made by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, in view of the statements which we have heard from the right honourable member for Balaclava and the honourable member for Gippsland ?",25
93,Mr BAMFORD,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Is that what happened down in the cave on the beach?,25
94,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I know noth- ing of anv cave. The coalition party decided to publish the fullest information on the subject. Everything was done in the full light of day, ancl the public were made aware of the terms of the arrangement arrived at between the two sections of the Ministerial party). The right honourable member for Balaclava, after having been induced by the present Prime Minister to ioin the coalition Government, had every right to expect that loyalty would be extended to him and his protectionist colleagues. The compact with the free-traders should have been kept in an honourable manner, but I admit that the Prime Minister did not lie under the same obligation to us as to the four protectionists who were induced by him to join the coalition Government. They had a perfect right to know what he intended to do, but he kept them absolutely, in the dark. On the Wednesday prior to the delivery ot the Ballarat speech, the leader of the Opposition lmd an interview with the Prime Minister, who gave him the impression that he was as loyal as ever, and that he intended to continue his support of the coalition Government. protectionist friends remained under the same impression. We all read the report of the Ballarat speech very carefully, and could come to no other conclusion than that the alliance had been dissolved. Even in his printed statement, which was not open to any suggestion of mistakes on the part of the reporters, the Prime Minister mentions, as an important point, the ending of the fiscal truce.",25
95,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"He meant that remark to apply to the time when the truce was brought to an end, and not to the present time.",26
96,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The friends of the Prime Minister are very ready with their explanations, but there can be no question as to the impression conveyed by the Prime Minister's speech.",26
97,Mr MAUGEK,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,It was our policy to knock out the free-traders if we could.,26
98,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The members of the protectionist party, and the leading press organs of the free-trade and protectionist parties came to the conclusion that, so far as the present Prime Minister was concerned, the alliance was at an end. It was extraordinary that he should leave in the lurch men who had fought under his banner for so many years, and whom he had induced to join the coalition Government. After his treacherous speech at Ballarat. the Prime Minister never once intimated that he had altered his opinion with regard to the Government, or intended to take any action against the interests of the coalition.",26
99,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Bu the says he did.,26
100,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"If the honourable member will read the report of the Prime Minister's speech at Ballarat, and his subsequent explanation, he can come to no other conclusion than that I have accurately represented the case. Minister has represented that the right honourable member for Balaclava stated on the Monday morning on which the report of his speech appeared in the newspapers that he was satisfied of the loyalty of his old leader. The Prime Minister did not tell honourable members that at the time that the right honourable member for Balaclava expressed that opinion he had not read the speech.",26
101,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,It had been communicated to him through the telephone.,26
102,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,It is absurd to talk about communicating such a speech through the telephone. The statement of All his the honourable member for Melbourne Ports indicates the intense anxiety of some honourable members to find excuses for the action of the Prime Minister. There is no means of avoiding the conclusion that the Prime Minister - acted a traitorous part towards his old colleagues.  honourable member should not say that.,26
103,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I am content to leave the matter in the hands of the members of the Prime Minister's party. The word of the right honourable member for Balaclava will be accepted throughout the Commonwealth. Although we had differed with the right honourable member for Balaclava for many years upon the fiscal question, we were able,| when the truce had been established, to meet him and other members of his party on common ground, and I may say that my association with the four protectionist members of the late Ministry was of a very pleasant character. We were able to join them in doing work of an administrative character-w e had not much time for legislative work-which , I think, will prove to be really helpful to the people of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister accused the leader of the Opposition of having acted the part of a traitor in regard to the fiscal truce. He asserts that the right honourable gentleman alone is responsible for the present position of affairs. As has previously been stated, however, Ministers were unanimous that the only honourable course open to them was to submit the Governor General's speech at the opening of Parliament in the form in which it was presented. We have been told that if we had cared to adopt the same course that had previously been f o l lowed by the Prime Minister, and had been content to submit to anything that might The Prime be demanded of us. we could have carried oh the Government. No Government with which I have been associated has ever resorted to such a course in order to retain office. When we found that we could not carry on the business of the country in an honourable way, we 'thought that the time had arrived when we should vacate our Minleader isterial offices. It has been urged by members of the present Government, and also by some members of the Labour Party, that we committed political suicide. That accusation proves that, at all events, did not cling to office. The honourable member for Bland may laugh, but he cannew not deny that we exhibited no desire ever to remain in office under humiliating circumstances. That fact is evidenced the accusation that we abandoned Minisupon terial office without any just cause.

110,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I clare say that the honourable member has a keen recollection of the event to which I am referring, and certainly he ought to have. I never fall out with a man because he deems it to be his duty in the public interests to a Government, so long as he does At the same led time, I object to the attitude which has and been adopted by some honourable members towards the recent coalition Government.

He found that it was impossible for him to carry on the affairs of government in an honourable way, because he had to depend then-as he does to now - upon the support of the Labour He declared that he could not continue in office under such conditions. ? Consequently he accepted the verdict of Parliament as being against his party, ancl The honits orable member for Bland succeeded him as Prime Minister, but soon found that he eould not carry on.

113,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"At any rate we have loyally carried out the compact inro which we entered with the coalition party. Although some honourable members have deserted that party, I am very glad to know that the members who were associated with the late Government in Ministerial office have remained true to the policy of a fiscal truce. When the right honourable member for East Sydney accused the honourable and learned member for Ballarat of treachery the latter turned round and levelled a similar charge against the leader of the late Government. that the best evidence of the loyalty and fairness of the right honourable member for East Sydney is to be found in the fact that the four protectionist Ministers in the recent Government - men who have been associated with the Protectionist Party for many years, and who are all well and honourably known-ar e still supporters of the fiscal truce policy of our leader.",28
114,Mr TUDOR,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,That fact has not reduced the supporters of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat from twenty-six to nineteen.,28
115,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,But it must be recollected that the honourable .and learned member for Northern Melbourne and several others deserted the Protectionist Party and joined the Labour Party.

119,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"At the presenttime he does not sit behind the Government. With many other honourable members he occupies a seat in the Labour corner. Possibly the honourable and learned member for Ballarat entertained the impression that he would be able to induce the four protectionist members to whom I have referred, and others, who were pledged to a fiscal truce, to go back upon the right honourable member for East Sydney. That is a suffiI t has cient answer to those who accuse the right honourable member for East Sydney of having committed an act of treachery. Do honourable members opposite imagine for one moment that if he had been guilty of any such act, the right honourable member for Balaclava would have remained loyal to him ? Do honourable members believe that if the right honourable member for East Sydney had broken the Coalition agreement in any way the late Treasurer would have continued lo support him, or that he would have borne out 'his statement, as to the action taken by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat to induce him to join the Ministry, if that statement were not accurate? I claim Not one member of the late Ministry has gone back upon the fiscal truce which was agreed upon, and that fact alone should prove that there is no justification for the contention of the Prime Minister that the compact was broken by us. The protectionist members of the late Ministry are just as true to their fiscal faith as are any honourable members now sitting opposite.' The right honourable member for Balaclava was selected by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat as one with whom he should be associated in the negotiations to bring about the Coalition, and that shows that he felt he was a man upon whom he could rely. The fact that the late Treasurer, together with the honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable and learned member for Corinella, all of whom are well and favourably known throughout Victoria, agree that the action taken by the late Prime Minister, in regard to the Governor General's speech, was a right and proper one, should be sufficient to show that our party acted straightforwardly in regard to the alliance.

127,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,May I ask you why vou are supporting a Government which includes a right honourable gentleman who has denounced the Labour Party ?,29
128,Mr SPEAKER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable member must address the Chair.,29
129,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The Treasurer is a far more pronounced Conservative than is any honourable member on this side.,29
130,Mr RONALD,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,He has seen the error of his ways.,29
131,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"We have no evidence of that. On the contrary, we know that the right honourable member said shortly after the defeat of the first Deakin Government, that whilst in office, he had had to eat dirt for three or four years, but that he was not going to eat any more, He strongly condemned the action of what he described as the third party in this House, and I believe that oh the occasion of the recent parliamentary visit to Western Australia, he was afraid that the presence of so many members of the Federal Labour Party in that State might interfere with his position there. He was, at all events, very anxious that some members of the coalition party should take part in the tour. The result was that the late Prime Minister journeyed to Western Australia.",29
132,Mr TUDOR,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Is that why the right honourable member for Swan telegraphed to the right honourable member for East Sydney to come to Western Australia?,29
133,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I can only say that the right honourable member was very anxious that the late Prime Minister should speak for him in Western Australia; and yet immediately after the famous Ballarat speech, he declared that he had never been a supporter of the right honourable member for East Sydney. He did not take long to change his views. It is true that he was not a member of the right honourable member's partu. but he was a supporter of the coalition Government, of which the right honourable member for East Sydney was the leader. In these circumstances, the assertion made by the Treasurer was out of place, unless he was in a little plot to dislodge the coalition Government. There can be no doubt that there was something in the nature of a plot to bring about the the overthrow of the late Ministry, ancl it is remarkable how quickly the right honourable member for Swan changed his views with regard to the Labour Party. Although the leader of the Opposition has been accused of being a Conservative, there is no honourable member who has brought forward ancl supported more democratic legislation than he has.",29
134,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Who says that he is a Conservative?,29
135,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"That assertion has been made by some honourable members opposite. If it be true, it seems strange that the workers of New South Wales, who are familiar with his political career, should invariably support him. Our party receives the great bulk of its support from the workers of New South Wales.",29
136,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,We represent them.,30
137,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"We certainly do. The leader of the Opposition has had to fight his Way in life, just as other honourable members have had to do, and he knows the value of being free to exercise one's talents to the best advantage.",30
138,Mr JOHNSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,He was the most democratic Premier of New South Wales.,30
139,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"There can be no question about that; but my honourable friends on the other' side seem to think that it is only recently that progressive legislation has been enacted in any State. Take the question of one man one vote.. That proposal was made by the then member for East Sydney, Sir Henry Parkes. ",30
140,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"It was proposed originally in, I think, 1890. The Bill was passed in 1891, and a call of the House was made in order to get the requisite majority, but the Parkes Government was defeated over the Coal Mines Regulation Bill. The right honourable member for East Sydney was a supporter of the proposal. Subsequently the late Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, took up the question, and piloted a Bill through the House, but it was framed during the regime of the Parkes Government. Again, take the question of the White Australia policy. Honourable members on the other side ""claim that they were its originators.  Reid, was the originator.",30
141,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The right honourable member for East Sydney, as honourable members know, introduced the finst White Australia Bil l in New South Wales, and the Royal Assent was refused by the Home Government. Then my right honourable friend brought forward a measure framed on the lines of the Natal Act, and it was passed and assented to. Years before' Sir Henry Parkes brought in and passed the first Chinese Restriction Bill .

144,Mr STORRER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Why introduce all this ancient history ?,30
145,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"My honourable friends do not like these references, because they are endeavouring to convince the people that the right honourable member for East Sydney has always been a conservative, whereas I desire to prove that he has always been a true democrat, offering to legislate always in the interests of the great bulk of the community. It may be unpleasant to my honourable friend to listen to these remarks; but at the same time. I think it is due fo the House and to the country that a few of these facts should be made known, in order that the electors may realise that certain men have not preached, but have performed, for the benefit of democracy, that which others have been only talking about for so many years.",30
146,Mr STORRER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"We are here to work, and not to talk about ancient history.",30
147,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,My honourable friend has not done much since he has been here.,30
148,Mr STORRER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I have not wasted much time.,30
149,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I do not think my honourable friend has done anything. If a man is sent here he ought to give expression to his views, and not to interfere with other honourable members. If my honourable friend is not able to speak for himself, he should allow those who can. If he is satisfied to allow a few men to speak and act for him, and dictate what he shall do, well, we on this side, are not built in that way.",30

155,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I do not know anything of what took place at the meeting of commercial travellers on Saturday, but I am satisfied that my right honourable friend is quite able to give a proper explanation in respect of anything which he may have said or done there. His long and successful career in New South Wales, and the steady support which has always been extended to him by the people on all occasions, is a sufficient answer to those who make charges against him. Again, take the question of womanhood suffrage. Who but the members of the Labour Party were the strongest opponents of its enactment? In New South Wales its strongest opponents belonged to that party. I have a list of the names here.  voted against its enactment here are sitting on the Opposition benches now.",31
156,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"There was hardly any one in the House whovoted against that proposal. I do not remember the number now, but I believe that not half-a-dozen honourable members voted against it.  they are all sitting on the Opposition side now.",31
157,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I might just as well ask what was the opinion of the right honourable member for Swan. I dare say that he has differed from the honourable member on many questions, and because they happen to be sitting on the same side now, is my honourable friend to be blamed for anything which the right honourable gentleman may do ?  able member is doing so.",31
158,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I am not. These are the remarks which were made by Sir Henry Parkes when the Bill was introduced on the 5th August, 1:891The one most striking feature of it is that it now removes from the electoral system of this country every vestige of giving any advantage to one class of electors which is not extended to all others. That is the main feature of this Bill . I know that my honourable friends on the other side would not hesitate to say that he was a strong conservative. I find that the largest proportion of the members who detrivoted against the Bill in New South Wales were men who belonged to the Labour Partv. I admit that they have altered their opinion, and I do not blame them for doing that.",31

164,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I do, sir. Certain charges have been made against some honourable members on this side, ancl it has been stated that we have always been fighting for the interests of conservatives. I submit, sir, that it is quite proper for us to say that for many years, in parliamentary institutions, we have endeavoured to do the best we could to advance the interests of, not one section, but all classes in the community. This is the motion which was in the first instance submitted to the Legislative Assembly of New South Walesand That, in the opinion of the House, the franchise for the election of members of the Legislative Assembly should be extended to women, subject to the same conditions and the same fications as those imposed by law upon male tors.  the Deakin Administration?",31
165,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"It goes to show that, although honourable members opposite may pose as strong democrats and friends of the people, honourable members on this side of the House have always been associated with democratic legislation, have always been friends of labour, and when in positions of responsibility, where they could do something, have always endeavoured to pass legislation of such a character as would benefit the great bulk of the community.",32
166,Mr WEBSTER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,What is the date of the resolution which the honourable member has quoted ?,32
167,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The date is 1891. Of course my honourable friend may state that it would not have been carried except for the Labour Party.

176,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I should like to know exactly what your ruling is, sir?",32
177,Mr SPEAKER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"It is to this effect : That the honourable member is within his rights in discussing the policy of the party of which he is one, and to reply to the charge as to their not being true democrats; but he is not within his rights in doing that at inordinate length. I have asked him to confine his remarks on that subject to a simple statement; and I again ask him not to discuss in great detail the attitude of honourable members on the one side or the other in relation to affairs in New South Wales twenty years ago. He will be clearly within his rights in making such a statement as he has mentioned, but no honourable member is within his rights in taking up an undue share of the time of the House in debating at length matters which occurred manv vears ago.",32

We are not a party of men who cannot carry out an honourable compact. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat has told us, over and over again, that he does not believe in the methods of the Labour Party.",34
204,Mr SPEAKER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I must ask the honourable member to address himself to the question.,35
205,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"We , on this side, vote on some principle.",35
206,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable member's side would have taken the support of the Labour Partv if it could have been had.,35
207,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The honourable member cannot say that we, on this side, ever did that sort of thing.",35
208,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The Labour Party cannot drive us.,35
209,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The Labour Party attempted to drive us, but we refused to be driven; we came to Parliament to ask that the Electoral Bill should be passed, and we were prepared to appeal to our masters, the people, whereas you were afraid to go to the country.",35
210,Mr SPEAKER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The'honorabl e member must not address honourable members, because to do so is to provoke direct interjections and disorder. If honourable members at the further end of the Chamber will refrain from comment, they will enable the honourable member to make greater progress with his speech.",35
211,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Interjection s are usual, but they do not interfere with me, and I have no great objection to them. When the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was being considered, we were told that we were the enemies of the worlcers, because we voted in favour of majority rule. But it has since been shown that the workers throughout the Commonwealth approve of what we did. We were told that, after the amendments which we carried in the measure, no labour organization would attempt to register under it. The fact is that the principal unions affected by it have already applied to be registered under it. This again shows how little honourable members of the Labour Party really understand the workers. We know that one or two associations of railway 'employees have made application to be registered tinder the Act.",35
212,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"That does not prove it' to be a good measure, Mr SYDNEY ' SMITH - I prefer the opinion of the workers themselves to that of the honourable member, and their opinion of the Act is proved by the fact that they have applied to be registered under it . It is pleasing to me to find, also, that a great many Avorkers do not approve of the attitude generally adopted in regard to labour matters by some of the organizations. A great union in New South Wales, known as the Railway and Tramway Union, has become so dissatisfied at the action taken by some of the labour organizations in Sydney that it has withdrawn from those bodies. I feel sure that when the time arrives for an appeal to the country we on this side will have no reason to be afraid to meet the people. Our action in this and in the previous Parliament will commend itself fo the electors of the Commonwealth, because, as a party, we have endeavoured to do what we could to advance the best interests, not of any one section or class, but of the whole community. In some of the newspapers it has been contended that the free-traders in the last coalition were,traitors to the protectionists, but I can challenge any one to say that we were unfaithful to any compact into which we entered in that coalition. Although we had - most to lose, in view of the fact that the protectionists had had the moulding of the Tariff, we were prepared to allow the fiscal issue to remain in abeyance, in order that legislation of a useful character might be passed. The attitude of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat put an end to the coalition.",35
213,Mr WILKS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Where are the Government supporters ?,35
214,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"There are two present, and, as there are only four direct supporters of the Government, there is no reason to complain of the attendance of Government supporters. I did not intend to take up so much time, but so many things have taken place in connection with Federal politics during the last few weeks that I thought I might be excused if I. made a few remarks in regard to them. No doubt those who have decided not to sneak on this occasion would be very glad if we on this side adopted the same course. They have made manv charges against us, but the best proof that we are on the right side is that no honourable member opposite has been able' to show that we have misrepresented anything. ancl honourable members who for many years were strong supporters of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, associated with him in public life, and to whom in a large degree he owed the position he attained in Victorian politics, admit that the free-traders who were parties to the coalition acted throughout in a straightforward way. The honourable gentlemen to whom I refer have been loyal and true to their compact, and honourable members on this side have no reason whatever to complain of the loyalty of the four protectionists who joined the late coalition Government. It is to be regretted that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat did not act with more candour, at all events to honourable members of his own party, when he determined to make the speech which he delivered at Ballar-at. The honourable and learned member contends that we misunderstood that speech; but no reasonable man could view it in any way other than that in which we viewed it.  about ? '",35
215,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The honourable member should ask the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. The son for all the row was probably that the honourable and learned gentleman wished to get where he is at the present time. are in. a better position, because we nave acted in a straightforward way, and no one is able to say that we endeavoured to retain office under dishonourable conditions. I feel sure that when the time arrives for the people to speak on the question they will"" do so with no uncertain voice, and we on this side have no reason to be afraid to face them.",36
216,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS," Honourable members on the other side are anxious to close the debate, and to proceed to business-principally , I think ,; to close the debate. I can quite understand that a great many of them are anxious to put the events of the past week or two as far and as fast behind them as they can. would like to give the impression to the country that nothing unusual has happened - that what has occurred has been simply the usual turning over that takes place in Parliaments. But so far as Victoria is cerned there is evidence of something so unusual having happened that it will not be forgotten for a very long time. When we see public men who have been associated with each other for a quarter of a century, and some of whom have grown grey in the service of Victoria, flatly contradicting each other, I think it is due t© the public that they should learn something more about the cause of the trouble. I hold that it is more important that the integrity of our public men should be placed above suspicion than that we should pass on to the transaction of business without discussing the situation. Only those who are fully acquainted with the events which have passed are able to communicate the real facts to the electors. Therefore, I feel that it is my duty to speak in the presence of such honourable members as choose to remain, and to put the matter before the country under circumstances which will admit of my being contradicted if I do not adhere to facts. If I were to go to my constituents, I might make statements which could not be very well combated by those who disagreed from me. But here any statements, which are beside the facts, or which overstep the fair bounds of criticism, may be questioned. The friends of the Prime Minister have relied for their justification of his action entirely upon his previous good conduct and reputation. I admit at once that no one had a better record than rea- had the honourable and learned gentleman. At times, however, men of high reputation do things which are not capable of being We readily understood, and to my mind the action of the Prime Minister, if it does not lead to his condemnation, will arouse grave suspicion in the minds of many of his old friends. I should prefer to see that feeling removed, if possible. It is stated that all the present trouble has arisen out of the Ballarat speech. All the old friends of the Prime Minister thought that that utterance involved a breaking away from the coalition. I was in a minority practically of one, because I did not derive from it such a strong impression. This may have 1 been due to the fact that, although I did not particularly favour the appointment of the Tariff Commission, I was all along desirous that a board outside of ParliaThey ment should be appointed to inquire into the alleged Tariff anomalies, rather than that unauthorized statements should receive public credence. Reading the speech in that light, I did not regard it as .so significon- cant as did some other people. The Prime Minister has stated that when he delivered that speech, he was not disloyal to the coalition, that he had no idea of breaking it up, and that he was entirely misunderstood. I am sorry to say, however, that I cannot fit in his subsequent actions with his words. The part he has played has created a feeling that some explanation is necessary to free him from suspicion. I consider that the late Government placed themselves in a somewhat extraordinary position by bringing down the Governor General's speech at the opening of Parliament in the form in which they submitted it, and I was not surprised that the present Prime Minister should have moved his amendment upon it. What did occasion me .astonishment, however, was that before moving his amendment he should have made absolutely certain that the adoption of it would have the effect of breaking up the coalition. There is no question about that. There were parties to the coalition other than those who occupied the Government benches. The fact of the Governor General's speech being prepared, ancl being unanimously agreed to by Ministers, did not show that anv party was breaking away from the coalition. It merely meant that those men who had beendeputed to lead the coalition had decided take up a position which some people thought was not consistent with their duty as leaders. There were still twenty-nine members of the coalition party who were not in the secret of the Governor General's speech. Only nine honourable members knew of the decision of the Government, namely, the six Ministers, the Government whip, .md the mover and seconder of the motion for the adoption of the A d dress-in-Reply. There were still twenty-nine honourable members who had clone nothing to break up the coalition, and I contend that we were perfectly entitled to some voice in deciding what was to be done. But what did the Prime Minister do? He called together his own immediate supporters, and tried the Government before a packed jury consisting of ten honourable members, including himself. He then decided to move his amendment, and not only so. but to go to the leader of the Labour Party and enter into an arrangement with him which would have the effect of smashing the coalition. I contend that we did not receive fair play.",36
217,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,When does the honourable member say that that was done?,37
218,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Betwee n the time that the Governor General's speech was delivered and 7 o'clock on the same evening.,37
219,Mr WATSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I went to the Prime Minister-wha t else was there to do?,37
220,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"That is all very well. The right honourable and learned member for East Sydney was not the only man in the coalition who was capable of leading the Government, and I contend that the party of thirty-eight members should not have been smashed up merely because of his failure to lead the Government. In ad'dition to those coalitionists who had no part in the presentation of the Governor General's opening speech, there were sitting in the Opposition corner a number of honourable members who would have been loyal to the Prime Minister, and who, together with those who were at the time sitting on the Government benches, would have given him an absolute working majority in this House. If there had been no possibility of carrying on the Government under his leadership, the Prime Minister should have, at least, endeavoured to show us that such a thing was impossible. We had acted loyally throughout. We had sat on the same benches and had occupied the same room with members of the Prime Minister's party, to and after having enjoyed each other's confidence, we were parted with without a word.",37
221,Mr WATSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable member had left the Deakin partu some time previously.,37
222,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I am speaking of the two parties which had practically resolved themselves into one for the time being. We did not look so much to anv particular leader as to the leaders of the coalition party, and I believe that if the Prime Minister had attempted to form a Ministry, he could have clone so.",37
223,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,What ! form a party in the coalition against the late Government ?,37
224,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Not against the late Government. I believe that an arrangement might have been made between those who would have absolutely supported the Prime Minister ancl those who could not very well have arrayed themselves in opposition to him. I do not think that the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney would have crossed the chamber ancl joined forces with the Labour Party merely because the coalition party had selected another leader.,37
225,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I should have supported him much better than he supported me.,37
226,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The nine honourable members who were either Ministers or in the confidence of Ministers, could not possibly have crossed the chamber and thrown in their lot with the Labour Party.",37
227,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Hear , hear. The Prime Minister imight have'held office for double the time that I occupied it.",38
228,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"If the Prime Minister had been as loyal as he says he was to the coalition, he would not have undone in four hours what it had taken him three months to bring about.",38
229,Mr WILKS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable member means that a change of leaders might have been brought about without smashing up the team.,38
230,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Yes , I contend that it would have been quite possible to carry on the coalition Government under another leader. I can only say that the Prime Minister's position is quite unintelligible to me. He invited overtures for the formation of a coalition Government, in order to break up the intolerable position caused by the presence of three parties in this House. He induced his old friends to join that Government, and promised them his support. He was to act as their guardian angel, and he thought that he could render them more assistance by sitting behind them as a private member than he could in the opacity of a Minister. I do not know how long a period was occupied in effecting a change in his opinions, but it seems to me that the position which the honourable and learned gentleman took up when he delivered certain speeches throughout the country was somewhat inconsistent with his attitude to wards the gentlemen to whom I have referred. He became, it seems to me, the mouthpiece of parties outside this House who were opposed to the Government, and he attempted to play two roles. That is how he came to break down. The fact that he had taken the best care that the coalition Government should be broken up is clearly evidenced by the amendment which he submitted upon the Address-in-Reply - an amendment which many honourable members might have supported under other circumstances. Had he merely pioposed that the House should proceed with, business, many of us might have felt ourselves free to vote for it. Mr G. P>. EDWARDS - But not when it was submitted as an act of treachery.",38
231,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"That is where the'trouble came in. I was told about five minutes before the honourable and learned member submitted his amendment that he intended to move it, and that there was a majority of seventeen or eighteen in favour of it.",38
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The whole thing was cut and dried before he left for Western Australia.,38
233,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"H a d the honourable and learned member moved that amendment without having made all these arrangements prior to doing so, we should have been perfectly entitled to vote upon it as we thought best. But, havinggone clean over to the enemy, in a political sense, and having completed arrangements under which the amendment was bound, not only to kill the Government, but also the coalition, his whole position became inexplicable. He protests that he did not intend that his speech at Ballarat should be accepted as a disloyal utterance. But, had he been loyal to that coalition, how he could have thrown over his old friends, the right honourable and learned member for Balaclava and the honourable member for Gippsland-me n who are as much respected throughout Victoria as is the Prime Minister himself-is to me extraordinary.  ber seen friends fighting politically ?",38
234,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"As the honourable member for Kooyong put the matter the other day, the position now is that we have returned to the status quo ante Watson, with this difference, that the tail which used to waggle the dog is now very much stronger whilst the dog is very much weaker. 1 do not think that the people of Australia are particularly anxious to rush forward Federal legislation under the circumstances which were so well described by the right honourable member for Swan and others after the Deakin Ministry had been displaced. So far as the Labour Party are concerned, I have not the slightest fault to 1 find with them. They have acted in the most 'honourable way. We have merely, to look at the position which has been created to realise that they have remained loyal to their principles and have been actuated by no motives of selfishness or gain. Whatever the result of the recent change of Ministry may be, they occupy an honourable position, ancl if they get their reward in the future they will have earned it in a thoroughly unselfish way.  character.",38
235,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,An effort has been made to discredit the right honourable member for East Sydney because he endeavoured to draw a party line between Socialism and anti-Socialism.,38
236,Mr KNOX,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,He did good work in that connection.,39
237,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I agree with the honourable member, because it is the most clearly defined line in party jDolitics that we have ever known in Australia. It is. quite an honest line. But I think that too many definitions have been offered of the term ""Socialism."" When the whole thing is whittled down-and just here I wish to say that the honourable member for Bland, in bringing Socialism up to date, has rather cleverly shifted his foot, and in that respect has scored as against the right honourable member for East Sydney",39
238,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,No danger is to be apprehended from ourj Socialism.,39
239,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I think that there is quite enough danger. The line of cleavage between Socialism and anti-Socialism is made quite clear enough h\\ the platform which has been adopted by the Labour Party. The members of that party have, to some extent, resented criticism of the methods of Socialism. Yet they have adopted that term, so far as I know, quite voluntarily.",39
240,Mr WATSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The Labour Party have not yet adopted it .,39
241,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,That is rather curious.,39
242,Mr WATSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I am a Socialist, but the party to which I belong have not adopted the plank of Socialism.",39
243,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I understood that the honourable member for Bland stated in Sydney that no man. should join the Labour Party unless he were a Socialist.,39
244,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,But the party have not adopted his proposal.,39
245,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I think that members-of the party ought not to resent a certain criticism of the history of Socialism, and of what it might lead to.",39
246,Mr WATSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,What might free-trade lead to?,39
247,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,It might lead to the referendum.,39
248,Mr WATSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,As proposed by the right honourable member.,39
249,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The impression which the term Socialism conveys to various minds is very different. Most people imagine that Socialism always tends to what, in Owen's time, was called "" The Equal L if e . "" As I understand it, the term Socialism was first adopted by Robert Owen and his disciples in England about the. year 1826 or T827.",39
250,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,That was Communism.,39
251,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"There are differences of opinion in regard to the equal life. I believe that the word "" socialism "" was first used by Robert Owen and his disciples in 1826 or 1827, and, after a time, it displaced the term ""Communism"" on the Continent. The honourable member for Hindmarsh says that the equal life means Communism.",39
252,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I do not. think that the equal life is possible.,39
253,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,But the honourable member believes in an equal dividend.,39
254,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I do not believe in an equal dividend either.,39
255,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Rober t Owen endeavoured to found a Utopia in Indiana. That is the equal life to which the honourable member may perhaps refer. Robert Owen spent something like .£30,000 upon land, buildings, mills, and so forth, but the first signs of an emevte came when he attempted to enforce the details of an equal life. The first proposal to which objection was taken was that all should wear a uniform dress. The men were to wear colourless jackets, with trousers fastened to them by buttons. I do not know how some of our figures would look if we were so attired. We are told that the best men in the colony sulked.",39
256,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The Government provide that uniform dress shall be worn in our destitute asylums.,39
257,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Quite so. The women of the colony were to be garmented in frocks, reaching a little below the knees, and pantalettes, the intention being, I suppose, that all should show an equal measurement about the ankles. To this the women objected. One of the conditions of the colony was that freedom of speech was not only a privilege, but a duty, and the women met, and absolutely refused to wear the prescribed dress. They agreed to ""boycott""-to use a modern word-an y women who wore such a dress. In other words, they decided not to speak to a woman so attired, and that was the beginning of the breaking up of the colony. This was the kind of equal life associated with the original Socialism, and it has probably given rise to the manv humorous or ridiculous schemes which so many people couple with present day Socialism.",39
258,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,We do not ask all bur men to wear red shirts.,39
259,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,But Socialism is ridiculous from whatever point of view we may regard it.,39
260,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I agree with the right honourable member, and I think a 'great mistake has been made in expending ammunition, at a long range,, upon those extreme views of Socialism that are never likely to be carried out. My own opinion is that before the realization of such extreme views is possible, we shall have become a more sensible people, or shall have been mollycoddled out of existence in the face of some more virile race. I personally do not concern myself with these extreme views. My desire is that we should guard ourselves, as far as possible, from the destruction of those characteristics of independence that have made our race what it is. The desire that those characteristics should be preserved is really the foundation of the contest against Socialism. Even the watered-down platform of the Labour Party goes a great deal further in the directio.n of risk or danger to our. natural characteristics than is desirable ; it goes so far in that direction, at all events, that we should enter a very strong protest against it. The leader of the Labour Party says that he desires, in the first place, that the State shall deal only with monopolies. I believe we all feel that an occasion might arise here when we should have to try to break down monopolies ; but it would be idle to break down one monopoly by creating another which would be worse. A State monopoly would be worse than a private one could be.",39
261,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Why not abolish present State monopolies?,40
262,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I think we all admit that there are certain matters which, owing to the complexity of modern civilization, require to be regulated by the State. distinction that I draw between the two parties is this: That those who advocate Socialism pure and simple, would indefinitely extend socialistic control, while those who are opposed to Socialism, contend that all that the State is called upon to do is - to control and regulate the highways and byways of individual enterprise. The two positions are clear and distinct.",40
263,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The scheme of the Socialists would close up private enterprise.,40
264,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Certainly .,40
265,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,How would it do so?,40
266,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,How could we have private enterprise if we made every man a State servant?,40
267,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,We have done that in connection with our railways.,40
268,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"We certainly have State servants carrying on our railway services. The leader of the Labour Party, in the course of the debate on the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , made what I think was a very sensible observation when he said that if he thought that the handing over of the iron industry to a State monopoly would lead to the exercise of undue political influence he would rather favour its retention by private enterprise. Having made that admission, he must find himself on the horns of a dilemma. If he is prepared to extend the system of State control to one industry, he must be prepared to extend it to another, so that in the end the whole of the State servants would become masters of the situation.",40
269,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Master s of their own business.,40
270,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,But if all were masters there would be no workers.,40
271,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,And no business.,40
272,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Exactly . Another plank which has been included' in the platform of the Labour Party is that of co-operation. I believe that we all are in favour of cooperation if it be on voluntary lines, but compulsory co-operation",40
273,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Is a contradiction.,40
274,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,It is ; it is as great a contradiction in terms as is compulsory conciliation.,40
275,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"We had had a lot of compulsory conciliation in Sydney. the Mr SKENE - I think that the cooperation movement has gone further in Belgium than in any other country. There those engaged in the system have discovered, however, as they have gone along, The that their methods must harmonize with ordinary business methods.",40
276,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Co-operatio n in Belgium has been successful only in regard to distribution, and not in production.",40
277,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"That has been the ex- perience in almost all countries. The system has been very successful in England, so far as distribution is concerned.",40
278,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,And in manufacture.,40
279,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,To only a very limited degree.,40
280,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,It has been successf u l in the manufacture of boots and other things.,40
281,Mr SPEAKER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Order ! The honourable member for Hindmarsh will have an opportunity to speak later on.,40
282,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I claim to have had as much experience of co-operation as any honourable member has had. For years I was managing director of a co-operative wool and produce company, and had the 8o Ministerial [REPRESENTATIVES.] strongest board in Melbourne to assist me. That board included such men as Samuel MCCaughey",40
283,Mr ROBINSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Was it strong in matter of weight, or in brains?",41
284,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,It comprised men who had done very well for themselves. We never drew a farthing as directors' fees.,41
285,Mr ROBINSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,That was strength; not many of us could see that system out.,41
286,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"We gave the system a very fair trial, but discovered that the mere doing away with the middleman-and that was practically what we were doing-and the mere carrving on of business upon a cash basis, did'not entirely fill the bill. We found that credit was of much more - importance to the persons associated with the industry than was cash. We found that as soon as a client doing business upon a cash basis wished to extend his operations he came to us for 'advances, and if we were unable to offer him the advantages that others did we lost his business. Throughout the ramifications of our co-operation we encountered difficulties that we had not anticipated, and I am satisfied that that would be the experience of others engaging in any enterprise upon co-operative lines. Take the co-operative stores in the farming districts throughout the country. They have all been a failure. A storekeeper' is practically a banker for these people. The promoters of these co-operative stores really want somebody to come in from outside ancl help them with money. The Belgian cooferateurs do not hold with the view that the State is to, control all the means of production; they hold that it would make their theory ridiculous to push it to the last consequences. These are the latest views that I have been able to find on the subjectHe does not rail at' capital, but says he must have capital to buy machines, horses, & c , and, they borrow money at current rates from their own members. He believes in a minimum wage, but has found it necessary to insist upon an equivalent minimum product. Mr Graham Brooks, who has written an excellent little work on the social unrest, says The aim of socialistic politics is invariably transform industry. But this politics will never be free from the delirium and the dangers of unreal hopes and tipsy schemes until it is disciplined by business duties and obligations. Until they began to adopt in Belgium the methods of ordinary business men they had no success. They say now of their French Statement. brothers that they are trying to run the universe before they have educated themselves to being able to run a shop. Speakthe ing from memory, there are only eleven instances of any sort of success in co-operation for production. It is in distribution, and in matters of that kind that it has been successful. a sign of Mr. JOSEPH COOK - It is easy for a man to imagine that he can do on a large scale what he cannot do on a small scale.",41
287,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Of course it is. I wish to refer to a practical matter of which I was reminded the other night, when the honourable member for Parramatta was pointing out that the difference between Canada and Australia is that we are not able to offer inducements to immigrants. In a previous session I mentioned that in my opinion there is a method by which we can offer a certain amount of encourage1 ment. I spoke then of the forms of closer settlement which had been devised; but at that time there was one which had not been tried. Instead of buying up big estates and attempting to settle men in that way, I suggested that the whole country should be open to any one who might choose to come and arrange with an owner for the purchase of land, and that the Government, whether Federal or State, should simply find the funds, so that a man of small means could acquire a small piece of land. I am glad lo say that since that time the Government of Victoria have introduced a clause into a Closer Settlement Bill which gives them ari opportunity of assisting any one to buy land in any part of the country, without first going to the expense of buying a big property.",41
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,And in New South Wales the Secretary for Lands has the same thing in contemplation.,41
289,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I noticed that when Mr. Ashton was speaking at Albury the other day he spoke in the same strain. I - see no reason why the Commonwealth should not adopt a system of that kind to attract from the old country, not persons who have no money, but persons with some capital, who would be able to provide work for our unemployed. I believe that if the people in Great Britain and Ireland knew to that on arrival they would be assisted in. that way it might lead to systematic immigration. There is no chance, however, of bringing the labouring classes here unless the contract clause in. the Immigration Restriction Act is altered, I think it .was intended by most of us when the clause was passed that it should be used only to prevent persons from coming into the Commonwealth at a time of strife, ancl accepting less than the current rate of wages. If I remember rightly, the honourable and learned member for Indi wished to make it applicable' merely to persons who were brought here in times of strife, and at an unfair rate of wages. '",41
290,Mr ISAACS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I do not remember exactly what I said, but I do not think I made any such limitation.",42
291,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Then it was the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne who made that limitation. Mr ISAAC'S - I remember making some allusion to the American law as to contracts.,42
292,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"That is what' it was. An understanding appears to have got spread throughout the country that our Immigration Restriction Act is on all-fours with that of the United States. But an American would scout the idea of keeping a citizen of one part of the United States or its dependencies out of any other part. The peculiarity of the contract clause in our Act is that we actually debar our fellow-citizens from landing on our shores. An American from Alaska may go by sea to California, just as an American can go from the Philippine Islands. Again, when Hawaii was taken over,, all the privileges of citizenship were given to it as a territory. I should like to impress upon the Government that it would be well for them to amend the Act. I should also like to impress upon the Labour Party that they have been pushing this matter to too great an extreme.",42
293,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"We had a bad experience before that clause was enacted. - Mr SKENE - If I understood the honourable member for Bland aright, when ' the clause was introduced he did not think it would go so far as it did under the administration of the then leader of the Government. In the.first instance, he was to move an amendment, and when we told him that it was altogether too drastic he got the honourable and learned member for Ballarat to draw up another amendment. If honourable members will look up the debate they will find that the question was discussed on those broad lines, and that the amendment was submitted with a view to preventing men from being brought into the Commonwealth at a time of strife or at less than the current rate of wages. I think that the) present Government could not do better than move to amend that clause.",42
294,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,They will not; they are not game.,42
295,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,That may be so.,42
296,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Why did not the other Government do it?,42
297,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Ver y probably - the late Government would have done it if they had been left alone. When the Hon. Winter Cooke, who formerly represented Wannon here, was in England, he wrote to me about this matter. He asked me to appeal to the present Prime Minister, and to urge him to move in the matter, which he said was so much misunderstood in London",42
298,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Misrepresented , not misunderstood.",42
299,Mr SKENE,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The misunderstanding may have arisen in some degree through misrepresentation. But there it is; and I believe that the present Government would make a very excellent beginning if they would amend that section. I hope that when we proceed to business they will * do something towards altering the opinion which the people of the Commonwealth have concerning Federal legislation. If they can do that, and preserve that spirit throughout their legislation, they will do much good. But looking to the House, as it is constituted, I am afraid that there is very little chance of their doing so.",42
300,Mr ROBINSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS," It is not my intention to delay matters by speaking at great length, but I feel that some remarks made by my honourable friend who has just resumed his seat will bear repeating. They are that we should not attempt to pass over the events of the past few weeks, as though there had been an ordinary change of Government. The change of Government has been achieved by means, which appear to be, fo say the least of them, extraordinary; and, to m\\ mind, they are in some respects such as to reflect very going severely upon the reputation of those who engaged in them. It is generally agreed that the beginning of the change arose out of the speech made by the present Prime Minister in his constituency. That speech he has told us was the speech of a loyal supporter of the Reid-MCLean Government. All I can say is, that it was the most extraordinary speech from a loyal supportei that I ever read or heard of. To show that mv view is not solely that, of an opponent, I have here a cutting from a newspaper, which I venture to say, is of all the newspapers in the Commonwealth, the most devoted to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Melbourne Herald, which, in season and out of season, has trumpeted his good qualities for the last fifteen or twentyi years. The Herald said on ist July:The Ballarat speech provided the last essential factor. Mr Deakin has since stated that his intention was not to intimate that he, one of the makers of the coalition, had decided to withdraw his support from it, but the Reid-MCLean Government interpreted the remarks of its decidedly candid ""supporter"" as a plain intimation that it had ceased to possess his confidence, andnotwithstanding Mr Deakin's disclaimer-it is not easy to see that the speech could have any other meaning. That is not the judgment of an opponent. It is not the judgment of a hostile critic. It is the judgment of one of the honourable gentleman's most enthusiastic supportersthat it is not easy to see from his speech at Ballarat that he had any intention but to turn out the Reid-MCLean Government at the very earliest opportunity. That being so, I do not think that the Prime Minister behaved in a way in which he ought to have behaved to the late coalition Government and to his own) colleagues in it. It is 'all very well to say that he did not mean to turn out the Government. The judgment or the ordinary man in the street is, after all, the judgment that disposes of these questions. The man in the street puts it in a rough-and-ready manner, such as I suppose you, Mr Speaker, would not permit me to imitate; but, we may say that the man in the street puts it somewhat as follows:-"" Mr Deakin went to Ballarat ancl made a speech which every one thought was meant to 'turn the Government out. He afterwards said he did not mean to turn the Government out; and he proved that he did not mean to turn the Government out by moving in the. House a motion which did turn them out."" All the refinings and eloquent perorations of the Prime Minister will not remove from the public mind the impression that he has not behaved in a way that we have been accustomed to from him. I can say, with all earnestness and sincerity, that there was no man in Victorian politics of whom I had a higher opinion than the Prime Minister. opinion has been very rudely shaken by the events of the past few weeks. for this reason that I felt it to be my duty to emphasize the remarks made by the honourable member for Grampians. Mr Robinson. gard to the programme of the present Government, I think we can safely say from the papers that have been supplied to us - fro m the drafts of Bills ""and the clauses that they contain-that the influence of their masters is apparent in the most unmistakable way. The pressure from the third party is absolutely apparent in the two papers which have been put into our hands. I venture-to sav that the larger proportion of the present Government-had the late coalition remained in office, and brought forward such Bills-woul d have voted against the proposals that are now brought forward in their name. But circumstances alter cases. Ministers hold office with the feeling of insecurity arising from their dependence upon the good will of the Labour Party. Therefore, their legislation is shaped on these extraordinary lines to win the support and admiration of that party. I do not blame honourable members of .the Labour Party. There can be no doubt that the triumph is in their hands. They have fairly won it. They have done nothing which can be called dishonourable. In everything they have done they have acted with scrupulous honesty. The position they are now in redounds to their credit. They are in a position to secure-and they have the power to secure - legislatio n and administration, such as they desire, and they have to take responsibility for neither the legislation nor the administration. We have been informed by the Prime Minister that, amongst the various projects to be put before us, will be proposals in connection with preferential trade. If that be so I hope that when they are considered by this House, they will be discussed in much better style than was the case last session. Honourable members may recollect that the present Prime Minister made a brilliant speech in favour of his motion, , and then buried himself in a room in some other part of the building during the rest of the debate. The attendance rarely exceeded half-a-dozen members during the discussion of the subject. I hope that Ministers, at least, will put in an attendance during the time when the question is debated. I intend to move an addition to any motion that is submitted to the same That effect as the addition which I moved on the previous occasion, namely, that the preIt is ference that we give to Great Britain should' be of such a nature as will lead to an increase in the trade being done between. With re-Great Britain and Australia. In regard to other proposals of the Government, we have been informed that the previous Government had intended to introduce some Bills upon the same subjects. The title - of a Bill may lead us to believe that we are all in favour of it ; but the clauses of the measure may make all the difference between support and opposition. I suppose that a majority of honourable members-perhap s 95 per cent, of them-were In favour of a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. But very few honourable members were in favour of that measure in the form in which it was brought in by the right honourable member for Adelaide, whose absence on the present occasion we so much deplore. I do not think there ""was anj'thing like a majority of honourable members who were in favour of that Bill in the shape in which it was dealt with at the instance of the first Deakin Government. Had that Government remained in office that Bill would have passed at the dictation of the third party, in the shape in which it was introduced. We all know that it was the defeat of - tfiat Government, the succession the Watson Government to power, and the subsequent accession of the Reid-MCLean Government, that enabled us to get provisions of a more moderate character inserted. We shall get from this Government Bills with the titles of which we all agree, but I am confident that when the clauses are examined - they will be found, like the clauses we have already seen, to be of an exceedingly drastic character, showing that they are a bid for the support of a certain section, and are put forward as a return for that support. ConstituThe tional government by two parties, one in office and one in opposition- a Ministry who will be responsible for their acts, ancl will have power to carry out their wisheshas, I am afraid, gone altogether, so far as this Parliament is concerned. Not until the electors have an opportunity to express an opinion will there be any chance of an alteration in the present system. So long as the present Government retain office, aided by the honourable members of the Labour Party, so long shall we have Ministers, consciously or unconsciously - it may be unconscbusly in certain cases - shapin g their legislation as the Labour Party desire. That is highly undesirable; and I agree with the right honourable member for Swan that it is very much better for the Labour Party to administer their physic from the Government benches than from the cross benches.  and learned member vote to put the Watson Government out?",42
301,Mr ROBINSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Because I do not believe in the physic of the Labour Party. I know that the honourable member for Maranoa would not agree with the physic I should prescribe. If I had a choice between a Government such as the present and a Government such as that of the Labour Party, I should unhesitatingly prefer the latter. I feel confident that we should get from a Labour Government legislation according to Labour ideas; but the men who brought forward that legislation would be responsible to the House and to the country. Under the present system the Labour Party can shelter themselves behind the plea that the legislation is not their legislation, but that of the Deakin and Isaacs party. It is not my intention to speak at any greater length. I merely wish to say that I do not like the outlook for the remainder of the life of this present Parliament. The sooner we go to our of constituents the better, even though that course should disturb the equanimity of the honourable member for Darwin.",44
302,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS," I regret very much that in rising I should have anticipated the Attorney-General. It is, however, quite a new feature to see the honourable and learned gentleman in the Chamber. He professed on a previous occasion to have a burning anxiety to get on with the business, but since then he has been seen here but seldom, and I may be pardoned for not observing he was in the Chamber. honourable and learned member may repeat in this Parliament his conduct in the last Parliament. It was his custom to walk through the House, perhaps once before tea, and then go home and enjoy himself for the rest of the evening, having spent the previous part of the day in laborious work over his own affairs. Under our remarkable system, the attendance of an honourable member for even one or two minutes is recorded as an attendance for the whole day.",44
303,Mr ISAACS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,How does the honourable and learned member know about my attendance? He has not been here very much himself.,44
304,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"When here I have noticed the conduct of the Attorney-General. I quite agree that one or two of his attendances may be worthhalf-a-dozen attendances Ministerial [REPRESENTATIVES.] of other honourable members. I have always held that sometimes the attendance of one honourable member, who has devoted himself to a particular measure, and gives the House the result of his consideration, may be of very great value. Really the best work is done, not by a record in ance, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports ancl the honourable ancl learned - member for Corio seem to think, but by a. knowledge on the part of honourable members of what is before the House, and an ability to express an opinion. I regret to see so few supporters of the Government present. It was my desire that those honourable members who have expressed themselves desirous of going on with the business, should have an opportunity to hear what ought to be done and how the Administration ought to conduct themselves.",44
305,Mr HUME COOK,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,There are as many honourable members on the Government side as on the Opposition.,45
306,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"That is so, just at present, I admit. I do not know that it is necessary for me to deal with the intrigues which displaced the late Government. It is true there was a coalition formed, which involved the sinking of principle on both sides. Free-trade and protectionist principles had to be sunk on one side and the other, and some sacrifice was certainly made by honourable members - I was one of those who did not regard with great favour the sinking of the fiscal principles which I support. It seems to me, however, that before we can begin to discuss by what principles a Government should be guided in carrying on the business of the country, we must first take care to preserve the Government itself. If the Government cease to exist there can be no carryiing out of principles on one side or the other. It appeared to me, from statements made by many members of the Labour Party, including the leader of that party, that we were face to face with a condition of affairs that would not have allowed of the assertion of any principle whatever. The Labour Party have adopted, or they say they intend to adopt, the new programme of Socialism. I do not know why the word "" labour"" is not good enough to describe the party, because, properly understood, it is wide enough to embrace everything. The word is certainly. wide enough to embrace all that great section of the community whom we in Parliament are chiefly concerned in looking after, namely, the workers of the. community; and by that I mean - workers of ail classes. I do not inStatement. tend to back up the drone, whether he be of the wealthy class or of the poor class; to fit both there is an apt term-loafer . If a man is a loafer, he ought not to be able to call on Parliament to assist him in any way; there are enough honest men and attend- women in the community who require the whole of our attention. We ought not to stretch our laws for the benefit of a small section; and we cannot but be surprised that, of late, the Labour Party have chosen to think that only those who refuse to work are those to whom we should offer consolation. In fact, the ""bummers"" of society are to be most considered-onl y those who loaf about the parks, crying out for work,- and praying they may never get it, are to have their complaints listened to. It was quite refreshing to hear the Treasurer of the Queensland Government offer some remarks on this subject. He explained that although the members of the Government to which he belonged called themselves a Labour Government, they were not addicted to any platform nonsense, and would try to assist only those who endeavoured to assist themselves; that, in fact, their labour platform was a platform for the benefit of workers, and not of idlers. I could wish that we were animated 1 by the same spirit in our legislation. But we keep trying to stretch our laws so as. to include a section of the community whom we cannot and ought not to help. I am afraid that if we did help them we should probably only succeed in taking from them the very smajl spirit of independence that now exists amongst them. It must be very painful to us all to have to make any strictures on the personal integrity of the Ministerial Party, but in outside life terms would be used, concerning the breaking of his word by the present Prime"" Minister, that would be hardly parliamentary. I can only say that personally I felt a great deal of regret that the honourable and learned gentleman should be the one to act as he did. I regret that there is not some party outside of Parliament which would treat the honourable and learned gentleman in the way in which I think he deserves. There can be no doubt that if men generally were to act in the same way, no such thing as social life, as we understand it, would be possible. Men would be absolutely unable to trust one another, in even the smallest concerns of life, and social life, as we understand it, would break down. If the honourable and learned gentleman had a conscience, one might say that it would be better to leave him to its reproach. I hold that he has lowered the standard of our public life as no other person has ever done yet. I cannot call to mind, nor can any other honourable member, any instance in which a man has so deliberately broken away, and, so far as we can see, solely on the ground of some personal gain, from an alliance entered into by himself. I , for one, have always objected to - the very small allowance that members of this Parliament receive. I have always said that the discrepancy between the allowance given to honourable members, and that given to Ministers, is too great-no t that, that given to Ministers is too large, but that that given to honourable members generally, is very much too .small. I regret to have to - say that as the late conduct of the Prime Minister does not come up to the standard of honour,, which I , for one, think ought to be observed, I am forced to the conclusion that there must have been some - special consideration causing the honourable and learned gentleman to act as he did. If it was pecuniary pressure which led the honourable and learned gentleman to act as he did",45
307,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I rise to order.,46
308,Mr GROOM,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,This is absolutely contemptible.,46
309,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"My point of order is that it is unparliamentary to attribute motives to any honourable member, and especially motives of a pecuniary character.",46
310,Mr SPEAKER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I must ask the honourable and learned member for Werriwa to withdraw any reflection he has made on the honourable and learned member for Ballarat.,46
311,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"If the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will show that I nave made any reflection, I shall be glad to do so. So far,, what I have pointed out - is that there is a very great difference between the allowance given to honourable members generally, and that given to Ministers. I am not saying that the. Prime Minister acted as he did under pecuniary pressure, but I point out that if he did so",46
312,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I say that that is a great deal worse.  - sinuations ?,46
313,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Does the honourable member for Grey think that pecuniary pressure is a dirty thing? If so, according to the honourable member, every worker throughout the Commonwealth is a dirty man, if he 'happens to be hard up.",46
314,Mr SPEAKER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Order ! I ask the honourable and learned member for Werriwa to withdraw the suggestion which he made just now, that the action of an honourable member of this House was the result of the difference'between the salary paid to honourable members and that paid to Ministers.",46
315,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I have not said so.,46
316,Mr SPEAKER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Order ! Any such suggestion is an imputation of motives; certainly it would be a very improper motive, and such a suggestion must not be made.",46
317,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I have not yet said that that was mv imputation, sir.",46
318,Mr SPEAKER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Will the honourable member kindly withdraw the suggestion ?,46
319,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"If Mr Speaker thinks that I have made such a suggestion, I will withdraw it ; but I cannot withdraw words which other honourable members have put into my mouth. Does Mr Speaker think that I have made such a suggestion?",46
320,Mr SPEAKER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I do think so.,46
321,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Unde r the circumstances I withdraw. I think it is a matter f o i very great regret that there should be such a considerable difference between the salaries paid to members generally and to Ministers, and I am satisfied that such a difference ought not to be allowed to' continue. If it were remedied it would put an end to intrigue, and there would not be. as there may have been in the past, any room.for a suggestion that honourable members - are acting under pecuniary pressure in taking a certain action. I ' d o not suppose that even the honourable member for Melbourne Ports would argue",46
322,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I object to the thing entirely. It is bad taste.,46
323,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I do not suppose that even the honourable member for Melbourne Ports would argue that it is an honourable thing for a man to break his word.,46
324,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I do not admit that any man has broken his word.,46
325,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I should like to know whether the honourable member thinks that it is an honourable thing for a man to break his word? Men who, like myself, never cared for the alliance, yet waited on. the honourable'and learned member for Ballarat', and asked him whether he intended to give""the^ alliance his full support, and whether he really understood the position he had taken up. The answer has already appeared in print, and is known to us all. The honourable and learned gentleman pointed 86 Ministerial out that, so far as he was concerned, the alliance was for the life-time of the present Parliament. There can be no harm in saying what has already appeared in the press, that the honourable and learned gentleman intended to observe ""the compact for the life-time of the present Parliament. We know how it has been observed, and I say that the House, after the exhibition which we have had, would do well to take into consideration the fact that there should .not be room even for a suggestion that honourable members may feel pecuniary pressure to such an extent that it may affect their political conduct. I hope that some effort will be made to increase the allowance paid to honourable members generally. always held that the present allowance is much too small, and I am not now, for the first time, advocating that the remuneration made to honourable members should be considerably increased. The Federal Parliament, instead of meeting for two, three, or four months in the year, as was suggested at the first Convention, has so iar met for something like seven months in each year. This utterly destroys the possibility of honourable members pursuing any other avocation, or engaging in any othe' walk in life, and, as the the average parlimentary life of members is something like ten years, during that time they should °t least receive such remuneration as would enable them to carry on their work when they retire from a parliamentary tion. Their position as members of Parliament is dependent upon popular favour, and that is such a very erratic thing that one cannot reckon upon the continuance for any definite time of the allowance. shall not dwell on the subject but I point out that, in my opinion, the discrepancy to which I have referred has been an awful I fear to be unparliamentary-and felt that so keenly as ' since I have observed the conduct - of the honourable and learned member for The first measure which the late Government proposed to submit to Parliament was the Redistribution of Seats Bill. should be regarded as the first duty of any Ministry to submit a measure of that kind, because we are all aware that the statisticians of the States have demonstrated that New South Wales is entitled to an additional representative. Their have been made on the same basis as those which gave to Victoria its twenty-three representatives. Therefore we cannot in Mr Conroy. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Statement. justice deny to New South Wales that which has already been granted to Victoria. I would go the length of saying that the* denial of an additional representative to New South Wales, in conjunction with the refusal of this Parliament to settle the Federal Capital question, will probably result in the secession of New South Wales from the Federal union.",46
326,Mr WATSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"What , rebellion?",47
327,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Unfortunately , the conduct of this Parliament has been such that not a single State would endeavour tocoerce any other into remaining in theunion. For this position we have ourselves to,blame, because we have endeavoured to I have trample upon the rights of the various States. Can any one be surprised if the Parliament of New South Wales insiststhat the union should be dissolved ? That could easily be done. We have the example of Norway and Sweden before us.. The Norwegian Parliament carried a resolution in favour of a dissolution of the union between the two countries. It is true that a referendium is now being taken on> the subject, but that does not alter the faot that separation has already been resolved upon by the Parliament. Judging from the feeling exhibited in New South Wales, I venture to say that the State Executive, if supported by the resolution of the State Parliament, would not hesitate to act in the direction I have indicated. In posisuch an event, how could the Federal Parliament enforce its authority? Would it call out the military? Every one knows that there would be no such thing as war. Everything would have to be I peaceably arranged, because the Federal further; Government would be unable to call uponany State to help it . Neither the majority of the people in any one State nor the mamisfortune- jority of the people in the CommonwealthI never are in favour of Federation at the present time.",47
328,Mr EWING,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Would the honourable and Ballarat. learned member vote in favour of destroying the union? I am sure he would not.,47
329,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"If this Parliament is It bent upon denying the rights of New South Wales, and upon breaking the Constitution - as it has broken it, and is continuing to break it-the States will be justified inwithdrawing their confidence, and in refusing to obey any law passed by us. A p calculations parently some honourable members think that it would be difficult for any State to withdraw from the union, but if a resolution were carried in favour of such a step by the New South Wales or Victorian ParWales liament the Federal authorities would be helpless.",47
330,Mr THOMAS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Suppos e a municipal council passed a resolution as the honorof revenue. able member suggests, should we take notice of it?",48
331,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"--No comparison can be instituted between a municipality and sovereign States such as New South WalesWales and Victoria. Could the honourable memone ber inform me what course would be open to the Commonwealth if New South Wales declined to allow a Federal writ to Would he insist upon the military being sent to give effect to it? , Mr THOMAS - I am in favour of law and order.",48

Mr CONROY-We know that an attempt was made to increase.the area of the Federal Capital Site largely with the idea of preventing the Parliament of New South from agreeing to our selection.

I point this out, because if we had really been earnest over the question an honest attempt would have been made to settle it. We not act, however, as we should have had we thought that the Seat of Governdeny ment Bill was likely to result in the Capital site really being chosen. I sayi that the tion-it belief is general throughput New Wales that the Commonwealth. Parliament was not in earnest in choosing the Capibal site, and that it has not acted in such as to create in the minds of the people that State a belief that we really intend establish the Federal Capital there. If were necessary for the purpose of my ment, I could show that one of the essentials in selecting 'a Capital site is it should be situated upon the main connecting our two great cities, and that should not be located at a distance from that line involving half-a*day's travel, involving a delay of all the mail matter the Commonwealth for that period.",49

361,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I spoke of the mails the Commonwealth. The honourable member must recognise that the amount of mail ter relating solely to Commonwealth affairs which is carried over our railways, is large indeed, and that its tendency will to increase. If we are to look forward the socialistic millennium, which the party ' to which the honourable member belongs wishes to bring about, the quantity of mail matter carried will be beyond computation, I should think that the complaints alone would represent five or six times the quantity of mail matter which is carried at the pre_ s e n t time. The next matter to which I desire to refer is that of the redistribution of be seats in this House. Will honourable members seriously argue that it is possible for to continue our present line of conduct without offending the people of New South acquired Wales? Already they are exceedingly angry about this matter. Rightly or wronghi they look upon the creation of the present to Government, headed by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, as a delibenot rate attempt to thwart New South Wales in New her endeavour to obtain her proper share of representation in this Parliament. Do we in the Ministerial outline of policy any terstatement by the Prime Minister, which isor likely to disabuse their minds of that notion*? Do we not know that if we decline to give in New South Wales an additional representative in this House-and the refusal of the did Ministry to introduce any Bill dealing with done the matter indicates that they intend to that State any additional representa will constitute another reason South why the people of New South Wales should take the action I have referred to through their State Parliament. If they a way are unable to obtain their proper share of of representation here, there is no other course to open to them but to ask their own Parliait ment to take such action as will either break arguup the union, or, at all events, restrain first the Commonwealth from collecting any that further Customs revenue until these matters line have been set right We know very well it that if the New South Wales Parliament carried a resolution to that effect-o r even thus if a referendum of the States were takenof upon the matter-ther e would be an overwhelming majority against the continued existence of the union.

It must not be very forgotten that in New South Wales 84,000' be or 85,000 votes were cast against Federato tion, and I know that the conduct of the Commonwealth Government in imposing very heavy taxation upon its people aroused the - greatest friction. That friction, however, would have been overcome had the peoplebelieved that it was deliberately levied by the representatives of Australia as a whole.. But are we today acting as the represenBallarat tatives of Australia when we deny to New South Wales of a vote.

Would it not be said that that state of the conduct of the present Ministry. affairs constituted plural voting upon extremely large scale?

364,Mr WATKINS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,When did the honourable to member for Bland make such a statement? Can Mr CONROY - In May of last year.,50

366,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Most of the remark? taken which I have attributed to the honourable for member for Bland were made by him when replying to the deputation of May-day Socialists, which waited upon him as Prime 'Minister. He then said' that he thoroughly approved of their aims and objects; that it would be their duty to cut off the industrial shackles that were binding the community, and in fact, to repeal all those laws that were oppressing the poor.",50
367,Mr BATCHELOR,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable learned member is confusing different matters.,51
368,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"After the formation of the Labour Ministry the House was asked TO adjourn, week after week, to enable the Cabinet to draw up its programme. We were told that they were going to bring forward legislation that would benefit the whole community, raise the wages of workers by two or three shillings per week, and bring prosperity to the homes of the poor. But after the House had adjourned again and again to enable the Ministry to consider the measures that were designed to bring about these results, the very first business with which the then Prime Minister asked Parliament to proceed was that of ordering the printing of a despatch announcing that henceforth members of the first Federal Parliament would be entitled to the prefix of "" honourable.""",51
369,Mr THOMAS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"This might be all very well for a public meeting, but it will not do here.",51
370,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I am not complaining, but in view of this action on the part of the first Labour Ministry in the Federal Parliament, what became of the boast of the democrats that their first business was to lift business from the slough of despond into which it had fallen? We were asked to order the printing of a document, so that henceforth members of the first Federal Parliament should be entitled to the prefix of "" honourable.""",51
371,Mr BATCHELOR,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,If it had been a substantial concession to honourable members the honourable and learned member would not have objected.,51
372,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,That is so.,51
373,Mr MALONEY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Did the honourable and learned member accept the title of honourable ?,51
374,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I am only speaking of the wonderful piece of legislative work that constituted the initial proposal of the first Labour Ministry.,51
375,Mr CROUCH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable and learned member ought in fairness to say that the matter had been decided by the previous Ministry.,51
376,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Does not the honourable and learned member know that, despite the thousands of other questions that might have been dealt with, the one thing that was animating the members of the Labour Ministry was the desire to get the title of "" honourable ' publicly conferred upon 1 them, in common with - other honourable and members, in this way? The matter was discussed for a month, and the Government of the day bitterly combatted the opposition raised by some honourable members to the printing pf such a despatch. Are any of the workers of Australia today better off for the printing of that despatch ? Has the load which oppresses the poor been lightened in this way ? Is the condition of the workers better than it was before it was decided that that despatch should be printed ? Meanwhile, Mr Speaker, I must draw your attention to the absence of honourable members from their duties. [Quorum formed.] Probably one of the most surprising things in the present situation is the melancholy confession of impotence and incompetence which has been made by the Labour Party. Because, although when the motion which brought the present Ministry into office was carried, the Labour Party comprised twenty-eight members, as against eighteen members of the Deakin party, still they practically confessed by their action in declining Ministerial responsibility that their party included no men with sufficient abilityj or intelligence to form a Ministry. This is not singular, when Ave look back upon their past career, and glance at their actions when they occupied the Treasury bench. It is a remarkable thing that after the statement made by the honourable member for Bland as Prime Minister, that theyi Would bring in measures which would make the poor better off, and banish sin, misery, and po\'erty from the land, which, in fact, AA'Ould make the country flow with milk and honey, their very first proposal was to ask the House to print a despatch announcing that the title of "" honourable "" had been conferred upon the members of the first Federal Parliament.",51
377,Mr FOWLER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable and learned member is very badly off for an argument when he stoops to that.,51
378,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Will the honourable member deny that the Labour Ministry introduced that proposal, and fought most resolutely for a month to have the document printed; that, after they had' secured an adjournment to enable them to formulate a policy, the only thing which they thought of sufficient importance to bring forward was that wonderful proposal?",51
379,Mr RONALD,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The onh\ one ?,52
380,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"How'gratefu l have all the workers to be for the existence of the Labour Party, and how confidently they can look forward on the next occasipn to something of the same sort, though, perhaps, still more brilliant! I am not surprised that members of the Labour Party should not like to hear of this most melancholy exhibition of incompetence.",52
381,Mr WATSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,We are enjoying spectacle of the honourable ancl learned member making an as of himself.,52
382,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Is it making an as of one's self to describe exactly what the first Labour Ministry did? If it is asinine to speak about the matter, how asinine it was to act as they did ! The true asses in that case were to be found in the members of the first Labour Ministry.",52
383,Mr SPEAKER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Order ! The honourable and learned member must not use that expression.,52
384,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Perhaps , sir, it is hardly necessaryi for me to use the term regarding the members of the Labour Ministry. The proposal to print this document occupied one of the precious three months during which they were ini power. resolutely they fought against our trying, to prevent the despatch from being printed! Here, day after clay, when we were occupied in preventing the Labour Party from commemorating how they had abandoned their democratic principle, that no titles were to be used, they made speech after speech in defence of the motion, that the despatch should be printed. ",52
385,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I am glad that the honourable member joins with me in thinking that more active steps ought to have been taken to give effect to the statement of the honourable member for Bland as Prime Minister, that he would repeal laws which were pressing upon the poor. He did not take a solitary step to relieve the burden of indirect taxation. Considering that the annual burden of indirect taxation amounted to£,g,000,000, one would have thought that it would have been the very first question to engage his attention. What did theyi do after carrying this brilliant fight of a month to a successf u l issue? They proceeded with the fagend of an Arbitration Bill , which I think ought not to have been introduced here. After all , it was a matter of political window-dressing, if one may use that term, because, during the last fifty years, there has been only one occasion when any necessity has arisen for the application of such legislation. I hope that another period of fifty years will pass before the necessity recurs. ",52
386,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,During the big maritime strike in 1891.,52
387,Mr RONALD,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The only occasion?,52
388,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"That ""is the only occasion, I think, when such legislation would have been of any advantage. Our experience the of this class of legislation certainly goes to show that it would never be of any advantage to the men whom it is supposed to benefit. That strike lasted for onlyj a short while, and if the workers had had to sit clown and wait for the Court to come to a decision, they would all have died of starvation in the meantime, judging by what has taken place in New South Wales, where periods of twelve and eighteen months elapse before decisions can possibly be arrived at. I mention this matter to show the extreme paucity of legislation on the part of the Labour Ministry, and also to point out how utterly impossible it is to place any reliance on their profession that they are the men to save the country.",52
389,Mr WATSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,""" The chap to save the How country "" sits usually on the opposite side.",52
390,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I understood from the many professions which the honourable member and his party had made, that they were the men to save the country. Over and over again I have heard the assertion that all we have to do in order to make everything bright and happy is to introduce legislation ; that is to say, to trust to Parliament. Well, if misery can be banished from the land by legislation,- we are making a mistake in not having three Parliaments. The first proposal of honourable members opposite ought to be to have three ^Parliaments, Ito sit in, eight hours' shifts, on every day in the year, to continually grind out law's. If such a simple little remedy as getting something printed on a sheet of paper, with the Royal arms on the top, ancl with the declaration that Parliament passed this Act, can make us all well and happy, why should we delay for a single moment? But the fact is, that in their' heart of hearts men know perfectly well that legislation can never accomplish many of these things, and even prevents progress.",52
391,Mr TUDOR,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable and learned member must be an anarchist.,52
392,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"When I see many of the laws which are passed, and observe how they interfere with people, I must confess that it does stir up a feeling of anarchism in me, using the word in its true meaning""without rule."" In that, which is its proper sense, I must say that I should like to be "" without rule "" altogether sooner than have laws passed such as we suffer from in many cases. With regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, we are all aware, no matter what we may say to the contrary, that that legislation cannot affect any dispute in any one. State. It is absolutely useless for that purpose. Therefore, when some honourable members went about explaining to the public the wonderful effects that were to be derived from the Act, it was, as I have said, so much political shop dressing. They knew perfectly well that it could not have the effect intended. Take the Act as it stands. Has it been used? Does any one contemplate how it can be used? Does any one contemplate that as it exists today it can be of any advantage whatever to the great bulk of the people of Australia? It is not necessary for me to point out that if mien cannot strike they are nothing more nor less than a lot of niggers. If men can be compelled to work when they db not want to work, they are in no better position than slaves used to be in so many parts of the world. I must confess that when I saw men in New South Wales refusing to work when ordered to do so by the Arbitration Court, I felt that if ever there was an occasion when men were justified in breaking the law, it was then. I felt that I could go to those men, and say to them, ""Stand .out against any law that will compel you to work whether you like it or not: ancl if they should force you to go to work, whether you like it or not, work in such a manner that they will-never ask you again.""",53
393,Mr TUDOR,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"If the honourable learned member were on piece-work, how would he get on?",53
394,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"If I were on piece-work, the more I did the better I should like it, provided I got paid for it. I never believe in doing work without being paid for it. What was the cause of the defeat of the .Labour Party? It was their insistence on putting into the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill a clause which absolutely went against their own principles as a Socialist party. If Socialism means - anything it means equal opportunities for all. Fortunately for the country, they were defeated on a clause in which, so far from keeping to the programme which they had mapped out for themselves, they tried to prevent men from having equal opportunities, and said that unless men belong to a union they should not be allowed to work. If men are not allowed to work, if they are not allowed to earn the means to live, they simply have to starve. The reason why men work is to earn a living. One of the most extraordinary things in connection with the Labour Party is that, after all their bold professions of equality, they absolutely ventured to try to force upon the people of Australia, a clause which was absolutely a denial of the very justice that they say that they claim for all. When they were defeated on that I believe that it was to the secret delight of some who belong to the caucus party, but who found themselves forced by the vote of the majority to vote for the clause. I have not the slightest doubt in my own mind that the more intelligent and better-read members of the Labour Party must have denounced such an iniquitous idea as that a preference was to be given to any one class of workers over another. It was a new doctrine to put into the laws of a country, and it was an absolute abnegation of the very statements which they made at other times. I am glad to say' that today we have from them a confession of how miserably they failed, and how unfit indeed they were to carry on legislation. Although there were twenty-eight members in the Labour Party against only eighteen in the other little party, they practically said, ""We really are conscious that we are unfit to legislate, ancl that what we introduced before only ended in muddle. We are not suited for carrying on this work. Amongst us there are none who can draw up statutes and interpret them properly, or there are not. sufficient of us. Therefore, we shall and have to decline the work. Although we are the largest party, and 'although it will be our votes that will put out a Ministry, we shall have to call upon this other small party to form a Government. We will tell them what legislation we want, and they will have to frame it and carry it out for us. ' When one looks at their position from ! that point of view, it is a most melancholv confession of incompetence. I am surprised that at least four or five men' amongst the Labour Party did not ""at once'break away from them. I am amazed that some did not say, "" We, at all events, are'competent, whatever some of you may be, of our ability-to share in the legislative work of the country, ancl we will do so."" But I suppose they were conscious of the work of the past. I suppose they recognised that they were able to take no credit whatever to themselves, and manfully confessed their inability to legislate. A more painful spectacle could not, .1 suppose, have been presented than when the other day Ministers were being criticised as unfit for their work in a Federal Parliament. Nothing could have been more painful than to hear the Labour Party cheering and concurring in the statements that the present Ministers are not fit to be Ministers at all, and yet - at the same time having to confess that those Ministers represent more intelligence rhan they have amon-gst themselves. They have had to agree that the Ministry should draw up Bills and introduce legislation, because, apparently, they have been unable to find among themselves men capable of performing such work.  and learned member read all this?",53
395,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"It is writ so large that "" he who runs may/ read."" Why was not the honourable member for Bass called upon to take the reins of Government?

The first thing they did was to submit a motion for the printing of a despatch intimating that the Imperial authorities had agreed to the title of honourable being conferred upon members of the first Federal Parliament. The next thing they did was to pass the fag end of an Arbitration Bill, which could not apply to any disputes in one State alone, ancl which gave preference to one particular class of workers over another. It has taken me just fifteen seconds to give a full record of the work performed by the Watson Government.",54

410,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"It would be a live party, at any rate. I am not in favour of that Socialism which permits, through a tariff, the robbery of the. poor. I have never been in favour of depriving any men of a farthing of their earnings.",55
411,Mr TUDOR,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Is that why the honourable and learned member supported the last Ministry ?,55
412,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The last Government at least insisted that there should be no further attempt to levy taxes on the masses of the people. I think that a fair opportunity of testing the feelings of honourable members will be presented when the Bonus for Manufactures Bill again comes before us. There is no question that in the event of that measure being carried the bonus, amounting to £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 , will be distributed amongst those who subscribe the capital necessary to carry on iron works - capital amounting to from £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 5 0 0 If that measure be passed, I shall take care that the money required to pay the bonus is not taken from the workers, but is raised by direct taxation. If the money is to go to capitalists that class alone should contribute.",55
413,Mr TUDOR,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Will the honourable learned member move in that direction?,55

416,Mr BAMFORD,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable member is now talking sensibly.,55
417,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"It must be remembered that I do riot advocate taking money from any one citizen to ' give to another. I have objected all through to one citizen being deprived of his earnings f the benefit of others- I do not care what class derives the benefit. I sometimes lose patience with those honourable members who occupy the Government benches when they assert that it is anti-socialistic to take money be from the worker to give to the rich, but that it is socialistic to take from the rich> to give to the poor. If there is to be any robbery, it should apply all round. If we: went in for wholesale robbery we should reduce the country to a state of anarchy. If my property is taken it will not affect me, because I shall not bealive to know that it is taken. While I am alive it will not be taken, or, if it should be, and I should get hold of those who take it , they will not live toenjoy it . After this exhibition of incompetence^-and I am not blaming the members of the Labour Party for it, it is one of those things which they could not help, because they did^not know any better, and they have my sympathy. So far from attacking them for it , I am commiserating and sympathizing with them that they should"" have to sit behind such a Ministry as the present. I think theirs is a p it if u l situation.

418,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"It is very plain. Wasthere not a letter from the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, stating exactly what policy he intended to pursue, and did' not the members of the Labour Party aphis prove of it? We know that if they did' not approve of it, the Ministry could not remain in office beyond tomorrow.",55

The first of them is the taking over of the debts of way. the States. ",55
421,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I am not saying that it might not be a useful thing to do. Sometwo thing of the kind will eventually have be done. The first plank in the new Labour platform, is, then, the taking over of debts of the States. I do not know how it is proposed to be done-probabl y by the transfer of so much stock into the name the Commonwealth as guarantor. supposing we do take over the debts of the States, in what way will the. mass of the workers be benefited by that?",56
422,Mr RONALD,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,A great deal.,56
423,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Will the honourable member tell me how? Is it proposed to lessen the taxation imposed on the workers in any way, even supposing that the Federal Government is enabled to save £ 5 0 0 , 0 a year by taking over those debts? It has not even been suggested by Ministers there will be the saving of a penny to made by taking over the debts.",56
424,Mr RONALD,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Then we will not take them over.,56
425,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"In that case, how will the proposal help the bulk of the workers? Honourable members must recollect that .am dealing now with a platform that belongs not only to the present Ministry, is indeed the platform of the Labour Party, because it has been submitted to them for their approval. The items of it were mitted to the honourable member for Bland as leader of the party, even before the whole of the Ministry were sworn in. the circumstances, none will deny that this Is the platform of the Labour Party, as I have said, the first plank in it taking over of the debts of the States. The honourable member for Bland told that there are laws oppressing the poor. In my opinion, there are laws pressing heavily upon the poor, but is there attempt to repeal one of them in this measure? W i ll this proposal to take over the debts of the States lighten the load the workers in any way? I am satisfied that it will not.",56
426,Mr CROUCH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,It means the payment less interest.,56
427,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I should like the honourable and learned member for Corio to tell the workers of the Commonwealth, any platform, that by the mere transfersolation ence of the debts of the States to the monwealth-the bondholders remaining same-thei r load will be lightened in any The honourable and learned member knows that at the present time, in all probability, the Federal Government could not borrow even at as low a rate as one or of the States can borrow. I am sorry to to say that that is so, but, rightly or wrongly, people who have money to lend the have the idea that capital could not be safely invested here. I think that to a large extent that idea is held erroneously, beof cause most of the talking here will end in But smoke, and most of the proposals for confiscation, and so on, are never meant, are really so much clap-trap and political shopdressing. I believe that in most cases it will be found that capital will be just as safe here as elsewhere, but we cannot get away from the fact that, rightly or wrongly, confidence is not given to us, and our credit is to a certain extent undermined and 0 0 destroyed. Credit is a great thing for any country, and leads to a greater acquisition that to wealth than does anything else. This be has been recognised for so many years that, not long since, I came across a passage in Demosthenes, written over 2,000 years ago, in which, when haranguing those who were trying to injure the State, he pointed out that by their wild talk they were destroying I credit, and he went on to use words which . are absolutely applicable to our position but today, saying, "" If you are not aware of this, that credit is the greatest capital of all towards the acquisition of wealth, then subyou are utterly ignorant."" I must say that those words are as applicable to the circumstances of today as they were to those In to which Demosthenes addressed himself.  and, member must be pretty hard up if he has is the to go back 2,000 years for an argument. Mr CONROY.'-It only shows how far us back honourable members opposite have fallen when a reproof addressed to legislators 2,000 years ago is equally applicable any to them. So far from being progressive first or advanced, and so far from being those who bold aloft the banner of progress, they of have fallen back to a conditions of things similar to that existing over 2,000 years ago. These are the men who talk of marchof ing on, when, instead of a march on, they are engaged in a march backwards.",56
428,Mr STORRER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Tal k on.,56
429,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"If the honourable memfrom ber could understand it would be some confor me to talk on, but I am sure that, Comhaving ears, the honourable member will hear the not. The next thing in the Labour platform N - is a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions. I will say for the Labour Party; that they did not attempt to deceive the old people to whom old-age pensions would be a great blessing. It does seem a great pity that in two of the great States persons should be debarred from obtaining pensions merely because they may have changed their place of residence; and it is to be regretted that the State laws are not amended in this respect. Under our present system of taxation the bulk of the revenue is contributed by the workers; and no Commomvealth or State can allow its citizens to perish in their old age and misfortune. This is a question in which the cost, although an element, is not the primary consideration. If want and misery were caused by the withdrawal of all the old-age pensions, there would be a searing of the heart of the community, and avenues of consolation would be closed up, thus creating greater evil than is caused by the payment of those allowances. The late Labour Party have never pretended that old-age pensions can be introduced all at once.",56
430,Mr WEBSTER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Who are the "" late"" Labour Partv ?",57
431,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I ' understand that the Labour Party have now become the Socialist Party; it is very difficult to follow all these changes. I heard the Prime Minister declare that it was a sine qua non that all members of the Labour Party should be Socialists, and a similar statement has been made byi the honourable"" member for Kennedy and the honourable member for Bland during the last fortnight. I am all the more surprised at the Labour Party allowing this proposal to be dangled before the public, when we know that the Federal Parliament is not in a position to deal with old-age pensions. If nothing else stood in the way, such pensions could not be instituted without the assent of the States.",57
432,Mr KING OMALLEY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Why not ?,57
433,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Surely the honourable member would not propose to raise fresh taxation when the present old-age pensions are provided by the States?  tion advocated by the honourable and learned member, we could raise fresh taxation.",57
434,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I admit that; but, as practical politicians, we should only proceed with measures which have some chance of being carried. Once let the Labour Party resolve how fa r they are prepared to repeal the taxes which now oppress the poor, and they will receive such support from this side as will enable the measure to be carried into effect very easily indeed.",57
435,Mr KELLY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Provide d there is no sham about the matter.,57
436,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Quite so; provided that, instead of placing this proposal on the platform as something that may be done, care is taken to introduce a measure. Then we come to the proposal for the encouragement of rural occupations. Is it not nonsense to put such a proposal in a programme like this? The very first encouragement given to rural occupation is to place an extra duty of £ 3 5s. on harvesters. Taking the average profit to a farmer from ordinary wheat land at ios. per acre, yjear in and year out,, we find the produce of more than six acres absorbed by this increase of duty, just as though the crop had been destroyed by a pest.",57
437,Mr CROUCH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The profit is greater than> that.,57
438,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I can assure the honourable and learned member that, year in and year out, the profit is not more than I have stated, although, of course, in some years it may reach 25s. or 30s., or even £ 2 . If a farmer, after paying interest, and receiving remuneration for his own and other labour, could be assured of a profit of ios. per acre on the average, he would regard"" himself as in a very happy and comfortable position. Of course, if it be contended"" that a man is not to be paid for his own» labour, then the profit may be greater.",57
439,Mr WEBSTER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,How long does a harvester last?,57
440,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"A certain percentage has to be written off for depreciation each year, but I should sayi a harvester wil l last nearlv six years. We must remember that in spiteof the existence of the Labour Party in the various States,- we have no Agricultural"" Tenants' Holdings Act, and there is no tenant right in improvements. An extra duty of £ 3 5s. has been imposed"" on harvesters, in addition to the £ 4 already charged, and that means a serious tax on all farmers who use thosemachines. If that is the way in which the Government propose to "" encourage rural occupations, the sooner these proposals are given up the better for those whom they affect. It is monstrous that the bulk of thefarmers should perpetually have taxation thrust upon them. Then it is proposed that there shall be bounties for new products. That is to say, the Government propose in some way to build up industries which areproved not to be suitable industries, by the fact that they will not pay for themselves. What fund has Parliament on which to draw except the money of the citizens? And what right have we to take money from one set of citizens to give to another? How can we say that we shall create a new industry? A new industry, I take it, is an industry in which after work has been done the product of that work is more valuable than its cost. Consequently if we encourage men to. engage in some occupation in which, after work has been done, the result is worth less than the cost of production, so far from having created an industry we have created a parasite. Let me give the simplest illustration of all. Let us suppose that some man said, "" We want to encourage men to work,"" and as a result we took a quarter of the community and put them in gaol. If , whilst they remained there,* they could 'earn onTy a quarter of the amount necessary for their subsistence, could that undertaking be regarded as a profitable one? Could the men be said to be profitably employed? Certainly not The bigger the gaol"" the greater would be the misery for us; and so far from calling that gaol a ""factory "" we should designate it an incubus upon the country. turn to a benevolent asylum, or a gaol, and point out that their inmates are not earning one-quarter of what is required for'their subsistence, it is very strange that some members of the Labour Party immediately exclaim, "" Very well; the community is contributing the other three-fourths, and those men, so far from being engaged in an industry, are really feeding upon the country."" They will admit that at once. But if we change the name of the institution, an.d, instead of calling it a benevolent asylum, designate it a factory, they refuse to call it a parasite, and prefer to call it an industry. That is a gross misuse of terms.",57
441,Mr CROUCH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Does the honourable ancl learned member call every factory a parasite?,58
442,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Certainl y nof. are many factories in which the articles produced are worth more than the cost of production, and by so much do they add to the wealth of the country. But when we have a factory the goods produced by which are worth only 18s., although the cost of production is £ 1 , I say that"" we lose 2s. in the £ 1 upon its maintenance. The more it produces the worse off will the country be. The bigger its production the sadder the spectacle it will present. Mir. CROUCH - Then every badly pro^ tected trade is a parasite?",58
443,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Yes , if the goods when produced are worth less than the cost of production.",58
444,Mr CROUCH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,That is the free-trade view.,58
445,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"It is the view which is entertained by all common-sense men in every walk of life. That a man is enabled by law to extract something from his fellow citizens does not alter the case in the smallest degree. The question at issue is, "" Is that extra expenditure necessary to keep any particular factory going?"" "" if it is, that factory is a parasite upon the community-and I do not use the word in any offensive sense. It is practically a factory which is drawing its life-blood from the public.",58
446,Mr KING OMALLEY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"A r e the railways a parasite, because all of them do not pav?",58
447,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"It is true that all of them do not directly pay; but indirectly they do, in that they carry a very large quantity of produce to market. 'ThereWhen we fore, the whole of our citizens should bear the cost of development for a short period. But if none of our citizens were engaged in productive works we should have no funds upon which to draw to enable us to pay interest upon those railways. While on the subject of interest, I wish to refer to those honourable members of the Labour Party who declare that they are Socialists. I am surprised that the bulk of them do not know that there could be no such thing as interest paid by Socialists. How could any Socialist pay interest? If he did so, It would obviously be because somebody had lent him money, and that individual ""would be sitting idly down whilst others were doing the work.",58
448,Mr MCCAY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,That should be rather an inducement to establish Socialism.,58
449,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"It would be to the fortunate individual who lent the money. There Mr MCCAY - Firs t borrow the monev, and then turn Socialist.",58
450,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"That is a very old saving. It was heard of thousands of years ago. First borrow the money, and when the interest gets sufficiently heavy pass a law to abolish the payment of interest. In reading history the honourable and learned member must have noticed how frequently laws were enacted for the abolition of debt. The natural sequence was that they raised rates of interest to all the workers of the community three, four, and five fold. That is exactly what a lot of us are doing by our wild talk at the present day. But I am thankful to see signs that people are beginning to regard a lot of the statements which are made here merely as wind, and to treat - them accordingly. When I hear the honourable member for Bland declare that if the State took over factories it would pay for them, and that if it appropriated land it would pay for it, I cannot understand how he can call himself a Socialist. money which would be loaned to the Socialist Government to be regarded as safe?",58
451,Mr WEBSTER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,What has the honourable and' learned member been talking about during all the recess?,59
452,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"About a body of men who have dubbed themselves Socialists, the bulk of whom do not understand the meaning of the word.",59
453,Mr WEBSTER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Does the honourable and learned member apply that remark to his leader ?,59
454,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I certainly apply it honourable members who dub themselves cialists. I am aware that some members of the Labour Party think they are bound to adopt that term out of loyalty to their party. For them. I entertain nothing but sympathy, because they are bound by the caucus, and are unable to repudiate of the statements which are made. One of the many definitions of Socialism was given on. by the honourable member for Grampians this afternoon, when he showed how that term had come to be applied to the folto lowers of Robert Owen, in lieu of the communism. I think that an old corn-law rhymer- I refer to Ebenezer Elliot-wrot the following four lines upon "" What is communist?"" :What is a communist? One who has yearnings For equal division of unequal earnings. Idler or bungler, or both, he is willing To fork out his penny and pocket your shilling. If honourable members opposite wished put that system into practice, I should with them, knowing that many of them have much more than I have to divide. What the next item in the Government proour gramme? The speedier and cheaper transpose portation of meat, butter, and fruit . . Mr ROBINSON - Unde r their Commerce Bill they propose to prohibit our export - trade.",59
455,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I was just about to deal with that point. Here we have the suggestion that the Government think that the fewer the restrictions placed upon trade the better; and yet they have brought in a Bill to regulate commerce. Most honourable members of this House are utterly ignorant of trade and commerce; yet we are to be asked to decide exactly how every man who spends the whole of his time, and risks the whole of his capital, in commercial pursuits', shall employ that time and capital. Is it not reasonable to suppose that the Bill must be doomed from the first? While the GoIs the vernment speak in the one breath of encouraging the speedier and cheaper transportion of our products, they propose in the next to give the Minister of Trade and Customs power to declare how our commerce shall be carried on. The matter is not even to be subject to the control of Parliament. It is to be dealt with by regulations drawn up by the Minister, according to his own sweet will. One would think that we were prepared to regard Ministers as being divine when we propose to vest such powers in them. It was the placing of like powers in the hands of Ministers that led to the to corruption in New South Wales, of which Sowe have lately heard so much. It was the action of a Government in placing such extensive powers in the hands of Ministers, in order, as they said, to prevent hardships arising in certain cases, that led to the swindling and corruption that went on for many a time in the mother State.",59
456,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,It is still going,59
457,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"We hope that, as the result of the publicity which has been given this system, we shall hear no more of it . term Do honourable members recall to mind the anxiety betrayed by some members of the e present Government lest trade with the a Marshall Islands should be injured? I was surprised to find the Prime Minister speaking with a sense of relief at the prospect of trade with that group being once more free to Australia, for I had been under the impression, judging by the legislation in to troduced by him as Prime Minister, and be also as Attorney-General in the Barton Government, that his chief desire was to is block trade. For what other purpose was high Tariff wall erected? What purwill the Commerce Bill serve if it be not that of hampering our shipping trade? It is evident that the Ministry do not understand the present position of Australia. Another proposal embodied in their programme is that of attracting population. 1 confess that if it could be accomplished by the Commonwealth Parliament I should be very glad; but let me say very plainly that I am not in favour of attracting any population to these shores, unless it can be shown that there is a chance of settling immigrants on the land. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It would be a crime to encourage immigrants if that could not be done.",59
458,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The only result would be to increase the misery that exists. As the Federal Government does not own an acre of land, it cannot hope to attract population in this way. The matter must be dealt with by the States. I hold that population would be attracted to Australia rapidly enough if we did away with legislation which really restricts immigration. The honourable and learned member for Parkes put the matter very clearly when he said that he was concerned not so much with the question of whether our laws restricted immigration, as with that of whether people believed that they did. The real point is that many people in England ancl elsewhere honestly believe that our legislation restricts immigration.",60
459,Mr BRUCE SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,They have had so many object lessons.,60
460,Sir JOHN FORREST,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,How long have they been of that opinion?,60
461,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Eve r since the affair of the six hatters.,60
462,Sir JOHN FORREST,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Immigratio n practically ceased ten years before that time.,60
463,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Does the right honourable member say that our legislation has had no effect on the inflow of population?,60
464,Sir JOHN FORREST,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I say that for the last ten years there has been practically no influx of population.,60
465,Mr BRUCE SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Our legislation has aggravated the trouble.,60
466,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I . think the right honourable member for Swan will admit that the legislation passed by this Parliament, whether good or ill , has had some effect on the inflow of population to Australia.",60
467,Sir JOHN FORREST,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I repeat that there has been really no inflow for over ten years.,60
468,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"But the right honourable gentleman must remember that for some years before Federation we passed through a period of unexampled depression. Bank after bank failed, and for something like six years times were so bad in Australia that no one thought of writing to his friends in other lands to encourage them to come here. Considering the fairly large outflow of population from England at the present time, the Treasurer will surely grant that we are not obtaining our proper share of it . It is highly desirable that we should seek to attract population, provided that we can offer the people land upon which to settle when they come here; but however largely we may talk about the matter, the fact remains that the Commonwealth Parliament has no land to offer immigrants, and therefore the Government, in saying that they propose to make an effort to attract population to our shores, are pretending that they can do something which is not within their power. That is my protest. I do n<t wish people to be led away by these will o'-the-wisps. If we can do these things, I should be very glad to know from the honourable member how we can. I can show him one way in which, while he may not be able to attract population, he can prevent rumours getting about that immigrants would not be allowed to land. The amendment of the Immigration Restriction Act which is required is not a very great one. There is no question that the* contract clause of the Act was intended to apply solely to men being brought out under contract to fil l the places of men on strike.",60
469,Mr BRUCE SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,That was stated to be the intention.,60
470,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The honourable and learned member is correct, but it has beenapplied in quite another way by an administrative act alone. It was applied in the case of the six hatters, and there is no doubt that its application resulted in a distinct injury being done to the community as a whole.  mortem on the ooor hatters ?",60
471,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,No ; but the provisionstill remains which allowed that case to occur.  bers of the other side alter it ?,60
472,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Knoc k it out.,60
473,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Let me state quite plainly why I do not. It is because of the general ignorance in the House of its ill effect We cannot carry the amendment which is required-w e canonly point out the evil which has arisen. The next item on the Government programme is a proposal for the appointment of a High Commissioner. While I am not altogether averse to the appointment of a High Commissioner, still I must first see that some arrangement is made with the various States to have one office instead of six offices in London. Unless there is some likelihood of that result being achieved, unless the States are more willing to entrust their affairs to our hands than they appear to be, I can see no reason for supporting such legislation at the present time. While this want of confidence exists between the States and the Commonwealth, I cannot see my way clear to sanction a proposal, not to limit, but to increase expenditure. The next measure on the Government programme is one relating to navigation and shipping. If the Government keeps on interfering with navigation and shipping, and the legislation is framed on the lines of the Bill which the honourable and learned member for Ballarat introduced, and he has the support of the Labour Party, we shall probably find that this restrictive legislation will have effect, not of increasing, but of seriouslv diminishing, the number .of men engaged in navigation and shipping, and that, so far from being a boon and a blessing to the class they profess to help, it will operate to their injury. It is clear that if the policy of restriction be pursued much further, we shall have all these companies combining. We shall, in fact, compel men to go into a trust a generation before they otherwise would do. Possibly the necessity for a combination might never arise here, but by our legislation we are absolutely forcing employers to combine.",60
474,Mr BRUCE SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"B y the Sea Carriage of Goods Act, for instance.",61
475,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I must admit that I was one of those who at the time did not thoroughly grasp the full effect of that measure, and I hope that if a case comes to be tried, it will be found that, perhaps, the .view I take even now is more nearly correct than is that of some honourable members who look upon the measure with greater fear than I do. I admit that it was a measure which ought to have received far. greater consideration than it did. . It was brought in just at the fag-end of the session, when all of us were preparing to go away. I had a consultation with the honourable and learned member for Angas, and I must say that I did not like, one or two of its provisiQtis. . . . . .",61
476,Mr BRUCE SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,It interfered with freedom of contract between ship-owners and shippers.',61
477,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I cannot go quite so far as that. So far as it made the law of negligence relating to land carriers applicable to sea carriers, I was absolutely with the Bill. Because I do not think that persons ought to be able to hold themselves out as carriers, and then contract themselves out of the law of common negligence.",61
478,Mr KELLY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Includin g the railways.,61
479,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I ,do inot think that Commissioners managing Government railways ought to be allowed to contract themselves out of the law of common negligence.",61
480,Mr BRUCE SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,They are monopolists; but there were fifteen shipping companies competing for the export trade of our people.,61
481,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"That tends to make it « very much more difficult. I am assured on very high authority that one or two of the shipping companies charged a higher rate where they took responsibility on bills of lading, but that nearly all the shippers the decided to ship under bills of lading under which no responsibility was taken.",61

483,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"They have since found that it is not going to operate to their advantage, because, of course, so far as they are concerned, the rates will have to be increased. I certainly thought that a person should not contract himself out of gross negligence- I do not think that anybody should be able to do that-if he receives pay for his work. Of course, if he does not the same law will apply as applies to land, carriers.",61

485,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"What are the other measures which the Labour Party propose to bring forward, because, of course, I consider all these to be entirely their measures? We know that they could not be brought in, or proceeded with, without their approval. With regard to the Bill relating to navigation and shipping, if we are not careful a further danger will arise. The Home Government have already intimated that we ought not to go outside the Merchant Shipping Act, and the great shipping firms at home certainly have some rights which ought to be considered. When we recollect that every, acre of land in Australia was voluntarily handed over by the Home Government, without making any charge to the people of the then young community, we ought to give great consideration to any suggestion which they make to us now. They have told us in effect that to legislate on these points, without showing consideration to all the boats engaged in the trade, is to go outside the Empire.",61
486,Mr BRUCE SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,That is a preliminary to refusing the Royal assent to one of Bills when it goes home.,62
487,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"We ought to take warning from the despatch which has ceived, and not run the risk of getting a snub, because there is no getting away the fact that we are dependent upon the power of England to allow us to legislate as we have done, and that without that tection we should not exist as a nation today. After some of our Federal legislation, I doubt whether Australia would be owned 80 tons to the acre to be produced. by the Australian people today, whether some other settlement would not have taken place here, if it were not for the power the British Navy.",62

491,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,They thought it was vating with white labour. right that the contracts should be made; but they never pretended that they would bring about prosperity.,62
492,Mr WATSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,They will not compare with the Standing Orders in that respect!,62
493,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I do not feel in that mood which would induce me to fight any one, or Ministers would become so seized the necessity for an amendment of the ject before. I then asked , "" Why should Standing Orders as to say that the matter had become imperative. The next matter to which I have to allude is the honourable continuance of the sugar bounty for a further period. On no fewer three previous occasions I have pointed out that the continuance of the bounty is, in my opinion, iniquitous. We have this simple fact to contemplate-that the to be made. owners of the richest lands in Australia are allowed to tax people living on other trick ! lands to the extent of nearly £ 1 0 an acre. Let us test that statement. I think the honourable member for Maranoa will agree with me that at least 20 tons of cane is a fair average yield for an acre of land in Queensland. That represents a little over 2 tons of sugar-roughly , 2J tons; our but we will take it at 2 tons of sugar to the acre.",62
494,Mr WATKINS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I believe the average is been re15 tons of cane per acre.,62
495,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I assure the honourable from member that the facts show that the average is 20 tons. . No doubt the honourable member for Herbert has known land to proproduce as much as 60 tons to the acre.,62
496,Mr BAMFORD,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Yes .,62
497,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I , myself, have known So that in taking the average at 20 tons I am doing nothing extraordinary. We will say of that 10 tons of cane produce a ton of sugar. That means 2 tons of sugar ro corner the acre on an average. The duty is £ 6 per ton.",62

The next What I say is that the bonus at presentgiven is £ 5 per ton of sugar, if grown byi t white labour, and that means a bonus of In other words, for cultivating an acre of land to produce sugar, we give a man £ 1 0 . .

I remember that an member opposite said, "" Poor ? You do not know what you are talking than about!"" A couple of Queensland members said that they were the richest lands in Australia. The very reason why I called them poor was to cause those interjections ",62
500,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The honourable member said so at the time, after he had fallen into the trap. If these lands are, as was then said, the richest lands in the Commonwealth, then necessarily people living on other land's-, which are poorer, are contribut- just reward of his own exertions. ing £ 1 0 per acre to people living on the richest lands in this continent. Is it not absurd that that should be the case? If we were asked to keep these lands in cultivation for any other purpose than sugar production, honourable members would see the folly of it, and vote accordingly.",63
501,Mr WATSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Is the land fit for anything but sugar? Some people say it is not.,63
502,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"At present the land is being used to the injury of the whole community. I need not dwell on the fact that at the present time the extra cost of sugar Is absolutely interfering with all the jam manufacturing and the fruit preserving industries in Australia. It has greatly In jured the fruit-growing trade. In fact, in place of having small orchards dottedhere and there over the country, the market has been destroyed. I myself am an example of what I state. I should have had over 40 acres of orchard in bearing except for the bad market.",63
503,Mr MCDONALD,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,There is more frui t in cultivation in New South Wales now than there ever was ,63
504,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"This tax on sugar is the greatest injury that the fruit-growers have ever had. It is absolutely a bar in their way. Let me show how that happens. Fruit may be regarded as worth from 3s. to 4s. per cwt. At the Customs House they take it at 3s. a cwt., and at that rate it pays very well. before fruit worth 3s. a cwt. can be turned into jam it absolutely has to pay duty on sugar at 6s. a cwt. This is the way to encourage the fruit-grower. If proposals for the further continuance - of the bounty are to be brought forward, I should like to know where the money is to come from? If one set of people, who, because they work hard, and _are able to extract something from the land, are to be taxed for the benefit of another set of people, we shall go the wrong way to work. - Our duty is to remove all those taxes which at present prevent the land from'- being put to its true use. It is not in our power to settle people on the land; but we are able to insure that those who are on the land - shall suffer under no disabilities by reason of the taxes we impose. We should take care that the taxes are so light that they do not raise more revenue than is absolutely necessary for the preservation of law and order, and for securing to every man the Beyond that we should not go.",63
505,Mr MCDONAL D,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable and learned member is' becoming a true Socialist.,63
506,Mr CONROY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"If the members of the Labour Party would only consent to work with me, we should soon find a way to remove the burdens which press heavily upon the working man. I regret to say that the very party which should be the first to relieve the working classes of taxation are the verylast to recognise that these taxes will assuredly remain, unless they lend their assistance to those who are fighting against them. That is why I view with so much regret the action of the Labour Party in entering into an alliance with the members led by the Prime Minister. We cannot indulge in any hope for the true advancement of Australia whilst that alliance continues. I say that with the full knowledge that probably no great change will take place during the life of this Parliament. Whilst the Labour Party permit the greater part of the taxation to be borne by the masses of the people they are false to their name and to their professions, and there can be no hope - for the true advancement of Australia. Mr HENRY WILLIS ' (Robertson) --I have no intention to speak at any length; but I think I should say a word or two with regard to the change of Government that has taken place under circumstances which have given rise to a good deal of But public comment. I have no wish to repeat all' the hard things that have been said by certain honourable members, not may be because I am not affected so acutely as they are by the change, and consequently cannot feel as keenlv as they do. After reading the speech delivered by the Prime Minister at Ballarat I came to the conclusion that he should have made his position clear at a much .earlier period. It appears that the coalition came into existence subject to the understanding that if a premature 'dissolution should take place, those who were in coalition should go to the country as a united partu. Owing to the pressure brought to bear upon the Government hy the honourable members led by the present Attorney-General, the late Government, in a weak moment, consented to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the Tariff. I had no sympathy whatever with that proposal, because I feit that when the time came for dealing with the report of the Commission there must be a break-up of the Coalition Government. I realized that if it were necessary to bring about a coalition in order to restore stable administration, and to present a solid front to the solid Labour Party, the destruction of that Government would be a calamity. It has been stated in this House that the appointment of the Commission was a farce. should be no party to any such transaction. Whilst I had no sympathy with the appointment of the Commission, I realized that once that body was appointed the public must not be fooled. Therefore, I was greatlv relieved when the leader of the Opposition announced the other evening that he had appointed the Commission in perfect good faith, and that he was prepared to stand or f all by the principles for which he had fought for so many years.",63
507,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,He said at Geelong that he had given them up.,64
508,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"-He said that he believed that the report of the Commission would be submitted in 1906, by which' time it was expected that the coalition party would be able to make a public announcement upon the fiscal question. Prime Minister stated at Ballarat that when the Commission was appointed, he felt that the step was a fatal one, because the fiscal issue would have to be dealt with, and the Government would f all to pieces. should have made that announcement when the proposal to appoint the Commission was first mooted. He should have said, "" I have no sympathy with this proposal,"" and should have pointed out to the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney, "" This is the rock upon which you will split."" At Ballarat, however, he stated that he had the fullest sympathy with the appointment of the Commission. He had previously made a similar announcement in this House. That was the time at which he should have pointed out the danger of complying-with the request of the Isaacs party. Ministers would then have stiffened their backs against those who were asking for the Commission, and would have strengthened their position. If they had shown a bold front, they would have added to the number of their supporters. Prime Minister, when speaking at Ballarat, stated that if his party went to the country at the period of dissolution which the then Prime Minister was foretelling, they would be piaced at a disadvantage, because the Anti-Socialistic League in New South Wales was being joined by many persons who professed protectionist principles, as well as by free-traders, but the former were being deceived. I was a member of that league, and I heard no whisper ot anything; in the form of treachery or deceit on the part of any member of that league. I should the no party to anything of the kind. I thought it would be a good I thing to formulate a platform containing several planks for which we could all have fought.",64
509,Mr KELLY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The Vice-President of the Executive Council was a member of the executive committee of the league.,64
510,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Yes , and I believe he is still a member of it.",64
511,Mr EWING,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,No . I am not.,64
512,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I believe that the Postmaster-General was also a member of the league. Further, it has come to ray knowledge that the energetic secretary of the Protectionist Association in Sydneyvisited the rooms of the league with a view to taking an active part in the crusadeagainst Socialism.",64
513,Mr BRUCE SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,As also did the keen secretary of one of the branches of The that association in mv constituency.,64
514,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Exactly. Furthermore, a most prominent protectionist and most energetic citizen, Mr O. Beale. promised to do his best to further He the objects of the league. I say, without any hesitation, that no one had any thought whatever of doing anything dishonourable in the formation of those leagues. Personally, I would sooner have withdrawnfrom the whole organization than have been a party to any deception of those forming the coalition.",64
515,Mr WATKINS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,What has all this to do with the printing of these papers?,64
516,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The honourable member might not like some reference being made to what has transpired, but we have to face the political situation. We have to* discuss here what the general public are thinking; they have been brought toface a new Administration with an old policy because of a misunderstanding in themind of the present Prime Minister. If the honourable and learned gentleman thought The there was some deception in the organization, it was his business to go to the right honourable member for East Sydneyi and discuss the situation with him. They might then, I think, very fairly have formulated a workable platform on which they could have gone to the country. ' It might have been a platform of anti-Socialism or democratic "" State action,"" but, whatever it was called, so long as it was a definite workable programme, there would have been a united party in the appeal to the country. In coming back from the country, the free traders would have been at as great a disadvantage as the protectionists, even if there had been a premature dissolution. So I say there was nothing in the contention of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, that his party would be placed at a disadvantage if a premature dissolution were to take place. Looking veryi carefully through the speech made by the honourable and learned gentleman at Ballarat, I came to the conclusion that it was an excellent speech, and, coming from a sick man, it was a very astute speech, well connected in its argument, and answering all objections occupying the public mind at the time. It was a speech which did the honourable and learned gentleman credit, as the leader of a partu. I think that the Age newspaper published such an interpretation of the speech as they wished the general public to put upon it, in order to bring about a collapse. The Age succeeded in doing so, but there was nothing in the speech relating to Socialism that did not meet with my hearty approval. I should like to direct the attention of the House to a few extracts from the speech, which, I think, it useful to consider at this juncture. In speaking of the policy which the right honourable member for East Svdney was advocating throughout Australia, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat saidTake the Prime Minister's own definition. He said that he is in favour of any form of State action-wha t is called State Socialism-whic h - assists private enterprise, and gives it belter opportunities of development. That was the definition of his Anti-Socialism given by the right honourable member for East Sydney, and on that the honourable .and learned member for Ballarat said I think ninety-nine hundredths of the people Australia would agree with that. The honourable and learned gentleman is himself one of the 99 per cent, of the community who would be in favour of State action of that kind. But, moreover, the Tight honourable member for East Sydney very properly placed before the public what the extreme Socialists were in favour of, and the honourable and learned member for BalMr Henry Willis. larat stated that 99 per cent, of the people were opposed to it. He put that statement in these wordsThe Prime Minister says that the policy of the Socialists, whi'ch he denounces, requires lhat all the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be transferred from private enterprise to the State. Mr Reid believes all who are opposed lo that are anti-Socialistic. Then ninety-nine hundredths of the people of Australia are opposed to that policy. It will be seen, therefore, that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was in favour of the policy which the right honourable member for East Sydney was advocating (throughout Australia,' tand was equally opposed to what was, and is still, the policy of the Labour Party led by the honourable member for Bland. The honourable and learned gentleman further saidBut what did Mr Watson say at Brisbane two or three |days ago? He 'explained that the objectives were not put forward for immediate realization; but as something to be aimed at in the future. If they are not put forward for use they are liable to abuse. That was the opinion of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and there was no difference on the subject between him and the right honourable member for East Sydney.' To further show that he 1 was opposed to the policy of the Labour Party the honourable and learned gentleman said: Now a relevant question is, Are we all State Socialists? If by State Socialism you mean an assumption of all the activities of daily life - by the State, and require them to be worked by State machinery as the only means of perfecting society, then I am at the opposite pole of opinion. Thee is no doubt about that. The honourable and learned gentleman was not in sympathy with the Labour Party; he was even at the opposite pole of opinion.  honourable member should support Eim.",64
517,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The honourable and learned gentleman was in favour of the policy enunciated far and wide by the then Prime Minister, and was opposed to the extreme policy of the Labour Party.",65
518,Mr MCDONALD,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The Honourable and of learned gentleman did,not say so in his speech.",65
519,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I have what he said in black and white, as edited by himself in his cool moments, and I understand that he stands or falls by his utterances in this form. I say .that there was a great deal in this speech on which we were united. We were united against the extreme Labour Socialism, it seems to me. There was a cleavage between the two parties, and no need for a third party. [There was one united party commanding a majority against the extreme Socialism of the Labour Party. We could have fought them, and we will fight them. continue the fight, and there will not be three parties by-and-by. That there can be two parties formed in this House, I am quite confident.",65
520,Mr MCDONALD,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,And the party having the largest number of members will be composed of Socialists.,66
521,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The honourable and learned member for Ballarat pursued the matter further, and, to show what he was distinctly in favour of, he said:While opposed to the State Socialism which is sought on the plea that it is a good thing to transfer private industry to the State, I take a very different position as regards serious abuses- I am free to use the machinery of the State as a remedy for proved and admitted evils when liiey can be best coped with by that means. clear and definite? I would turn to the nationalizing of industries only in the last resort. The Labour Party would make the nationalization of industries their first act. as soon as an industry was ripe for the plucking. As one of their leaders has expressed it, ""as soon as the plum is ripe,"" they would pluck it. The point ""was very tersely put before the conference of labour representatives by the honourable member for Perth, when he stated what Socialism really was. There was no need whatever for the honourable ancl learned member for Ballarat to.break awav from the coalition of which I was a humble member, ancl I hope the time is not far distant when, as a solid democratic party, we shall be able to face the united Labour Party. The Prime Minister was most desirous of - showing his constituents where he stood; and this point I desire to emphasize. His declaration will stand for all time-or . at - any rate, for the time of this Parliamentas his views on Socialism. The honourable ancl learned member saidTo summarize my position, let me say that in - each instance every proposal must be dealt with as a plain business proposition. In my eye State Socialism is a remedy to be applied with caution, or else the remedy may easily be worse than the - disease. Now the Prime Minister will apply this Socialism, if we call it such, with"" great - caution. The honourable and learned member proceeded to say, I refeat that the real crux of State Socialism lies in the question, "" Who is to pay? It all - comes to £ s. d."" That is the difference between myself and the members of the Labour Party. Is Socialism expedient? Will it pay? If it will not pay, then the State should have nothing to do with it ; We shall but if it will pay, and it is expedient in the interests of the people ancl of the country, then it may be undertaken, provided that private enterprise is not interfered with to the disadvantage of the people. These are a few of the conclusions at which I arrived on reading the speech made by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. A platform might have been prepared by him and the right honourable member for East Sydney in consultation, and on that platform we could have gone to the country as an Australian Liberal League. It was repeatedly stated by the right honourable member for East Sydney, when Prime Minister, that when he went to the country he would have someIs that thing definite to place before the electors. It is most deplorable there should be a crisis at a time when we might have been united, ancl when there could have been placed before the people a straight out issue, as to the decision of which I had no fear. However, we have in power a Government - a democratic Government-wh o will bring fonvard non-contentious measures. If the Government introduce measures which are for the good of the people-mea sures which could have been brought forward by the coalition Government- I shall support them, just as the Labour Party will. Instead of the Labour Party having the Government under their thumb, it seems to me that the Government have the Labour Party under their thumb. The Government know very well that the Labour Party do not want a dissolution, otherwise they would have opposed the crisis motion; and the Government may bring forward measures of which they are thoroughly in favour, and none that the Labour Party specially desire. If the Government introduce measures of that character. I cannot see how it is possible for members of the Opposition to vote against legislation in favour of which they have a moral conviction. I feel pretty certain the Opposition will support measures they are in favour of. and will not merely oppose for the sake of harassing the Government. Under such circumstances, the Government will live on their measures, and not on the sufferance of the Labour Party. But the Labour Party are ""playing the game"" very much in the interests of the party who are opposed to them, though not so intentionally. The Labour Party have taken the forelock, and have expressed themselves in favour of taking a referendum on the Tariff Commission's report, and passing into law the mandate of that referendum. The right honourable member for East Sydney made a public announcement to the same some months ago, considering that a referendum would be a capital way of settling the question. If the question is settled in that way, I , as a free-trader, will fight in the constituencies in favour of free-trade. I want nothing from this House; I only ask to be given a free hand in advocating free-trade in the country. When the referendum is proposed, if I am returned again, I hope I may be a member of this party, namely, the Free trade Party, fighting in favour of the revenue Tariff. If the country decides that there must be protection, then the spoils of the victors shall not go to Victorian manufacturers only, but all the manufacturers throughout the Commonwealth shall share in the plunder, for, at the very best, protection is nothing but robbery. I hope I shall see the duties reduced as low as possible, so as to have a revenue-producing Tariff in the interests of the impecunious States, and in the interests of the great State of New South Wales, of which I have the honour to be one of the representatives. The latter State is spending one million pounds a year more than the people had to provide before there was Federation- a million more than is necessary for the government of that State.",66
522,Mr BRUCE SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,T w o millions.,67
523,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I am informed by the honourable and learned member for Parkes that the extra expenditure amounts to two millions, but a million is sufficient for my argument. It was stated by the representative of the Government in the Senate that the free-traders "" knocked a million off "" the Tarifl. That saving worth fighting for, and I hope that we shall be able to put in some good work when the Tariff is again dealt with. The Tariff must be dealt with and disposed of, and then, hope, there will be a progressive democratic party, which honourable members in the Socialists, corner may call socialistic if they like. with extreme Socialism we shall have nothpower ing to do. I find from the Worker newspaper that the Labour Party intend to be represented at the International Socialist Conference to be held in England.",67

527,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I took the effect trouble to make an extract from the Worker this evening, so that I know that what I state is correct. The point I wish to make is, that it is extreme Socialism to which I am opposed, and to which I ihink my party are opposed; but we are a democratic party who will move with the times. In connection with the municipalization of public services, the counties and' municipalities of Great Britain have been granted tens of millions of pounds by the Local Government Board.

531,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"As the honourable member for Newcastle has asked me to cite a case, I will refer him to a work in which he will discover a great number of cases. I refer to Dr Alfred Shaw's work, English Municipalities and their Government.",67
532,Mr TUDOR,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I will refer the honourable member to another work, namely, Municipal Management, by Suthers, who declares that it has been a success.",67

535,Mr HENRY WILLIS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I am pretty familiar with it at the present time. I may was tell the honourable member that I was a member of the Greater Sydney Conference, and read a paper before that body, a copy of which I will be happy to send him.

536,Mr RONALD,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Southern Melbourne) After the great tirade of abuse and vituperation which has been distributed broadcast throughout this debate, I think that it becomes one to say a word in favour - of gentlemanly conduct and of reasonable discussion in connection with those matters upon which we differ. I do not wish to take upon myself in this House the role of a lecturer upon good manners and common decency, but I must say that I have never 'been associated with anv other assemblyand I have had a considerable experience in many assemblies, ecclesiastical and political-in which there has been so much vituperation and uncalled-for abuse as has ""been indulged in by hononable members to whom we are opposed. is high time that we entered a protest against the traditions of Parliament being dragged down to the depths of mud-sling""ing.

539,Mr RONALD,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I will say it to the end - of the chapter. If we cannot credit each other with honourable motives we have no right to associate with honourable men. debate has reminded me very forcibly some very ancient lines, which I think exsituation. actly summarize the situationLong in the fields of words we may contend; - Reproach is infinite, and knows no end; Amied, or with truth, or falsehood, right orwrong, So voluble a weapon is the tongue; Wounded, we wound, and neither side can fail , TFor every man has equal right to rail. If every man exercises that equal right to indulge in abuse, we shall soon make parliamentary life such a sphere that no honourable man will care to enter it. The sum total of this contretemps in which parties find themselves is that the alliance between the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and the right honourable member for East Sydney was simply an effort to ally a negation. There was nothing positive upon which the two parties were agreed. They endeavoured to combine ficetrade and protection - and one might just It as well attempt to blend fire and water. There is no middle course which can be adopted. If they had. had a positive policy, they might then have agreed upon the negative part upon which to oppose the Labour Party; and if they had brought forward an alternative to that party's policy,. there would have been a possiWe have bility of the perpetuity of the alliance which had been entered into. But the Prime Minister, when he found himself face to face with a blank sheet of paperthe policy brought forward by the Government-ha d no alternative, as an honourable man, but to say, "" Even if it means a return to Socialism, let us have something better than this."" That is all I intend to say, but I wish again to enter my protest most emphatically against the unseemly conduct of some honourable members in charging others with having been guilty of perfidv. when there is no proof of any such thing. We should exhaust all hypotheses before resorting to charges of perfidy, treachery, or and other forms of abuse such as have been so freely hurled about this chamber.",68
540,Mr LIDDELL,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS," As this debate appears to be dving a natural death, so I have no desire to fan the sinking flame. But as you, sir, remarked in giving a ruling to an obstreperous member of the Chamber, we must recollect that we are here not by virtue of our own personalities, but for the purpose of representing the electors of the Commonwealth. I feel that it is my duty, on behalf of the electors of the This Hunter, to give expression to my opinions of in reference to the present political . I do not think that this discussion can be seriously regarded as a debate, but, nevertheless,. I cannot say that it has involved a waste of public time. The Attorney-General reminds me of the man who has taken his seat in the first-class carriage of the Ministerial train. He has got there all right, his luggage is in the van, and he wants to be off. He does not care about anybody else's feelings,and consequently he takes up a very high . stand, ancl directs us to do the work of men. I think that we are doing the work of men, and part of that work consists of protesting' against the conduct of certain honourable members of this House. If anybody should protest against that conduct, certainly the electors of the Hunter should do so. ' In the first Parliament we elected a gentleman in whom we believed, and who promised to give us a revenue Tariff. When he. became a member of the first Cabinet his ideas changed. to the electors, and said he had thought better of his original proposal, and that the only course open to the Commonwealth Parliament was to pass the heavy protective Tariff that is now in operation.",68
541,Mr MAUGER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,-Now in operation?,69
542,Mr LIDDELL,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The Tariff under which we are now suffering. If we could get rid of it we should be in a better position. 1 firmly believe that the first representative of Hunter in this Parliament-Si r Edmund Barton - was influenced by the present Prime Minister. It ill becomes me to criticize the conduct of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, veteran in politics that he is ; but I firmly believe that he influenced, to a certain extent, the first representative of Hunter in this Parliament, ancl that his influence from the very inception of the Commonwealth has not been an influence for good. I only wish to say that the free-traders or revenue tariffists of New South Wales sank the fiscal issue. We were perfectly prepared to support a Government consisting equally of protectionists and free-traders, and full y expected in those circumstances that we should have the loyal support of the present Prime Minister. stead of that, however, the honourable and learned fgentleman, the moment ithat he joined the coalition, instead of taking his seat immediately behind the Government, retired to the most remote corner of the back bench. Was not that in itself an indication of want of lovaltv on his part? When the 'first opportunity occurred to thrust the late Ministryout of office he took advantage of it. I would remind him that the House is in exactlv the same position that it occupied when the first Deakin Administration was in office. Minister has formed an alliance with the Labour Partv. which, as I have alreadv said in this House, is but a parasite bodythat will ultimately prove the ruin of the party which is relying upon its support.",69
543,Mr JOHNSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,It is a no-reliance party.,69
544,Mr LIDDELL,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"It is a party that believes in taking one step at a time towards its ultimate goal. The people of Australia, to my mind, do not recognise the danger associated with it today. It is not my desire, however, at this stage to enter upon a consideration of that matter. The whole debate has been thrashed out, and I haveonly to say that if honourable members opposite ever had any feelings they must now He came back be in the position of the unfortunate individuals who passed through the inquisition-in a state of total insensibility.",69
545,Mr JDEAIQIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS," On the only occasion upon which I have had an opportunity toaddress myself to the questions before the House, I spoke, as honourable members are aware, without notice, and, in some surprise, from the. back Ministerial bench, i i * reply to-an attack from the then Prime Minister. In such circumstances, it is notstrange that, called upon for the first time to face the allegations then made, and those that followed outside the House, I was Obliged to Supplement that speech by statements to the representative of the public press that have not appeared in Hansard. Those remarks have appeared"" only in part of the public press, having been mutilated in the greater section of it , so that the seauence of events which was the necessary condition to a comprehension of the present situation was utterly destroyed. But I do not, for that reason, propose to inflict upon the House a repetition of those statements. At this hour of the night, and at this stage of the debate, it would be unwise, and also, I believe, unnecessary, to do so. What I shall' Inhave to say will be directed not-as I should have wished-to the task of dealing with those criticisms and suggestions upon the policy of the Government that under ordinary circumstances would form the chief"" feature of a reply of this nature, but toa few salient features of the situation from which we are about to pass. It seems to be forgotten that both in the action taken, and the words spoken with regard to the Late Government, I had any obligations, except those that are declared to have existed between honourable membersThe Prime now opposite-and particularly the leader of the Opposition who now enters the Chamber-anc l myself. I have neither denied nor sought to diminish those obligations. I have said, and venture to repeat, however, that they were but some of the many obligations imposed upon honourable members of this House, and upon myself in particular during the late crisis. In addition to anything I owed to the late Government, and felt to be due to its leader, I owed much to the men with whom I have been associated in this House, who sat with me; to the party, though divided, which sat on both sides of the Chamber, and to the general public. I was as much bound to discharge these obligations in the order of their claims as I was any others of a personal or directly Ministerial character. And, sir, standing here after a debate extending over several days, during which abuse based upon false, unjustifiable, ruthless, suspicion has been showered upon my every action, let me say that I have passed through it with less disturbance and less sensitiveness than through any assaults that have been made upon me during my political career.",69
546,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,No one doubts that.,70
547,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"They might if they did not know that the imputations made against me have their foundation, such as it isancl they have no real base-in sheer suspicion of my own intentions. Of those at least I have a more intimate and fuller knowledge than any other living being can possess.",70
548,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable and learned member thinks so.,70
549,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I know. I know as no one else can. Until the delivery of vernor-General's speech, which was the of treachery that destroyed for ever my fidence in the then Government, I had the remotest intention of leaving my seat on the back Ministerial bench, or of varying during the present session the support I gave the Government last year. took my old seat, intending to support the Government with the same reservations, fulfilment of the same agreement, and precisely the same manner as before. I not the slightest expectation of the surthat prise that was to be sprung upon us, the slightest idea of anything ahead, but the regular and steady transaction of the business that we should be called upon undertake. I told the representatives of the press at Ballarat that I should sit there, ancl that' I saw no reason why I should not do so. Until the Governor General's speech larat. was delivered at the direction of the late Government, I had not the remotest suspifour cion that I should be found during this sespresently. [16] . sion ranged against the right honourable gentleman who now leads the Opposition. That we are here, and that they are there, is due to the fact that he put into the mouth of His Excellency a declaration of war against the men who had supported him, and who had brought him into power. For reasons which were not communicated to me. and which 1 do not propose to attempt to decipher-for reasons utterly unknown to me, and unforeseen by me-the Prime Minister was enabled to convince colleagues, against whom I make no imputation, of the necessity of following a course based upon mere suspicion.",70
550,Mr MCCAV,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Le t not the honourable ancl learned gentleman forget that he did make imputations against them in the press.,70
551,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Does the honourable and learned member refer to a time before the Governor General's speech was delivered, or afterwards ?",70
552,Mr MCCAY,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Afterwards .,70
553,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Yes . I did so, ancl do so now against the leader of the late Government, but confess that they are only imputations. They are my interpretation of his action, but even that interpretation is not satisfactory, to my mind.",70
554,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable and learned gentleman objected to others drawing inferences.,70
555,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"That was an inference I drew from his action, and it is the only one I am able to draw. It is put forward as an inference only. My coalition with the Gohim was formed on. two plain condiact tions; and my adherence to it, my condetermination not to depart from it, was not shown by the fact that I read both of its documents at Ballarat, and that they were included in the report of my speech, that when it was published in extenso, so I that its very words might be placed before the people who had listened to what I said, in or would judge my remarks. The agree in ment arrived at in May, 1904, can be rehad duced to two simple pledges-the first until Mayi, 1906, or anv earlier date nor which the Government might choose, the fiscal question was not to be raised by them, or, on their part, except with the consent to of both parties in the Ministry.",70
556,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Ye t the honourable and learned gentleman offered an alliance with the protectionists ten months before that at Bal,70
557,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I have answered that times, and shall answer it a fifth time",70
558,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Who wanted the honourable and learned gentleman's support when he was in treaty with one's enemies?,71
559,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The right honourable and learned gentleman can not now confuse issue.,71
560,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I do not wish to do that.,71
561,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The first plank in that agreement was fiscal peace to May, 1906, and possibly longer, but at all events fiscal peace. The object of that fiscal peace its purpose were set out in the same agreeof ment embodied in a list of practical business measures which were to be brought forward country. and passed in the interim. It was to enable that business to be done, and for else, that the coalition was formed, and the agreement was made. There was no obgentleman ject in burying the fiscal question as a tion, except for the transaction of public business.",71
562,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"There is one thing which the honourable and learned gentleman has left out, and that is, that it was also directed against the Labour Party.",71
563,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"We shall come to that point in its place and time. At this I am dealing with the only two features of any importance in the coalition-th pledges given and received. What made the coalition was pledges of fiscal peace until May, 1906, and then a Ministerial declaration of policy, with a view to the - transaction of useful and necessary legisthat lation till then, legislation non-contenread. tious in one sense, in that it did not involve the fiscal question. What done by the speech of the Governorlearned General ? The useful legislation which fore he spoke. was promised, and which was the very reason of the coalition, was thrown under table. Nothing was to be done to fulfil that pledge. Not one measure of all those which were set out and promised to be done as a justification of the coalition, as a justification for sinking fiscal question. That was done by the late Government,, advisedly, for reasons of ingtheir own, and that for the first time broke the agreement, and shattered it into fragacross ments.",71
564,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable and - learned gentleman broke the agreement Ballarat.,71
565,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,When the soul had gone out I did not want the corpse.,71
566,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Then there was the second part of the agreement. That was an obligation to declare the fiscal policy of the Government - in May, 1906, or life, or longer. sooner. Instead of this, what was the proposal in the Governor General's speech ? To bury the fiscal issue for three years. Instead of the promised declaration of the the Government policy in May, 1906, we were offered a declaration of it some three years beyond that date. Here were the two vital considerations of the coalition, and the only two that justified it, both of them deliberately brqken by the right honourable and gentfeman. They were broken in the face Parliament, which was also to be broken without the possibility of any gain to the",71

575,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Why the members of the the Labour Party have always given it up. Several honourable members interrupt,71
576,Mr SPEAKER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The s e conversations the chamber, especially this disturbance during a set speech of the Prime Minister, are entirely out of accord with the at dignity of the House. For some days he has been subjected to a number of serious attacks, and he is at least entitled to make a statement without interruption.",71
577,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The right honourable gentleman was at perfect liberty to sink the fiscal question for the rest of his natural,71
578,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,For the rest of his political life.,72
579,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"That does not affect his pledge to announce his fiscal policy in .May, 1906. There was nothing to prevent kis personal change of view in our agreement or any understanding, or inference to be drawn therefrom. The right honourable member was quite within his rights in doing that, or promising to do it , and there would have been no objection, I assure him, from the Protectionist Party in the community if he had done so. But that did not and could not relieve him from the obligation he had solemnly undertaken that, if his Government lived, unless it was destroyed by some attack from without which we were unable to prevent, he should, in May, 1906, announce his fiscal policy to the countryand it was no fulfilment of that condition, but an absolute breach of it, to seek to postpone it for three years later. What were we 'offered instead ? What did the right honourable gentleman compel us to choose between? It was between a dissolution of this Parliament immediately and placing him in the position which he now adorns.",72
580,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I would not like the honourable and learned gentleman's posi-. tion for twice the honour and glory.,72
581,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I not only understand cator, then. the right honourable gentleman, but in another sense agree with him.",72
582,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I left the grapes, and the day|S past. fox has them now.",72
583,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I am not to be diverted. The right honourable gentleman chose to put this to this House one simple alternative- "" Go to the country at once, or, by some motion which ..will enable you to proceed with public business, you must remove me from office, because I place myself in the posisite tion to prevent you by saying that you shall not transact public business my consent while I lead the Government."" Not until he put that choice to us did the idea, not merely of moving a motion, but even of supporting any motion adverse to him, ever occur to my mind. On the conand trary, as I have said, and repeat for last time, all my arrangements for the ing session were based on the expectation of the right honourable gentleman remaining in office, and of my playing a very small part indeed, except in the transaction the ordinary business of the House.

The only questions that were ever discussed by me which affected thei future of the late Government were the suggestions which every one saw broached in the public press and elsewhere, that with a majority of two its position must necessarily be uncertain. But those discussions were always based on the supposition and statement that we were still supporting them, and that the Government, if it went down this session, would go down in some Opposition attack which would find us supporting the Government against the attack. Except in that way, the idea of consenting to displace the Government while it was trying to transact that business to which we and they were pledged, the business set out in detail in the agreement, the practical business still waiting to be transacted by this House-the idea of attacking the Government during the transaction of that business never crossed my mind.",72

They were' to be penalized though they had done nothing and said nothing against the Ministry. They came to an unanimous verdict, apart from and before any advice of mine. They insisted that action should be taken, and that I should take it.",72

I am only telling my own part in this matter. public will see when they come to consider the events of the past few weeks, is that no ordinary set of circumstances, no doubtful choice was before us. No merely) questionable action on the part of the Government, had occurred; but a blow at us so indefensible as to bring protectionists at once and unanimously into one mind, in the face of an utterly unforeseen situation. They agreed that only one course was open to us. The then Prime Minister had forced a choice of alternatives, and they saw that there was then no choice on their part. What happened, happened spontaneouslv and unanimously. This in itself is a demonstration that different men of different views and different inclinations felt that, under the situation which the right honourable member had created, only one solution was left, and that was to propose an amendment that would allow of the transaction of the business to which we had pledged ourselves before the country during the fiscal peace.",73

605,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable gentleman declared this Parliament to be an impossible Parliament.,73
606,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Yes , that is perfectly true, but relates to a different matter - and in the sense in which I used the words it is The only really substantial meaning to be attached to the right honourable member's interjection is that the position which I occupy is not one to be envied. It certainly is not, in this Parliament and in the constitutional situation in which we find ourselves. Nothing but the imperative nature of the situation, nothing but the fact that if a dissolution had been granted, it would have been fruit less and profitless, would have left us still with three parties, and must have left us still divided, could have driven us to accept our present responsibilities, knew that when we had cost the country £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 , and a new Parliament had been returned, there would still have been three parties, and that.the transaction of business would still depend upon an alliance, or understanding between two of those parties, such as now exists to some extent on these benches. We knew that a dissolution now What the must be futile, and that business ought to be done first. Nothing but such considerations would have induced me to take the action which I have taken. We should not have been a single step further, nor could we have improved our position in the slightest degree, if we had had a general election at that time. So when the right honourable member charges me with reviving the three-party system, he surely forgets that he, and he alone, is entitled to that distinction. The speech of the Governor General was a declaration of war against his allies, the protectionists, who were then supporting him.",73
607,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,No . Mr DEAKIN ' - It proposed to destroy them without warning or justification.,73
608,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Surely public principles are not a question of office, of being in or out? Mr DEAKIN ! - But public principles differ, and our principle as protectionists was only guaranteed by the declaration in our agreement that the late Government's fiscal policy should be declared in May, re1906. When we were asked to substitute for that date a statement of the late Government's fiscal policy postponed till 1909, it became a totally different thing. Hansard. Remember that we were protectionists. We had never sunk protection. simply agreed to work with the late Government until May, 1906, when they were to declare themselves fiscally. We were - never prepared, or even asked, to wait for such a declaration until May. 1909. I , myself, advised the late Government - of the steps by which we could - remain associated with them until the end of this Parliament. But when the Prime .Minister sought to change the policy p f fiscal peace until May, 1906, into a policy of fiscal entombment until 1909, the situation was entirely changed.",73
609,Mr JOHNSON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Did not his fiscal allies in the Cabinet agree to that?,74
610,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I am not aware.,74
611,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,That was a personal declaration of my own.,74
612,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"And as purely personal I have always treated it for several reasons. Consequently, by that personal declaration of his, the right honourable member at once revived three parties in this House. He carried with him his own fiscal party. But could we see the fiscal question entombed until T909? Did not the right honourable member know that he could not expect'to carry with him those protectionists who were supporting him?",74
613,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,They wanted the fiscal peace to last for three Parliaments.,74
614,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Some did, but they - were so few that they were unable to make themselves heard at our caucus. When the right honourable member attempted the entombment of the fiscal question, he knew that he was cutting himself off from those protectionists who were supporting him, and that he was re-creating the three-party system. He resolved us at once into our original parties. There was the Free-trade Party which supported the right honourable member, there was the Protectionist Party which I had the honour to lead, and there was the third party fiscally indifferent, and putting forward its own policy. It was, I say, this act of the right honourable memb e r / and this alone, that re-created the three-party situation which unfortunately we have now inherited. I have not altered one opinion that I have ever expressed as to the inconvenience, danger, and prejudice to constitutional government that the threeparty system occasions. I say that our present system makes the working of constitutional government, as we know it, impossible upon established lines. right honourable member having re-created the three-party system, we had to face it. We had We had to admit it, and' take the best possible course. He left us only a choice of evils, of difficulties. Either we could go to the country, and obtain a verdict which would settle nothing, which would leave us where we were, and would 'entail the expenditure of £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 ; or if we did not go to the country we could try to carry on this Parliament under the three-party system. Of those two evils we preferred to save the country £ 5 0 , 0 0 0, and to carry on the business for which we were sent here; and we hope to give the country time to reconsider the situation so as ultimately to come to a more intelligent decision than we should have done had we rushed to the electorates in confusion as the right honourable member desired.",74
615,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"For or against your allies, which ?",74
616,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"An alliance between two parties which would put an end to the three-party system-has not been consummated. No honourable member of this House can claim to have, with greater risk to himself and with the acceptance of greater responsibility, done more than I have to endeavour to get rid of the three-party system. I regret no step that I have taken in that direction, although, unfortunately, the results have mocked my hopes and my belief. „ Three parties of nearly equal strength were returned to this House, and from the first I sought to formulate some substantial plan upon which two of the parties could unite. The Labour Partycould not! unite with any other, the protectionists would not; and when I trusted the right honourable member and his party, it was only to find myself, without warning, and on mere suspicion, betrayed.",74
617,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Wit h a dagger in the honourable and learned member's hand.,74
618,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I had no dagger in my hand, until the right honourable gentleman aimed his battle-axe at his protectionist supporters, and then I had only twenty-four hours in which to obtain it. I endeavoured at great personal risk and cost to myself to bring the three-party system to an end in this Chamber. The whole of that work, whatever it may have been, was destroyed by the breach of faith of the right honourable gentleman, and we are now thrown back upon the conditions which But the had previously existed.",74
619,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The Prime Minister made another alliance. i Mr DEAKIN - Unfortunately , we were not able to make an alliance. We had what the leader of the Opposition has properly called an understanding, and in arriving at that understanding I took care that it should fulfil the very same conditions that the right honourable gentleman himself agreed to have fulfilled in our agreement last year. Everything was done openly, and our agreement has no concealed item or bargain. The right honourable gentleman has been pleased to taunt us with having submitted our programme to the Laboui Party. In one sense of the term, it certainly was submitted,: because it was communicated to them; but, inasmuch as neither the leader of that party nor the party as a whole had made any stipulations beforehand as to what our programme should contain, no humiliation was involved. The members of the Labour Party were simply referred to the unaltered programme of the former Administration, of which I was the head, and of which some of my present colleagues were members in 1903-4, and they then' indicated that so far as that was concerned, they were prepared to give, a general support to the Government. That was the beginning and the end of an understanding honourable to both parties, and involving no sacrifice on the part of the Labour .Party, or any sacrifice or submission on ours.'",74
620,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,It did not involve going over the precipice.,75
621,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"We shall not fail to receive the assistance of the right honourable gentleman and his supporters when there is any prospect ofl helping us over. A letter and a resolution were exchanged between Mr Watson and myself in order that everything in the understanding should be made known to the public, and that those outside the understanding, as well as those within it, should know precisely where we were and are.",75
622,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The Minister does not himself know where he is-wha t is the use of saying that?,75
623,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The only direct personal attack on my procedure that I have heard from my right honourable friend the leader of the Opposition is that, after he had thought fit to tear up the agreement between us, and to depart from the only two of its constituent parts that were vital, he considered that I should still sil in my old corner and allow the leader of the Labour Party to move the motion adverse to the right honourable gentleman's proposal to dissolve without doing any business. But why should"" that duty rest with the then leader of the Opposition? The right honourable gentleman owed nothing to the then leader of the Opposition for the place he occupied, but he did owe something to us. He had: broken no agreement with the leader of the Labour Party, but he had broken every agreement with us.",75
624,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Did the Prime Ministerthink that he was entitled to the reversionof the leadership?,75
625,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The then leader of the Opposition had no special grounds upon which to urge a complaint against the right honourable member for East Sydney, but the right honourable gentleman had given us cause for the keenest complaint by deliberately seeking to cut us off not only from the friends from whom we had separated ourselves in order to give him a chance to carry on the business of the country, but by cutting us off in the country too, and attempting to grind usto pieces between his own fiscal supporters and the members of the Labour Party.",75
626,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I wronged the honourable and learned member into the position of Prime Minister again, so that he need not be too bitter.",75
627,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I would much rather that the right honourable gentleman had retained the position.,75
628,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Not on the Prime Minister's terms.,75
629,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"On terms of which the right honourable member has spoken of me in expressions of the most exaggerated eulogy, and from which there would have been no departure so long as he had fulfilled his agreement.",75
630,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The Ballarat speech put an. end to the agreement.,75
631,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"In my speech at Ballarat I pointed to something a year, if not longer, ahead. It is ridiculous to tell me that the right honourable gentleman, who has been described in his own State as the old parliamentary hand of Australia-a . man who understands party management and mechanism perhaps better than any manin Australia-would , because of a speech, pointing to some possible devel6pment twelve months or more ahead, act like thecoon in the American fable, and say, ""Don't shoot, Colonel; I ' l l come down.""' To tell me that such an old parliamentaryhand and strategist as the right honourable - gentleman acted in that way before satisfying himself whether we were going to shoot at all, is to strain our credulity too far.",75
632,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"When the honourable and (learned member spoke about taking another wife twelve months hence, it was time for - me to get rid of him.",76
633,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,E v e n that offer was - not made. I pointed out that if the proposals made by the Tariff Commission were treated in a business like way there was no reason why the right honourable .gentleman should not continue in office. I actually pleaded with him to take that - course.,76
634,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The Minister offered to enter into an alliance with the Labour Party if 'they would adopt the principle of protection. I did not want an alliance of that kind.,76
635,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I offered to accept the support of the protectionists wherever they might come from, either from the anti-Social ist leagues of New South Wales - or the Labour leagues, and in so doing I - offered no more than the right honourable gentleman has done on fifty platforms when welcoming Labour members who were free traders, because they assisted him in carrying on his campaign. Mr 7OSEPH COOK - That was during the fiscal fight.",76
636,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Exactly , and my speech pointed only to the time when fiscal peace should be ended in the event of a failure to devise means by which the period of the agreement between us could be lengthened. May, 1906, was named from the - first as the end of the term for which our agreement was made. Honourable members have chosen to speak of our coalition agreement as if it were made for all time, as if we had abandoned protection - and bound ourselves to the right honourable member's chariot wheels, in order to form one indissoluble party with his free-trade followers. But our party as a whole had - emphatically rejected the proposal for a - coalition, and we were at our peril individually assisting the right honourable gentleman to transact the business of the country.",76
637,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,There was no - about the peril. Look at the Age.,76
638,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The change that has taken place in the distribution of members - of this House within its walls is not in itself, that is to the public outside, a matter - of the first importance. At all events, it is not to us, I believe, a matter of that importance, except for one consideration. One consideration only partly contents us with the present position of laffairs, and that is because we have at least saved from the wreck with which it was threatened that which is more to us than our party, because it makes our party, and more to us than our individual fortunes, which are gladly given to it, and that is the policy with which we are identified before the country. The right honourable and learned gentleman's policy, so far as we have been able to gather it, is a policy of negation, and a policy of d r if t . The policy which, whatever happens to us. personally, will now be re-established, and will .long survive us, will strike its roots into this country and dominate it , will be a progressive, practical, and positive policy; it will be no policy of negatives. The change of Ministry unfortunately and unhappily brought about, as it has been, from my point of view, has this redeeming virtue, that the policy that was threatened, that was sought to be obscured, under a sudden and hurried dissolution brought about undeT cover of an appeal to political passion, will now be submitted to the country, and be put before the people in such plain, clear, and straightforward terms that few, if any, will be able to misunderstand the issue. The verdict of the country will decide how far its acceptance will be at once granted, but nothing now can turn it back.",76
639,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"How much per cent, more does the honourable and learned gentleman . want on the Tariff ?",76
640,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The question as to details of percentages by which my right honourable friend kindly endeavours to lead me from my path, will be dealt with, I hope, on expert advice, at an early date.",76
641,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"What , with a fiscal peace for this Parliament?",76
642,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I hope so, when the circumstances of each case have been examined. Then we shall be able to talk to the right honourable gentleman about percentages. At present, we are not qualified to deal with the question, and, to put the matter in American phraseology, we do not propose to doubt jump stiles until we come to them.",76
643,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I hope the honourable and learned gentleman will keep his word with the people.,76
644,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"O u r practical and progressive policy will have the opportunity which we all desire for it. We shall accept the verdict of Australia, whatever it may be, confident that even if the great ability of the right honourable member for East Sydney, and the support which he gets from his followers whatever they may think of the course he has pursued, should enable him to wrest from us more than we think he is entitled to of the representation of his own State, and of some others, still we shall proceed in our confident faith. It is a certainty that the policy which is now brought forward with its flag unfurled and its face unveiled, will continue its advance for years to come, until it is firmly established as the root basis of the politics of this country. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",76
645,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Labou r cheers, surely not?",77
646,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,It s path has' been cleared by the subtle attack of the right honourable member for East Sydney himself. Thanks to the right honourable gentleman himself we hear no more about free-trade in this country.,77
647,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,We will though.,77
648,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"We hear next to nothing now of the revenue Tariff. We hear nothing of any amendment of the existing Tariff. The right honourable gentleman has brought himself steadily abreast of public opinion, until he is content now to take the Tariff as it is, and simply seeks to prevent it going any further. I think he will find himself foiled in that effort, as he has found himself foiled in previous efforts.",77
649,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,The honourable and learned gentleman sees that I am easily shifted.  man did not say that in Brisbane. He said there that it would be hard to shift him.,77
650,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,I did not expect this.,77
651,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"If we could shift the right honourable gentleman into the protectionist camp, that would be a most important help, but in the meantime to have induced him to make the three long fiscal strides which he has made, is a great achievement - becaus e this is a road on which there is no going back. There will be some going forward, some advance at the next election, but it will not be what the right honourable gentleman used to call an advance.",77
652,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,Onl y 5 per cent. ?,77
653,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"It will be what_ he would have called a retrogression, because it will mean more protection, preferential trade, with positive legisOne lation in regard to social questions, and in regard to the peopling of this country with a white race.",77
654,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,That is the card; keep to that. What difference is there between us on that subject. I should like! to know?,77
655,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Onl y this differencethat, so far as I can understand, the right honourable gentleman has not yet committed himself to any practical means for giving effect to that policy.",77
656,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I consider that English, Irish, and Scotch people are white people.",77
657,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"Whereas , if we live for a few months longer in ithis Parliament, we shall offer an opportunity of considering a full-fledged and complete scheme for dealing with this question. If the right honourable member for East Sydney is content to place his great ability and the forces behind him at the service of stagnation, merely preventing us going forward as far as we wish, or in the direction we wish, that is for him to choose. But we cannot take the same course, because we believe we are here as the servants and custodians of that policy which is yet to be the Australian policy.",77
658,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"I have been setting honourable members opposite too quick a march, and they do not like it.",77
659,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,That was a march to the rear.,77
660,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,No ; a march to the people.,77
661,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,A march to the people when the right honourable gentleman knew that the people would not be able to give any verdict which would alter the existing state of affairs effectively.,77
662,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,That is quite a gratuitous thing to say.,77
663,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The right honourable gentleman's march to the people meant two or three months spent in this House considering the question of the redistribution of seats. Then it meant a general election, which would take another month or two, and it consequently meant that for five or six months there would be an absolute suspension of public business-bu t with the continued supremacy of my right honourable friend, who would have remained in office.",77
664,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,All I can say is that I ; handed it over to the honourable and learned 1 gentleman without much trouble.  gentleman had to do so.,77
665,Mr REID,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"There was not much trouble. speech was enough, one false supporter.",77
666,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The supporter alluded to was not false, but was absolutely trueso true I do not wish to make any more asseverations; but if my memory - and conscience, up to the time of the delivery of the Governor General's speech, could be held up to the right honourable gentleman as a mirror^ I would so hold them up now, confident and positive beyond all suspicion of doubt that they would satisfy even the suspicions he is affecting as his excuse. The anxieties I felt were quite of another character. However, it has pleased honourable members opposite to forget the facts; to deny them; to reverse the order of events; fo ignore the meaning of the Governor General's speech; not to recognise the fact that at great risk to ourselves we kept the Government in power, supporting a right honourable gentleman who tore up his agreement and left us to fight as best we could in the country against the men whom we were supporting, as well as any others who might range themselves against us. That was the treatment which the right honourable gentleman was prepared to mete out to his supporters and those who stood back in order that he might be given his opportunity to give this country practical legislation. That, sir, was black treachery. We resented and resisted it. There was no other choice for us. and, whatever the Tesult may be to myself and those whom I represent, confident in the ultimate victory of our policy, and Confident also that We are doing but justice to our constituents, I am satisfied with the step we took. It was our clear public duty, although I do dread the arduous burden which it imposes upon us. Question resolved in the affirmative. COMMERCE BILL.

ADJOURNMENT. ALIEN IMMIGRATION-BOOK-KEEPIN G PERIOD-DESERTE D WIVES AND FAMILIES. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. Mr BAMFORD 'Herbert) - On several occasions myself and other members have brought under the notice of the Prime Minister what may be termed the maladministration of the Immigration Restriction Act. The Prime Minister has always expressed his sympathy with the representations made to him, and promised that for the future the Act would be more carefully administered. I am now credibly informed that there are in the Cairns district for Queensland a number of Chinamen-ne w chum Chinamen-wh o have not previously been is the country, and have, therefore, not arrived under permit. I do not know whether it is a fact; but it has been suggested that these mon take passages at Hong Kong or travel as stowaways. When the steamer is off Cairns, Port Douglas, or Cooktown, it is said that beche-de-mer boats, or other boats which are hovering about, ostensibly on business, but really for the purpose of landing Chinamen, come alongside in the small hours of the morning, when the. passengers are in their bunks, and very few people about the decks, and the Chinese are then transferred to these small boats. I do not know whether there is any connivance on the part of those on the ship, possibly there is; but. at any rate, I am informed that these Chinamen are landed at Cairns, also in the small hours, without any difficulty. The men can be taken up the inlet, or landed at the north side of the inlet, where there are plenty of Chinese. In any case, Chinamen are entering the country in this illegal way,, and I ask the Prime Minister what steps he intends to take to prevent these breaches of the law. I admit there may be some difficulty in preventing the landing of these men; but the difficulty ought not to be insurmountable. These men are being landed, not only at Cairns, but at Port Douglas, Cooktown, and other places along this extensive coast. There are no police or police boats to watch vessels which arrive; but I am sure some satisfactory method could be devised by the Department to prevent this evasion of the Act.",77
667,Mr CROUCH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS," I beg to emphasize what the honourable member has said. During my recent trip to Queensland I found a very general impression, not only amongst the townspeople, but amongst the planters, that there was some back-door passagje for Chinese. In view of the strenuous White Australia policy which the Prime Minister has just indicated, I direct his attention to the Alien Immigration Act of Cape Colony, which has received the assent of the London Colonial Office. In that Act there is a provision under which every Chinaman in the Colony has to possess'a yearly registration ticket, and that has to be produced when called for, showing last year's signature of a resident magistrate. This is not a matter"" of taxation; but a means of preventing a dangerous influx of Chinese to Cape Colony, in viewi of the importation of Chinese to the Transvaal. I have had a copy of this Act, with its regulations, sent to me, and I shall be pleased if the Prime Minister can see his way to adopt a similar means of preventing the influx of Chinese to the Commonwealth.",78
668,Mr CARPENTER,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS," I desire to direct the attention of the Treasurer to a matter which I regret was omitted from the statement of the business proposed by the Prime Minister. I refer to the continuation or otherwise of the book-keeping; system at the expiration of the period of five years. This is a matter of great importance to Western Australia. I have on more than one occasion quoted figures showing how the abolition of this system would affect the finances of the State which I represent. During the four years of Federation, the absence of this book-keeping provision would have penalized the State Treasury of Western Australia to the extent of £2,160,000. The tendency is for the revenue of Western Australia to approximate more and more to the f e r cafita revenue of the other States, and I want the Government to say that they will give the House an opportunity to discuss the question, if possible, this session. If the Trea-surer can give an undertaking that the matter will form a subject in his financial statement, that will be some assurance to the Treasurer of Western Australia. the matter is not dealt with this session, we shall not be able to reach-it until pretty late next session, and the Western Australian Treasurer, not knowing what his income will be from Customs, will not be able to prepare his Estimates. I want the Government to indicate what they intend to do when the present five years' period has expired, which it does in October, 1906. The ""Government of Westem Australia ought to know what the new system is to be if a new system is to be introduced, and they ought to be informed whether the present system is to be continued. I ask the Treasurer to give this matter his earnest attention, as it is one of very great importance to the finances of Western Australia.",79
669,Mr HUTCHISON,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS," I . wish to call the attention of the Prime Minister to a matter which I cannot very well embody in the form of a questionor questions. Last session it' was my intention, if it had been constitutional, to submit a Bill dealing with the subject of deserted wives and families. Unfortunately,. I found, after consulting the late Attorney General, that it would not be constitutional' for me to d'o so. This is a very important matter, at any rate, in regard to South* Australia. I had the honour of a seat upon the council of the State Children's; Department of that State for some years, and we found that families were constantly being deserted by men who went to the other States, who were well able to contribute to the support of their families, but refused to do so. At the present moment there is a man living with another woman in Melbourne who has deserted his wife and family in South Australia. Heis earning a good salary every week, but refuses to contribute is . towards their support, and there is no power tocompel him to do so. I ask the Prime Minister to consider the advisability of communicating with the whole of the States Governments with a view to inducing themto hand over to the Commonwealth Government the power to deal with this matterI t is obviously a matter upon which Federal' action requires to be taken, for the reason that it would be idle for four or five Statesto agree to legislate in regard to it, because deserters would then go to the fifth State where there would be no power to deal"" with them.",79
670,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS," I shall be happy to inIf quire into the suspected influx of Chineseto which the honourable member for Herbert has alluded, and am glad that he has recognised the difficulties under which I labour. I am only gradually getting intotouch again with the Department in that respect, and so far have received no complaints from the district to which he refers..",79
671,Mr WATKINS,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,There is no doubt that the practice alluded to exists.,79
672,Mr DEAKIN,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The first step to betaken will be to endeavour to prove thefacts, and to locate if possible the placeof the arrival of the Chinese. I will take some steps in regard to the matter, and perhaps the honourable member will"" communicate with me at a later stage. The matter which has been alluded toby the honourable member for Fremantle.is a very complicated one, and cannot be - dealt with now. The Treasurer is giving his attention to the finances of the year, and in the course of his Budget speech he may be able to make some allusion to it. Further consideration may be given to it - when the Estimates are out of the way. In the case referred to by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, my own impression 5s that the Service and Execution of Process Act does afford a larger remedy than he supposes.",79
673,Mr CROUCH,OVERTIME IN CUSTOMS,"The evil is due to defective State legislation. Mr DEAKIN.:-If there be any de j feet at all,- I do not think it will be found in the Service and Execution of Process Act, but in State legislation. If the honourable member for Hindmarsh will speak to the Attorney-General, and put a concrete case to him, we shall soon be able to determine that. Question resolved in. the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.45 P- m",80
