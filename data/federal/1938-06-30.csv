I asked the Treasurer if he would communicate with the States to ascertain how each State had expended its portion of the special grant of £600,000 a year which was designed to assist non-roadTreasurer using payers of the petrol tax. Has honourable gentleman yet been able to communicate with the States? If so, has he received any replies? If not, will lie advise me during the recess?",13
6,Mr CASEY,Unknown,I gave directions thai such a letter should be drafted but am afraid that in the last few days I have not been able to attend to the matter personally. I undertake to do.so as early ns possible and to advise the honourable one FEDERAL CAPITA L TERRITORY. ORDINANCES AND AWARDS.,13
7,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"Is the Minister for the Interior aware that ordinances in the Federal Capital Territory dealing with comtrading hours and hours of employment are now at variance with awards that have been made since the date of their gazettal ? Will the honourable gentleman make a survey of both ordinances and awards, and endeavour to bring the ordinances into line with the awards? I refer parlast ticularly to the baking trade.",13

9,Mr LYONS,MARKETING OF AUSTRALIA N,"A communication on the lines indicated was received, suggestmating an alteration of the method adopted in connection with the marketing of Australian wool. The Government gave consideration to it, and a reply was forwarded intimating that it was of opinion that thu suggestion would not achieve 6ho results NA PIECES.",13
10,Mr HOLT,FURTHER ISSUE OF CROWN,"Is it a fact that thp proposes to make a further the issue of crown pieces? Has the attention of the honourable gentleman been directed to the reported experience of bank tellers that this coin is proving very unpopular with the general public, and that in their opinion it probably represents now about £60,000 of dead capital inasmuch as it is not freely in circulation ? Is that the conclusion formed by the honourable gentleman on reports received by him from his officers? l f so, does he propose to make a further issue?",13
11,Mr CASEY,FURTHER ISSUE OF CROWN,"I believe that there is a place in Australian currency-it may not be a very large one-for a 5s. piece. The original issue of 1,000,000 crown pieces was readily absorbed, and very few of them are in circulation at the moment. The Government has in mind a further issue at some future date, not in the immediate future. PAPERS. The following papers were sented :Customs Act-Regulation s amended-Statu tory Rules 1938, No. 05.

NA DEPOSITS.",14
12,Mr GREGORY,YAMPI SOUND IRON ORE,"A little 'while ago the Prime Minister received from the geophysical expert a memorandum dealing - with the method of locating deposits of iron ore at Yampi Sound. Will the right honourable gentleman consider the making of a geophysical examination of the iron ore deposits of Australia so that, as early as possible, we shall have some idea as to the quantity of iron ore available in this country?",14
13,Mr LYONS,YAMPI SOUND IRON ORE,"Consideration will be given to the matter raised by the honourable member, but of necessity the decision as to whether such an examination would really be worthwhile is a matter upon pre- which the Government must be guided by the advice of experts. NON-OFFICIAL POST OFFICES..",14
14,Mr JOHN LAWSON,YAMPI SOUND IRON ORE,"Can the Minister representing the Postmaster-General say whether the departmental report upon the wages and working conditions of officers in charge of non-official post offices recommends an improvement of the rates of pay and working conditions? Is the honourable gentleman able to give to the House the assur-ance that such an improvement will - be effected, and can he say whether any improvement will operate as from the end of this financial year ?  cates the raising of salaries in most grades of the service. That recommendation has the approval of the Government, which intends that the increases shall date from the 1st July. The Government regrets that the announcement of its intention could not be made earlier, owing to pressure of other business, but those who are to benefit will not suffer by reason of the delay. OVERSEAS AIR - MA IL SERVICE. INTERNAL DISTRIBUTION.",14
15,Mr SPENDER,YAMPI SOUND IRON ORE,"Will the Minister confor Defence state what re-organization, if any, has been made with respect to the internal air-mail .services which are to be ancillary to the overseas service? If any re-organization has been made what companies are involved, and what is the estimated additional cost?",14
16,Mr THORBY,YAMPI SOUND IRON ORE,"1 made a fair l y f explanation of this matter when dealing with the Empire air-mail agreement yesterday. Although it is not actually .covered by the agreements in the bill now before the House, I explained that the Government had decided, and arrangements have been completed with the exception of a few final details which are awaiting the passage of the bill, in favour of the distribution of the South Australian mails from Darwin to Adelaide, the Western Australian mails from Darwin to Perth, .the Victorian mails from Adelaide on to Melbourne, and the Tasmariiian mails from Melbourne direct. This arrangement will enable the mails to bp distributed in every capital city approximately within an hour on the same afternoon or evening. I cannot very well make available until the bill is passed and the agreements with the respective companies are finalized, information in regard to the cost. Three different companies will probably be involved.",15
17,Mr HAWKER,YAMPI SOUND IRON ORE,"Can the Minister for Defence say, what arrangements are being made for the continuation of some of the old ancillary inland air services, such as those from Charleville. to Daly Waters nnd Cootamundra to Charleville? If those particularservices are not to be continued, arc arrangements being made to transfer the contracts to some other service in connection with which they would be useful?",15
18,Mr THORBY,YAMPI SOUND IRON ORE,"The plan to which the Government is working provides for the alteration of certain air routes. For example, the air route through to Cootamundra will no longer be necessary, in view of the fact that the mails will be distributed through two other channels, but the operating company will be invited to take over another route which will absorb its organization. The same may be said of the route from Brisbane through to Darwin. As the flying boat - service will in future provide for the traffic between these two bases, it is proposed that this internal service shall be diverted at . Daly Waters through to Wyndham. Every effort is 'being made to utilize the existing services. The operating companies have been asked to vary their routes as may be necessary to u l l keep their machines full y engaged. NA INDUSTRY.",15
19,Mr WILSON,STABILIZATION OF WHEA T,Can the Acting M i nister for Commerce state whether the Gothat vernment has taken any action in the direction of speeding up in the matter of providing some stability for the wheat industry?,15
20,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,STABILIZATION OF WHEA T,"In this connection 1I have nothing to add to the very full and complete statement that I made on a motion for the adjournment of the House last week. NA PENSIONS INSURANCE. Mr BEASLE Y,-Is the Treasurer yet able to inform the House of the terms of reference to the royal commission on tlic. National. Health and Pensions In surance Bill'? If he cannot give the exact details will he intimate what sectional interests may be affected, or whether the commission will be concerned only with matters affecting medical practitioners? If other interests are likely to he affected, it is desirable that they should have time to prepare tlieir cases.",15
21,Mr CASEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"The terms of reference have not yet been finally drafted, but the commission will be asked to consider whether the proposed payment of l is . to medical practitioners should be varied; whether the rate should differentiate as 1 ietween city and country; and whether mileage and the times at which the service has to be rendered should affect the payment. The commission will concern itself only with the medical part of the service.",15
22,Sir FREDERICKSTEWART,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,Will consideration be gi ven to the position nf dependent wives and families?,15
23,Mr CASEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Yes ; that, aspect of the subject, is definitely related to the medical services and, of course, to the friendly societies.",15
24,Mr BBASLKVJ,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,Then the friendly societies will also be affected?,15
25,Mr CASEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"The terras of reference -'will deal ouly with the medical services, but this will affect friendly societies to some extent.",16
26,Mr STREET,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,Is the Treasurer yet able to announce the personnel of the commission?,16
27,Mr CASEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,Not yet; but I hope to clo so within the next three or four days.,16
28,Mr BEASLEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,Can the Treasurer inform me when the commission is likely to.begin its investigations?,16
29,Mr CASEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,I hope that no delay will ' occur; but probably two or three weeks will elapse before the commission can actually begin its inquiries. The Government will lose no time whatever in determining the personnel of the body. MEDICAL RESEARCH FUND.,16
30,Mr JENNINGS,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Is the Acting intervals, Minister for Health able to give me information as to the amount of money available in the Medical Research Fund established last year? Has the been drawn upon, and what is thu exact positionat the moment?",16
31,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"I cannot give the honourable member, off-hand, the information lie desires, but I shall obtain it and forward it to him. MANUFACTURE OF MOTOR-CAR after ENGINES. Sir HEN RY GULLETT - I ask the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs whether that report of the Tariff Board on the manufacture of motor-car engines in Australia has yet been returned from overseas; and, if so, when we may expect, some information in connection with it?  now before Cabinet. I can say no more than that,- in due course, it will be sub- ing mitted to Parliament. NA NA",16

'MANUFACTURE OF AIRCRAFT IN AUSTRALIA. Sir HEN RY GULLETT - Will the Minister for Defence inform the House of the terms upon which the Commonwealth Aircraft Manufacturing Company is manufacturing aircraft for the Defence Department? I should like information as to prices, &c.",16
33,Mr THORBY,EXCHANGE FOR RYDE DISTRICT,"A definite contract has been placed with this company for 40 aircraft of the N.A.33 type at a competitive price in relation to imported machines of similar type. A further order will be placed later for 60 or 70 additional machines to be delivered, at over a specified period. I canany not give the honourable member detailed information as to the price of the 40 machines already definitely ordered, but fund yet it is very satisfactory. Sir HENRY Gur.LKTT - Are all the machines to be of one type?",16
34,Mr THORBY,EXCHANGE FOR RYDE DISTRICT,"The 40 machines will be of similar type; but I am glad to say that arrangements are being made to provide all types requiredThe machines, the first delivery, will be 100 per cent, of Australian manufacture.",16
35,Mr HOLT,EXCHANGE FOR RYDE DISTRICT,"Is the Minister able to say whether it is a fact that only one .shift is being worked at the Commonwealth Aircraft Company's factory? if so, has any request been made by the Defence Department for the work to be acceleiated by tin? employment of additional shifts?",16
36,Mr THORBY,EXCHANGE FOR RYDE DISTRICT,"Onl y one shift is beworked at the moment, but. steps are being taken to employ another shift in rhe near future. Mr Hoi/r - When ? .",16
37,Mr THORBY,EXCHANGE FOR RYDE DISTRICT,"I cannot say exactly. The company found some difficulty in « complete team of skilled tradesmen to operate the new machinery, installation of which was completed exonly on the 31st March. A second complete team has to be organized before it is feasible to start another shift. Tbr Defence Department and the company are working in the closest co-operation, and a second. shift will be employed c soon as it is practicable to do so. COAL FREIGHTS.",16
38,Mr JAMES,EXCHANGE FOR RYDE DISTRICT,"I ask the Prime Minister whether he will obtain information for me as to the reasons for the great disparity in the freight rate in New South Wales on coal, compared with the country. rates on wool, wheat, steel and other products? As this is an urgent matter, in so far as my constituents are concerned, which may involve industrial trouble that will affect the whole Commonwealth, I hope that the right honorablo gentleamendments; man will not ask me to put the question on the notice-paper.",17
39,Mr LYONS,EXCHANGE FOR RYDE DISTRICT,"If the honourable member is referring to the freights on the State railways, he must be well aware consideration, that questions, on that subject directed to the State Government or the Railway Commissioners of New South Wales. It is not a question which able to answer, I have no objection to obtaining the information which the honourable member desires, but I do not know that I can get him the particulars fuller or any sooner than he could himself. ; NA EQUIPMENT .",17
40,Sir HENRY GULLETT,MANUFACTURE OF DEFENCE,Will the Prime Minister undertake to furnish the House at an early date with the details of the statement he is reported to have made to the Australasian Council of Trades Unions to the effect that the Government was taking stringent steps to prevent profiteering in the private manufacture of materials for the Defence Department ?,17
41,Mr LYONS,MANUFACTURE OF DEFENCE,"I can only say in general terms that it has been made quite clear that the' Government intends to evolve a policy for the control of profits in this connection. NA BY "" THEMINIST ER FOR practically DEFENCE.",17
42,Mr WARD,FORCED AEROPLANE LANDING,"Is the Minister for fence able to inform me whether it is fact, as reported in the press recently, that when an aeroplane in which he was as travelling had to make a forced landing, he gave the name of Williams instead of his own name? If so, why did he assume another name?",17
43,Mr THORBY,FORCED AEROPLANE LANDING,"My name is well known throughout the Commonwealth. There is no reason why I should do as was suggested in one newspaper in this NA NA 1938. Bill returned from the Senate, with and a message intimating that it had agreed to the bill as amended by the House, at the request of the Senate. Ordered That the foregoing message be taken into in committee of the whole House should be at a later hour this day. PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE. I am PROPOSALS FOR THE ERECTION OF A NE'W HOSPITAL AND GAOT, AT DARWIN, NORTHERN TERRITORY.",17
44,Mr MCEWEN,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"Indi-Minister for the any Interior) [11.28] - I move That in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1936, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report:-Darwin , Northern TerritoryErection of hospital. It is proposed that a new hospital shall be erected on a site bounded by MCKaystreet, Lambell-terrace and Kahlin Beach. This site is at present used as an aboriginal compound, but will be vacated as such when the new compound is available. Tho existing hospital buildings are situated on a site which is too restricted to permit of their expansion on planned lines. The buildings are unsuitable and incapaFe of being remodelled or added to. With a daily average of 40 inpatients, the hospital is overcrowded, and there is no margin for an epidemic, prevalence of disease, or influx of population. There are no private wards, and no facilities for the segregation of white and coloured patients. The Deaccommodation for staff and other a facilities is also unsatisfactory and inadequate. Owing to the growth of military, naval and aerial activities, the matter of hospital accommodation at Darwin is one of urgency. The proposed hospital, which has been designed, after investigations in Darwin, Java and Singapore, to conform with the principles of tropical architecture, will consist of four ward blocks, children's ward, two isolation blocks, administrative block, X-ray block and operating theatre, medical officers', matron's, sisters' and nurses' quarters, kitchen block, ambulance station, laundry, garages and services. The buildings, it is proposed, shall be laid out on a cruciform type at the correct angle to take advantage of the prevailing winds. Construction will be of concrete and fibro-cement with fibroccanent adjustable louvres on the outside walls and fibro-cement roofing. A commencement has already been made with the isolation blocks, which are being erected urgently at a cost of £7,890 to take cases now unsuitably housed. The ichemo provides for 131 beds, comprising 106 in four main wards, nine in the children's ward, and sixteen in - the isolation blocks. In emergency, this number of beds could be increased by using the verandahs and, by adding a story to each of the main wards, a further 106 beds could be accommodated. The present intention is that approximately 100 beds should be provided for initially. The approximate cost of the complete scheme, excluding equipment, some of which is available from the existing hospital, is £85,000. I lay on the table plans, &c, in connection with the proposed work. Question resolved in the aftirinative.",17
45,Mr MCEWEN,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"Indi-Minister for the Interior) [11.31] - by leave- I move That in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1013-193(5, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Committee on Public Works for investigation and report:-Darwin , Northern TerritoryErection of gaol. It is proposed to erect a gaol on a site comprising 160 acres, which is portion section 2, hundred of Bagot. The existTHOKBYing gaol is situated in the vicinity of the civil aerodrome. The buildings being on high ground to the north-west of landing ground interfere with the landing of overseas planes, and those taking off during the north-west season. The buildings are unsatisfactory for the purposes of a gaol, being badly ventilated and unsuitable for the climate. The yard enclosure is too small, and creates difficulties in segregating white and aboriginal prisoners. The surrounding galvanized iron wall is in a bad state of repair, and ineffective as a barrier. The proposed site for the new gaol is favourably located about 4£ miles from Darwin and, whilst it is easily accessible, it is out of sight, of, and away from the main roads. The scheme includes the following buildings:Administrative block. Remand, first offenders' and debtors' block. White prisoners' block. Aboriginal prisoners' block. Hospital block. Medical inspection block. Kitchen, garages block. Worksheds, stores, &c, block. Boundary wall. Covered ways, watchtower. Patrol-trackways, &c. The accommodation provided for isWhite prisoners-17 . Aboriginal prisoners-98 . The buildings have been designed according to principles adopted after investigating similar establishments in other places, particularly at Changi, Singapore, where a new prison has recently been erected. The construction will be of reinforced concrete with steel doors, grilles, &c, and the outer verandah walls of the prison block will be composed of concrete posts, adjustable fibro-cement louvres, and expanding metal screeny. The estimated eost is £42,000. I lay on the table plans, &c, in connection with the proposed work. Question resolved in the affirmative. Standing EMPIRE AIR SERVICE (""ENGLAND TO AUSTRALIA) BILL 1938. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 29th June of (vide page 2811). on motion by Mr. That the bill be now read a second time.",18
46,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"Capricornia) [11.34] the This is a bill to which the Opposition intends to give its general support. I intend,, however, to interrogate the Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) on the various aspects of the measure. It is a biU to r at if y and authorize agreements which have been made between the Government of the United Kingdom aud the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, and between the Government, of the Commonwealth of Australia and Qantas Empire Airways Limited, to bring Australia into the Empire air-mail scheme giving Australia, an air service between Southampton and Sydney, which will, in the initial stages, take nine and H l u f f days, a period which is subsequently to be shortened to seven and a half days. While the Opposition agrees that if is a great step in national progress to link England and Australia by an efficient a ir service; the Government cannot be congratulated either on. the manner in which i i , has dealt with this important subject, or on bringing down a measure, which is of such importance to Australia, in the-dying-hours of the session without giving honourable members sufficient time to studythe whole of the ramifications of the bill, which consists of 22 pages of very small type. It is absolutely impossible' for anybody to give that close study which is warranted by the importance of' the measure. second-reading speech of the Minister was made only yesterday. The Govern- 3aid- . ment's action in respect measure, however, is in keeping. with its legislative actions for some time.. It takes months, and sometimes years, for the Government to make up its mind on an important matter and, when a certain course is decided, the legislation is brought before Parliament. «nd forced through, sometimes with the aid of the guillotine, without allowing members the opportunity for the const™c .t-ive criticism that is so essential to efficient legislation. They have been told by the Minister that this agreement has been entered into.",18
47,Mr THOBBV,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,rSubjec t to ratification by Parliament.,19
48,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"I agree, but the attitude of the Government when such agreements are put before Parliament is "" Take it or leave it "" . When the Ottawa Agreement was placed before Parliament for ratification, we. were told that it could not be amended. It had to be accepted, as-a. whole; otherwise the whole of the negotiations that had led to the agreement would have to be re-opened.. In bringing down this bill the Minister for Defence «aid that, instead of being subjected to criticism, the Government should be complimented on what it had clone. That is where I j o in issue with the honourable gentleman because I have no doubt that the action of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr C u r t in ) , in moving the adjournment of the House on this subject recently, expedited the finality of certain aspects of the distribution of the mails after they arrive in ..Australia, because tliere was a good deal of apprehension as to what was'to happen",19
49,Mr THOBBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,Onl y in the press.,19
50,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,- N0 definite pronouncement had been made by the Minister.,19
51,Mr TJTOKRY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"The plans had been in operation for mouths.' Mr Forde , - I shall deal with that aspect. Not only honourable members on this side, but also honourable members opposite, have seen fit to criticize the Government's lack of decision in this matter. On the. 7th June, the honourable member, for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett). The speaking on the adjournment motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition, ' ' of this . It is fiftoeii months since 1 left the Ministry and even when I was a Minister I was heartily ashamed 'of the delay in the inauguration of the overseas air-mail service. Since then that delay of which I was ashamed has gone on for another fifteen months. The Minister for Defence is not responsible for all of it, but the matter seems to be dragging on as hopelessly today as it was two years ago. I cannot for a moment understand why there should be delay in tlic making of a plainstatement as to how the mails will be distributed after they arrive at Darwin. The honourable gentleman's comments were typical of the criticism of some honourable gentlemen opposite. The' overseas air-mail service has been the subject of a great' deal of propaganda for a number of years. Promises and. assurances were given by various Ministers of the governments that have been led by the right honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Lyons). In December, 1935, Senator Sir George Pearce, who was then Minister for E x ternal Affairs and the Leader of the Government in another place, commenting upon certain of the Imperial Airways Service, said that the new flying-boat service would be .started at a very early date. In September, 1936, the then Minister for Defence, Sir Archdale Parkhill, said that the Commonwealth Government "" will now proceed to finality with the air-mail agreement"". That was 21 months ago. Speaking as the Acting Prime Minister on the 27th May, 1937, the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) SaidI am gratified that the long negotiations between the governments of the UnitedKingdom and Australia regarding the Eniipire A i r Mail have resulted in agreement on all points which had originally been at issue. scheme will he put into operation in - laniiiirv. 1038. Sir Archdale Parkhill, on the -24th August, 1937, in reply to a question, said It is hoped, that consideration of. the air agreement will lie completed at it comparatively early date. This shows that the Government in ""the last two or three years has not known where it has stood. One day one Minister would say something and the next another would say something else. In February, 1936, the Sydney Morning Herald, in a leading article, saidThe whole conduct of the administration has been from - the outset characterized by ignorance and a lack of imagination.",19
52,Mr THOKBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,That was because the Sydney Morning Herald could not get the inside story that it wanted.,20
53,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"The honourable gentleman is at liberty to attribute motives to that newspaper, but I am not aware of them. .1 take it that that was a fair statement from a newspaper that is noted for its constant support of the Government on political issues. From time to time other newspapers have commented on the delay. On the 9 th June last the Sydney Morning Herald saidIn every detail of preparation for performance the Government has so procrastinated'as to induce the suspicion that it docs uot want thu agreement. The (lover'niiient has rebutted every inquiry, and has. .e.vhibiled an .indifference.iind mi inertia, that has heroine scandalous - mails will be disti-ibute'd from Darwin. 'rhe delivery of the mails in the Comaspects monwealth is an integral part of the scheme. This is another matter in which the - public has had grave doubts ""as to the ability of the.Ministry. On the Sth August, 1935, the then Minister for Defence (Sir Archdale Parkhill) said- : That the existing internal land - plane route from Darwin to the south must be maintained and improved. On the 9th December, 1937, Sir Archdale Parkhill wrote a letter to the Leader of the Opposition, in which he said- : The question of the rearrangement of the internal routing of the overseas mails has. ncit yet been considered. Before that letter was 'written the publicity branch of the Prime Minister's DeThe partment issued a statement .on the ""'Record of the Lyons Government"", in which it referred to the Imperial Airways Service, and said It was decided to reorganize and develop internal subsidized air services to connect tlieni to the main trunk - services: According to the present Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby.) it was clear that ,u]) to the 4th June, 1938, the Government had not seriously considered internal services. According to the Sydney Morning Herald on the 4th June, 1938, the Minister for Defence saidProbably in the early stages all mail will be carried to Sydney and be distributed from there instead of fromDarwin. The action of the Leader of the Opposition in moving the adjournment of the House to discuss the internal distribution of overseas air - mails wa - s fully justified. It galvanized the Government into taking action, and resulted in clarifying a situation which, up to then, had been very obscure.",20
54,Mr THOKBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"Month s before the Leader of the Opposition moved that motion, the Government had announced its definite decision to distribute overseas mails from Darwin..",20
55,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"I draw the attention of the Minister to his statement published on. the 4th June, 1938, in The. Sydney Morning Herald, that probably in the - early stages, the mails would be delivered from Sydney, and not from Darwin ",20
56,Mr THORBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"Yes / that will be so in the early stages, but after August the",20
57,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"The whole controversy revolved around that point. I maintain that there was a lack of candour on the part of the Government until the motion by the Leader of the Opposition was moved. Several contradictory statements had been issued, and I do not think that the Minister really knew just where he stood. He had said, by way of excuse for the delay, that it was necessary to collect meteorological information. I remind honourable members,- however, that as long ago as December, 1935, Sir George Pearce said that it would be necessary to collect information of this kind. What has been done during the last two and a half years in this direction ? Surely in that time a meteorological organization could have been established.",21
58,Mr THOKBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,Meteorologica l information has been collected for a century.,21
59,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"We all know that certain records have been kept, but I am referring to the excuse put forward hy the Minister - that the delay in beginning the service was due to the need for collecting meteorological information, and I am pointing out that it does not seem to be a valid excuse. Sir George Pearce said two and a half years ago that steps were then being taken to collect this information. According to the newspapers, the delay, has been due to differences of opinion between officials of Postmaster-General's Department and those of the Defence Department regarding - time-tables, the delivery of mails,",21
60,Mr THOKBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,Who told the honourable member that?,21
61,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"I road it in the press, and pressmen have ways of obtaining information regarding such matters. If that really Was the reason for the delay, it does not redound to the credit of the Public Service.",21
62,Mr THORBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,-It is an unjustifiable statement.,21
63,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"I recognize that airtransport is developing rapidly, and that it is destined to be animportant means of communication in the future. All the important towns in Gerinany are connected by air services, and in every country in the world, air services are being extended. For both military and commercial purposes, aviation is of the greatest importance fco Australia, having regard to its vast area, its long coast line, and the suitability of its climate. I believe that the time is not far distant when aviation will be of such importance that it will be necessary to appoint an Air Minister who, working in conjunction with, or under the authority of, the Minister for Defence, will control both civil and military aviation.",21
64,Mr THORBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,It would be a tragic blunder ;to' divide the control of the various defence arms.,21
65,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"Thei r control would still be co-ordinated under the Minister for Defence. Years ago, there was a Minister for the Navy, as well as a Minister for Defence, but the Navy was so small that the portfolio for the Navy was abolished, and the Minister for Defence assumed control of all the defence forces. Tliere is no doubt that the present Minister for Defence has a great deal of work to do, and though he is tackling his job with enthusiasm, it must be taxing him severely, and the Government should do something torelieve him of some of the burden. It is provided in the agreement that progressive reductions will be made in the time taken for the journey between London and Australia from nine and a half days to iscven and a half days, but the no .reference is made to the period during which this reduction shall take place. Is it intended that within one year or two &c. years, the time shall be reduced to seven and a half days? I should like to know whether a decision has been reached on this point. Perhaps the Minister will be able to inform honourable members in the course of his reply. At the present time, the Dutch service takes eight days, but quite recently the managing-director of the Dutch company informed Sir Earle Page that, by 1940 or 1941, his company would bring Australia within three days of London. That makes nine and a half days, or even seven and a half days appear very slow. However, I do not suggest that we should jeopardize the lives of passengers or pilots for the sake of speed; I merely suggest that the Minister should give consideration to the possible shortening of the time for the trip. The - Minister has stated that, as the result of the reduction of the postage rate on letters-from Australia to London from Is. 6d. to 5d. a half-ounce, it was expected that 90 per cent, of mail matter would, in future, be carried by air. Does the Government intend to continue at the same rate the mail subsidy at present paid to the shipping companies, even though so large a percentage of mail matter will in future be carried by air?",21
66,Mr THOKBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,There will be no reduction of the subsidy during the currency of the present contracts.,22
67,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"I should like to know what is the duration of the present contracts with the shipping companies, and whether there is any provision in the agreements .for reducing the subsidy in the event of a large percentage of the mails being carried by air. We have been told that before long 90 per cent, of mail matter will be carried by air, but, apparently, the present rate of subsidy to the shipping companies is to continue.",22
68,Mr THORBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"That refers to first class mail matter only, not to the bulk mails, which .will continue to be' carried by the mail boats.",22
69,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"I should also like to know what percentage of second-class mail matter will be carried by air, and what percentage will continue to be carried by the ships. Is there any justification for continuing the present rate of subsidy? Under the agreement, the Commonwealth will pay-to Qantas Empire Airways a minimum annual subsidy of £40,000 sterling. This subsidy will be inr creased by 8s. per lb. for each pound of mails originating in Australia or its territories in excess of 40,000 lb. per annum, but shall not exceed £50,000 sterling. We all remember what happened in regard to a somewhat similar provision in the agreement for the East-West air service. It was alleged that huge quantities of matter were sent by mail by certain persons in order that the extra subsidy could be collected from the Government. The Commonwealth will also pay this company 16s. sterling for the carriage of each pound of mail matter originating in Australia or its territories. Under this arrangement, it will pay not less than £32,000 sterling, and not more than £52,000 sterling. Thus the Commonwealth will be committed to a total liability of £102,000 a . year under the two headings. In addition, the liability of the Commonwealth in respeet of the maintenance of ground organizations on the Sydney-Singapore section will be £30,000 a year, making a total maximum outlay of £1-32,000 per annum.",22
70,Mr THOKBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,That is the ^maximum.,22
71,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"-The surcharge of 3d. a half-ounce will yield 8s. per lb., but the subsidy of 20s. per lb., plus 16s. per lb., will bring the total cost to the Government by way of subsidy up to 36s. per lb. I should like to know what are the charges for this class of mail matter in other countries in the world. Was the Minister justified in making this steep reduction of the surcharge from Is. 4d. to 3d. a halfounce? I am not criticizing what has been done, but I should like to know how it compares with what is being done in other countries. The average man and woman in Australia does not send one letter a year overseas."" This service will, of course, suit commercial interests with overseas connexions, and, because so much time will be saved, it will be particularly valuable to firms which send highly paid executives abroad. To the great mass of the people, however, it will not mean very much. ,To the worker in the factory or the shop, the reduction of the surcharge from Is. 4d. to 3d. will mean nothing, but the subsidizing of the service by the Government to an amount of £132,000 a year will be a great concession to the commercial interests. I do not say that it is wrong to do this, but I should like to have from the Minister a comparison between the proposed charges for this service and the rates being charged on comparable services in other parts of the world. The Minister said that the Commonwealth Government may arrange with the company to carry out repair work to the aircraft and for the construction of new aircraft in Australia if such work be found .to be within the capacity of the Australian aircraft factory. What .authority will determine whether or not such work is within the capacity of the Australian industry? I can understand that there will be a good deal of prejudice against the Australian factory. The honourable gentleman said further that any difference between the cost of those repairs in Australia and the eost of similar - work overseas will be borne by the. Commonwealth Government. What is the justification for that undertaking? If overseas shipping companiesare obliged to carry .out repairs in Australian ports they have to meet the Australian charges for such work, even though they may be higher than those for similar work in London or in other parts of the world. The Minister may be able to justify this departure, and I should like to have his views as to what additional costs are likely to be imposed upon the Commonwealth as the result pf this undertaking. .Mr BEASLEY - Is it proposed that the Commonwealth Government shall pay for the maintenance of the aircraft?",22
72,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"No , but it will meet the excessive cost in comparison with overseas costs.",23
73,Mr BEASLEY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"How does that anise? We enter into a contract for the carriage of mails, not for the repair of aeroplanes.",23
74,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,If it is found to be necessary to carry out repairs in the Australian factory the Commonwealth is to meet any excess costs.,23
75,Mr THOKBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"On a basis to be agreed upon.. We have taken the precaution to insert in the^agreeraent a provision which will enable the Government of the day to enter, into further agreements with the company to. have new planes constructed in Australia or to have any heavy repair work undertaken in this country. That has been done in order to give our own workmen 'employment,, and the Commonwealth is prepared to bear a proportion of the increased cost. Mr pATEuaoK - It is a subsidy to an Australian industry. - Mr Forde - The honourable member cannot catch me in that way. I - believe in keeping all. the work within Australia that it.is possible to' do, but if an organization ''which is making profits finds it necessary to carry out repairs in . Australia, why should it be given a subsidy for that purpose? Why should the Commonwealth assist the company because rates of wages and living uosts are higher 'in, the'.' Commonwealth than in the United 'Kingdom-?- If 'that be done in this case, 'could we'""re fuse the wheat-growers-a subsidy because' they find' that the cost of harvesting their crop in Australia is greater than in other countries?",23
76,Mr THOKBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,The . real reason is because no duty is to be imposed on the importation of these flying boats or their parts. The principle has been accepted in this country for many years that a bounty .or a subsidy may be paid to an industry if it be found that it will result in additional employment for Australian workmen.,23
77,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"I can quite understand the undertaking being given at the present time, when we have not the necessary plant and equipment in Australia to manufacture flying boats of the type required for this service. Within a reasonable time, however, all replacement part's will be manufactured in this country, and when it is necessary to increase the mimber offlying boats to operate the service they should be manufactured here. Clause 5 (k) of the First Schedule provides that the Commonwealth reserves the right to represent that major repair work and overhaul work shall, if possible, be carried out in Australia. That is somewhat vague. Will the Minister say whether the Commonwealth has any authority to insist that such work shall be carried out in Australia, or does that matter rest entirely with the company?",23
78,Mr THOKBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,The Commonwealth has to agree to the work being carried out in Australia before it can enter any commitments to contribute towards the extra cost,23
79,Mr BEASLEY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,Then it is proposed to contribute towards the extra cost ?,23
80,Mr THOKBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"Yes , only if it is to the advantage of Australian workmen, who will get further employment in the industry in this country. No extra costs, however, can be imposed upon the Commonwealth without the consent of the Commonwealth.",23
81,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"I am not prepared to be dogmatic in regard to the matter, but I maintain that any new equipment should be manufactured in Australia if it is possible to do so.",23

We may be told that the Tariff Board is an appropriate body because it has the necessary experience and means of gathering and sifting evidence. We are also told that the officials of the Trade and Customs Department cannot determine, as well as the Tariff Board, whether or not machinery can be manufactured in Australia. I ask the Minister if it is proposed to submit this matter to the Tariff Board? I am anxious to hear what the honourable gentleman has to say in regard to that because I have in mind the long wait we have experienced in connection with the board's report on the manufacture of motor engines in Australia. That matter was referred to the Tariff Board for investigation and report over two years ago, and' the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett), myself, and other honourable members have been endeavouring to elicit from the Minister some information as to whether that report will be made available before the coming recess. Will ' there be that endless delay in securing a report from the Tariff Board concerning the manufacture of aeroplanes in Australia? It is important that, if it is possible to do so, the work should be carried out here, and we are anxious to ensure that the com,pany shall not escape its obligation to have such work carried out in Australia. Unless the company is rigidly bound in this direction, it will certainly purchase it* requirements in the cheapest markets in the world.",23
84,Mr BEASLEY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,I have yet to be convinced that any job cannot be performed in Australia.,24
85,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"I think the honourable member is right. No joh done in any part of the world cannot be done just as well in this country. Is the Government justified in establishing a precedent of this sort? If it gives a concession to Qantas Empire Airways Limited of this sort, will it not be equally justified in granting similar concessions to the friends tff the honourable member for Gippsland ",24
86,Mr THORBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,T- A concession is being granted at the present time to. the Australian steel industry by way of bounty.,24
87,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"No bounty is paid to the Australian steel industry today. Bounties are provided for a few industries, but they are chiefly primary industries. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited says that it does not need protection now because it is impossible, owing to the armament race overseas, to import supplies of steel. That company can compete today on a free trade basis.. The steel bounty was wiped Out years .ago. We know that in tariff schedules protection is afforded, for the steel industry by way of duties, but, owing to the difficulty of securing supplies, with - the exception of a small quantity of special steels that cannot be manufactured here, no steel is coming into this country. The importers of these special steels have to wait a long time before their orders a.ro fulfilled.",24
88,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,Hon.. G. J. Bell) Order! The honourable member is getting away from the bill.,24
89,Mr FORDE,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"I was merely pointing out that no. steel bounty is paid in Australia today. I am. glad that a' concern with the experience and the past history of the Qantas company is to be linked up with the Empire Airways in this scheme. I wish to pay a tribute to the splendid record of Qantas Airways in 'Australia. Everything the Minister has said in regard to its operations in Queensland is amply justified. It has been carrying on services in different parts of Australia for many years with exceptionally few accidents, and it has played a very important part in making the people of Australia air-minded. Safety is its watchword. Speed, safety, economy, payload and comfort are essential attributes of a commercial typ""e aircraft, but it is impossible to combine the ideal of all of thesefeatures in any. one aircraft; consequently, it is necessary to compromise in the most advantageous manner, and, while speed is the main reason for the use of aircraft in transport, the maximum of attainment in this direction must be limited to cater adequately for safety, economy and comfort. I believe that the Qantas company has more nearly achieved the attainment of that' ideal than any other civil aviation company in Australia. When the Qantas company is linked up with Empire Airways in the vast organization under the control of that company, with all its technical experience, it will have the means of securing the latest scientific information appertaining to air services throughout the world; and, as the result, I believe we shall have a very efficient air-mail service between England and Australia. With the reservations I have made, and if the queries I have put to the Minister ure satisfactorily answered, I shall support the measure.",24
90,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"Flinders) [12.13]. - I can sympathize with the wish of Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde) that the House had had an earlier opportunity to discuss these agreements in that? detail. With that, I feel sure, all honourable members will, agree. In actual tice, however, international agreements of this sort must obviously be made first place between governments and then, in due course, be either wholly rejected or accepted by the respective parliaments. It is obvious that when governments different countries are negotiating matter like this, which requires so much very difficult problem. compromise, it is not possible for them consult their parliaments on every point. Being interested in this agreement, I took the trouble to travel both ways over the whole of the route, and discussed it everybody interested in it ; but I have never been consulted in any way or called into conference by any single member of the Cabinet. In that, I can only bow to the wisdom of the Cabinet. air-mail I have, nevertheless, every sympathy with the difficulties that the Minister and the Cabinet have had in effecting this agreement. If the problem had been solely to provide an adequate inward and outward mail for Australia, it would have been comparatively simple. [Quorum formed.] But those interests conflicted with the interests of the Government of the United Kingdom, and, to 6ome extent, the interests of the vernment of New Zealand; also the interests of Empire communications as whole. A service adequate to our requirelow ments is quite different from one that would be adequate for the requirements of the Governments of the United Kinginternational dom and New Zealand. Therefore, we the outback services. had to compromise, and the making of a compromise without unduly sacrificing our interests was a difficult problem. Had it been a case of providing merely . our own air-mail service, we would have provided a service with a terminal at Darwin and distributed the load among that other services, despatching it in three separate directions.",25
91,Mr BEASLEY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,'Was not that the original proposal?,25
92,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"That was, I think, Australia's original suggestion, but we had to sacrifice our direct interests in order to compromise with the interests of the Empire communications as a whole.",25
93,Mr BEASLEY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,Can the honourable member give us any information about,25
94,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"I can give no pracinformation on the point. I have never been taken into any one's confidence. in the Apart from having had to compromise with other external interests, we have had to compromise with the interests of the air-mail services supplying the needs of of our capital cities and the necessary on a internal services. This was another We were to faced with the establishment of an absolutely up-to-date service from London to our capitals, and at the same time the maintenance of services to which we had with become accustomed, the withdrawal of which no one would seriously consider. I regard the compromise outlined by the Minister as an excellent one. The difficulties will increase as the pace of the services is hastened. I am quite sure that, when the schedule is speeded-up it will be impossible to insist that the operators shall land at such frequentintervals as has been the case in the past. To get a reasonably high speed in air transport, one has - to fly in considerably longer stages, so that the aircraft may operate at most efficient heights and take advantage of the most favourable routes. Qantas Airways, I know, Gohas been tremendously handicapped in the-past by having 'had to land at frea quent intervals, and also come down to altitudes in order to drop mail-bags. We shall be faced in the very near future with the dissociation of our main air-mail services from Our main services will have to be express, and the outback services slower ones, stopping at all the places along the different routes needing the service, and having every right to it. In this connection, I was glad to hear the plan outlined by the Minister for making use of the services which have been operating in the past, and which, to some extent, will be superseded. I particularly regret that, in the outline which the honourable gentleman has given to us, and which we have seen in the press, no mention was made of what is to become of that very excellent service run with the greatest efficiency and little limelight by the Butler organization, from Co'otamundra to Charleville. Mr. Butler and his staff are entitled to every consideration. One can see quite easily how the civil aviation authorities can make use of the other lines, but it is not such an obviously easy matter to determine what can be done with this organization In the references to undue delay the last two years, not only in this country, but also overseas, the impression was given that the Australian Government was the sole cause of the trouble; that we were, so to speak, unnecessarily obstinate in holding out for selfish points of view. I should like to say in defence of the authorities of the day, that when I flew myself out from England in 1936, at almost every point along the route I heard criticism of the scheme and the expression of very grave doubts as to its feasibility. The criticism may have been rather more.loudly voiced in Australia, but I assure the House that it was voiced also over every inch of the route from the United Kingdom to Australia. Another big problem which has had to be overcome is the provision of facilities through the Dutch East Indies, not because of any hampering action on the part of the Dutch authorities, but on account of the type of service upon which we have decided, which does not coincide with the type which the Dutch are using; consequently their facilities are different from what are required by us. t ' Mr BEASLEY- That service is really ' the more efficient. ! Mr FAIBBAI.EN - It is a service of an altogether different type; it is a plane service. The Dutch have bases for [103] commercial land-aircraft military amphibians, which require different facilities from those required by the large flying boats to be used on the service to Australia. Both services are most efficient in their way. I regard as one of the bright spots in the development of British airways and Dutch airways across the world the wonderful spirit of co-operation and friendliness shown throughout by the one country towards the other. The Dutch, probably like ourselves, are notorious for keenness in driving a bargain. If they have driven a good bargain in this matter, it has been done with a remarkable lack of ill-feeling. Any airman who has flown through the Dutch East Indies is prepared to pay tribute to the wonderful friendliness of the Dutch authorities and the remarkable absence of red tape at their aerodromes. Of all the aerodromes in all the countries that I have visited I know of none at which the officials are more friendly and helpful, during and there is less red tape, than in the Dutch East Indies. It was the only place in my journey out at which I was not asked to produce a passport. I welcome this opportunity to pay a tribute to the manner in which they are co-operating with us. It augurs well for our future rela-' tions in the Pacific, and indicates how strongly the Dutch appreciate the necessity for the two countries to stand together in protection of their mutual interests. Many persons wonder why flying boats are to be used. I do not propose to enter into a technical explanation, except to draw attention to the contention that i i i regard to size we are rapidly approaching the limit to which land aeroplanes can be built, because of the restrictions placed upon their size by the landing grounds that can be made available, whereas the size of the landing areas provided for flying boats is almost unlimited. ""We talk of aerodromes in terms of hundreds of yards, and of landing areas for flying boats in terms of miles. It may be of interest to honourable members to know that while in England after inspecting a line of 27 flying boats which were to be used on this service and the South African service, I was afterwards taken up to the drawing room and shown blue prints for flying land- boats which will make these look almost like toys. The development of those later mil chinos is delayed by reason of the fact that the engineering side has not been able to develop power units of sufficient size. Provision is made for single berth cabins, and in size the new machines will quite dwarf the present flying boats. Over distances of the length of our internal routes or the majority of the air routes throughout the world, aircraft of moderate size, operating at great speed with frequency of services, will obviously be preferable to enormous aircraft operating less often, but so long as people right across the world they will demand more space and comfort.than they are content with when travelling for only about one day. One of my regrets-I do not know whether it is as material as I consider it to be-is that the existence of Qantas Empire Airways as a small, self-contained-I might also say family-unit, will be to some degree interfered with by the introduction of this larger service in co-operation with Imperial Airways. Dp to date, no one who has had anything to do with Qantas can have failed to be impressed by the fact that it is almost a family rather than an organization. Every mechanic treats every machine owned by Qantas as though it were a Derby favourite on which he had wagered his shirt. I feel that, although Qantas is to be left in complete charge of the Singapore to Sydney portion of this route, according to the Minister's explanation its aircraft will at Singapore pass out of its hands and be flown by Imperial Airways' pilots. I do not for a moment doubt the ability of Imperial Airways' pilots, navigators and mechanics, but I feel that the extraordinary pride of Qantas pilots in their machines, such as one takes in one's own horse, motor car or aeroplane, will to some extent be lacking. I admit that to have organized the matter differently would have been difficult. One plan considered was that the crews of each flying boat should fly the whole of the route between Sydney and Southampton. believe that on very short consideration one will realise that, as a matter of continual routine, the piloting of a flying boat from Australia to England would impose too great a strain on the crew. I also think it desirable that the Mr Fairbairn. pilots should operate over a comparatively short stretch of the route, in order that they may learn it perfectly. The other alternative would have been to keep our flying boats entirely on the Singapore to Sydney section. In that case there would have been the difficulty caused by the fact that the engines in these aircraft require overhauling at 400-hour periods, and that at present there is no provision for overhauling in Australia such as it is possible to obtain at the travel works of the manufacturers. To preserve the splendid esprit de corps of Qantas, arrangements should be made as soon as possible for the complete'servicing of its aircraft in this country. I am in full sympathy with the desire of the Minister and his advisers to accomplish this objective without undue delay. The criticism which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Eorde) directod to this point of the agreement seemed to me to show a lack of understanding of the real intentions of the Government. Had Qantas felt that it would have been necessary for it, at this stage, regardless of cost, to service its own craft completely, and also to provide spare parts for its machines at Australian costs, it may have been alarmed at the possible increase of running costs involved thereby. Naturally a company would desire, in such circumstances, to protect itself as far as possible. Honourable members will recollect that the contractors for the Sydney Harbour Bridge covered themselves against increased cost.  exchange.",25
95,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"True ; it failed at that point, but otherwise it covered itself. Qantas naturally desired to do the same thing. Nevertheless, I urge that arrangements should be made as soon as possible to service within this country the flying boats on our part of the route. That does uot mean that I in any sense suggest that the craft will not be adequately serI viced by Imperial Airways' engineers, or not be expertly flown by Imperial Airways' crews; but obviously men will find it difficult to take the same pride in the aircraft of another company as they take in their own. It is desirable also that the craft to be used in this service should be confined as far as practicable to uniform climatic conditions. This will contribute to efficiency. A wide variety of conditions will be experienced on the complete route from the United Kingdom to Australia, and I think it will be generally agreed that aircraft which are confined to the conditions known to predominate in a given section of the route are likely to give better service than machines which would have to meet the great variety of conditions of the whole route. Moreover, mechanics dealing with machines on certain sections of the route will be able to service them more effectively, and will have, a more intimate knowledge of them, than they could possibly have of machines travelling over the whole route. I do not call into question, in any respect, the ability of the officials and men of the Qantas and Imperial Airways to co-operate in the fullest possible degree. On the occasion of ray recent journey from Australia to England I saw something of the spirit of co-operation that exists. I did not hear one Qantas official criticize one Imperial Airways official or vice versa. But if anything should go wrong with a machine on a certain section of the journey, it would be only human for the engineers of one company to suggest that those of the other company are responsible. Regarding the spirit of co-operation already existing between the two organizations, I well remember that in flying between Penang and Singapore we entered a storm which frightened the life out of me. When we landed at Darwin Captain Lester Brain, of Qantas, said to me "" I am sorry that I cannot spend the afternoon with you; but I am taking a spare tyre to Penang in the DH86."" I knew that the journey involved travelling through 250 miles of storm, yet this official took it as a matter of course in order to assist the officials of Imperial Airways. One feature of this proposed service which disturbs mo is that the mail matter which will come to Australia from the United Kingdom will carry no surcharge, whereas that which goes from Australia to the United Kingdom will bear a surcharge of 3d. a half ounce. I also appreciate the difficulty of our postal authorities in connection with this matter. If the surcharge were lifted from air-mail matter from Australia to Great Britain, undoubtedly an agitation would quickly arise for the lifting of the surcharge from internal air-mail matter. Of the total cost of £130,000 a year for this service, about £70,000 will be collected by surcharges, so naturally the abolition of the surcharge would tremendously increase the cost of the service to the Government, and the abolition of surcharge for internal services which would have to. follow would be an even greater expense. Obviously, however, a greater bulk of airmail matter will come into Australia at the I4d. rate than will go out of it at the od. rate, for people are naturally a little parsimonious in these matters. It may be said that the reduced tonnage of outward air-mail matter will make more room for passengers, but if so many hundred people travel from Australia to England by this service, approximately the same number will make the return journey, unless the expedient of reduced fares for the outward journey is adopted. As things are, it seems to me that a considerable waste of pay load is probable. I realise the financial difficulties which have faced the Government, but it seems to me to be .inevitable that before very long the surcharge on outward mail matter will have to be discontinued. We sliould, therefore, make up our minds at once to bear the additional cost. After all, two-penny postage has been justified by saying increased postal facilities are now being paid for out of revenue, and have in fact been paid for in this way during the last few years, loan money not being available for the purpose. If the Government abolished the surcharge it would still have a very considerable margin of profit on the operations of the whole department. For this reason it would, in my opinion, be justified in taking the course that I am advocating. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made another point upon which I am at variance with him. He said that the imperial air-mail service really only interested commercial firms doing business inEngland, and people who have relatives and friends abroad to whom they write regularly. That, I submit, leaves out of account a very important factor. The reduction of travelling time between Australia and countries overseas must benefit not only our business interests, but also all the tural business and social activities of Australian life. One of the great handicaps from which Australian professional and business men, medical practitioners, artists leaders of our cultural life suffer, is their separation from kindred interests overseas. Our people definitely suffer in consequence of their lack of personal contacts overseas. When it becomes possible for professional and business men, educationalists and industrial leaders to make quick journeys abroad to keep in touch with new thoughts and methods it will be immeasurably to the benefit of Australia as a whole. Eor this reason, I feci that the observations of the Deputy Lead el* of the Opposition concerning the probable advantages of this service showed a lack of adequate appreciation. Like that honourable gentleman, however, I feel that this is an appropriate opportunity upon which to pay tribute to Qantas. Australians have every reason to be proud of the romantic growth of many of their industries, and also of the outstanding careers of many of our citizens in various professions and commercial undertakings, but I do not think a greater romance has occurred in the history of Australian enterprises than that of the development of the Qantas Empire Airways.",27
96,Mr BEASLEY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,Does the honourable member consider that Australia has properly treated its notable pioneer aviators?,29
97,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"Probably the Ohair would consider that I was departing from the provisions of the bill if I discussed that subject at any length, but I may in passing point out, with the - indulgence of Mr Speaker, that the fact that an individual has shown himself to be a wonderful aerial explorer does not necessarily make it easy to fit him into civil activities or public life. I have the greatest admiration for the wonderful work of our aerial explorers but, in some cases, their very virtues and extraordinary fearlessness in attempting great feats have made it difficult to fit them into the ordinary walks of life. We must all have regretted that some of these airmen have been obliged, for financial reasons, to engage in hazardous flights which were not culof real value. Speaking in general terms it may be said that the governments of Australia, according to the prosperity of the times in which they have been' in power, have accorded our aerial explorers and very considerable support. People are apt, at times, to complain that Australia does not provide facilities for aviators comparable with those available in the United States of America; but it must be remembered that although our air routes are as far flung as those of the United States of America, they serve only about 7,000,000 people, whereas those of the United States of America serve between 110,000,000 ancl 120,000,000 people who are among the wealthiest in the world. Having travelled 'over the back country air routes of Australia. I have felt called upon, again and again, to pay tribute to the magnificent work done by our civil aviation authorities in making these routes so safe with the limited money at their disposal. I have flown right across the northern parts of this continent over to Broome, crossing some of the most rugged country in the world, and I have seldom been more than 30 miles from an .emergency landing ground, yet on one occasion, when I flew up the Rhine in Germany in thick fog, my eyes nearly popped out of. ray head looking for landing grounds. At one stage of the journey I flew a distance of 150 miles in which there was only one landing ground. Probably if I had deviated 20 or 30 miles on either side of the ronte that I was taking I might have seen emergency landing grounds. When the difficult conditions of this country are considered in relation to the amount of money available for aerial developmental work, it must bo admitted that those closely identified with civil aviation have done a remarkably good job.",29

99,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"I propose to conclude my remarks by giving a short sketch of the remarkable record of Qantas, which is of interest because the company is the Australian agent to carry out this agreement. The company was formed in 1920 by Mr Hudson Fysh and Mr T. J. Mclnnes, two flying corps officers, who had returned from the war. They commenced a taxi - service between the Longreach rail-head and the Wintc-n rail-head, with two war-time aeroplanes purchased from the Government. In 1922, the Government of the day gave them their first subsidized route between Charleville and Cloncurry, a route of 577 miles. In 1925 this route was extended to Mt. Isa and Camooweal. The route flown then became S25 miles. In 1927 a branch line from Cloncurry to Normanton was established, bringing the number of miles flown to 1,040. In 1928 the Cloncurry flying doctor service, Which has since become famous, was established by the Australian Inland Mission with transport provided by Qantas. Qantas has been carrying out the flying doctor service ever since. In 1929 the company extended its route from Charleville to Brisbane, making the total number of miles flown 1,484. An interesting point in the growth of this company is that, unlike the usual transport companies which generally start from the city and work out, Qantas started from the bush and worked into the city. It has developed from a bush company to an international service. In 1930 Qantas pilots had completed 1,000,000 miles of flying. In 1931 Qantas co-operated with Imperial Airways in an experimental service from the United Kingdom to Australia. By 1934 the number of miles flown by Qantas aeroplanes had increased to 2,477,000, entirely free of fatalities to the passengers. In 1934, when the Brisbane-Singapore service was permanently established, the Qantas Company ended its fourteenth year of existence. Its record was recognized then as one of the most outstanding in the world in air transport. It is certainly an outstanding chapter in the history of Australian aviation. In 1934 Qantas became Qantas Empire Airways and the company initiated its service to Singapore, which it has been flying ever since, its aeroplanes have flown 3,100,000 miles between Singapore and Australia. They have flown over the Timor Sea 576 times ",29
100,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,Hon. G. J. Bell) I am afraid that the interesting history of Qantas has nothing to do with this bill.,30
101,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"I submit that it has to do with this bill to Fysh, the extent that I am dealing with have the record of an agent of the Commonwealth Government. To show how efficient the Qantas company has been is surely to indicate the good fortune of the people of Australia in having such an agent to carry on their work. I shall not continue further with statistical detail, if Mr Speaker thinks I am not in order in doing so, except to point out that in 3,100,000 miles flown, not only have there been no fatalities or injuries to any passenger or member of the staff, but also on no occasion has there been a forced landing. That is a record which is unique in the history of aviation. With all due respect to Mr Speaker, I do not intend to make any apology for commenting upon the wonderful record of Qantas, because it shows what an excellent agent Australia has to carry on this new service on which we ' are embarking. A discussion of the route between Sydney and Singapore would not be complete without a tribute to the very great work done by the meteorological station at Darwin. When the Singapore service was started it did not have meteorological aids, and the average speed of aircraft, which, as the pilots did not know where to find favourable winds, had often to buffet against head-winds, was 128 miles an hour. Since the establishment of the meteorological station that average speed has been increased to 152 miles an hour with exactly the same aircraft. That is solely because the officer in charge of the station is able to tell the pilots at what altitudes they will find favourable winds. ;We are today at a milestone in the history of air transport in Australia, and it would be quite wrong if a tribute were not paid to the men who have pioneered until the Singapore route. Mr Hudson Fysh has worked up Qantas from a small taxi service to an organization in which there is a greater amount of co-operation than I have seen in any industry. Not only is it right to pay a tribute to these men, but also, I think, the Government might well consider, when next making out a list of honours, recognizing not only the managing director, Mr. but also the senior captains. They done wonderful work in the last four years particularly, as well as during the - whole eighteen years' history of Qantas. The agreement is a reasonably fair efficient compromise of many varied terests. I think generally that the result is satisfactory. One could point to a of things oncmight have wished for, particularly we should be satisfied the proposals that have been outlined by the Minister for the distribution of the mails at this end. This distribution will cost appreciably more money than it would have cost had the mails been taken to Sydney, because the cost of the service to Sydney will not be reduced by the fact that the aircraft are carrying less mails after leaving Darwin. Nevertheless, this additional cost is well justified because will give the people the standard of service to which they rightly consider they are entitled. There are two directions in v,.,,tih I think there could be improvement. One is a provision Australian section of the route shall be kept entirely' as a self-contained unit for reasons which I outlined has earlier in my speech. is that Australia must be prepared to go to the extent of abolishing the surcharge altogether. Much criticism has been levelled, not only at the Minisefficiency ters, but also at their officers. particularly, that those who have had to make this provision for. the ground, rather water, facilities along the route, deserve a tribute for the speed with they, when the route was decided, vided adequate facilities. One of the difficulties that they have encountered the time is that, although the bility for providing the facilities the route was a responsibility of the civil for aviation authorities, they did not until the last moment what the postal authorities would decide that they wanted. Therefore, the civil aviation authorities were kept waiting until a very late date to know actually on which route they would have to provide facilities. that was decided, they provided facilishould ties in a very reasonable time. All through there has been difficulty in that facilities have to be provided by the Civil Aviation Department under the Minister for fence, whereas the major question of overseas air service. Air. Fivirlia-irti. mails was the responsibility of the Postmaster-General's Department. There is a great deal to be said for the proposal and to place the Civil Aviation Department inand the Postmaster-General's Department under the administration of the lot same Minister. I do not suggest in any but way that the Civil Aviation Department with should become a branch of the Postmaster-General's Department. [Leave to continue given.] I feel that civil aviation is something entirely by itself, but it is constantly doing the work of the post office, and there needs to be a definite co-ordinating factor between the two departments. The Postmaster-General, generally speaking, it is not an overworked Minister, and I feel that the same Minister could be in charge of the two departments. I do not agree that civil aviation is a matter for the Defence Minister. Meteorological work is largely carried out on data provided by the Postmaster-General's Department, and thai the I think that these three functions might well be co-ordinated under the . one Minister, particularly when civil aviation to provide the facilities for the mail The second deliveries that are provided for in this agreement. I conclude that it is a satisfactory agreement, and I hope that it will bo carried out with the success and that has marked operations of I think, Qantas in the past.",30
102,Mr BEASLEY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"West Sydney) [2.30]. or - The speech of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn) has been which both informative and interesting. When prothe lionorable member deals with aviation, he gives to the .House information all which is both important and interesting. responsiThe honourable member said that along the Government and the Minister Defence (Mr Thorby) were know to be congratulated for formulating this agreement because of the great difficulties that necessarily arise when different governments are. involved. He also stressed the point that varying interestspresumably vested interests-associate d Once with aviation had to he reconciled. I like to obtain from the Minister some further information regarding the reasons whioh induced the Government to depart from its original determination to Demake Darwin the terminal point for the The honourable member for Flinders expressed his regret that he was unable to give information on this point, but' I maintain that the House should have this information if it is to appreciate the real significance of the agreement. When the former honourable member for Warringah, Sir Archdale Parkhill, was.Minister for Defence, there was a good deal of press controversy regarding the proposal to make Sydney the terminal point for the service. The then Minister took a very strong stand against this proposal. He argued that, for both commercial and defence purposes, Darwin should be the terminal point; that it was essential that our inland air services should be fostered. It was pointed out that, because of the great distances between inland towns, they could be adequately served only by aerial services. It was further argued that to continue the service down the Queensland coast with flying boats would be merely to superimpose another method of transport upon the railway and shipping services already in existence. .Those arguments were, for the most part, supported by honourable members of the Opposition, and the then Minister declared very definitely that he would not budge from thu position he had taken up. It looks*, however, as though financial interests have scored another victory. The Minister was defeated, and went out of office, and, very shortly afterwards, we were informed that .the Government had. reversed its policy, and that Sydney would become the terminal point for a flying boat service. It was stated that this decision was justified on the ground that, as it was proposed to extend the service to New Zealand, the terminal point should be at Sydney, so that the service could be carried on without interruption.",31
103,Mr THORBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,The service will be extended possibly beyond New Zealand.,32
104,Mr BEASLEY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"It seems to me that this argument was added only as an afterthought; we heard no suggestion of it when the controversy first began. I still believe that the matter should not be regarded as settled, because it is just as desirable now as it ever was that we should foster and develop our inland air services in order to relieve the isolation of people in the outback areas, and to strengthen our defence equipment. I believe that there has been a surrender by the Commonwealth Government to very strong financial interests.",32
105,Mr THOKBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,There is no foundation for that belief-. Australia retains absolute control over the service from Singapore to Sydney.,32
106,Mr BEASLEY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"The Minister is able to make that statement, and we are unable to test its truth because the information before us is so meagre. This agreement is a highly technical document, ancl it cannot be expected that its full purport will be readily understood by laymen. The fact remains that the previous Minister for Defence, who had, presumably, all the facts in his possession, believed that Darwin should he the terminal point. Now the Government has reversed its previous decision, and we are given no satisfactory explanation. The honourable member for Flinders was unable to supply the reason, and, indeed, confessed that he, himself, was not completely satisfied. Under the agreement, many concessions, besides the payment of a subsidy, are to be made to the companies operating this service. For instance, ail the oil and fuel which will be used on service flights, and for trials and tests as well, will be made available to the companies free of duty, and all other taxes to which they might be subject, and this is to apply also to all equipment imported for the purpose of maintaining the service. That is an important concession. Moreover, the companies are to be reimbursed by the Commonwealth for any duties or taxes paid in the Dutch East Indies in respect of fuel and equipment purchased there. Tho agreement also provides that the Commonwealth Government shall pay to Qantas Empire Airways Limited a minimum annual subsidy of £40,000. The subsidy payment will be increased by 8s. per lb. for each pound of mails originating in Australia or its territories carried in excess of 40,000 lb. per annum, but shall not exceed £50,000 sterling. That appears to be fairly clear, but the next paragraph also provides for payments, and I should like to know whether they are to be additional to those in the paragraph I have just quoted. It is stated that the Commonwealth Government will also pay to Qantas Empire Airways Limited 16s. for the carriage of each pound of mail originating in Australia or its territories, but that the annual amount so paid shall not be less than £32,000, nor more than £52,000. Am I right in assuming that, under those provisions, the total subsidy may amount to £102,000 a year?  Mr BEASLEY.!-It is also provided in the agreement that the frequency of the service shall be not less than three times weekly, and that it shall be increased if the Commonwealth so requires. I should - like to know whether, if the frequency of the service is increased, the subsidy is to be increased also.",32
107,Mr THORBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"No , the maximum amount to which the Commonwealth is committed under the agreement is £102,000, plus £30,000 for maintenance. The company is bound to carry all the mail offering, even if, in order to do so, it must put on extra flying boats.",33
108,Mr BEASLEY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"The Commonwealth undertakes to provide £30,000 for maintenance. I should like to know whether this money is to be expended wholly on the Australian end of the service, or whether it is to be expended on a pro rata basis over the whole route from Great Britain.",33
109,Mr THORBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"Onl y on that part from Singapore to Sydney, and any amount required in excess of £30,000 will be paid, - by the Government of the United Kingdom - Line on account of the' transference of - Mr BEASLEY - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) referred to the subsidy which the Government now pays to the Orient Line for the carriage of mails by sea. Paragraph g of clause . 6 of the agreement is as follows: The Commonwealth Government will make , no reduction in its subsidy payments to the Orient Line on account of the transference of mail to the air service, though it reserves 'the right to modify the existing arrangements on other grounds if .and when it considers such step to be necessary. The wording of that paragraph is not very clear. I have reason to believe that those who control the affairs of the Orient Line are also financially - interested in Imperial Airways. From 'what I can gather, those associated with the Orient. Line are likely to be equally associated with Imperial Airways, and it looks as if they will be paid both ways. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, in a short space of time the reduction of the air-mail rate will result in approximately 90 per cent, of our first-class mails being carried overseas by air. It does not appear right to me that subsidies should be paid in two directions. The taxpayers of Australia should not be called upon to maintain at the existing high rate the subsidy now paid to the Orient Line for a service which two or three years hence it will no longer be called upon to render. It would be difficult to justify on ordinary business principles the continuation of the present rate of subsidy, whether my contention with regard to Imperial Airways and the shipping interests be correct or not. Clause 6 g is not definite in that it ought to provide some means whereby an adjustment can be made to the extent that at least the subsidy for. the air service could be reimbursed by the reduction effected in the payments to the Orient Line. In that respect the Deputy Leader of the Opposition touched a very vital point in this agreement.",33
110,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,How long will that condition continue?,33
111,Mr BEASLEY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"The clause itself seems nebulous to me; it provides that the Commonwealth shall make no reduction in its subsidy payments to the Orient mails to the air service. There is no reference to time. It further provides that the Commonwealth Government reserves the right to modify the. existing arrangements on other grounds if and when it considers such a step to be necessary. Apparently "" other grounds "" will have no reference to the air-mail service.",33
112,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,Is there any definite term to the contract?,33
113,Mr THORBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"No . A subsidy of £130,000 was paid until 1931, when it was reduced to £110,000. The point is ] that the weight of first-class mail matter that will travel by air will amount to only about 40 or 60 tons a year at most. \ It is not a very big item. A large proportion of the mail carried by the Orient ' company is second-class mail matter.",33
114,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,In . the event of the surcharge on air mail being entirely removed surely that arrangement would not be continued?,34
115,Mr THORBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,The agreement provides that it can be reviewed by the Government and the Orient Line at any time.,34
116,Mr BEASLEY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"The preamble to the agreement definitely states that no reduction will be made. That leads me to the deduction that the interests associated with comjjanies drawing these subsidies would want to be clear that they would not be affected by changing conditions in regard to transport. Those who invest in certain j>ublic utilities such as transport take the risk that changing conditions may vary the mode of transport. I feel sure, however, that nobody wishes to inflict unnecessary hardship on those who have invested tlieir money in this way but the taxpayers cannot be expected to make payments in order to enable obsolete services to continue. I am still at a loss to know why the preamble makes such a definite declaration; but time, no doubt, will show more fully the reasons for if.",34
117,Mr THORBY,PENSIONS INSURANCE BIL L,"Calare-Minister for Defence) [2.50] - m reply-In reply to the points raised by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), the contract entered into with the Orient Company was not merely for the carriage of mails; in return for the subsidy, the Orient Company undertook to run to a certain'schedule, and to call at certain ports and pick up and set down first and second class mail matter. It would be a breach of contract if, because we take a small portion of the mail away from that company, we cancelled the whole or any part of the mail contract for which the subsidy was paid. The quantity of first-class mail matter which will be diverted to aerial transport will not amount to more than four or five tons a month. That is a very small quantity when considered in relation to the large volume of mails carried by the Orient Company. The contract under which the mail subsidy is paid to the Orient Company requires the company to call at a number of ports not related to the actual route which will be covered by the flyingboat service. That is why the clause to which the honourable member for West Sydney referred was inserted in the agreement. The Commonwealth reserves the right to reduce or vary the mail subsidy to the Orient Company, not because it proposes to despatch a .certain quantity of mail by air, but because of other considerations entirely outside of this proposed flying-boat service. The Commonwealth does not propose to tie its hands in any way or to allow the Empire air-mail contract to interfere with the contract already existing with the Orient Company. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) asked what subsidy was being paid by the British Government in connection with this scheme. Foithe first three years the British Government will pay £750,000, and at the end of each subsequent three-year period, the amount of subsidy will be reduced to £675,000, £600,000, £525,000, and £450,000, respectively. Those amounts include the subsidies from the various participating countries which will be receiving part service from this organization. The honourable member for West Sydney also raised the point as to why the Commonwealth Government varied the original proposal that the service should end at Darwin and then be taken up by land aeroplanes throughout the Commonwealth. The British Government's proposal was for an Empire flying-boat service, and if the Commonwealth had insisted upon breaking the service at Darwin it would have been necessary to institute a separate service from Sydney to Auckland. A break of this sort in the flying-boat service would have probably resulted in the destruction of the project the British Government had in mind to deliver all outward mails to the various parts of the dominions free of surcharge. The iCommonwealth Government originally took exception to Imperial Airways continuing the . service right through to Sydney, thus virtually taking control of the air-mail service within the Commonwealth. A compromise of the kind referred to by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr-. Fairbairn) was effected,-as the result of which the Commonwealth retained under its control the Australian section of the air route and in return agreed to cooperate with Imperial Airways in the service to Darwin. The Commonwealth even went so far as to say that, as the Qantas Company Lad successfully established an .aii' route from Singapore through to Darwin and Brisbane, it should be entitled to retain control of that section of the route. The British Government, however, promised to provide an Empire flying-boat service in respect of which it undertook to contribute the larger proportion of the cost. It believed that such a service would be a national asset and that it would be possible gradually to extend it right throughout the British Empire. The dominions were asked to contribute only a minor proportion of the cost. It was then decided to accept that proposal, and the agreement embodied in the bill was drawn up. The retention of the surcharge in the case of the Commonwealth will meet only a portion of the total cost of its share of the subsidy, and the reduction of the surcharge from Is. 4d. to 3d. a half ounce, should be welcomed by the people generally. The agreement has been drawn up very carefully to protect Australia's interests in every possible way. The Commonwealth Government has agreed to contribute towards the cost of the .manufacture in Australia of flying boats and parts as .a definite contribution towards the establishment of an aircraft industry in tin's country. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. NA PENSIONS INSURANCE BILL 193S.

I understand that that was not the intention of the honourable member who moved for the inclusion of the paragraph; that he wished to confine the exemption to the medical benefit. I ventured to address the committee when this matter was before it previously. I believe that honourable members are convinced that hospital employees should not be denied the right to make contributions or to obtain benefits under this scheme. If it be necessary to embark on a longer dissertation, I shall be only too glad to do so.",36
122,Mr MAKIN,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,Hindmarsh) [3.6] - I cannot feel at all - satisfied with the explanation given by the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) for the omission of paragraph c. The request which the amendment featured was that hospital employees who today receive a medical benefit the equivalent of or superior to that provided under this bill should to that extent be exempt from the provisions of the bill. The Treasurer says that this paragraph will deprive hospital employees of the right to participate in this particular form of insurance. The honourable gentleman knows that that difficulty could easily be overcome by a consequential amendment in an earlier clause.,36
123,Mr BEASLEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,How does the Treasurer make his point?,36
124,Mr MAKIN,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"He says that he has received an intimation from the officers of the Crown Law Department that, by the passage of this particular paragraph, hospital employees will be disqualified from any participation in the scheme. That, definitely, was not the purpose of this committee when the paragraph was inserted in the schedule. It was then made clear to the Treasurer that he would be required to make the necessary consequential amendment adequately to provide for the position. His unwillingness to do so is shown by his declaration this afternoon. He knows full well that he could deal with the position adequately if he wished to do so.",36
125,Mr BEASLEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,Thes e benefits are generally taken into consideration when wages are being calculated.,36
126,Mr CASEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,I do not believe that they are.,36
127,Mr MAKIN,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"They are regarded as being equivalent to a consideration provided by the hospital authorities on behalf of their employees. If the paragraph be omitted from the schedule, those employees will definitely""' nave imposed upon them the obligation to make ' a contribution in order to receive a benefit which they now receive without that contribution. I consider that the Treasurer has been most inconsiderate in respect of hospitals. The bill makes no provision to aid them in their work. On the contrary, an added obligation will be placed upon them to deal with the many cases that will be referred to them by doctors under this insurance scheme. This paragraph was a medium whereby hospital boards could at least have been relieved of the financial obligations which the bill proposed to place upon them. In a speech that I made earlier on this matter, I said that not only is the Government imposing on hospitals an added obligation in that under this scheme they will have to provide for a larger number of patients, but that it is also ruining their prospects of obtaining the public subscriptions which formerly were made possible by means of the voluntary schemes of different firms. If this ban be imposed on all employed persons, many of them will be under the impression that national insurance covers the whole of the treatment in respect of sickness and ill health, - consequently, they may forego the opportunity to contribute voluntarily to the funds of a hospital. That will deprive hospitals of a substantial amount of revenue which they now receive. As a further hardship, hospitals are to be required to make a contribution on behalf of their employees for what is now provided by means of their medical services.' The whole thing is grossly unjust. An unfair burden will be placed upon these institutions, and the employees will definitely be deprived of that consideration which is due to them as a part of their employment. I hope that the committee will see the wisdom of rejecting the Senate's amendment, and will insist upon the retention of the paragraph. The necessary consequential amendment could then be made, and equity and justice would be done to hospital employees as well as to the institutions themselves.",36
128,Mr BEASLEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"West Sydney) [3.12]. - T-I support the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin). The whole matter is embraced in one point. In the calculation of wages by boards, conciliation committees and other tribunals, consideration of the services provided by the employer in these matters is assessed at a certain value and the wages are determined accordingly.",37
129,Mr CASEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,Onl y in some cases.,37
130,Mr BEASLEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"As a matter of fact, a tribunal is dealing with the matter of hospital employees in Sydney at the moment. For a long time, the different hospitals made separate agreements with their employees, but, under the Hospital Commission, there has been a move for standardization, and a common rule is now being made. All these factors are now being considered in the form of evidence and argument. The employees of the railways and tramways services are provided with a pass to travel to and from their work ancl to visit different parts of the State when on annual leave. The value of those passes and other concessions is fixed at a certain figure, and is taken into account when determining weekly wages. When all is said and done, our contention is that the employees should not be called upon to pay twice for their benefits. In the and, rates bill, provision was made whereby the payment of employees in government institutions who have superannuation benefits is to be less than is prescribed in - respect of persons who are to be covered by this scheme generally. Whatever the rates for these persons may be they will be fixed upon an actuarial basis. I am at a los3 to understand why any difficulty should be understood in regard to this matter. As hospital employees, speaking generally, receive medical benefits similar to those specified in this bill and pay for them by way of deductions from their wages, it is, therefore, unfair to expect them to contribute under thi* scheme. Certain persons who contribute for superannuation payments have been granted exemption, and hospital employees whose terms of employment provide for sickness benefits, could be granted exemption with equal justification.",37

132,Mr CASEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,And also mental asylums and philanthropic institutions?,37
133,Mr BEASLEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,I know that certain inmates of old men's homes are treated according to their capacity to work; but many of them receive far less than the basic wage.,37
134,Mr CASEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"A . provision of the. bill meets those circumstances. MT. BEASLEY - We should not impose a double contribution upon any employees. To avoid doing so was the whole object of the proposal of the honourable member for Hindmarsh. The Treasurer (Mr Casey) says in effect, "" I want to protect the health of the workers and of insured persons generally "". Very well, but why impose a - double charge on the workers to achieve that purpose?",38
135,Mr JOHN LAWSON,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"The purpose of the Government is to guarantee the provision of health services. Mr BEASLEY.'-Isolate d cases may be cited to prove any contention on this point, but we submit that the charges upon employees should not be such as to causethem to pay twice for the same services.",38
136,Mr CASEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Corio - Treasurer) [3.17] - On e underlying principle of this bill is that employees shall be assured of the benefits provided. Eor that reason the fewest possible exemptions have been allowed. If the partial exemption desired by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) for certain classes of employees is granted, undoubtedly an agitation will be set on foot for further exemptions, and the whole object of the scheme may be undermined. Although some hospital employees may, at present, be receiving benefits equivalent to those specified in the bill they have no guarantee that they will continue to receive them. The wide range of hospitals should be kept in mind. We should think, not only of the big metropolitan hospitals, but also of the suburban and private hospitals, and of the mental hospitals and other philanthropic institutions. The Government wishes to preserve continuity of insurance for all the persons entitled to come under the provisions,of the bill. Even persons covered by their terms of employment with some hospitals, may find themselves in different employment next week. They may accept employment entirely separated from hospitals. The Government desires to ensure that in such cases their privileges shall be preserved. In my opinion, when this measure is in full operation, the position of the hospitals will be better than it is today. We know very well that in some cases, hospital employees who fall sick are paid, if not the whole, at any rate a proportion, of their wages by the hospital authorities. If the Government's intention is implemented the hospital finances will be relieved of any such burden in respect of insured persons.",38
137,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,Unde r the British scheme extended hospital benefits are provided for definite contributions.,38
138,Mr CASEY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"It may - be true that in certain hospitals the - medical practitioners give free treatment to nurses who need it, but we can have no guarantee that that procedure will not be varied. If hospital employees are insured under this bill, the medical-practitioners on the oue hand and the hospital authorities on the other will be relieved of any obligation to provide them with medical treatment and medicines without cost for, as the insured persons will be entitled to the benefits of this measure, the medical practitioners and hospital authorities will be fully entitled to make the specified charges in respect of them. I , therefore, urge that the Government's view be accepted.",38
139,Mr BLACKBURN,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Bourke) [3.20] I do not propose to discuss the merits and demerits of the clause,, as they have once been settled by this House. I am concerned about the Treasurer's suggestion that, if this amendment is adhered to, hospital employees will be .entirely exempt. The object of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) is to secure exemption from ' payments for medical benefits for only those hospital employees whose terms ofemployment assure them of medical benefits. On the consideration in committee of clause 24 it was pointed out that the carrying pf this amendment in the First Schedule would - necessitate the insertion in subclause 2 of clause 24 a reference to paragraph c as well, as to paragraph b of Part II . of the First Schedule. I urged the postponement of clause 24 until that schedule had been disposed of, and ' I .think that suggestion was supported by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender). Had it not been for the guillotine, clause 24 could liave been recommitted at the report stage and the amendment in sub-clause 2 made here, but if the House adheres to its amendment sub-clause 2 can be consequentially amended in the Senate.",38
140,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Parramatta) [3.22] - I hope that the committee will revert to the status quo in this connection. The honourable membra for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) stated in temperate language what sounded like a good case, but 1 do not think that his examples were altogether true to the facts of the case. I was an inmate of a hospital recently, and I know that the nurse who attended me was a contributor to a hospital fund in New South Wales She did not enjoy the right to hospital treatment as part of the terms of her engagement. Where is the real difference in persons paying for these benefits by means"" of a pay envelopes tux and paying for them by moans of friendly society contributions? Tn each case the benefit is purchased. If hospital employees are entitled to exemption because of certain contributions they make to"" specified funds, surely the 400,000 members of friendly societies in Australia are also entitled to exemption because they contribute to tlieir societies for medical services and medicines-. Mr SouixTsr - But will not certain adjustments be made by the appropriate approved society in respect of such individuals?",39
141,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,NATIONAL HEALTH AND," Yes; but undoubtedly adjustments will also be made in the emoluments of hospital employees. Obviously, the Hospitals Commission of New South Wales will bear this point in mind. The area of the application of this measure should not be restricted in any further degree. I am sorry that public servants have been granted exemption from contributions. I do not know whether that was done in the interests of the State as an employer, or of the public servant as an employee; but certainly it was a mistake.",39
142,Mr NOCK,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Riverina) [3.29] - I hope the committee will restore the clause to its original wording. Last week I met a nurse employed in one of the largest hospitals in Sydney, and she said to me, ""Who has taken upon himself the responsibility to say nurses wish to be excluded from the national insurance scheme?'' She told me.that some medical practitioners gave free treatment to the nurses at the hospitals in which they were interested, others charged half-fees, and others felt no obligation at all in regard to the matter. Unless we are careful, we shall add to the anomalies of the scheme. It may be that maids and cleaners in hospitals will be excluded, although clearly they are on a. quite different footing from nurses, and do not enjoy quite the same goodwill from the doctors as do the nurses. This nurse said to me that they would rather pay 2d. a week and have medical attention as a right than save that 2d. a week and accept it as an act of kindness. I appeal to the committee to agree to the Senate's amendment, and leave thu clause as it was originally framed.",39
143,Mr BARNARD,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Bass) [3.30] - I cannot accept the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Casey) as to the value of restoring this clause to its original wording. I am aware of the conditions that operate in subsidized hospitals in Tasmania, and to some extent in Victoria, as the result of my associatiou with a union. In Tasmania one of the conditions of employment of the nurses and the general staff is free medical treatment. When they are ordered off duty as the result of illness their pay continues for a time, but, of course, it eventually ceases: There is no suggestion of charity in the provision of free medical treatment for the staffs in Tasmania. It is their right. In Victoria the same position applies - Free medical treatment of the staffs of the hospitals is provided for in the awards of the State wages board. I have no knowledge of what obtains in New South Wales, where the position may be as the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) states it. The Treasurer claimed that the. hospitals would benefit when the scheme had settled down. But I do not think that would work out in practice. The hospital boards will have to find extra money to make contributions in respect to their employees through the national insurance fund, and I do not know where they are going to find it. The cost of hospital treatment will have to be increased. I agree with the honourable member for ""West Sydney (Mr. 13easley) that the troubles of the auxiI liary committees that provide money to assist the hospitals will be greatly increased. Perhaps the Treasurer has mind that eventually .the hospitals be wholly maintained by the States from general taxes. The suggestion made by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) would overcome the difficulty that the Treasurer anticipates. If the hospital employees were excluded from the provisions of the bill, the position would be more satisfactory, not only for the employees but also for the hospital boards, which are the employers.",39
144,Mr GANDER,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Reid) [3.34] - In my electorate there are two State institutions, Badman, A. O. one at Newington, where tliere are 700 women, and one at Lidcombe, where there are 1,400 men. At both hospitals some of the inmates have been employed, for many years. At Newington, the wages range from £.1. a week to as low as Is. 6d. Does the Treasurer intend to deduct Is. a week from the women who receive .Is. (id. a week for washing combe, the wages range from nearly the basic wage for the man who drives the motor bus from the railway station lo the hospital, to u very low level. Does the Treasurer intend to take Is. 6d. a week from those who arc receiving, say, only a few shillings a week? One man at Lidcombe has been oarniug 7s. or fs. a week for years. Surely lie will be exempted. This matter should be cleared up by the Treasurer. I want a. definite statement as to what the position will br. I propose to vote for the amendment made by the House of Representatives.",40

156,Mr HUGHES,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"North Sydney-Minister for External Affairs) [3.52] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. On 27th July, 1929, an International Convention was signed at Geneva, relating to the treatment of the wounded and sick of combatants in time of war. This convention-to which Australia is a party - is popularly known as the Geneva Convention. The convention makes provision for the use of a distinctive emblem - a red cross on a white ground-by those engaged in medical services. Article 24 of the convention provides that such an emblem may not be used, either in time of peace or in time of war, except to protect or to indicate the medical officers and establishments, and the personnel and material protected by the convention. In order to give effect to this provision, the convention further proL ) vides, in article 28, that the governments subof the parties to the convention whose legislation is not at present adequate for the purpose, shall take legislative action prohibit the use of the red cross on a white ground, or a white or silver cross me on a red ground, except in the circumcontemplated by the convention. It is, accordingly, provided by clause of the bill that no person shall use any such emblem for the purpose of his trade or business, or for any other purpose, unless the authority of the Minister, or an authorized person, has been obtained. Tho clause also prohibits the use of the words "" red cross "" or "" Geneva cross "", or any similar words. The bill also terminates the application to Australia of certain British legislation on the subject. The convention of 1929 supersedes a convention dated the 6th June, 1906, which also made provision for the protection of the Eed Cross, but did not go so far as the more recent convention. Legislation to give effect to the 1906 convention was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1911, and this legislation applied throughout the whole of the King's dominions. In 1937, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed a further act to give effect to article 2S of the 1929 convention, but this act does not extend to the Commonwealth. The act contemplates, however, that legislation will be passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, and, in order to remove any doubt as to the power3 of the Commonwealth Parliament. expressly provides that the Commonwealth Parliament shall have power to legislate to give effect to article 28 of the convention, and also authorizes the Commonwealth Parliament to terminate the application of the British act of 1911 to the Commonwealth and its territories. This bill will, therefore, make provision to give effect in Australia to the Geneva Convention of 1929, and will terminate the operation in Australia of the British act. which will be no longer necessary.",41
157,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Melbourne Ports; [3.55] - It is almost a pleasant surprise to hear the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Hughes) propose that this Parliament should ratify one of the conventions of the League of Nations. It is true that this is a convention associated with the League itself, and not with one of its auxiliary bodies, but Australia's representatives have agreed to conventions which Australia has not honoured, much to our disgrace. However, the Government has decided to adopt this convention in order to bring Australia into line with other nations, and its purpose is to securetlie co-operation of all the signatory nations in doing all that is humanly possible for the sick and wounded members of all armies on the battlefield, whoever and wherever they may be. Two or three decades ago, most of us believed that conventions of this' kind would be respected, and that the emblem of the red cross would serve to protect, in all circumstances, those who bore it. It is, however, useless for us to fool ourselves. We know that it is now more of a danger than a protection to shelter under the red cross on the battlefield. Thus, while it is impossible for us to have a great deal of faith in international agreements of this nature, it is our duty to subscribe to them in the hope that some good may come from them. It is 'also provided in the convention that the red cross, or the Geneva cross, may not be used for trade purposes. For years past certain first-aid and medical organizations have used the red cross emblem in their - peace-time work, but there is a growing tendency for the emblem to be exploited for trade purposes, thus destroying its peculiar significance. In brief, this convention covers the folit lowing matters(3) The treatment of the wounded and sick of combatants in time of war. (2) The protection of the buildings, equipment, and personnel of the medical services of the opposing forces. (3) The definition of a distinctive emblem or badge which can be easily recognized and respected by all those engaged in war. As I have said, at one time the emblem of the red cross was regarded as an absolute safeguard against deliberate molestation for all those engaged in caring for the sick and wounded in time of war. Unfortunately, we have reached a stage when practically all our efforts to humanize war have been proved futile. Someone has said that we might as well try to Christianize hell as to humanize other Avar. I believe that to be largely true, but it is still our duty to do what we. can, and therefore I support this measure.

160,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"BarkerActing Minister for Commerce) [4.22.]. - I move That the bill be now read a second time. This measure provides for bounty at a reducing rate on citrus fruits exported to all destinations other than New Zealand, over the three years 1938, 1939 and 1940'. The bounty will be at the rate of 2s. an export box for 1938, Is. 6d. an export box for 1939, and Is. an export box for 1940. These amounts apply to the box which contains approximately 1\ bushels. For the bushel box they are to be propor-. tionately reduced. Assistance has been rendered to this industry since 1933. In that year, following the imposition of the New Zealand embargo on Australian citrus fruits, growers were guaranteed their out-of-pocket expenses on oranges exported to the United Kingdom. The guarantee was renewed in .1934, and, as that year turned out to be particularly disastrous on account of adverse seasonal conditions, a bounty of 6d. a case was granted on oranges exported to the United Kingdom. For the years 1935, 1936 and 1937, bounty at the rate of 2s. an export case was paid. Although the New Zealand embargo 193S. has been partially lifted in each year . since 1933, in favour of fruit from areas certified to be free from fruit fly, it has proved a serious handicap, particularly to New South Wales growers, in the marketing of their crops. These growers have been unable to ship any fruit to New Zealand for six years, with the exception of small quantities from the Murrumbidgee irrigation area, where there is no fruit fly. They must, therefore, look to the local market, and to export markets other than New Zealand, to absorb their fruits. When the crop is at the peak, the local market cannot absorb the whole of it, so that growers are forced at this time to export, to sell locally at reduced prices, or to a'low the fruit to go. to waste. This applies especially to fruit from the northern districts of New South Wales, whore it is liable to develop, black spot if left on the trees, and.imust, therefore, be marketed as soon as it is.ripe. The New Zealand market had proved a useful outlet for much of this fruit, and its availability assisted in maintaining a reasonable price on the Sydney market. The assistance rendered over the last few years has enabled growers in these tricts to secure an outlet for much fruit which they would otherwise have been forced to sacrifice or .to waste. bounty has also assisted in establishing in the United Kingdom market, 'South Australian oranges of a very high quality. The success so far achieved in placing these oranges in the United Kingdom, encourages the belief that a permanent market will be available there, even though only a limited quantity may be sent forward each year. porters also have benefited from the assisachieved. tance rendered by the Commonwealth Government in the past, but it has mainly been of value for the reasons mentioned. Two years ago, when the industry seeking the continuance of the bounty, its representatives were informed that, unless the industry did something to help itself through its own organization, the Government could not even consider any further claims for assistance. As the result, the industry formed the Aus1933 tralian Citrus Advisory Council in 1937. The objects of the council are, briefly, 1934 to investigate and to advise the Govern1935 . ment upon matters relating to the pro1936 duction and . marketing of citrus fruits, with a view to improving the status of the industry, and ensuring better marketing conditions for producers. The council has been hampered in its activities because of the uncertainty in the minds of growers regarding the future, 1 ancl it has, therefore, recommended that, instead of dealing with the bounty tion from year to year, the Government should approve a. bounty over the next three years at reducing rates. With knowledge of what they are to expect which it will cease. over the next three years, and of the fact that the bounty will cease at the end that period, the council and the industry can devote their attention to solving some of the problems which today miliassist, tate against the satisfactory marketing their fruit. * The Australian Agricultural Council its last meeting, passed a resolution favour of the bounty on citrus .fruits exported being continued for a period three years. In passing this resolution, the council had in mind the matters which I have just referred. As a matter of fact, it expressed the view that paythat Afr. Archie Cameron. disment of subsidies without evidence of of the improvement, or the likelihood of improvement, in the conditions of producThe tion and marketing surrounding the industry concerned, is wrong. in principle except in the case of major economic adversity. The citrus industry has given evidence of its desire to improve its production and marketing conditions, and is, therefore, in the opinion of the Government, entitled to some measure of assistance over a definitely limited period, to Other expermit of such improvement being In past years the assistance to the citrus industry has not been very costly compared with the benefits obtained in was the greater stability of markets. The figures for the various years are:Year. Name of Assistance. Amount Paid. £ Guarantee 3,328 Guarantee £9,946 | Bounty £5,227 \ 15,173 Bounty 7,886 Bounty 1937 Bounty 7,432 10,000* * Estimated. It is anticipated that the crop for 1938 will be considerably heavier than for 1937, and that, even with the opening of the New Zealand market to greater supplies .of Australian citrus, there will be quesa larger export to other markets. The bounty for 1938 will probably cost £13,000, but there will be a progressive a reduction in each year until 1940, after From time to time in the discussion of of bounties it has been suggested that the bounty does not always go to the person whom the Government desires to namely, the grower. It is the defiof nite intention of the Government that the present bounty shall go to the grower, and provision to ensure this has been included at in the bill. The Department of Commerce in has been instructed to see that the grower - receives this bounty. The only exception of is in the case' of approved co-operative organizations, which pool the fruit and to pay the proceeds to their grower-members. Provided the Minister is satisfied these organizations actually pay the proceeds to their growers, and that the growers desire the bounty to be paid to them through their own co-operative organizations, he will approve of the bounty being paid to such organizations for subsequent distribution to growers. I submit the bill for the favourable consideration of honourable members.",44
161,Mr FORDE,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"Capricornia) [4.30] In supporting this bill I express my pleasure that the Government is proposing to continue this bounty for three years although at a diminishing rate each year. No doubt this is intended to serve as a notice to the citrus growers that at the end of that period the Government expects them to stand upon their own feet. This provision is wise, for bounties are intended to assist industries only in the initial stages of their development.",46
162,Mr ANTHONY,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,Jus t like protection!,46
163,Mr FORDE,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"I am sure that the honourable member for Richmond (Mr. Anthony) would not like the protection at present accorded butter producers and bacon growers to be lifted; nor would he be pleased if New Zealand potatoes were admitted free to Australia; but I am not "" one-eyed "" in my advocacy of protection ; I believe that both primary and secondary industries should bo protected. I regret, however, that the Country party is "" one-eyed "" in this respect. The citrus industry is of importance to the Commonwealth because it makes possible the settlement of relatively small areas. It is really one of the outcomes of our closer settlement policy. Numerous returned soldiers are settled on citrus groves in various parts of Australia. In 1916-17 we had 17,000 acres under citrus cultivation, and our production totalled 1,450,000 bushels of fruit. By 1935-36 tlic area had increased to 41,000 acres and the production to 4,430,000 bushels. More than 50 per cent, of our citrus fruits is grown by returned soldiers. Un-' fortunately, some returned men were settled on unsuitable land for which the Government paid too high a price, and we have also had to cope with a certain degree of over-production. Quite recently Mr J. R. Crawford, the economist of the Rural Bank of New South ""Wales, directed attention to another difficulty of the industry. According to a report in the Sydney Sum of 27th June last, he saidThu change in the demand from common oranges and mandarins to. navels and valeuciaa has hit badly the coastal and metropolitan growers. Evidently, a remarkable alteration has occurred in the kind of citrus fruit demanded by the market. Sir Richard Linton, when Agent-General for Victoria in London, rerjorted that South Australian navel oranges sold well on the British market. It is interesting to note that 10,000 acres of our citrus country is planted with navel orange trees, and 30,000 with other varieties. Steps should be taken to replace the unpopular varieties by the varieties demanded by purchasers overseas. The Acting Minister for Commerce ,(Mr Archie Cameron) could, no doubt, through his department, do something to stimulate a movement in this direction.",46
164,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,Productio n is a subject over which the Commonwealth has no direct control.,46
165,Mr FORDE,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"But it could undoubtedly, at periodical Premiers Conferences and meetings of the Australian Agricultural Council, direct, attention to the subject. Mr AitCHiE CAMERON - I have conferred with the citrus growers' organizations on the subject.",46
166,Mr FORDE,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"I hope that the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) will also, direct attention to it at the next Premiers Conference. Probably something could be done through the instrumentality of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to deal with the problem. The organized marketing of citrus fruits and the extension of the export trade would undoubtedly be of great value to the industry. Steps to achieve these ends would, in my opinion, be of more assistance to the industry, in the long run, than the provision of a limited amount of money for bounty payments. Unless steps are taken to deal with the root, causes of the troubles which surround the citrus growers at present, it will be found, in three years' time, that vliey will again need to come cap in hand rn the Commonwealth Government for additional assistance. Temporary alleviarinn of the kind now proposed does not gi't to the root of troubles in which the growers find themselves. Under the Ottawa Agreement it was expected that the Australian citrus growers would obtain a larger share of the market in the United Kingdom, but actually our exports of citrus fruits to that market have decreased. i l r . AEOKIE C<v&fEROK - But we are in a better position on the Canadian market.",46
167,Mr FORDE,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"I am glad to hear that that is so. It is in that way that the industry will be permanently improved. Temporary patches upon it will be ineffective. The citrus growers of Spain and Palestine are the largest exporters to the United Kingdom market; but the growers of Brazil and the United States of America also enjoy a large share of the trade, while those of South Africa exported more than 1,000,000 cwt. of citrus fruits to Great Britain last year. The following table sets out the value and total imports ''of citrus fruits to the United Kingdom and also Australia's share of the trade:IMPORTS INTO UNITED KINGDOM. - Quantity. 1933Total 11,500,000 Prom Australia 46,000 1938--Tota l . . ,,. . . 9,535,000 1935-36-Fro m Australia 39,500 1937-Tota l . . . 12,492,000 1930-37-Fro m Australia 32.000 Those figures show that our exports of citrus fruits to. Groat Britain could be substantially increased. Why is it that we are not obtaining a larger share of Britain's trade?' Undoubtedly the present, situation is most unsatisfactory. Although flip Commonwealth and State governments may be actuated by good motives in seeking to develop this industry, their activities are?obvionsiy ineffective. In the press report of the remarks of Mr J. R. Crawford on this industry, a passage from which I have already cited, it is statedThe loss of the New Zealand market as the result of the embargo applied by the Dominion Government in 1932 was one of the main causes in the decline of the Australian citrus industry. The speech just delivered by the Acting Minister for Commerce did not indicate clearly whether this embargo had been completely lifted. If not, I urge that negotiations be entered into with that, object. At a conference held in Canberra during 1935, and attended by pathologists and representatives of the Commonwealth and State governments, and also of the Government of New Zealand, it was unanimously decided that the interests of public health were no longer being served by the existing quarantine prohibitions. The present Labour Government of Now Zealand has, on several occasions, expressed the opinion that the continuation of any restrictions on the trade between Australia and New Zealand was not justified. We know that a good deal of the trouble originated in consequence"" of the action of the Commonwealth Government in prohibiting the importation of New Zealand potatoes to Australia because of the fear of introducing the diseases known as corky scab and fire blight. No doubt this subject was discussed at some length by the Minister for Trade and Customs during Value. his recent visit to New Zealand, and 1 hope that a statement will be made at an early date to the effect that all the reCwt. £ maining difficulties have been overcome. The embargo on the importation of 7,990,000 Australian citrus fruits to New Zealand 44,000 7,185,000 was imposed by the Dominion Govern33,000 ment in 1932. I believe that that action 7,955,000 was retaliatory, at least to some extent, 29,000 for the treatment accorded by the Commonwealth Government to New Zealand potatoes"". The prohibition was modified in 1933 to permit a limited importation of South Australian oranges to New Zealand. In 1934 the Dominion Government again decided to allow oranges from South Australia to enter New Zealand in specified quantities and by certain vessels. I liave been assured that a real demand exists in New Zealand for Australian oranges for which the consumers of that country are prepared to pay quite satisfactory prices. In view of Australia's trade position with the sister dominion, everything possible sliould be done to encourage reciprocal action. The following table indicates the volume of our trade with New Zealand, including bullion and specie, for the period 1927-28 ro 1930-37:- ' Your.

Although the State governments control land settlement, and also the closer settlement programmes at present on foot, the Commonwealth Government could undoubtedly do a great deal to obtain more satisfactory markets for our various primary products. Probably if the standard of living of the Australian people were substantially improved and their purchasing power increased they would be able to buy a much larger proportion of the Australian citrus crop, but [ shall not dilate further on that aspect of the subject at the moment. Citrus fruits are health-giving, but thousands of Australian families cannot purchase them because they have no margin over what is required to purchase the bare necessaries of life. Consequently, fruit on many orchards is left to rot on the ground. 1 believe that the Acting Minister for Commerce will take this matter up with enthusiasm during the recess, and I hope that he will be able to make a satisfactory report! to Parliament when it meets again.",47
168,Mr GARDNER,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"Robertson) [4.45] I commend the bill to the House. The bill is proof that the Government realizes that, although part of the difficulties of the industry have been removed, those difficulties are still very considerable. [Quorum formed.] Kxcoss of Exports. Before I was interrupted by a futile attempt to count out the House-suc h attempts must be futile- 1 was referring £ £ £ to the fact that many difficulties still 548,492 confront the citrus orchardibts, and that, 1.527,985 when all the circumstances of industry 2,197.391 .1.997,280 arc consideied, it must be apparent that 1,615,129 it lieuds further assistance: .l.n my elec1,867,229 torate there are mote citrus growers than 1,569,866 there are in auy other Commonwealth 2,623,590 electorate, but none of them will share directly in the benefit from the partial lifting of the embargo' against the importation of Australian icitrus fruits into New Zealand, although they will receive indirect benefit. There is a certain reason, which there is no need to specify, why those growers cannot participate in that direct benefit. The partial lifting of the restrictions by the Government of New Zealand has resulted in a larger quantity of Australian citrus fruits going to New Zealand now than even went to that country before the embargo was imposed, but the fruit mainly comes from South Australia and a part of Victoria. I hope that in addition to this bill, which I am glad to note has the support of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde), there will be further scientific investigation of the citrus areas on the eastern coast, in order, .if possible, to enable the growers in those areas to export their fruit to New Zealand. The bounty offered under this billis to be paid for three years on a sliding scale. The growers are pleased that it, has not been restricted to one year. ' As the result, of the payment of the bounty, a large quantity of citrus fruit will be exported overseas, and the result will'""he a diminution of the quantity of fruit that'will be sold on the local market, with a consequent appreciation in the local prices. Therein will be the indirect, benefit that some of my constituents will enjoy. New Zealand is anxious to have the disability which reacts against the lifting of the embargo against the importation of oranges from the eastern parts of Australia removed, and to that end it has sent several experts to the eastern Australian citrus-growing districts to investigate the matter. It cannot be gainsaid that at least in certain times of the year there is no danger of harni resulting to New Zealand from the import of oranges from those districts. When the Minister for Defence (Mr. Thorby) was Assistant Minister for Commerce, his experience in the New South Wales Department of Agriculture Stood him well in his efforts on behalf of the citrus industry of New South Wales to eliminate this trouble. I trust that the department will not allow the splendid work that he did to remain incomplete. New Zealand-is anxious to meet the growers of New South Wales, and I think that if further scientific investigation is undertaken the present difficulties can be surmounted. I hope that the efforts that have been made to ensure that this bounty will be paid to the citrus growers will have the desired results. I understand that every precaution has been taken to ensure that the bounty will go into the pockets of the growers themselyes. I commend to the citrus-growers the need for them to organize. I regret the disunity that exists among them. They should realise that they would have more hope of obtaining assistance from the Government if they presented a united front. ' It is essential that this, industry should be assisted. The wealth of the country comes from the soil and, although the citrus industry does not rank in importance with the wheat and wool industries, it does contribute substantially to the wealth as well as to the health of the nation.",48
169,Mr NOCX,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"Riverina) [4.55] - Pro tection is the declared policy of Australia and, in that respect, there is no reason why the primary industries should not be on the same footing as the secondary industries. The citrus industry is also entitled to consideration by reason of the fact that there is no justification for any section of industry to be called' upon' to carry the burden of national policy. Every ' honourable member will admit' that the citrus industry was disorganized as the result of the embargo which was imposed by New Zealand in retaliation for the embargo which was placed on the importation into Australia of New Zealand potatoes. Ever since that action was taken, the producers who had been planting in anticipation of an extended market in New Zealand have been prejudiced by national policy. In these circumstances, there is an obligation on the part of the Commonwealth Government to try to compensate the growers. Secondary industries have protection, because their costs are higher than are the costs in competitive countries, and, on the ground that tariffs add to the growers' costs, the citrus industry is entitled to assistance. The popular conception was that when the New Zealand embargo was lifted there would be no need for further assistance to the citrus-growers, but prices slump when there is a surplus of the fruit. Citrus fruits are perishable and cannot be held back from the market. The Government 13 justified in granting this assistance to enable the citrus industry to recover from the harm that occurred when'the New Zealand embargo was in full force. The bounty will be paid on a sliding scale, for three years. That is of benefit to the growers. It must be recognized that, although the embargo in New Zealand has been removed from fruit which comes from fruit-fly-free areas, it is the declared policy of the Government of New Zealand to purchase the dominion's citrus requirements through one organization, thus eliminating competition. I believe that the Government has taken the fact that the elimination of competition in New Zealand will result in reduced returns from that dominion into consideration in deciding to pay this bounty as a means of assisting the citrus-growers in exploiting and securing some competition from markets in other parts of the world. I commend to the growers what was said by the Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr Archie Cameron) about their need to organize on a united basis. That is good advice. While the citrus-growers are divided,, their interests are prejudiced. I hope that the market for citrus fruits in the eastern countries will be extended. I impress upon the House, however, the fact that this bounty is to be-payable only in respect of fruit that is shipped abroad to places other than New Zealand; it is not a bounty on production, nor on all exports, and the amount is most moderate.",49
170,Mr BEASLEY,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,Are refrigerating facilities now satisfactory for the export of fruit over long distances?,50
171,Mr NOCK,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"They are reasonably satisfactory for fruit exported from Western Australia and South Australia, but the journey from 'Sydney to England is rather too long, and the fruit does not usually arrive in the best condition. However, the taking of fruit off the Australian market tends to prevent a glut, and makes for better prices.",50
172,Mr JOHN LAWSON,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"Macquarie) [5.2] - I support the bill, and I offer the Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr. Archie Cameron) my congratulations, not only on bringing down this bill, but also on interesting himself in all phases of the fruit-growing industry, and on taking the trouble to acquaint himself with the difficulties that confront the dustry, difficulties which vary from State to State, and also in different parts of the one State. I believe that I speak .accurately when I say that no other primary industry has suffered more in the last six or seven years than has the citrus fruit-growing industry. In common with all primary industries,' it was, of course, the victim of the general depression, but it suffered more than most because oranges, grapefruit ancl other citrus fruits are unfortunately, and I believe wrongly, regarded as semi-luxuries. For that reasonthey arc among the first to be cut out when bad times come, and purchasing - power is reduced. Thus the industry associated with their production suffers more than those engaged in the production of basic necessities. The citrusgrowers have also suffered because of the increasing output of the industry. In the case of wheat, and other annual crops, production may be regulated from year to year, but that is not possible in the case of citrus fruit. The undoubted prosperity which the industry enjoyed before 1932 encouraged the growers in all States to plan ahead, and to go in for fairly heavy plantings of young trees. These are now coming into full bearing, and the industry is faced with the problem of finding a market for the increased production. This year,. it is estimated that the-production of oranges alone will exceed that of last year by 500,000 bushels. Finally, the industry has, if I may so describe it, been nailed to the cross of political expediency, both in this country and in New Zealand.",50
173,Mr BEASLEY,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"Then the honourable member admits that the restriction of trade was not due to a desire to keep out , pests ?",50
174,Mr JOHN LAWSON,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"To some extent this matter of pests was not put in its true light. The estimated production of oranges for the year 1936-37 was 3,S56,889 bushels, while for 1937-3S the estimated production is 4,303,000. [Quorum formed.] I have here a table prepared by the officers of the Department of Commerce setting out the production of oranges for 1932-33, and the estimated production for each of the succeeding years up to 1937-3S. I ask inleave to have the table incorporated in Hansard. [Leave not granted.] Trade relations between New Zealand and Australia have been in an unsatisfactory condition for the last five or six years. I do not wish to dwell on the .cause; suffice it to say that differences have existed, and the citrus fruit-growing industry has suffered very severely in consequence. Those trade difficulties were the original cause of the embargo imposed by the Government of New Zealand on the importation of citrus fruits from this country. Some time ago, the Government of New Zealand embarked upon a policy for supplying the needs of that dominion in regard to citrus fruits entirely from its own territories, and orchards were established in the Cook Islands and elsewhere. While those efforts were not wholly successful, it is a fact that considerably more citrus fruit is being produced in New Zealand and the islands under its control than was the case five or six years ago. The desire of the Government of New Zealand to protect this newly established industry was one of the reasons for the imposition of the embargo on the importation of Australian citrus fruits, but there were other reasons. However, the position today is vastly improved. The lionorable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) asked, by way of inter jectionj whether restrictions on trade between New Zealand and Australia were really due to a desire to prevent the introduction of pests. We know that the excuse given both in New Zealand and Australia for the embargo was that New Zealand desired to protect itself against the introduction of the Mediterranean fruit-fly. To-day, however, New Zealand is prepared to admit citrus fruit without any restriction, except in regard to fruit grown in certain specified areas which cannot be guaranteed free from Mediterranean fruit-fly. Those areas are almost wholly within the the coastal districts of New South Wales represented by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Gardner) and myself. Most of the citrus-growing areas of Australia are free to export fruit to New Zealand throughout the whole of the year without restriction, and that, to a great degree, has had the effect of improving the general position. It is estimated that, during the present year, New Zealand will import from Australia 320,000 oases of 70 lb. each. For the three years prior to the imposition of the embargo by New Zealand, imports from Australia, were as follows:Year. 60-lh. cnsi.'K. 1930 100.000 1931 103,000 1932 .. 105,000 Thus, the average importations over those three years amounted to 145,095 cases, and those were 60-lb. cases. Compare that with this year's estimated importation of 320,000 cases of 70 lb. each, which are equal to 373,333 cases of 60 lb. each. This is more than two and a half times the average quantity imported for each of the three years immediately prior to imposition of the embargo. That dicates the extent to which the trade position has improved in regard to citrus fruits, and it will be still further improved. It is proposed in this bill to inaugurate a long-distance policy for helping citrus fruit-growing industry by granting of a bounty, not on fruit ported to New Zealand, which is a Mr John Lnvoxon. Bounty Bill 1938. tively lucrative market, but on fruit sent to the United Kingdom, Canada, the East and other places. The reason for this distinction is evident. It costs about the 13s. a case to market fruit in Great Britain, where the market is much more precarious than in New Zealand and the wastage due to long distance transport much greater. Nevertheless, it is necessary to encourage exploitation of this and similar markets in order to relieve the local market of surplus production. The Acting Minister for Commerce expressed the hope that, during the next three years, the industry would put its house in order, and in this I entirely agree with him. It will not be an easy thing to do. I have to admit, as did the honourable member for Robertson, that the domestic affairs of the industry are not in the happiest state. There is a-certain amount of disruption within the industry itself. Several distinct organizations of growers are in existence, and I suggest that, when the Government is negotiating with the representatives of the industry, it should see that it gets into' touch with the representatives of all the organizations whioh - justifiably claim to represent important sections of the industry. There is a Fruit Growers' Federation, which represents all sections of fruit-growers generally, and there is, in addition, the Hawkcsbury Citrus Association and the Citrus Growers' Defence Association, which are especially representative of the citrus fruit-growers. I understand that, in recent negotiations between the Minister and the representatives of the industry, the last two organizations were ignored. I suggest that they be invited to send representatives to discuss their problems with the department. In my opinion, the chief difficulty with the which the citrus fruit-growers in New inSouth Wales have to contend is the Mediterranean fruit-fly, which is extremely difficult to eradicate. I suggest that, as a preliminary, this problem should be brought under the notice of the Australian Agricultural Council. the The average commercial fruit-grower the is beset by a large number of expests, and although lie is capable relaof dealing with many of them, he cannot deal very adequately, particuCouncil larly in the coastal areas of New South Wales, with the Mediterranean f r u it for the simple reason that flanking the citrus-growing districts in the coastal areas is a multitude of back-yard present. orchards in the suhurban and outeris inetropolitan areas of Sydney. back-yard orchards simply a multiplicity of septic pockets, in which are incubated 90 per cent, of the pestilent diseases that cause so much damage to the crops of f r u it growers the coastal areas.",50
175,Mr CURTIN,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,Does not the New South Wales Government compel everybody who has a f r u it tree in his back yard to register it?,52
176,Mr JOHN LAWSON,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"Every comf r u mercial grower is required to pay a registhem tration tax, but no registration is required of back-yard orchards.",52
177,Mr CURTIN,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"1I have half a dozen f r u it the House. trees at my place at Cottesloe; I do not sell f r u it , but I have to pay a registration fee for those trees.",52
178,Mr JOHN LAWSON,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"That is not the case in New South Wales. suggest that the Australian Agriculthe tural Council take up this very the important question. The position that the average commercial f r u it grower takes very great care of his in order to keep pestilent diseases away from his orchard. He takes all proper precautions that are either laid down i the regulations, or advised by agricultural and horticultural inspectors. back-yard orchardist is in a totally ferent category. He does not grow f r u for profit ; he is not concerned whether he gets a clean crop or a quality of crop; and, unfortunately, his trees are not. subjected to the regular and ruthless inspection of orchard inspectors. The result is that back-yard orchards, particularly in the metropolitan and outer suburban areas of Sydney, are riddled with disease and are the main breeding grounds for the Mediterranean f r u it fly, which has caused the citrus growers of New South Wales and other parts of the Commonwealth the loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds in recent years. I urge the Government to submit this matter to the Australian Agricultural at its next meeting, which, I understand, is to take place in August, fly (ind endeavour .to formulate some scheme whereby this problem can be tackled in a much more effective way than it is at I say most emphatically that it being neglected today. I have lived in These a suburb of Sydney for the last six or represent seven years, and I know that the average back-yard orchard is inspected only once in about five years. Even that inspection is a very cursory one. It is impossible, in in these circumstances, to expect that orchard diseases will be eradicated. I urge this course upon the Minister with a view to giving those meu, who have worked hard and endeavoured to keep their f r u it free from disease, a chance to rid their properties of the Mediterranean it fly, which, as I have said, has cost hundreds of thousands, of pounds in rhe past, and will cost even more in the future. I support the bill, and I trust that it will have a speedy passage through [Quorum formed. |",52
179,Mr FROST,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"Franklin) [5.21] - I congratulate the Acting. Minister for I Commerce (Mr Archie Cameron) upon introduction of this bill. Although State which I represent in this House is is not interested in the growing of citrus - fruits, I know the value of the industry trees to this country. I cannot agree with the contention of the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Gardner) that the n citrus-growers of Australia are placed in a difficult position because of the embargo But the placed upbn the importation of potatoes diffrom New Zealand. As a matter of fact, it there has never been a complete embargo on the importation into that dominion Australian citrus fruits. Restrictions are imposed only in respect of f r u it grown in those areas which are not free from disease. The same conditions apply to the Australian embargo, on the importation of New Zealand potatoes. Australians are not a frnit-eating people, and as a means of solving the difficulties which beset fruit-growers generally every encouragement should therefore be given to the people to eat more f r u it . The climatic conditions of Australia, and the composition of its soils, are favourable for the production of f r u it of high quality, and, in my opinion, we produce fruit equal in quality to that grown anywhere in the - world. I was unable to understand the statement - made by the lionorable member for Riverina (Mr. Nock) that New South Wales citrusgrowers were unable to ship their fruit to Great Britain.",52
180,Mr NOCK,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,They found that a large quantity of the fruit was damaged before it arrived on the British market ,53
181,Mr FROST,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"Whil e I was in England in 1935 I had an opportunity to sec New South Wales citrus fruits exhibited for sale in the borough markets. The lemons exhibited were of especially good quality and, judging by appearances alone, the - oranges were equal to any exhibited for sale. That fruit was packed in New South Wales and shipped from Sydney, and commanded the highest prices. In 19-28, the South African citrusgrowers were shipping a good deal of fruit to England, but much of it was of inferior quality. The South African Government offered inducements to the citrus-growers to produce varieties which were found to be. most popular in the markets of the Old Country, with the result that when I was in England 1 saw a Union Castle boat at Southhampton unloading over 50,000 bushels of South African oranges, which upon inspection proved to be as good as any produced in any other part of the world. I was informed that, as the result of the assistance granted to the citrus-growers by the Government of South Africa, the quality of the product had improved materially. I urge upon the Minister the desirability of instituting inquiries to ascertain the most favoured varieties in the export markets with a view to producing those varieties especially for export. In the opinion of the English buyers the Australian oranges have too many seeds in them; but no fault is found with the condition of the oranges on arrival on the English market. The citrus industry is well worth fostering and I trust that every honourable member in this House will support this bill as representing an effort on the part of the Government to improve the conditions of the industry. Honourable members opposite too frequently blame Tasmania for the absence of markets for Australian citrus fruits, and only too often do we hear the statement repeated that, the embargo placed upon the importation of New Zealand potatoes has had a disastrous effect on the citrus industrygenerally. As I have said on many occasions, the embargo on the importation of certain New Zealand potatoes had nothing whatever to do. with the decision of the New Zealand Government to impose an embargo in respect of the importation of Australian citrus fruits grown in certain areas.",53
182,Mr NOOK,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"Althoug h there is no disease in Australian cherries, the New Zealand Government will not permit their importation.",53
183,Mr FROST,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"I can quite understand that if the cherries are grown in an area infested with fruit fly, but I am quite sure that no embargo is placed on the importation of cherries from disease-free areas. Tasmania had much the same experience as New South Wales in connection with its attempts to eradicate orchard pests. As a preventive measure the Tasmanian Government passed a law which requires that all trees grown in back yards must be sprayed, and provides that those found to be infested with disease may be destroyed.. In Tasmania a householder must either keep his trees clean or lose them. I agree with the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr. John Lawson) that a neglected orchard is a veritable nursery"" for pests. Apparently, however, the New South Wales Government is afraid to bring in a law requiring all householders to keep their fruit trees clean, and because of that the commercial fruit-g'rowers are penalized. The CommonAvealth Government has no power to deal with these matters except in relation to the Federal Capital Territory. They come within the province of the States, and unless the State governments bring down legislation designed to aid the fruit-growers in theeradication of insect pests, the fruit-growers will continue to suffer heavy losses.",53
184,Mr HAWKER,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"Wakefield) [5.30] I approve the main purpose of this bill. I congratulate the Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr Archie Cameron) upon having introduced a measure providing for assistance to be given for a period of three years. that extent, this is an improvement on . previous measures. also agree that it is fair to provide for a tapering off of the bounty over a period, at the expiration of which the industry may be expected to have reorganized itself and improved the quality of its product. I suggest, however, that the period hero fixed is too short to achieve any practical results in certain most important directions, and that the tapering oft' is too sharp to give either a sense of security, even for the period covered by the bounty, or the necessary encouragement to induce growers to incur the risk, trouble and expense of establishing a stable, self-supporting market.",53
185,Mr FBOST,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,The period should be not less than five years.,54
186,Mr HAWKER,CITRUS FRUITS BOUNTY BILL,"I agree with the honourable member; and the tapering down should be no sharper than at the rate of 3d. a case a year. Most of the trouble in this industry has been experienced in New South Wales, which has never exported considerable quantities of citrus fruits other than to New Zealand. Encouragement of this sort for three years will not be siifficient to induce any grower to make a change of the varieties grown. In the past, a consistent plan has been followed only in South Australia, and the results have been so uncertain and discouraging that it is unlikely that this bounty will lead to any considerable development or improvement of the existing, rather chaotic, and struggling condition of the industry. However, for the present year the bounty is on a' satisfactory basis, and the provision in respect of subsequent years can be dealt with when the time arrives. I , therefore, do not press the Minister for any alteration of the schedule to the In committee, however, I propose to direct attention to the safeguards provided in respect of the growers, for whom the bounty is being provided. As the bill is drafted, some fruit may pass into the bands of dealers and be exported by them, the grower being unaware that he is entitled to the bounty. Some obligation should be placed upon the exporter to notify the grower of his intention to export, and thus enable the grower to apply for the bounty. I have much To pleasure in supporting the bill. [Quorum formed.}  with other honourable members in congratulating the Government upon having introduced this measure, and the Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr Archie Cameron) on the able manner in which, so far, lie has handled it. I consider that he has made quite a good showing as a Minister in this House, and that he should be commended for the work he is doing. I am not altogether enamored of bounties, but in the present instance a bounty is justified. In the first year it will be at the rate of 2s. a case, in the second year at the rate of Is. 6d. a case, and in the third year at the rate of Is. a case. Some of the finest oranges grown in the world are produced in the electorate of Boothby. Whilst I was in London as Agent-General for South Australia, many experimental shipments of oranges were made from that State, and I was pleased at the manner in which they were received on the London market; there was a great demand for them, and eventually a good trade was developed. Even when the embargo on the export to New Zealand was imposed, oranges from Renmark and the Torrens Valley were admitted into that dominion. The bill is drafted on right lines, and I hope that it will have a speedy passage. Certain remarks have been made in regard to the period of the bounty. I should have liked it to be five years, but I am prepared to support the three-year period in the hope that it will prove of benefit to this particular : industry.  support the bill, and am, indeed, gratified billthat the Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr Archie Cameron) has seen fit to assist the growers of citrus fruits in such a material fashion. The greatest measure of my approval is given to the encouragement of primary producers to be members of a co-operative organization. I am conscious of the fact that, under the prevailing economic conditions, those engaged in different callings must, if they are to obtain justice, belong to an zation. The advantages of co-operation are greater in the case of primary producers than in the case of any other class in the community. It goes against my grain to congratulate a government to which I am politically opposed, but I believe in giving credit where it is due, and on this occasion, at least, every member of this Parliament can support the Government in the measure it has introduced. If the citrus-growers of Australia are entitled to a bounty, by the same rule so also are the wheat-growers, the wool growers, and the exporters of every other form of primary production. I hope that, after this exhibition of political wisdom, the Ministry will introduce in the ensuing session measures of a like character in relation to wheat, butter, wool and other exportable primary products. I have always been a supporter of the policy of protection, but only because I prefer to be robbed by the local rather than by the overseas manufacturer. If I support a protectionist in respect of secondary industries, I must also support the protection of primary industries. I commend the bill to honourable members, and hope that it will pass. I take particular pleasure in commending the Government for having endorsed the principle that no grower shall be eligible for the bounty unless lie is a member of a co-operative organization.",54

The Labour party has always been insistent upon that course being adopted. It is totally opposed to bounty payments being made to intermediaries of any description. . The corresponding provision - of certain other bounty bills has not been satisfactory in this regard, for we know that at times agents have arranged for bounty payments to be made to them to meet certain alleged contingencies which they have asserted have arisen in connection with the growers' .business relations, or even in connection with liens on properties. The Labour party does not believe that any bounty payments should be made except to the growers of the fruit. It is not our responsibility to provide money from the Consolidated Revenue merely to improve the financial position of agents and intermediaries. Our purpose should be to assist the grower of the fruit, and we should ensure that any payments made under this or any other bounty measure are actually used for that purpose. Sub-clause 2 of the clause readsWhere the grower of the citrus fruits exports the citrus fruits through an agent the bounty may be paid to the agent who shall be liable to pay the amount thereof as a debt due from him to the grower. 1 do not, know why that roundabout method should be-adopted to express the intention of the Government - ""Why should the agent be mentioned?

194,Mr FORDE,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Capricornia) [6.3] - I take this opportunity to raise a question in connection with the administration of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I have asked questions in the last fortnight or so about the refusal of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to broadcast the address of the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, Dr Wand, from St. Barnabas' Church, Ithaca, at 7 o'clock in the morning, and the replies that I have received are not satisfactory. It is no wonder that the public objects to commissions and boards created by Parliament which become autocratic and egotistical in the extreme and develop an exaggerated opinion of their own importance and a disregard for the general public. The position into which the Australian Broadcasting Commission is drifting is one that calls for investigation and reorganization of the commission itself and of its activities. I was amazed recently to read in the press of the Australian Broadcasting Commission's refusal to provide facilities for Archbishop Wand, of Brisbane, to broadcast from St. Barnabas' Church, Ithaca, on the occasion of the church's jubilee. The press paragraph sets out the reason as one of cost. The Prime Minister, in reply to a question, said the General Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission had advised that the granting of the request would entail a special opening of the station at 7 o'clock on Sunday morning, whereas the normal broadcasting hours were from 6.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. on week days, and from 8 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. on Sundays, and that the commission considered that the present hour of opening on Sundays, viz. 8 a.m., was a reasonable one. I am not satisfied with that reply. Archbishop Wand and the church authorities in Brisbane in particular and in Queensland generally are also dissatisfied. It was pointed out that the refusal was in accordance with an agreement with the Postmaster-General's Department not to broadcast church services except at 11 a.m. and 7.30 p.m. This, in my opinion, is absurd, for three reasons: 1. On occasions, several times a year, St. Barnabas' Church services have been broadcast at 7 a.m., such as on Palm Sunday, for the discommission tribution of palms and the first overrides communions, the servioe being followed by a breakfast at which the address is given by some notable person. 2. Many people prefer their religious exercises early in the morning. The o'clock service is distinctly weak in many churches. Mr Forde. 3. Cost of overtime is alleged, but what is that compared with the high feessome say hundreds of pounds-pai d to certain individuals for half an hour's performance. It also must beborne in mind that the Australian Broadcasting Commission makes good profits, in view of which the extra cost would have been trifling. 4. Recently the test match results were broadcast until 4 o'clock in the morning for several days, and I presume the forthcoming matches will also be broadcast. I do not say one word against the broadcasting of' the test matches. They are justified. In the opinion of all fair minded people, however, the needs of religion deserve au equally sympathetic consideration. I would also add to the refusal of the that broadcast by Archbishop Wand last Sunday week, the refusal to broadcast the Premier of Queensland last August at S a.m. from St. Barnabas' Church, when he gave an address to the communicants. Mr Eorgan Smith's address was distinctly non-party and if it had been allowed to be broadcast from the national station his hearers would have derived benefit from it. When the commission refused to broadcast the address one of the commercial stations filled the gap. The Australian Broadcasting Commission has also refused to broadcast the Anglican Annual Communion Breakfast of that church, at which Mr E. A. Cooper, the State Treasurer of Queensland, is to give the address. Although that address will be non-political the commission refuses to broadcast either the service or the address at the breakfast. The lesson from all this is that Parliament has delegated its powers to a commission from whose decision there apparently is no appeal. This is surely a negation of democracy. The power of the savours of dictatorship which democracy, and if I were the head of a government it would not be tolerated ' for five minutes. Ministers when approached individually say that they are in sympathy with those who protest against the unreasonable attitude 11 adopted by the commission, but when they are asked to do something they say that they cannot intervene. I wish, to emphasize that the Golden Jubilee of the St. Barnabas' Church in Queensland was regarded as of sufficient importance that the press gave much space to it before and after the event, ancl yet the Australian Broadcasting Commission would not broadcast at that function the speech of a very eminent Anglican Archbishop, who has shown on more than one occasion that he is a broad, tolerant man with very high Australian ideals. I ask the Minister to bring my complaint before the Cabinet meeting on Monday with a view to having the policy of the Australian Broadcasting Commission reviewed and to have permission granted for the broadcast of the services ancl addresses at the annual communal breakfast at St. Barnabas' Church in the near future at which the Treasurer of Queensland is to deliver a non-political address.",56
195,Mr HOLLOWAY,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Melbourne Ports). - The Minister representing the Post to try to get for me a report on the extraordinary censorship by the Australian Broadcasting Commission of Judge Foster's proposed lecture on encroachments upon personal liberty in Australia. Judge Foster accepted an invitation by the commission to speak from an "" A "" class station on the subject of personal liberty, but, when some members of the commission objected to certain parts of his address, and it was censored, he decided not to speak. Judge Foster, whose proposed address I have read, carefully avoided any interference with or any statement that might be construed as hurting the religious susceptibilities of any section of the community. The people of Victoria, who, possibly, know Judge Foster better than do people in other parts of the country, although he is well known throughout the Commonwealth, were'so disgusted at the attitude of the commission that I , along with other honourable members, was asked to raise the matter on the floor of the House. Ministers may be surprised to know that honourable members do not like bringing matters before Parliament; they would rather settle them privately with the Ministers, because that is a better way of having things done. The Minister repre[104] senting the Postmaster-General, however, is in a difficult position, because, when the Parliament is in recess, there is no need for him to represent the Postmaster General, and he does not do so. I do not blame the Minister in this matter. The people of Victoria demand a final answer from the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and I - should be pleased if the Minister would approach the commission with a view to obtaining a report for submission to Parliament. I cannot understand the attitude of the commission because the Australian people, as a whole, possess a broad outlook on questions of religion. In the lecture which he submitted to the commission, Judge Foster referred to some figures of the past, and I am led to believe that some of the members of the commission thought that he should not be allowed to do so. The great body of public opinion in Victoria, and I think in the rest of Australia, is that there was nothing in Judge Foster's lecture that warranted the drastic blue pencilling which it received from the commission', and which led to the cancellation of the address. The bigoted attitude which the commission adopted in this matter is itself an encroachment upon the liberty of the people.",58
196,Unknown,SUPPLEMENTARY,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 7.30 p.m.,58
197,Mr EIORDAN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Kennedy) [7.30] - I rise to discuss a matter regarding which I have been in correspondence with the Treasurer (Mr Casey) for some time. It was also the subject of a recent interview between us. It concerns certain grants made available by the Commonwealth Government to the various State governments for the purpose of encouraging metalliferous mining, largely for the purpose of providing work for the unemployed. In December, 1934, at the invitation of the 'Commonwealth Government, Ministers for Mines in the various State governments were called into conference at Melbourne to discuss this matter, and at that conference the 'Commonwealth Government agreed-to make assistance available. It was actually decided to make the grant available for only one year, but it was subsequently agreed that payments should be continued for a period of three years. It was expected that the scheme would be put into operation immediately, but delays occurred, and it was not until February, 1935, that the first money was made available. By July, 1935, the scheme was fairly launched. Queensland submitted a definite proposition, and because it presented a good case, it succeeded in obtaining the largest share of the grant. In 1935-36, the first year in which the scheme was in operation, the Commonwealth Government contributed £70,000. This sum, together with the £10,000 made available by the State Government, was expended during the fifteen months which followed the inauguration of the scheme, and the result was a marked revival of metalliferous mining in the back country of Cairns, Chillagoe and Charters Towers. At the request of the Commonwealth Government, in 1935, representatives of various States again attended a conference for the purpose of reviewing the progress of the scheme, and at that conference strong representations were made to the Minister in Charge of Development for the continuance of the Commonwealth grant for at least three years, as originally intended. The Commonwealth subsequently advised the States that it had approved of the continuance of assistance, but on a reduced scale. In the succeeding financial years, 1936-37 and 1937-38, Queensland received from the Commonwealth Government £35,600 and £24,900 respectively. Queensland has always observed strictly the requirements laid down by the Commonwealth Government for the expenditure of the grant, which was made available to the States solely for the purpose of bringing about a revival in metalliferous mining'and a consequent decrease of unemployment. If the Queensland Government has desired to give assistance in any particular direction^ it has always asked the Commonwealth Government to state whether or not such assistance would be within the terms of the grant. The conditions laid down by the conference have also been observed. importance of such a scheme, having as its object the rejuvenation of a valuable industry, such as metalliferous mining, can be readily appreciated. Many years ago, thousands of miners were engaged in all forms of metalliferous mining, particularly in the back country around Chillagoe. This particular portion of Queensland has in latter years, however, Mr jBiortion. become more or less deserted. The 'Commonwealth grant has assisted men to recommence prospecting in these areas which, from the point of view of metalliferous mining, are as rich as any in the world. To-day, the town of Chartors - Towers is languishing, yet towards the end of the last century it was a prosperous mining centre .of considerable importance. It still has a population of approximately 10,000, however, and in recent years the number of unemployed has reached 700. As the result of the Commonwealth Government's assistance to the mining industry, many of these unfortunate people have been able to undertake gold prospecting activities again. Some of them have been very successful. It is not necessary for me to mention their, names, but, if required, details can be obtained from the government authorities. In the interests of these people, I appeal to the Treasurer for a continuance of Commonwealth assistance to the metalliferous mining industry in Queensland. Should the scheme be abandoned, a severe blow will be dealt at out-back communities, particularly in Charters Towers. Not onJy are the miners' organizations vitally interested in the continuation of this grant, but grave concern is being evinced by shire councils and chambers of commerce. These bodies have requested me to do what I can to urge the Treasurer to extend the Commonwealth assistance for at least two years, even though it be on a sliding scale. It is feared that mining activities will be seriously restricted should the grant cease. The Queensland Government at present holds a substantial unexpended balance in a trust account. That surplus is there chiefly because it was learned some months ago that the Commonwealth Government intended to withdraw its assistance as from midnight to-night, The and expenditure was consequently restricted. The sum at present held in trust, however, would last for no more than three months. I again appeal to the Treasurer to give serious consideration to the urgent requests for the continuation of a grant that means much to a portion of Australia which, in the past, has been, neglected and has not received Ae treatment to which it has been entitled. Should the grant be continued, even on a sliding scale, it would do much to give many out-back localities some semblance of population. In the past the State Government has made money available to prospectors who applied for ""prospectors' assistance"" namely, £2 a week for married men and £1 a week for single men. Assistance was also granted in other directions. In these northern areas, there are mines that have been neglected for many years ancl have, consequently, become filled with water. Assistance was given by the State Government for the purchase of the necessary machinery to pump the water from the mines, but as soon as mining was resumed the money borrowed had to be repaid. It is largely as the result of these repayments that the trust fund account has been built up. It has been possible for the State Governshould ment, with the assistance of the mining grant, to undertake metallurgical investigations which have proved of great value to the mining industry in the north. Assay officers have been established throughout the mining districts and many metallurgists have been employed in assaying the numerous samples, submitted by prospectors. If the grant is withdrawn many of these men will be thrown out of employment. The Queensland Government is doing, and will continue to do, everything possible to keep men in employment, and the provision of this grant has enabled it to assist thousands of miners in the sparsely populated areas of northern Queensland. Many thousands of pounds were made available out of the grant from the development of the Portland Roads mine, one of the finest mines in northern Queensland. By the provision of those funds it was possible to construct a jetty and also a road from Portland Roads across the Iron Range to the ' Batavia gold-fields. These iron mines are reputed to be 67 per cent, propositions, ancl their developmentwill benefit the areas in which they are situated. I have given these particulars as to how the grant has been spent, not because I think the Queensland Government may be accused of having squandered it-to use a colloquial expression, "" It is pretty tight withits hand-out,"" because it realizes the value of the grant when utilized in association with a policy directed towards securing the greatest benefit from every pound spent. This grant has enabled 'the'mining industry in northern Queensland to be lifted out of the doldrums. I shudder to think what will happen in the mining districts of the north if it be discontinued. I therefore appeal to the Treasurer to continue it for at least two years, even if on a diminishing scale. We all know that from a defence viewpoint the settlement of the empty spaces of the north is very desirable; the mining grant has enabled the Queensland Government to keep a large number of men employed in profitable occupation in outback districts. The Commonwealth Government, in association with the Governments of Queensland and Western Australia, is conducting a geophysical survey of the northern portions of Australia, which"" be of great assistance to the mining industry of Queensland and give impetus to the work of prospectors. The Treasurer is well aware of the need for the continuance of the grant because of the large amount of correspondence which has been addressed to him in regard to it. The Government recently announced - that it has entered into an agreement with the British Government to finance a migration scheme for the settlement of migrants in this country, on a fifty-fifty basis, but at the same time it proposes to withdraw this measure of assistance to the Queensland Government which has utilized it for the purpose of keeping in employment good Australians of the best type in the outlying districts of the north. As the result of assistance granted to prospectors in the Charters Towers district, a new field was recently discovered which shows signs of profitable development. It is to assist those prospectors, who are prepared to leave the civilized centres on our eastern coasts and go into the outback in search of gold and other metals, that I make this plea to the Treasurer to-night. It has been said that this grant is to be discontinued because the money is needed for defence purposes. In my opinion, this grant might well be continued in the cause of defence, because it will help to keep in outback areas men of the hardy pioneering type who would be our best defenders in case of need.

198,Mr FROST,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Franklin) [7.57] - 1 avail myself of this opportunity to bring before the House a very serious complaint in connection with the issuing of licences to B class broadcasting stations in Tasmania. A little over two years ago, a gentleman came to my place and informed me that he had made application for the issue of a B class broadcasting licence at Hobart. I communicated with the Postmaster-General, and received a reply to the effect that, as several other applications had already been received for the issue of B class licences, no further applications could be considered. Since then, however, several B class licences have been granted. A few weeks ago, I asked the Minister representing the  whole of the correspondence in connection with these applications would be laid on the table of the Library. My request was refused, for what reason I do not know. Why should this "" hush-hush "" policy be adopted with regard to this matter? I also applied for a B class licence on behalf of the Trades Hall, Hobart; that application was also refused. The Premier of Hobart and the Minister for Agriculture, both reputable men, have made applications for B class licences, but have met with no better success. The newspapers and prominent business people in Tasmania have a virtual monopoly of commercial broadcasting in that State, with the result that Labour men are unable to place their views before the public through the medium of broadcasting. In this respect, Tasmanians have been more badly treated than the people of any other State. I have been unable to ascertain why the Postmaster-General refused to table the correspondence in connection with the issue of these licences. I doubt very much now whether any applications preceded that sponsored by me two years ago. One is forced to ask what influence is brought to bear in connection with the issuing of these licences. It is time a public inquiry was instituted into this matter to ascertain why it is that a monopoly is granted to a few people to control commercial broadcasting in Tasmania. I support the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) in regard to the need for the continuance of the mining grant to assist in the development of the northern parts of Queensland. In my opinion, die Government would do well to reconsider its decision in this respect. On the south-west coast of Tasmania there are many miles of very rough country which has never been prospected. Recently tin has been discovered there, and the country also carries osmiridium, gold, and other minerals.",61

206,Mr FROST,SUPPLEMENTARY,"I appeal to the Government to assist in the development of the forests of Tasmania. That State has vast areas which cannot be put to any other use, but yet are superior to all other parts of the world for the growing of forests. Two large firms have begun the manufacture of paper, one in the north, and one in the south. In order to maintain supplies for that industry, the forests of the State will have to be preserved. The practice has been to allow selectors to hew out 200 acres and perhaps destroy 88,000 acres of forest country in the process. The State Government has not the necessary funds to devote to the preservation of these forests.. Recently all the State governments received a pittance from the Commonwealth Government for this purpose, and it has been of considerable benefit. Timber supplies are becoming short throughout the world. Countries which formerly permitted the denudation of their forest areas have now altered theii policy on account of soil erosion. We must learn the lesson taught by those the Treasurer^- countries, especially the United States of America, where there are now millions of acres which will never again be of value because of the destruction of forests. present.

The time surely has arrived for the Government to give consideration to the removal of those provisions of the Premiers plan which affect the dependants of deceased returned soldiers. I have brought this matter to the notice of the Treasurer (Mr Casey) previously. When framing the budget for the forthcoming financial year, these last emergency cuts should be removed.",62
223,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLEMENTARY,Order ! The honourable member is not discussing the bill.,63
224,Mr MAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"I thank you for your indulgence, sir. I shall now deal with a matter which is embodied in the provisions of this bill."" The time surely has arrived for' an improvement of the services provided by the PostmasterGcneral's Department, particularly in new rising communities. In my district, there are two localities which have become substantial residential areas and yet are not afforded the requisite postal facilities. I feel that new localities are being definitely penalized by being deprived of services that they have a right to expect. During the financial depression, the expenditure of the Postmaster-General's Department on new works and services was reduced almost . to extinction, and I regret that the rate of expenditure is still far below normal. The result is that 1 many growing districts are being deprived of services, particularly letter deliveries, that should be provided. I refer, for example, to the localities known as Kilburn and Seat-on Park.",63
225,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLEMENTARY,The honourable ber may not discuss those details under this bill.,63
226,Mr MAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"I contend, sir, the bill provides for certain expenditure in works and services by the Postmaster General's Department, my remarks arc in order. Mr SPEAKER,-The honourable memsons ber may discuss any item contained the schedule.to the 'bill; but he is seeking to tell the Treasurer how money ought to be spent. The honourable gentleman is confusing this measure with a Supply bill.",63
227,Mr MAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"I am anxious to Conform to your ruling, sir. I , therefore, simply ask the Treasurer to bring my remarks under the notice of the Postmaster-General with the object of urging him to grant the increased services that I am requesting.",63
228,Mr BARNARD,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Bass) [8.17] - The House is entitled to more information regarding the expenditure provided for in the schedule to this bill than the Treasurer has so far seen fit to furnish. I ask for additional particulars in relation of Division 36 under the Department of the Interior. The lines are£ £ Haul .. 18,857 in lieu of . . .. 0,800 9,057 We are well aware that in consequence of the manner in which the General Estimates are frequently dealt with in this Parliament, works are often put in hand although Parliament has been given no detailed inform a tion in connection therewith. Instances of this kind were brought under notice recently when the Loan Bill was being considered. On page 27 of the bill, a supplementary ' expenditure of £250 is provided under the description, "" Honoraria to Members of Commonwealth Book Censorship Board"". This prompts mo to ask the Treasurer to make a statement respecting the results of the Government's efforts to prohibit the importation of obscene literature. Have the States co-operated with the Commonwealth in this connection? I congratulate the Government on its initiative in prohibiting the circulation of objectionable publications which have been imported freely into Australia memduring the past, few years. Mr GANDEH,-The Acting Minister for  that as this move on his own account.",63
229,Mr BARNARD,SUPPLEMENTARY,"If that is so, I give him a double meed of praise. I have no desire to protest against the payment of adequate out-of-poeket expenses to perwho perform useful services for the in Government, but I should like to know exactly how this amount of £250 was expended, seeing that, it is apparently supplementary to anamount provided under the same heading in the General Estimates. An amount of £142 is provided under the heading, ""District Laboratory"" in the proposed vote for the Department of Health. As this expenditure has apparently been incurred in Tasmania and probably at a place not far distant from my home in Launceston, I ask Treasurer to give an explanation of it. My reason for making these inquiries is that I believe the time has come for honourable members of this House to the Postmaster-General's scrutinize much more carefully the expenIf diture of the money voted to the Treafactory surer in a lump sum. Under a recent measure, £2,000,000 was provided for the Treasurer to expend according to his discretion. My experience as a member of this Parliament is causing me to feel that such expenditure should be examined most carefully to ensure that the public funds ai;e devoted wholly to legitimate purposes. The practice of the Governis ment in forcing Parliament to remain in recess for long periods and then to call upon members to work under a very months ago. heavy strain to the point of fatigue does not lend itself to a careful examination of the various measures submitted to us.",63
230,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLEMENTARY,"The honourable memare ""ber is not now discussing the bill.",64
231,Mr BARNARD,SUPPLEMENTARY,"I have merely made those remarks in passing, Sir. I seriously request the Treasurer to furnish me with them. detailed information in connection the items to which I have specifically referred. Under "" Miscellaneous Services "", trolled by the Prime Minister's Department, an amount of £409 is allocated the Commonwealth Grants Commission. This, I take it, entitles me to direct the attention of the Government to the manner in which certain recommendations of the Grants Commission in relation to Tasmania have been dis-. regarded. I do not criticize the commisment sion itself on this account, but I ask Treasurer to explain the Government's attitude in connection with the matter. The item on page 38 of the bill, "" Secondary Industries Research-Moto Car and Aeroplane Engines, £1,000"" also calls for some explanation. I should behaviour. like some explanation of the appropriation of £100,000 for research by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research into the manufacture of motor car and aeroplane engines. I should also like some explanation of the item "" Conif tributions towards cost of maintenance the House. by State of reception and farm training depots, £16,926 "".. That is an unusually large item for a supplementary approthe priation bill. Has the money already been spent or is it to be spent? I ask the Treasurer also to explain section A of Division 130, "" Central office "", under Department. the Minister is able to give a satisexplanation as to why all these unusually large items are appropriated in a supplementary bill I shall be relieved. [Quorum formed.""]",64

233,Mr CASEY,SUPPLEMENTARY,This is merely an appropriation of money that was spent eighteen,64
234,Mr SHEEHAN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"The amount is altogether inadequate. It could be spent in the Cook electorate in one day. There thousands of unemployed in that electorate, and at Happy Valley people are being evicted from their homes. The Government should do something for It should appropriate a much with bigger amount of money than £642. The time has arrived when the Government should give consideration to the constandardization of the railway gauges.",64

236,Mr SHEEHAN,SUPPLEMENTARY,"The provision of an automatic telephone exchange at Mascot has been a bone of contention for many years. Apparently, the Governhas at last decided to convert the the manual telephone exchange at Mascot to the automatic system.",64

The remarks of the honourable gentleman showed clearly that he was not aware of the nature of the document with which the House is dealing. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) spoke of . the metalliferous mining grant. This matter has been considered by the Government on many occasions. The grant was made, at the nadir of the depression in order to enable the States to help miners. A decision' having been reached, the Government cannot reconsider this matter. The grant must end on the 30th June this year; I shall bring under the notice of the Postmaster-iGeneral (Senator A. J. MCLachlan) the representations of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) regarding the Postal Department. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Barnard) spoke of an under-estimate by the Minister for the Interior (Mr MCEwen), but a3 the honourable member has not remained in the chamber to hear the explanations for which he asked, I can only repeat the sum that these are Supplementary Estimates, not the Estimates proper. They are merely the amounts by which the ordinary Estimates have been over-expended. The payment has been taken out of the Treasurer's Advance.

251,Mr LYONS,LEAVE OE ABSENCE TO ALL,"Wilmot-Prime Minister) [9.14] - I move That the House do now adjourn. I intimate to honourable members who have asked questions, or who may still have questions on the notice-paper, that replies will be sent to them as soon as Adjournment. they are prepared.' The remaining business on the notice-paper is not of such an urgent character that it cannot wait . Speaker, until the House meets again.",67
252,Mr BEASLEY,LEAVE OE ABSENCE TO ALL,"West Sydney) [9.15]. some matters which I consider of importance. I would not do so at this stage of the proceedings if another opportunity 23 had been presented, because I have no 10 wish to detain honourable members. The first matter relates to the failure of the 13 Customs Department to deal adequately with the methods employed by a cotton AYES. combine., known as Coates Limited, in its endeavours to force an Australian firm of manufacturers' agents, indentors and warehousemen out of business. It is interesting to follow the methods employed by the Coates combine to achieve its purpose. The Australian firm commenced trading in March, 1937, but the unscrupulous methods adopted by the combine to create a monopoly by selling certain lines below landed cost will evenNOES. tually destroy its business. No one will deny the right of this firm to conduct a business in Australia such as that conducted by the Coates combine in other parts of the world, but no outside firm or combine should be permitted to use its influence and its wealth to crush a competitor. Three different brands of cotton manufactured by the combine,, known as ""Hercules"", ""New Century"", ancl ""Martlet "" were landed in Australia. Samples of all three were tested by the customs authorities in tlieir Sydney laboratory, and the "" Martlet"" sample was found to be a better quality cotton than either of the other two brands. It is obvious that the combine set out to market, not an inferior grade of cotton, but an equally substantial cotton as its major line at a lower price, in its efforts to squeeze out its competitors. In a letter dated the 16th May, asking the Customs ROOMS- Department what had been done in regard to the matter, the Australian firm was informed that it had been referred to Canberra, and that appropriate action had been taken. Further inquiries revealed that it had been referred to Australia House, London, with instructions that the Coates combine should be interviewed in London with a view to having production costs produced. This matter, to some extent, touches upon, the right of the department to examine costs of production in regard to articles imported into Australia. I understand that the required information was withheld hy the combine. This indicates how the Ottawa Agreement operates in regard to these matters, when the Australian manufacturer is compelled to produce his costs of production, while his competitor, a wealthy overseas combine, is permitted to refuse to supply that information. The Collector of Customs then used his right under the act to assess a legitimate value on all importations of ""Martlet "" sewing cotton, and I am informed that duty is being levied on a price which is equivalent to the home price of "" Hercules"" cotton. Whether the manufacturers have increased the invoiced price of ""Martlet "" or not, I am not in a position to say, but the fact is that the combine has not made any change in its selling prices, and it still continues to sell goods to the customers of the Australian firm at prices below landed cost. It has recently been stated that the same article is now being imported in colours as well as in black and white, and is sold at a ridiculous price. If this information is correct, it will be hopeless for the Australian firm to attempt to carry on. The Australian firm asked that this matter be ventilated in the appropriate quarter with a view to having action taken to prevent this worldwide combine from using methods in Australia, which have been effective in other countries to crush all competitors. It is not right that an Australian firm should be treated in this way, nor is it right the power, wealth an'd influence of any combine should be permitted to override the powers of the Customs Department. It is the duty of this Parliament to take steps to see that no combine is permitted to continue these practices. - Yesterday, I asked the Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) a question concerning instructions issued to departmental heads in the capital cities. It has been reported- I know that it has actually occurred-that certain selected members of staffs have been asked whether, in the event of war in which Australia is involved, they would be willing to offer themselves for defence work either at home or abroad. I asked further what steps had been taken by the Government to protect employees who felt that in answering unfavorably they might be subjected directly or indirectly to victimization. The reply I received read- From the information given by the honourable member, it is not possible to give a direct reply, but if he will furnish further details inquiries will be made. Speaking generally, those specific instructions of the nature referred to have been issued by the department. District base commandants have certain responsibilities for the preparation of plans for an emergency which involves consideration of staffing requirements. My question had no relation whatever to base commandants, but applied to the heads of Commonwealth departments. I clo not know whether this action has been taken in Canberra, but I know that questions have been asked in Sydney. I should like to know who issued instructions to heads of Commonwealth departments to arrange interviews with selected members of the staffs, and if the Government did not issue these instructions, am I to understand from the reply given that the base commandants have power to do so without the knowledge of the Government? I cannot believe that that is the case, but if it is we are entitled to know whether departmental heads or members of the military forces have such authority. If no such authority has been issued, the members' of the public service concerned will appreciate an expression of opinion on the subject. They are entitled to know who issued the instructions, and if the that answer to my question is correct and not evasive, I take it that no such instructions have been issued by the Government and that heads of departments have no authority to clo what has been done.",67
253,Mr GANDER,LEAVE OE ABSENCE TO ALL,It may have been done by some of Eric Campbell's mob.,68
254,Mr BEASLEY,LEAVE OE ABSENCE TO ALL,"The heads of certain departments may be endeavouring to set up organizations or ascertain from members of their staffs whether they .would be willing to do certain things, not only in regard to war, but perhaps in connection with civil matters. Another matter which I should like the Government to consider is the advisability of extending superannuation benefits to those officers who are performing very valuable work in the Federal Members' rooms in the capital cities.",68
255,Mr MAKIN,LEAVE OE ABSENCE TO ALL,I suppose that the able member includes typists?,69
256,Mr BEASLEY,LEAVE OE ABSENCE TO ALL,"Yes . During the last Parliament, a measure was passed in which provision was made for the members of the High Commissioner's staff in London, the officers of the Repatriation Department and those in several other departments to receive superannuation benefits. At that time honourable members expressed the opinion that no section of the public service sliould receive special treatment in this respect and that superannuation benefits should be available to all Government servants. officers who come in close contact with Ministers are fortunate enough to get their ear and have the Superannuation Act applied to them, other officers should have a similar privilege. trust that during this recess the Government will look into this matter to see if it is not practicable to extend superannuation benefits to the officers employed in the Federal Members' rooms in the various States. Many of us are prone to forget the very valuable services which these officers render. They undertake foi us work of a personal nature, and in many respects carry out responsibilities the value of which it is difficult to assess. They attend to our correspondence when we are indisposed or engaged on other public duties. They have been of great assistance to ' honourable members who have visited other parts of the world. Generally speaking, their work is important, and particularly do we appreciate the tact which they display in answering our correspondence.",69
257,Mr SPEAKER,LEAVE OE ABSENCE TO ALL,"The honourable member has exhausted his time.  Minister for Customs) [9.28] - The honourable member for ""West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) has brought under the notice of the Government certain matters connected with my department. I do not know anything of the subject referred to by the honourable member, but I shall have f u ll inquiries made and advise him of the result. The Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) wishes me to state that he has already answered in part the question raised by the honourable member, but that further inquiries are proceeding,' the result of which will be conveyed to the honorhonorable member.
