This bill actually does bear in mind that we stand here in the middle of 2006 disfocused very heavily on airport security matters on 11 Sepand we are now dealing with this matter. The government when you consider the public spin this government likes to to terrorism. The government has been keen to legislate, measures that make a difference. Accordingly, I move: with a view to substituting the following words: the House condemns the Howard Government for its failure to proprotect Australians, including its: Identification Card (ASIC) system; security at regional airports; and security measures for charter flights”. that Labor has with respect to aviation security and the measures. But they are amongst the most significant, and I and the industry, put in place a new aviation security idenrequirement to improve security at our airports. This syssomething in the order of 10,000 ASICs have been issued. in circulation for only a couple of years, we know that for. We know that 384 have been lost or unaccounted for, at the end of last year to a Senate inquiry. of ASICs can be lost in the space of a couple of years in security matters. It does make you wonder about this that was being suggested a few months ago. If this govsystem in the aviation industry, you are only left to trying to administer the 16 million ID cards that the government now says that we are not going to have and others are pursuing some alternative, supposedly to confined area of airport security, hundreds of security We know where two of them are, because two individuals and I think are currently before the courts.

Baggage is still not being X-rayed as the government some years ago that by 31 December 2004 all checked baggage be X-rayed. Certainly a couple of months ago that was not case. A couple of months ago Australia's largest airport, baggage on international flights. That is more than a would have that system in place.

If you cannot international airport, what signal does that send to the you see the speculation surrounding people such as Schapelle being properly handled or whether it could be interfered lawyers and supporters. I do not want to get into the another debate-but the fact that a large number of Australians defence indicates that the Australian public think it is flights can be interfered with. The fact is that we know for interfering with baggage, and there was a drug We even had the bizarre situation of a fellow who worked pieces of luggage and parading around the airport. We but there is a very serious side to that story. If somebody as easily put drugs in, put a bomb in or do anything with system. Leaving aside the question of responding to terrorism, client relationship. But when we are talking about questions belief that we could see that sort of malaise in As we stand here today, my best advice is that we are of Sydney on international flights. They X-ray some of pretends that the swabbing is a substitute for X-ray. If do not. The standard is to X-ray 100 per cent, and it shortly, which is to X-ray 100 per cent of domestic checked can manage that better than they manage the international exemption from that. Sydney Airports Corporation, members in this parliament and former head of the Prime So the Department of Transport and Regional Services to meet the standard which the government itself set and pens to be an issue of speculation-more in the industry enabled the corporation that Max Moore-Wilton heads other people in the industry who have cast a cynical allow Sydney airport to operate a less secure screening low. The sooner Sydney gets its act together and does most, if not all, other international airports do-the better cards without authority. So we know the whereabouts of not know the whereabouts of the other few hundred misThe entire aviation security system at airports relies upon areas of an airport. To think that in the space of a couple hundred lost or unaccounted for is mind-boggling. What this government is responsible for when that is the outto say I have little confidence in this government's manmore concerned with getting the political spin right, with getting the security on the ground in place. We see a situaASICs has been completely maladministered by the Howard said it would be. The government made an announcement on international flights departing Australia would the case and, as far as I am aware, that is still not the Sydney airport, was not X-raying 100 per cent of checked year after the deadline by which this government said it happened in the last couple of months but this week I is now X-raying 100 per cent of its checked internathey are not.

By the middle of 2006, on implement those basic security arrangements in our largest rest of the world? Of course, it is one of the reasons why Corby. The debate as to whether or not baggage was with was raised in the defence of Schapelle Corby by her argument about Schapelle Corby's case-that is a matter for were quite happy to believe Schapelle Corby's quite possible, if not probable, that their baggage on these some of it has been. We know people have been arrested ring operating at Sydney international airport. at the airport taking a camel suit out of one of the can all have a bit of a chuckle about someone doing that, can interfere with the baggage in that way, they can just the luggage-put it in or take it out. That is not a secure that is not an acceptable standard for any customerof security, particularly post 11 September, it beggars the day-today operation of security on the ground. still not X-raying 100 per cent of the baggage going out it, and the bits they do not X-ray they swab-and no-one it were, that is what we would be setting as the standard. We is not happening. We are about to reach another deadline baggage. We will see whether or not the government cargo. Sydney airport managed to get itself a special headed up by Max Moore-Wilton-a person well known to Minister's department-managed to get an exemption. allows Sydney airport to continue an operation that fails the deadline of 2004 for that standard to be met. It hapthan in politics-as to how that conversation went that up to get that special exemption, but there are plenty of eye over the arrangements that have seen this government process than other airports in Australia are obliged to folX-ray 100 per cent of international baggage-as I believe it will be for the entire Australian travelling public. NA There is also a problem with cargo on those flights senger aircraft. The Wheeler report It is recommended that the Australian Government require screening of all cargo on passenger aircraft Very shortly, Australian regulations will require all checked baggage X-rayed. So the simple answer here is: baggage in, we should also be ensuring that the cargo on rayed as well. I am not sure whether that recommendation ested in advice from the minister in reply to this debate understanding is that it is not followed in all airports, Wheeler that deserves consideration. There is a separate matter, of course, which is air representations from people who work in the industry. was a matter that we included in our submission to Wheeler lia and I discussed it with him.

A lot of focus has been put on the operation significant charter flight industry. Typically, charter flights can be on the opposite side of the airfield or quite some exist for major airline passenger travel, and an People who have focused on situations like September on, I think wrongly focus on the hijacking of large aircraft. aircraft. I think the Australian aviation industry can large aircraft are as secure as they reasonably can be very big aircraft to have an impact in an incident I think also the other half of the equation-that is, if a plane missile, the impact can be determined just as easily by plane. There are a number of targets you could identify trophic incident should a small aircraft be I think we pay too little attention to the charter industry a sense, with questions associated with terrorism, we is planning to fight the last war. We run the risk of planning templating what the next terrorist attack might be. After large aircraft secure and to make major airport terminals in that direction. But it is folly to pretend that, having We do confront the threat of terrorist activity. We aviation industry, a couple of areas where we simply have cargo sectors of the industry. This bill does not address the provisions in the bill that are practical. I hope the matters should be the subject of review and report to parliament, procedures for major events. A sound enough position is that include checked baggage. This is cargo carried on pasmade comment about that. Wheeler said: that the screening of cargo be expanded and include mandatory where passengers' checked baggage is screened. domestic and all international flights in Australia to have wherever there are passengers on planes who can check those flights is subject to the same scrutiny-that it is Xhas been adopted across all airports. I would be interconfirming what the situation is with that. Certainly my but I think it is nonetheless a sensible recommendation from cargo on cargo flights.

From a series of revelations from those that have occurred before then, we know that control over what happens on the other side of the fenceand in this House, that this government needs to look clearances that are being given.

We now have a scaled reaction in terms of security, has been outsourced because we do not have an Australian ernment. The American government takes responsibility government employees to be responsible for aviation security-not be directly responsible to the elected representative report to the President and his cabinet. What does the government here do? Not only does it force under a single commander so that one particular gard for the whole situation; it also allows the situation say, ‘Yes, we will provide security on this airport,' and ries of companies, which can then employ people on a temporary has been absolutely useless. No-one has really vetted those that is a fundamental area where We know from the first indications that baggage handlers fied as having previous terrorist connections. We know ously than it has been.

So I would suggest to the minister that he looks seriously normal response-that is, saying: maybe we should have and also coordinate with Customs to ensure that we actually volved there for decades. We need to break up the groups ports and therefore take more effective measures at stopping airports. So it is not just a question of saying, ‘In two-armed or three-armed bandits stole gold and did all whoever was responsible for that at the time was completely 2001.

I believe that the special events security show particular merit. There is a proposed aviation conference and exhibition more than 5,000 visitors each year by 2009 to 2011.

I do not see that the event in Wagga Wagga attracting achieve its target of 5,000 visitors. That would have fits. If we have this event in Forest Hill at the airport, tourism in regional areas, and it is my view that this Wagga Wagga to continue to plan and to have it My area, the Riverina, is ideally placed as a central Temora Aviation Museum. It is an attraction to behold, visit Temora. It is something you would expect to see and yet here in Temora, with the assistance of the Temora dustry, we have seen the Temora Aviation Museum grow thing that they need to be very proud of. The entire region has good prospects for continued security zones is well adapted to those routine activities, flexible structure in order to manage these specialised ports. The bill provides for a system of event zones, which some of the usual security arrangements for the duration example, some events that we have are so strictly managed sent to wear an aviation security identity card. I go to an example of that in relation to a regional regional carrier, has a fundraiser each year. Last year with cancer. It was a sensational day.

I raise firstly an the need to improve the aviation security identification even if you do have in place a decent system of cards and ensure that people with cards are screened, you will have all a year ago, in March 2005, three allegedly inebriated men board one of our big aircraft. They spent over an hour on drinking all the wine and whatever was left there. Finally, they were apprehended and dealt with. of security, Chris Ellison, claimed, ‘It doesn't really much of an issue.' The issue is this: if those people had NA intended to do some serious damage and were on this aircraft have created enormous problems for Perth airport or for spite the minister dismissing the incident as nothing appeared in court the lawyer who was prosecuting the case magistrate should throw the book at the trio. That incident, which happened at Perth International security. In another example, a senior citizen managed was bound for Singapore.

If he had been a terrorist, airport. I would also like to talk about what happens with screening. We have some serious problems at Perth airport and often military aircraft use the airport. A lot of explosives, ment is handled through the airport. I am very concerned the tarmac and access ordinary aircraft then they could tary to carry military payloads. It is totally unacceptable can occur. For example, not so recently the military put in a request request was knocked back. But you do not need a permit operating out of Perth airport. Three thousand kilos flight carrying that cargo is directed on its flight path states or overseas. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you consider priately because someone might have boarded the aircraft done to ensure that these sorts of incidents cannot occur. protected when it is on the ground. I was very alarmed to find out that these aircraft, air base, where they were fully guarded, receiving they were considered to be commercial and not military security whatsoever. In addition, often they would stay route to the Gulf. That is a frightening concept, when tarmac with that sort of payload sitting there on the C17s, which will operate as military aircraft. But I am for loading and off-loading of those particular aircraft, port to protect that cargo. These are just some examples of the security issues these things are happening at Perth airport, I am sure that across the country. I hope that the situation is improving the government will adequately deal with the situation. I also see something in this bill about regulations to lon air show is coming up next year. As you know, Mr last year. It is a fabulous show for Australia; in fact, I would urge anyone who has the opportunity to get down some regulations there to help address that. In conclusion, I again draw all members' attention to that report. It is certainly worth reading. It highlights addressed, unfortunately we have a long way to go. On on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment Bill 2006, claimed that aviation security is a high priority for this for over an hour without being apprehended, it could any airport that did not have proper security in place.

A guy who was a bit unhe was going to have his own little protest and he rode airport.

We have now bought concerned that, if Perth airport is to be used in the future we need to ensure there will be proper security at that airat Perth airport, which I believe need to be addressed.
