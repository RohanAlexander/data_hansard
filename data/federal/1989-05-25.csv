3,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The honourable member may proceed. EmptyHere Sydney Morning Herald of today's date, 1;hursday, 25 May, there is an article headed 'Peacock backs down on wheat', written by Peter Fray' and Mike Seccombe, dateline Canberra. It says in the first paragraph: .The Federal Opposition has buckled to National Party pressure and is set to renege on an agreement given by the previous Opposition Leader, Mr Howard, to support the Government's controversial wheat legislation. This is incorrect. The course of action outlined by the previous Leader of th- Opposition on the attitude of the coalition to the wheat legislation has not and will not be changed. I understand that my office advised one, if not both, of the journalists that I have just mentioned of this, and I do not understand why this article would be written as it has been-they, or one of them at 'least, having been advised that their view was incorrect. So, I repeat: there is no change in the attitude of the coalition to the wheat legislation. NA",10

Star of the Sea Home for Aged at Walla roo, South Australia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: That the Star of the Sea Home for Aged at Walla roo South Australia, has operated very successfully with 21 Hostel Beds since 1978 and its associated Nursing Home of 10, beds since 1985. The Department of Community Services and Health has advised, that as from the 31st of December 1989 the present level of financial subsidy for the Nursing Home will be substantially reduced making it impossible for the Nursing Home to continue operating at its present numbers. As the District, in which the Nursing Home is situated, has' the highest ratio of aged persons, per head of population in South Australia, there is an ever increasing and definite need for the Nursing Home to continue providing this essential service. Your' petitioners therefore pray that the House: Will ensure that a financially viable Nursing Home, as an adjunct to - he Star of the Sea Home for Aged at Wallaroo South Australia will be maintained, by either a continuation of the present level of Funding or approval for additional beds to be allocated. by Mr Andrew (from 4,036 citizens). Romania: Human Rights The Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of 'Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: A decision has been made by the Roumanian Government to completely raze villages where there are fewer than 5,900 inhabitants. This will result in the loss of approximately 78,000 villages. This is against the wishes of these people and is a complete denial of their basic human rights. It would result ill total cultural genocide of regions and ethnic minorities which have a history dating back to the middle ages. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Parliament of Australia does all that is within its power and influence to immediately halt this cultural genocide. by Mr N. A. Brown (from 865 citizens). Brisbane Airport: Runway 14/32 To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain electors of the Division of Lilley draws to the attention of the House the fact that: If the cross wind runway at Brisbane Airport were to be used for jet aircraft, residents of Nudgee Beach, Shorncliffe, Pinkenba and Brighton would suffer noise far greater than that suffered by other residents with craft flying at altitudes of 400 feet over Nudgee Beach to 1,700 feet over the Eventide Nursing Home. i Given that the 'good neighbour' policy between residents 'of the area and the airport has been successful in .the past; Your petitioners request that' the House call' on the Prime Minister, the Minister for Transport and Communications and the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation, Support to implement promises made by the Government that Runway 14/32 will not be used for jet aircraft. by Mrs Dai'ling (from 66 citizens). Boothville Maternity Hospital, BrisbanT- the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of, certain residents of the State of Queensland draws to the attention of the House the Salvation Army's intention to close Boothville Maternity Hospital in Brisbane ,on the 30 April 1989.

Pharmaceutical Benefits To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We, the people of Berowra, wish to. draw the attention of Members to the fact that proposed cuts in funding of Pharmaceutical Benefits will severely reduce service and availability of medicines to the public. Your petitioners therefore ask the House'to reject these cuts and maintain our family chemist service. by Dr Harry Edwards (from 306 citizens). Interest Rates To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families; Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering s-verely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments' or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially. Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the House require the Hawke-Keating Government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates' as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of' their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Fife (from 42 citizC?ns). Road Funding To the J-Ionourable the Speaker and Members of The House of Represent!ltives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: Federal fuel excise taxation has reached record levels resulting in high costs for fuel and causing severe hardship particularly for people in col1ntry areas. ' At the same time there has been a considerable reduction in the amount of Federal fuel excise taxation spent on roads; reduced from 66 per cent in 1983 to 20 per cent 1989. Your Petitioners therefore pray that the House call on the Federal Government to take heed of the crisis situation facing small business, large fuel users and the crisis situation relation to road infrastructure and (I) Reduce by half the CPI Federal fuel tax increases (2) Increase by half the proportion of Federal fuel taxation being spent on roads. by Mr Tim Fischer (from 10 1 citizens). Tax File' Number To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of' Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia who draw to the attention of the House that: I. The Australian Taxation Office disregarded its privacy obligations to the citizens of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory iii February by sending an admitted 55,000 to 77,000 tax file number letters to people who were either deceased or had changed address. 2. The Australian Taxation Office disregarded its privacy obligations to the citizens of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, in March by sending an admitted 29,000 to 58,000 tax file number letters to people who were either deceased or had changed address. 3. The Australian Taxation,Office disregarded its privacy obligations by sending out a large number of tax file number letters during March in unsealed envelopes. 4. The Australian Taxation Office extended the deadline for employee declarations beyond the 31st March as defined by section 202C(4) (a) of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Act 1988 but failed to obtain a Proclamation from the Governor General for this extension as stipulated by section 202C(4)(b) of the Act. 5. The Australian Taxation Office, in its implementation of the tax file number system, has failed to abide by the provisions of both the Privacy Act 1988 and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Act 1988. Your petitioners therefore request the House to commence an investigation into the administration of the tax file number related legislation by the Taxation Office and the role of the Taxation Commission-r in the above mentioned administration. ' by Mr Tim Fischer (from four citizens). Broken Hill: Aged Care To the Honourable the Speake,r and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Broken Hill in the State of New South Wales, points out to the House and calls on the Federal Government to accept its responsibility by providing sufficient suitable Nursing Home and Hostel accommodation for those Broken Hill citizens who are frail or aged. Your petitioners therefore requests the House: (a) Negotiates with the N.S.W. State Government to maintain sufficient long-stay beds at the Broken Hill Base Hospital until. it, the Federal Government with whom - he responsibility of care for the aged lies, provides the accommodation required. (b) Also requests that increased funding be pro,vided for support services that provide care for the frail and aged in their own homes in Broken Hill. ' by Mr Hicks (from 517 citizens). Australian Federal Police To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petiti-n or certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House decreases in the number of members within the Australian Federal Police'and the problems concerned' witl'\ sufficient funding for the force which has adversely affected the operations and ignored the proven needs of the Australian Federal Police. These problems have restricted surveillance work; airport anti-terrorist functions; major anti-drug operations and initial investigations. Consequently Australian citizens are continually placed iii jeopardy by drug-traffickers, organised crime circles; corruption and major fraud. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House require the Hawke-Keating Government' to provide the necessary funds to the Australian Federal Police and increase the co-operation between State Police Forces and the Commonwealth, in order to combat crime, drug related violence and corruption, thereby creating a, safer Australian society in which to live. by Mr Jull (from seven citizens). National Museum of Australia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The following petitioners, certain citizens of' Australia, draw to the attention of the House that Australia does not have a national museuqI depicting the cultural traditions of Australia over its 40,000 year history of human occupation and, the relationship between people and the Australian environment. Your petitioners therefore respectfully request the House to support the immediate commencement of the construction of appropriate buildings and infrastr4cture to house and display the collection of the National Museum of Australia and to provide sufficient funds to enable the Museum to operate effectively. ' by MrLangmore (from 1,295 citizens). Family Court of Australia ro the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: Petition for Royal Commission into Family Courts of Australia, legal services commissions in Australia, experts providing services for the Family Court of Australia and welfare bodies working within and for the Family Court of Australia. The Petition of the undersigned shows, we are extremely concerned at the operation of the Family Court of Australia; The methods used by Family Court appointed independent representatives, (lawyers representing the children in Family Court dispute); The qualifications of people regarded as experts in this Court; The ease with which access between parents and cl'\ildren is stopped by this court; The type of evidence being accepted in this court; The fact that legal aid i- often used to support access being stopped but not provided to the other parent to defend his or her right to access; The manner in which evidence is gathered for the Family Court of Australia by legal aid funding bodies, lawyers acting within the Family Courts of Australia, experts such as counsellors, therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers, and welfare bodies working in the Family Court of Australia. Your petitioners pray that the House of Representatives, assembled in Parliament, act to hold a full Royal Commission into the Family Court of Australia, all bodies operating within the Family Court of Australia (such as Legal Service bodies providing legal 'aid, independent representatives, welfare bodies) and the methodology used by these bodies and their representatives EmptyHere Family Court of Australia To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representati-es in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned shows: We are extremely concerned at the law which allows the Family Court of Australia to stop, suspend or reduce access between non-custodial parents and children with extreme ease and the manner in which this is done in secrecy, as the law will not allow media reporting of the Family Court of Australia. We are also concerned that parents are willingly flaunting access orders under the present law, where the conviction and punishment of parents is placed in the hands of the Family Cqurt judges. We believe that bailiffs, with access to all Family Court orders, should be appointed to enforce all orders and to seek punishment of those breaking orders, in a court other than the Family Court. We believe this bailiff should have jurisdiction to fine ihosb offending parents to help free up the court time, this could be in the form of a standard, on-the-spot fine and regular offenders would be prosecuted in another court. We also believe that no person should be interviewed for Family Court reports or evidence unless that interview is video recorded and copies of the recording made available to the parties concerned for them to be assessed by their own experts. We believe no access should ever be suspended, except by consent of all parties, without a video recorded assessment, copies of which are available to all parties, being done first. We are concerned at the type of environment supervised access is held in for these assessments and seek proper access centres which would be away from the Court registries, with pleasant inside and outside access areas to truly gauge the interactions of the people concerned. No access should ever be. suspended without a video recorded interaction of the people concerned being done, unless by consent of all parties. Your petitioners pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled amend the Family Law Act to ensure that the Family Court is open to media reporting, that no access order can be stopped, suspended, reduced or altered for a period exceeding fourteen days, unless by consent, without a video recorded assessment .of all parties cQncerned, by a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist. That bailiffs be appointed to all Family Courts of Australia to enforce all court orders. That suitable supervised access areas be provided away from the court where access could be observed in a more suitable environment than now is the case. EmptyHere Mining and Tourism in the Antarctic' To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, draw to the attention of the House our extreme concern about the impact of any human activities in the Antarctic, such as mining and tourism, on the region's environment and wildlife. Your petitioners therefore request the House to do everything in its power to prevent such activities, in the interests of Australia and the world; and to ensure that the Antarctic region is preserved as a Heritage Park. EmptyHere 'Authority Required' Prescriptions To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whilst acknowledging the Government's desire to contain the growth in health costs, the introduction of 61 new drugs to the 'Authority Required' listing will result in potentially serious delays in patients receiving medication prescribed by their doctors. Your petitioners request the House to immediately reverse the Government's decision and withdraw these drugs from the 'AiJthorities Required' list. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr West (from 168 citizens). Petitions received.

10,Mr CROSS ,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"Brisbane) (1O.12)-On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the Committee's report entitled The priorities for Australia's mine countermeasure needs, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",16
11,Mr CROSS,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"In the report on the Australian Defence Force (ADF), its structure and capabilities, published in 1984, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade identified a requirement for the ADF to develop within its maritime defence forces a small but highly capable mine countermeasure (MCM) capability. That requirement had previously been noted in the 1976 Defence .White Paper and was subsequently reflected in the 1987 White Paper. Despite those official endorsements that the acquisition of an effective MCM capability must be a defence priority, the fact is Committee. that for the past decade those capabilities have been in a state of decline. 'Today, for all practical purposes, the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) no longer possesses an operation capability to respond to the threat of mines laid in Australian waters. That unsatisfactory circumstance has been recognised and some action has been taken. The Committee commends and supports the present Government's vigorous efforts of recent years to address this loss of essential military capability. Certain of those efforts are particularly noteworthy. For example, the development of the craft-of-opportunity minesweeper concept by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) and the RAN appears likely to be a considerable, technical and operational success. Nevertheless, the present state of our mine countermeasure force remains causeÂ· for concern. I believe that this report by the Joint Committee is therefore timely and important. The report is not simply a series of critimine cisms of the organisational processes which have allowed the ADFs MCM force to degrade to its present state. It is, rather, a constructive examination of the whole subject, based on a careful analysis of Australia's strategic circumstances, the technology of mine warfare, Defence Force resources, and the RAN's general capabilities. Most importantly, the report uses that analysis to present a series of positive recommendations, directed towards the speedy development of a' sufficient and effective MCM force. Further, those recommendations ate consistent with the priority which rational threat assessments indicate should be accorded to the development of the ADF's overall force structure. Before detailing the Committee's major judgments, I should like to acknowledge those organisations and individuals who assisted us during the inquiry. As Chairman of the Defence Subcommittee I wish. to record my appreciation of the efforts of my Subcommittee colleagues., This is the third major repott prepared by the Defence Subcommittee which has been tabled during the thirty-fifth Parliament; a statistic which clearly illustrates my colleagues- committment both to. Australia's security and the work of the Joint As has been the case throughout the thirtyfifth Parliament, the Minister for Defence ( Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel ( Mr Simmons), the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defehce gave the Committee their full support. We are grateful for that assistance. We would also like to thank all those associations or individuals who made submissions, gave evidence or assisted the inquiry. In particular, the contribution from RAN and DSTO mine countermeasure specialists was appreciated. The Committee would like to recognise the contribution made. by its staff. Finally, special mention should be made of Mr Derek Woolner, who assisted the Subcommittee's research under arrangements initiated by the Parliamentary Library. I now turn to the report's major findings. In the past 15 or so years, sea mines have been used to' great effect iq ,a range of locations, inclUding Vietnam, the Red Sea, Nicaragua and the Persian Gulf. While offensive warfare operations can involve the most advanced technology, some of those campaigns were notable for the simplicity of the weapons and the laying platforms: in the Persian Gulf, for example, mines dating back to Tsarist Russia were used, and apparently were laid in some instances from motor boats. Yet that most basic weapons system eventually demanded an expensive and disproportionate response from a large, modern, international countermeasure force. That disproportionate response was consistent with the results achieved by the aggressive use of sea mines in larger, conventional conflicts, notably World War II and the Korean war. n is the Joint Committee's judgment that, in the prevailing strategic climate, the use of sea mines represents one of the most likely threats to Australia's security and trade. It is a threat which is equally applicable across the range of conflicts, from low level contingencies, through to escalated low level conflict, and up to more substantial conflict. Some basic dataÂ· on Australian .trade illustrate that assessment. Our overseas commodity trade is dominated by shipping, which in 1986-87 carried some 78 per cent by value of imported commodities and 86 per cent by value of exported commodities. In terms of volume the dominance of sea transport is complete, being 99.9 per cent by weight of exported commodities. Taking into account the circumstances which I have briefly outlined, and which are discussed in detail in our report, the Committee developed a set of recommendations for which the main criteria were, first, the need for the prompt resolution of the difficulties whicQ have hampered the development of the RAN's MCM force; and, second, the fundamental necessity for that force to comply with current strategic assessments. In particular, the MCM force must possess those broad characteristics identified in the White Paper as necessary for the ADF, namely, 'range, endurance, and mobility, and independent logistic support'. We do not believe that the planned MCM force structure satisfies those criteria. The development of an effective minehunting capability is central to Australia's MCM force. Minehunting-as opposed to sweeping-is the only suitable technique for locating certain types of mines. Minehunting vessels also are essential for the conduct of tactically vital underwater surveys. The RAN and Australian industry have shown commendable initiative in designing and constructing the catamaran-hulled Bay class inshore minehunter. When fitted with a suitable sonar system, that vessel is likely to provide an acceptable inshore capability. Unfortunately, the project's progress has been seriously delayed by the failure of the preferred sonar system to satisfy specifications. In turn, that delay has impacted adversely on many other aspects of the total MCM program. Accordingly, one of theÂ· Committee's main recommendations addresses the need for Navy to explore alternative sonar options for its mine hunters inshore (MHIs). In our judgment, the option which is most likely to achieve the earliest possible resumption of trials in the Bay class hunters will come from the single source procurement of a proven, integrated sonar system. If necessary, that system could in the first instance be leased. Since the concept for the Bay class MHI was developed, the emphasis in mine hunting has shifted from inshore to offshore operations. Consequently, the Committee considers that the RAN should acquire three rather than the planned six MHls, and that the future development of the minehunting capability for the RAN should be directed towards the acquisition of larger, coastal minehunters. For similar reasons, and also to improve the deployability of MCM forces, priority should be given to acquiring large craft of opportunity platforms for mine sweeping operations. Other recommendations directed towards the MCM force structure deal with precursor sweeping, offensive mine warfare, and force numbers and disposition. We also believe that, given the success of international mine clearance operations in the recent past, attention should be given to the establishment of a regional MCM force. The capacity effectively to control shipping in Australian waters should a mine warfare threat arise will largely depend on our surveillance and port defence systems. Here, we are talking about prevention rather than cure-clearly, a preferable course of action .. The Committee believes that those activities are more likely to be successful if a coordinated, centralised port defence system is established and regularly exercised; and if the limits of our territorial seas are extended to 12 miles, consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A skilled, committed personnel base is fundamental to the defence of Australia. Last November this Committee tabled a major report on personnel wastage in the ADF. Committee members were gratified by the response to that report made in this House two weeks ago by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel ( Mr Simmons). We are aware that the ADFhas sustained a high loss rate of MCM specialists, and believe that the measures detailed by the Minister to improve conditions of service should help to arrest that rate. We also believe that lack of job satisfaction can be a major factor in decisions to resign, in which context our recommendations aimed at reviving the RAN's MHI project are crucial. My final comments address the central theme of this inquiry, namely, the priorities for Australia's mine countermeasure needs. During the inquiry, the Committ.ee was impressed by the technical expertise and dedication which the Navy's MCM force is able to apply to overcome the risks of hostile mining. We have, however, observed that the value of this resource and the need to support it has not always' been given proper recognition at high levels within defence. To ensure the future development of the RAN's MCM force, mine countermeasures must be accorded priority in the procurement, personnel and policy activities of the Department of Defence. It is clear that an MCM capability must rank equally in, the RAN's force structure with, for example, the submarine and surface warships programs, but demands more urgency. In conclusion, it is the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that the development of a capable MCM force must be one of the highest priorities for the ADF. We acknowledge the present Government's efforts to establish that force, and trust that this report will make a constructive contribution to the process. I commend the report to the House.",16
12,Mr HALVERSON ,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"Casey) (10.22)Whilst I support the general thrust of the comments made by the Chairman of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Gommittee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Brisbane ( Mr Cross), in regard to this significant report the priorities for Australia's mine countermeasure needs, there are, I believe, a number of important aspects which warrant further comment and particular attention. Because of time constraints, I want, on this occasion, to. focus on the alarming and long term neglect and decay of our mine countermeasuJ;'es capability----:neglect and decay which has resulted in the total degradation of the albeit limited - apability we once possessed, to the current position .where we find ourselves with no effective mine countermeasures capability at all. This situation has been allowed to develop and continue despite the fact that for any country with even a small coastline-and particularly for one that is surrounded by water-mine warfare poses very real threats. It undoubtedly has significant implications for Australia. The 1986 report of the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities and the 1987 Defence White Paper both acknowledged the proposition that the sea is the most likely area in which Australian interests could first come under military threat. In this context, mine warfare is very effective from both a strategic and an economic point of view. Mines can be very efficient weapons. They are relatively cheap, and the speed and ease with which they may be obtained and deployed belie the potential threat to security they pose and the cost and complications involved in their detection and disposal. Sea mines have been used extensively and effectively in both world wars and' during the conflicts in Korea, Vietnam and, most recently, the Middle East; notably the Suez Joint Canal-Red Sea area, and the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war. As stated in the mine countermeasure needs report, offensive mine warfare operations are notable for their cost-effectiveness, particularly in terms of the disproportionate response they demand fromÂ· defenders. A graphic example of the relative ease with which a mine warfare capability can be acquired, and its potential effectiveness, is given on page 18 of the report. During the Korean war the United Nations (UN) forces planned !,In amphibious assault on the port of Wonsan. The communist forces hastily assembled a fleet of junks and laid a defensive field of 'on some 3,000 old, but still functional, Russian mines around Wonsan. The result was that the UN assault landing was delayed for eight days. A senior United StatesÂ· commander summarised the operation in a message to Washington: We have lost control of the sea, to a nation without a navy, using obsolete weapons, laid by ships in use at the time of Jesus Christ.Â· Unlike sollie other defence issues, there is no dispute about our need to adequately protect ourselves by mairitaining an effective mine countermeasures capacity against the threats posed , by mine warfare. . Having established that mine warfare poses significant risks and problems, that a mine warfare threat exists in so far as Australia's future defence and security are concerned and that this threat should be countered, the question must be asked: what are we actually doing about it? The answer is far from satisfactory. Although we have assurances from high ranking naval officers that the MHI-mine hunter inshore-program is a very important part of naval development, that there is no intention of curtailing the program at this stage, and that the Navy. gives very high priority to the development of a mine warfare capability, it is obvious that the program is bogged' down and getting nowhere fast. Let me illustrate this point by summarising the ongoing saga of the minehunting catamarans. In his ministerial statement of 17 September 1985, the Minister for Defence ( Mr Beazley) said: The Government regards the establishment of an adequate mine countermeasures capability as a high priority. One important initiative currently under way is the, construction of two prototype fibreglass minehunter catamarans of Australian design. These craft are expected to enhance significantly our inshore mine warfare capability. The 'important initiative currently under way' that the Minister referred to in his statement had, in fact, already been on the books for more than 10 years, having first been mentioned in the five-year defence program approved by the Labor Government in 1975. It is pointless to pretend that, where mine countermeasures (MCM) are concerned, the Coalition has demonstrated any greater concern or commitment or had any greater success than Labor. In the 1976 Defence White Paper reference was made to the fact that the mine countermeasures force at that time consisted of two minehunters and one minesweeperall of the Ton class, wooden-hulled and, at more than 30 years of age, relatively elderly and due to be pensioned off. At the time the Navy was examining a new concept in MCM vessels which it was hoped would provide a more, flexible and effective minehunting capability-an Australian designed and developed glass-reinforced plastic craft fitted with modern minehunting and mine disposal equipment. The Government's objective was to have the new minehunter craft entering service during the first half of the 1980s. In October 1981, the then Minister for Defence, the Hon. D. J. Killen, in a ministerial statement informed the House: Our plans for the development of the' Austrajiandesigned minehunting catamaran are proceeding and tenders for construction of two prototypes are presently being evaluated. In April 1982, in a question on notice to the then Minister for Defence, the right honourable member for New England ( Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes) asked the reasons for .the delay in finalising tenders which had been called' in November 1980 for the construction of the two prototype RAN minehunter hulls, and also inquired regarding costs associated with the project. In his response, to the question, the right honourable member for New England, the then Minister, referred to several factors, including the fact that vessels of this type and size had never before been constructed in Australia, and advised: The time involved in considering industry'S proposals and finalising contractual arrangements has been longer than normally taken for a conventional vessel. The right honourable member for New England further advised that the estimated total project cost-including all costs associated with design, development, construction' and evaluation-for the two prototypes was estimated to be about $70m at August 1981 price levels. In August 1982, the then Minister for Defence advised the House that the development of the Australian designed mine hunter was proceeding, and contract negotiations had started for the construction of the first two vessels. By 9 December 1982 a note of urgency had crept into the mine hunter catamaran project, when the then Minister for Transport and Construction moved that, because of the urgent nature of the' work, it was expedient that construction of the RAN mine hunter catamarans and associated shipbuilding facility be carried out without being referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. The Minister stated: The cost of the two catamarans and the associated facility is estimated to be $23m. It is essential that a contract be entered into by December 1982 to allow the replacement minehunters to be commissioned on schedule. Any delay in entering this contract would result in a critical gap in the Australian Defence Force's minehunters capability. In fact, the project was already some five years behind schedule. Here we are in 1989six years since the government last changed hands and nearly 15 years since the catamaran project was first mooted-and still no operational minehunting catamaran. I bring this matter to the attention of the House because I hope that we may learn from history, .and thus avoid making the same mistakes again. As is so often the. case, we are paying dearly-and not only from the point of view of our current lack of MCM capability-for the years of indecision, procrastination and lack of action. The report reveals some alarming details regarding the extent of the financial damage. In early 1983, approved expenditure on the two prototype MHI vessels was $53m. By the end of 1987-88, expenditure on the two prototypes had reached $82.6m. Unit project cost is now about $86m for each additional vessel. We can compare this with the early 1986 figure of less than $53m per vessel noted in the Dibb report on the Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities and with the cost of other much larger, already proven and available mine hunting vessels, for example the United States Navy's Osprey class or the British Sandown-much bigger vessels for relatively little additional iture. Apart fromÂ· the catamaran fiasco, there are other significant and fundamental problems associated with our current MHI program.The sonar system on which the mine hunting effectiveness of the MHI vessels depends and in which we have invested some $87m to date does not work, and there are considerable problems still to be solved if existing deficiencies are ever to be overcome. An alternative system is available, but no decision has been made to purchase the viable off the shelf option. How much money will be spent and how much more precious time will be lost whilst this Nero mentality :prevails? Anyone with even a basic knowledge of Australian coastal waters is well aware of the limitations imposed by the sea state three specification. The vessel will not be' capable of performing the task for which isÂ· has been designed unless the wind has dropped. I believe that we have achieved our objective, and I commend the report to honourable members on both sides of the House.",19
13,Mr BILNEY ,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"Kingston) (10.32)-As Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, 'I have pleasure in speaking in this debate in support of my colleague the Chairman of the Defence Subcommittee of my Committee, the honourable member for Brisbane ( Mr Cross), and following the remarks of the honourable member for Casey ( Mr Halverson) on the tabling of the Committee's report entitled The priorities for Australia's mine countermeasure needs. That is not the kind of title that would be likely to sell one million copies of the report, but it addresses a topic of great importance. This is the fourth major report prepared by the Defence Subcommittee under the leadership of the 'honourable member for Brisbane. The previous three reports have become known by the eponymous title of the 'Cross reports', and it is - fair to say that each has had a significant impact on the defence debate in Australia, as I am sure the Minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, ( Mr Humphreys), would be well aware. I am confident that this fourth Cross report on the topical subject of mine warfare and expend- countermeasures will also contribute positively to that defence debate. , Mr Tim Fischer-The finale-the last Cross report.",21
14,Mr BILNEY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"No, it will not be the ,last Cross report. Another report on the Australian Defence Force Reserves is coming up, and I believe that that will complete the fourth leg and will similarly deal with an important problem. Before I comment on the findings of the Joint Standing Committee, I believe it would be of interest to honourable members for me to outline the three Cross reports to which I have referred. In 1984 the Joint Standing Committee tabled a report entitled The Australian Defence Force: Its Structure and Capabilities. That report did not receive a great deal of sympathetic attention from the Government and the Department of Defence, but a number of the C::ommittee's key judgments and findings were subsequently reflected in the Dibb'Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities and the 1987 Defence White Paper, the documents which, more than any other, today shape the development of the Australian Defence Force (ADF). The Cross Committee's 1987 report, The Management of Australia's Defence, reviewed the higher defence organisation. Among its more important recommendations were those addressing, first, the need to overcome single service rivalries; secondly, the need to overcome civilmilitary relations at defence headquarters at Russell Hill; and, thirdly, the need to reduce the overstaffing and overran king that made employment at Russell offices a stultifying experience for so many people. A subsequent series or reorganisations within various components of the Department of Defence and the ADF has focused on those three major problem areas. In particular, the structural review of higher ADF staff arrangements that is currently being carried out by Major-General Sanderson at the direction of the Chief of the Australian Defence Force could alter fundamentally the management of Australia's defence. The third Cross report and the most recent, Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force, was tabled in 1988. That issue had been the subject of considerable controversy in this place, and was one which, as anyone who has had anything to do with the forces knows, was a very real and alive issue at the time, and in many ways that is still the case. That report. dealt with one of the most vexed and contentious issues within the ADF for many years-namely, the di-turbingly high. resignation rates to which our armed forces have been subject in the past five or so years. Might I say on behalf of the Committee that I think all members have been gratified, J?y the reaction to the personnel wastage report. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel ( Mr Simmons), in a detailed response delivered in this House just two weeks ago, endorsed 41 of the 48 recommendations which the Committee made in that report. The other day the Chief of the Defence Force, General Gration, describc;:d the Government's response as 'quite a milestone in personnel practices' and said that the third Cross report had given the ADF 'a leap forward'. Against that background' I now want to speak briefly about the fourth report on miile warfare countermeasures. As I said before, although it is rather specialised and isÂ· unlikely to appeal. to as wide an audience as its predecessors, it contains a number of significant judgments. Here I would like to pay tribute to the members of the Defence Subcommittee, including the honourable member for Casey who has just spoken, for the hard work they put into producing this report. There is a sense in which this latest report can be regarded as a case study of many of the general policy issues which were argued in broader terms in those three previous reports. The fact that Australia today effectively has no operational mine countermeasures capability can be traced, in part, directly to deficiencies in force structure development decisions, inadequate higher defence management and questionable personnel management practices. Sufficient detail from the report has been given this morning by t-e honourable member for Brisbane and the honourable member for Casey for me not to wish to add much to that. I want to reiterate and underline that the need for an effective mine countermeasure force has been recognised in official policy documents as one of Australia's highest defence priorities for some 13 years now; yet we still remain at least two years, and probably more, ,away from reaching that objective. That having been said, I would like to acknowledge the vigorous leadership demonstrated by the present Minister for Defence ( Mr Beazley) in his efforts to resolve this problem. Acknowledgment must also be made of the commitment and inventiveness shown by mine warfare specialists within the Royal Australian Navy and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. I believeÂ· that the report entitled The priorities for Australia's mine countermeasures can be used to contribute constructively to ,the development of an essential defence capability. Its analysis ,of our needs arises from a rigorous review of threat assessments, while its recommendations, have been framed to reflect those broad characteristics identified in the 1987 White Paper as necessary for the broader' Australian Defence Force,namely, range, endurance, mobility and independent l-gistic slJPport. The report thus addresses issues which require urgent attention. Indeed, nothing has drawn attention more to the urgency of those measures than the Gulf war. We all watched as a low-tech but very potent, very cheap, very readily deployed weapon was used to disrupt vital channels of communication, and used, I might say, against ships from nations of the highest technological weapons capability. They were stymied by mines, some of which dated back to the days of the tsars. I think that should send a chill down the spine of any Australian, knowing how much Australia, as a trading nation, relies on very few major ports. I have said that this issue is urgent. In my view, it is exceedingly urgent and the Committee has done the right thing in pointing to it. Before I conclude I should like to return to a matter I raised at the start of my speech. This is the fourth major report prepared by the Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade underÂ· the chairmanship 'of the honourable member for Brisbane.Â· As I said in response to a rather uninstructive interjection earlier, it will not be the last Cross report. I know that I speak. for all members of this House and for members of the Joint Committee when I say that these reports stand as testimony to the wise leadership the honourable member for Brisbane has given that Committee. They have earned him and his colleagues on the Defence Subcommittee widespread respect both in the Parliament and in the defence community. As Chairman of the Joint Committee I congratulate him on tabling this fourth Cross report and commend the report to the House.",21

17,Mr OKEEFE ,COMMUNITY AFFAIRS,"Burke) (1O.41)-On behalf of the Standing Committee .on Community Affairs I present the Committee's report entitled Fairness, courtesy and efficiency? A report on the quality of service provided by the Department of Social Security, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be prip.ted.",23
18,Mr OKEEFE,COMMUNITY AFFAIRS,"This report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs is its second report, and it concentrates on the quality of service provided by the Department of Social Security. It results from an intensive inquiry which we have made, commencing in February last year. At the outset I should outline the motivation behind an inquiry of this kind. As politicians, we receive a constant stream of people coming into our offices seeking assistance in dealing with government departments and the services we provide. Social security and pensioner benefits are a key example. Many of us have prepared pensioner information kits, and we have witnessed the demand in our own electorates for this kind of information. To the extent that this reflects a weakness, perhaps, in the provision of services and the quality of information, there was scope for an examination of this kind, and the members of my Standing Committee were pleased to receive a reference from the Minister for Social Security ( Mr Howe) encouraging this examination. I believe the report is both balanced and fair. It is also true to say that it is management-oriented in that we have recognised that the officers of the Department must work within the legislative framework provided by the yovernment. We have focused on the techniques by which the quality of service and information' can be provided from within. In fact, the Committee has made a number of suggestions on how to improve client contact, including the adoption of a modified expert computer system as a staff aid in regional offices. We have looked to improve techniques for visual, written and electronic communications; a strong commitment by both management and staff to the opportunity for changed work practices; improved staff skills presented by award restructuring and second tier wage negotiations; and an increased use of the welfare agencies and community groups as providers of information and a buffer zone between the Department and its clients. The report recommends that regional managers be given more scope to take more initiative in developing and expanding the networks and resources available to them, especially the services which can be provided through the welfare agencies and community groups which act as de facto members of the social security system. The Committee has made 44 recommendations as to how this administrative and communicative can be improved. It is fair to say that at the outset of the inquiry we received an impresto sive submission from the Department which outlined a wide range of initiatives being taken, and faced up to a number of difficulof ties that needed to be addressed. We have borne this in mind as we have carried out the inquiry, and the recommendations in report are intended to assist with the priorilarge ties and the approaches in a way that we think is complementary to the Department's plans. . Having said that, it is only fair to make the other point. The bottom line is that Committee is not satisfied with the overall standard of service provided, and we make no bones about it. We are not critical of counter staff and the officers. In fact, we quite admiring of the efforts of these people in very stressful and difficult circuIl}stances. I believe that our recommendations are well structured, anq they should provide a. sound basis for further development of the departis mental blueprint by the Minister and the senior officers of the Department. I wil- not go into the detail of the report. As I know that a number of other memfascinating bers of the Committee wish to make a few comments, I shall conclude my introductory remarks by saying that we have been very appreciative of the efforts and the interest shown by the many people and organisations who contributed to the inquiry. They range from major organisations, such as the AusI tralian Council of Social Service, through to community groups and private individuals. We also extend our appreciation to the many staff members of the Department who openly and frankly discussed their perceptions us. Members of the Committee recognise that it is not easy for people to subject themselves to the spotlight and scrutiny of a standing committee of the Federal Parliament. It not every day that a group like that goes to a work place and wants to know what the people there really think about things. To the extent that these people were able to adapt and to talk with us, we believe that they .handled themselves very well in the situation, and they gave us a valuable insight into staff attitudes-which are quite positive-within the Department. I think our process report reflects this. I also wish to place on record my thanks my fellow Committee members for their interest and the efforts they put into the work. We want to convey our appre-iation the efforts of the Committee secretariat. Mr Nordin, Mrs Mills and the staff have been required to liaise with many groups and bur organisations. They have had to handle. a volume of sensitive material. They have conducted themselves patiently and profes.sionally in this process, not only with the many clients with whom they have had to deal but also with the members of the Comthe mittee, because Â·weÂ· all think we know the answers and we allÂ· have different perceptions about these things. I think members of the the staff conducted themselves very well in are this task and I am glad to see them present in the House this morning forÂ· the tabling of the report. They should be proud of their work. I believe that the report is balanced and fair. It is intended to be constructive. It management oriented, and we look forward to the Government's response to it.",23
19,Ms MCHUGH ,COMMUNITY AFFAIRS,"Phillip) (10.48)-This was a fascinating committee to be on and a report to dealÂ· with. First, I commend the Chair, the honourable member for Burke ( Mr O'Keefe), and the secretariat, in particular, for all their work throughout this review. It was fascinating for all of us, because we are allbackbenchers who know ho,w important the social security system is. suppose it must be the most vast bureaucratic system in Australia. Almost all Australians are involvc::d in some way with the social security system. We as backbenchers are constantly dealing with .the offices of the with Department of Social Security in our own areas. For that reason it was marvellous to go around the country and to see, from the inside, how the system really works. This was particularly the Clise for Governis ment members, as we have been part of a government in which the Minister for Social Security ( Mr Howe) decided to look at the social security system and was prepared to find out how it worked and where there needed to be change. For that reason, of course, the Minister set up' Cass Review of Social Security, the first comprehensive review of the, social security system for 40 years. That resulted in an enormous number of changes to the socia.1 security system. In the operation of the Committee we were able to see how those systems were being delivered, how informaabout tion was being given to clients, and so on. The Department of Social Security has ways had a problem, because of the vastness of its work, in communicating with the pubprovid-d lic on' what they are entitled to and what they are not entitled to-and also, of course, with its'image. All these changes depend on the staff the social security system, just, as we in electorates depend a great deal On those staff. They are meant to be ,the fount of all knowlpffice. edge, whether we approach them or whether members of the,public approach them-and their difficulties, I think, are enormous: Com,nittee has recognised"" all the way through, the dedication and the commitment of staff in Social Security offices. Some of them are quite extraordinary-certainly in my electorate. There are three major offices: at Bondi Junction, Maroubra and Randwick. I cannot speak highly enough of the compassand sion and the caring way in which the Social Security officers deal with the, members, of the public in my constituency enormous amount of h-lp that they offer me. The public image of the social security office is the long queues which are unavoidcertain able because almost everyone comes to Sbcial Security at some time. The people standing in those queues have had to' swallow their pride in order to approach Social Security. cannot speak highly enough of the officers who deal with these people. The' Committee in its reports asks for more to be done for more initiatives to be taken. It is tant to remember that many initiatives come from people in regional social security fices. There is a great deal still to be done, but by cooperation and consultation with people already in the field many improveshould ments are still to be made. I commend the have a real repqrt to the House.",24
20,Mr SCIACCA ,COMMUNITY AFFAIRS,"Bowman) (10.51)-1 was very pleased to have been part of this inquiry. In fact, I spent a deal of time with the the honourable member for Burke ( Mr O'Keefe) and other members of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs travelling around the country and seeing for ourselves what the position was with the service of the Department of Social Security. The honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh) talked the dedication of the social security staff. As a, general rule that is the case. It is alalso fair to say, however, that one major problem we en,countered was the services by certain regional offices at the c(>\ll face; that is, the cO]Jnter staff. One recommendation in the report .is that more senior people should be employed on the of counter. Many regional offices have probour lems with resources. Certain areas are more of a burden on a particular social security There is no question that there were many complaints about the type of service that was being received at the counter, at This the coal face. As a result of this report-I know the Social Security Department is aware of our concerns in this regard-more senior people will be rotated as, a result of 'the award restruCturing, which will alleviate the problems with the different staff levels, et cetera. That problem will be fixed up. I think we would be hiding our heads in the if we did not say that there were some problems in that' area. If nothing else I am glad that this report will make sure that that and of the problem is fixed up. As we weni' around the country we found that there was a great disparity between regional offices. Some regional offices were run better than others. One recommendation is that the regional managers should probably take' more steps to be more innoI vative, to be a little more original in some of their ideas as to how the services of that particular office are to be given to clients. In and my own' electorate the Committee was kind imporenough to come with me and inspect the services that are available in the social securofity office at Wynnum. I am proud that these i services are provided in my electorate. It is the a model of the way social security offices be-roomy interview rooms and modern premises. The people who go there wait for only a short time. The other members of the Committee who were fortunate enough to be with me on that day saw for themselves the sort of office that every social security office, given the resources, could be. Mr Tony Cunning, a manager in that area, is an innovative person. He takes prideÂ· in the services that he delivers. Bob Pook helps and gets involved in the community on a purely voluntary basis and he uses the experience he gains to provide services through the social security office. I congratulate both of them and all the staff of the social security office at Wynnum. In conclusion, it was a pleasure for me to have been involved in this inquiry. I very much enjoyed the company of the staffBjarne Nordin and Robina Mills-and all my other colleagues, particularly the Chairman, the honourable member for Burke. We get on very well. I think that we work very well together. I commend the report to the House.",25
21,Mrs HARVEY ,COMMUNITY AFFAIRS,"Hawker) (10.55)-;-As with the preceding speakers, I have also very much enjoyed serving on the Standing Committee on Community Affairs as it looked into the quality o,f service provided by the Department of Social Security. I endorse the statements commending the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Burke ( Mr O'Keefe), and thank the Committee staff for its hard work and the efficiency with - hich it conducted this inquiry. As a backbencher with a very high proportion of my electorate being clients of the Department of Social Security, particularly age pensioners, I have a fair amount of contact, like the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh), with the departmental officers in my electorate, particularly the Department officers at Edwardstown, Glenelg and Parkside. I have been generally very happy with the quality of service which has been given at those offices. There are always individual cas- of. disgruntled clients who come to a backbencher to complain about the perceived treatment that they have had at the. local departmental office, but we often find that this is a case of misunderstanding or misconstruction or somebody having a bad day. On the whole the service is very good. The Committee has identified various problems. One problem is access to and delivery of information to clients. I find that potential clients are very much in the dark about what benefits might be available to them. That is why I endorse the recommendation in this report that says that there ought to be a single application form for potential clients of the Department of Social Security because at the moment they have to diagnose their own problem and, in a way, they have to prescribe their own cure. Hopefully under this system people will be able to go along to the Department and simply say, 'I am in trouble, I need income support'. They will not have to find out what benefit or payment they are eligible for. It will then be up to the Department to guide them through the process. In social security there is always a tension between the targeting of pensions to people who are eligible and at the same time making sure that potential clients have their rights. This will always be a problem. Hopefully this report will help to remedy that. I will not go on because other people want to speak on this matter. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for giving me the chance. It is a pleasure to endorse the recommendations.",26
22,Mr DUBOIS ,COMMUNITY AFFAIRS,"St George) (10.57)-I wish to endorse the comments of the Chairman and the previous speakers. During the inquiry we learned that there was some dissatisfaction among the clients of the Department of Social Security over the delivery of. the Department's services. It was nothing new to us because most of us had heard those complaints in our own offices. The use of inexperienced staff to advise bewildered clients and the sometimes abrupt way in which clients were notified of a termination or a reduction in benefits led to some hostility towards the Department of Social Security and/or the Governtnent. Who better to blame than the Government when something unexpected occurs? The range of benefits, pensions and assistance available from the Department reflects the range of problems faced in the community and this Government's determination to address those problems. WhileÂ· we would all prefer a less complicated array, we run the risk of denying relief if we reduce the range of benefits to simplify the system just for its own sake. The introduction of new or expanded benefits and renewed attempts to reduce overpayments are responses to community expectations. The changes are sometimes difficult to keep up with, but we must remember that social security is a welfare-based safety net and those in our community who need and deserve financial assistance should receive it. The implementation of the recommendations in this report will redress some of the complaints about the Department's services. I hope that they will be seriously considered. This report could not have been presented today were it not for members of the secretariat. Their assistance and their comprehension of the .issues were invaluable. I also thank them sincerely.",26
23,Mr JOHNS ,COMMUNITY AFFAIRS,"Petrie) (lO.59)-Very briefly, I thank the Chairman, the honourable member for Burke ( Mr O'Keefe), and the secretariat for their good work. The main point in this report is that the social security system is complex because the problems in the community are complex. Inevitably and always, the social security system must respond to that complexity. By and large, I think it does it very' well, and we say so in the report. I wish to congratulate all of those hard-working members of the Department of Social Security who have to cope with a great deal. They do a good job in servicing their constituency. In this report, we seek to help both the constituents, that is, social security clients and the workers in the Department of Social Security. Let me emphasise once again that I do not believe we will ever have a nice, simple, clean system of providing payments and benefits to social security recipients. We must acknowledge that there is a complexity and diversity of needs out there in the community and it is our job as a government and, through the Government, to our administrators to respond to the complexity, always keeping in mind that we must make things simple for the client. I wish to thank all those who have been involved in this report. NA . NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY",27
24,Mr CLEELAND ,JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE,"MCEwen) (11.03)-On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority', I present the Committee's report entitled Drugs, Crime and Society, incorporating a dissenting report, together with evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",27
25,Mr CLEELAND,JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE,"The past year has seen a growing debate on the question of the alternatives to the present policy of prohibition in respect of illegal drugs. In Britain, the Economist has advocated a relaxation of the present policy to 'get the gangsters out of drugs'. In the United States of America hearings have been held in CongrÂ¥Ss on the issue. In this country a former Deputy ComEmptyHere lianis, has suggested that at this time there is a case for making presently illegal drugs available under strict government control. The report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority will prove a disappointment to those who expected this Committee to recommend sweeping changes to the present law. The Committee believes that there is ample evidence that the present policy of prohibition is failing to achieve its objectives; namely, to reduce the use of those drugs which are presently illegal while preventing supplies of such drugs from reaching those in Australia who may wish to usthem; Illegal drugs are available throughout Australia for anyone who wants them, although at prices often artificially inflat-d by illegality. The market for illicit drugs lis a demand market. That is, those people who desire to use illicit drugs seek out the supplier and create the market by their own demand. For many years. governments have attempted to use the criminal law as a means of reducing supply to the marketplace. This report clearly demonstrates that such an approach has limitations and, in so far as its stated aim is to prevent illicit drugs from reaching the marketplace, it has demon-traÂ­ bly' failed. Evidence before the Committee demonstrated that illicit drugs are available in Australian gaols in all States. If it is not possible to keep illicit drugs from Australian gaols, how is it possible to keep the supply of illicit drugs from the streets of our society in our major cities? Those who would seek to increase penalties and to have a greater emphasis on law enforcement need to produce evidence to justify the effectiveness of that strategy. The reality is that there is no country in the world which has been successful in preventing supply from reaching the demand markets in those societies. This is not to say that law enforcement has not a major role to play in, the illicit drug market. The Committee has found that Australian law enforcement agencies have been far more successful in making seizures than they have been given credit for. But even the agencies themselves agree that they cannot stop all drugs from reaching the marketplace. Seizures do not represent a loss to importers of the street value of the drugs quoted in press reports but, rather, the purchase price of the drugs in their country of origin. For example, the present cost in Asia of a kilogram of No.4 heroin, which is basically pure heroin, is $15,000. Recent newspaper reports of a successful interdiction by the Australian Federal Police of some 60 kilograms of No. 4 heroin put the value of that heroin at $60m. Frankly, this is a nonsense. At $15,000 a kilo, the, cost to the importers of that interdiction is some $900,000, plus the cost of importation into Australia. In addition, the importing group has lost the services of some middle range dealers and suppliers in Australia. The experience of law enforcement agencies throughout the world is that the interdiction of a partic41ar importation of any illicit drug is immediately replaced by another importation to ensure that supply is readily available to the market-place. The evidence suggests that no special expertise is required to enter the trade, so that even if agencies succeed in arresting major traffickers there will be others ready to take their places. Moreover, the more successful law enforcement is, the greater the profits will be for those prepared to enter the trade. The Committee acknowledges that, by raising the, price of the illegal drugs and making access to them ,frisky and difficult, the present policy of prohibition deters new users who might be attracted to these drugs if they w-re as readily available as alcohol and tobacco. It also encourages heavy users to consider treatment and abstinence because of the cost and difficulty of maintaining a habit. However, it achieves these effects ata considerable cost to the users themselves and to society. The Committee estimates the direct annual cost of drug law enforcement at $123m. The users of heroin, in particular, resort to crime to support their habits. The community bears the cost of drug related crime through increased insurance premiums and increased security for their homes and business premises. Users seeking to buy drugs are brought into contact with a criminal subculture and may progress from using cannabis and pills to using heroin. The illegal drug trade is violent because it takes place outside the law and the profits to be made corrupt law enforcement agencies an<;i, indeed, our entire society. The high cost of illegal drugs means that many users prefer to inject them, thus gaining the greatest effect from a small quantity of the drug. Carried out under unsanitary conditions, this has obvious health risks, and also leads to needle sharing, spreading hepatitis-B and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The illegal drugs are adulterated with substances including talc, glucose, strychnine and arsenic, posing further dangers to users' health. Prohibition has eroded accepted civil liberties. Prosecutions depend on informers and the law bears most heavily on the young and the poor. Prohibition also means that the illegal drugs are not available for medical use. What are the alternatives to the present policy? The Committee does not believe that increased penalties are a solution. The last two decades have seen a steady increase in the maximum sentences for drug trafficking in this country with negligible effects. Decriminalising the cultivation and distribution of cannabis for personal use would diminish the illegal market, but there would be no quality control and no control on underage use. Prescription of heroin to dependent users might ease their health-related problems and draw them into counselling on needle-sharing and treatment programs, but it would leaveoccasional and new users still seeking their supplies on the black market.' Making the presently illegal drugs available under strict government controls, with a ban on commercial sale and advertising, would eliminate many of the costs of the present policy. At the same time it could lead to a dramatic increase in the use of these drugs and a consequent increase in health problems. There'is no easy solution. Each option involves trade-offs between costs and benefits. The Committee emphasises that the present policy results in an absence of government control over the chemistry of the drugs being sold, the outlets where the, drugs are sold, and who the drugs may be sold to. The Committee therefore recommends that the community give earnest consideration to options by which governments might impose more controls on the sale and marketing of the presently illegal drugs. Besides calling more accurate statistics, the Committee proposes that the Commonwealth Government should set targets as indicators of the success of its latest initiatives in curbing the drug trade. Should these initiatives fail to make significant inroads o,n the market then the Committee suggests that it would be appropriate to consider some relaxation of the present prohibitions as an alternative policy. In the meanwhile the majority of the Committee recommends a ban on all advertising of alcohol and tobacco products. The Committee wasÂ· told that young people are faced with conflicting messages as to the acceptability of drug taking. We attempt to convince them that drugs are harmful, but at the same time they are bombarded with advertisements promoting the use of alcohol, tobacco and certain pharmaceutical drugs. The Committee believes that the continued promotion of alcohol and tobacco in particular undermines the credibility of the attempt through the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse to reduce the consumption of the illegal drugs. As Chairman of the Committee I place on record my appreciation and the appreciation of the Committee for the assistance provided by our secretary, Giles Short, our research assistants, Rosa Ferranda and John Carter, and steno-secretary Chris Migus. This report commands the attention of the Parliament and of our community. In order to diminish the harm caused by the use of illegal drugs we all need to expand our own horizons and to look at the problem honestly. The Committee is indebted to all the witnesses who appeared. There is in our community unarguably great concern at the present policy. There is unarguably great concern at the health risks and the harm done to out young people. But if the problem is to be solved, all of us need to have a fresh look and to open our minds to different approaches and to be prepared to accept in the long term the need to review our current policies.",27
26,Mr MACKELLAR ,JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE,"Warringah) (11.11)There is no subject of discussion within the community which strikes more terror and apprehension into the minds particularly of parents than the subject of illegal drugs. We are constantly confronted with a situation for whereby young people especially become entrapped, in many cases quite knowingly, into a vicious circle which can lead to a degraded lifestyle which-surprisingly-can be very attractive to a group of people. One of the things about this particular inquiry, and the report Drugs, Crime and Society that the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority is introducing today, is the fact that it brought forward submissions covering a wide range of views, but also it brought to bear a great deal of enlightenment on a subject about which there is a tremendous amount of misleading information. I must say, from my own point of view, that I found the submissions to the inquiry of great interest and extremely informative. My own preconceptions about a number of aspects' of what has become known as the drug scene were shown to be false, driven by exaggerated media reports and in many cases bringing about a situation which led to badly based views as to possible solutions to the problems confronting society. If for no other reason, I would encourage people to read this report for the factual information it . contams. [, l In chapter 6, for instance, we deal with the subject of options in relation to possible policies. As the Chairman, the honourable member for MCEwen ( MrCleeland), has already pointed out, there is no easy solution. Well, we knew there was no easy solution to the problem, but when one analyses the options available to legislators in dealing with this situation, I think the report does a great deal of good in clarifying and reducing a tremendous amount of information into an easily readable and understood form. At this stage I would like to pay great tribute to those who were largely responsible for drawing up the draft report, which was then dealt with by the Committee. The Committee secretariat has done a tremendous job in its work in dealing with the. material that came forward to the Committee in relation to the inquiry on drugs, criine and society. There is a widespread view within the community that what we need is more of the same. One will not find a great ,deal of argument in the broad community when one puts forward the proposition that there should be harsher sentences for people involved in the drug trade. On the face of it, that is a pretty straightforward and simple way to go. One of the aspects of that approach is that it makes the people who put it forward feel a lot better about it. It is in many ways a vengeance' driven response which is entirely understandable; it would be supported and is supported by a great proportion of the broad community. The question that the Committee asked itself was whether this was the appropriate way' or a realistic way to deal with the problem which is with us. I have to say that the simplistic approach-harsher penalties, and more and more expenditure onÂ· police work and police enforcement-when the effects ,of it are analysed, disCloses that the scenario is not all that alluring. It seems to me that experience would suggest that governments. can expend almost unlimited amounts of m.;mey in the law enfqrcement field and the problem will continue to grow within the community. I do not subscribe to the notion that more of the same is the appropriate way to go in dealing with this utterly horrendo-s, problem. One of the things that the Committee found during the inquiry, is that the extent of the money to be made from involvement in the illegal drug business is so vast that it is in itself a tremendous incentive for people to risk all sorts of penalties-including the death penalty in other countries-simply because the financial rewards are so enormous. One thing that greatly concerns me as a member of parliament, a parent and a member of society generally is the fact that the amounts of money involved in the illegal drug trade are so enormous as to prove the most corrupting influence on the very basis of our society that we face. It extends right through all those pillars of society upon which our way of life depends. We have seen examples of police forces, legislators and the judiciary being corrupted. When one considers the effects of this on the organisatipn of society, obviously it should be and is of concern to a very great number of people. Whether or not we should adopt the more of the same approach in dealing with the problem seems to me to be very much open to question. As the Chairman of the Committee has said, the submissions put to us suggested, and the report finds, that there is no simple straightforward solution. Decriminalisation or the, legalisation of presently illegal drugs is not the, way to go immediately, and a harsher regime does not hold out a great deal of hope in dealing with the problem that confronts us. What we must do is get across to the general community the facts of the situation so that legislators can make their decisions, based not on emotion but on hard information. That is what this report s,ets out to provide. The only aspect of, the report which was not unanimous was the recommendation relating to the advertising of tobacco and alcohol. A group of the Committee would not agree to the recommendation in chapter 7 that the Commonwealth Government ban all advertising of alcohol and tobacco products on radio and television, in cinemas and in print, so far as it is within its constitutioJ)al power to do so. Four members of the Committee-Senator Alston, Senator Hill, Mr MCGauran and I-dissented from that. I would like to read into the record the reason for that dissent: We dissent from the recommendation. . . which proposes a ban on all advertising of tobacco and alcohol products. The Committee's Terms of Reference did not allow a full investigation of advertising and its impact. The evidence submitted therefore does not justify a recommendation in these absolute terms. It is important that any parliamentary inquiry into any subject should base its recommendations on the material submitted to it and on the evidence which has been heard by the Committee in its deliberations. We did not believe that sufficient evidence to justify that absohJte recommendation had been put. That, does not mean to say that we are not coricerned about tobacco or l,I.lcohol advertising. It is something which deserves continuing monitoring, particularly alcohol advertising which gives a misleading picture of the virtues of an alcohol-oriented lifestyle. Overall, it was an extremely worthwhile investigation. The Committee has come forward with a fairly brief report which I would urge all members of the Parliament to read carefully. I hope that it gets a much wider audience as well, because it deserves it.",29

29,Mr SAUNDERSON ,AND INFRASTRUCTURE,"Aston) (11.22)-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Trans.port, Communications and Infrastructure, I present the Committee's supplementary report on the role and functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",31
30,Mr SAUNDERSON,AND INFRASTRUCTURE,"---;by leave-This supplementary report expands on and adds to theÂ· work in chapter 5 of the Committee report, The Role and Functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, presented to the House on 1 December 1988. It concentrates almost exclusively on ownership and control matters. The primary purpose of the report is to extend the trustee system recommended in the 1988 report to situations where the Tribunal finds that a person is unsuitable to hold an interest in a broadcasting licence. This is a matter I raised in a speech to a conference organised by the Communications Law Centre on 7 March 1989. This is what I said: The current inquiry by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal into Bond Corporation presents a scenario which, in my view, makes introduction of the 'trustee' system imperative. Should the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal find that Alan Bond is not a fit and proper person to hold a licence, it has two choices: either to require Alan Bond to be removed from a position of influence on the Board of the Bond Corporation; or to order divestiture by the Bond CorporationÂ· of the Nine Network. In either instance, a period of grace would almost certainly be provided to allow this to be done. Leaving Alan Bond in a position of influence. over the company holding the licence during this period of grace, this would clearly be a ludicrous situation. If the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal had the power to require the transfer of. shares to a trust arrangement this situation could be avoided. Under the Act the Tribunal is in a very difficult position if it finds that a person is, for example, no longer a fit and proper person to hold a licence or an interest in it. The Tribunal cannot order thaLperson to transfer the licence or some interest in it to someone else. The divestiture power in section 92N of the Act applies to existing interests only when they contravene the audience reach or crossmedia limits. In all other cases, the Tribunal's powers go no further than action against the .licence itself. The Tribunal could revoke the licence under sectionÂ· 88 of the Act, but if the unfit person is not the licensee itself that step would be punishment for a situation that would not be thelJault of the licensee or one which the licensee could rectify. Even if the unfit person is the licensee itself, the main effect of revocation is to deprive the area of a service which may take a long time to replace, given the processes involved in the grant of a new licence. The Tribunal could possibly attempt to avoid this problem by making ..its revocation decision operate from some future date, such as the date, that the replacement service commences. However, this would leave the unfit licensee in control of the existing service for all of that period in circumstances where there would be little incentive . for the licensee to keep the service operating at a reasonable level. Because it is neither final nor irreversible the trustee system has two advantages over a system of forced divestiture. First, it can be implemented without delay. This means that the public interest is protected by ensuring that an unsuitable person is rapidly removed from a position of control of a licence. Secondly, in the event that the Tribunal's decision is ultimately set aside, the interestholder can quickly reclaim the interest held in trust. This protects that person's commercial interest without compromising the objectives of the Act. For that reason, the Committee also does not believe that Tribunal decisions ordering that an interest be transferred to a trustee should be subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. If any decision is to be subject to review on the merits, it should only be the primary decision as to eligibility or' suitability. We have recommended that: The Broadcasting Act 1942 be amended to provide that in a case where the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has determined that a person holding a particular interest in a licence ('the interestholder') is no longer eligible or suitable to hold that interest(a) the Tribunal be empowered to require that specified interests held by the interestholder be transferred to an independent trustee for sale; . (b) the specified interests be those which will sever the interestholder's connection with the licence with the minimum adverse effect on the operations of the licensee or any third party; (c) the trustee for sale be a person selected by the interestholder from a list of persons generally approved by the Tribunal to act as trustee, or a person approved by the Tribunal in the particular case; and (d) a decision of the Tribunal to require that specified interests be transferred to a trustee for sale not be subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I have dealt with the primary purpose of the supplementary report. Its secondary purpose is to expand on the trustee system by examining the efficiency and effectiveness of alternatives arid by providing detail on how the trustee system might work. This expansion on the trustee system is divided into two parts-alternatives to the trustee system and practical issues of the system. Chapter 5 of the 1988 Report dealt with ownership and control. One of the major concerns of the Committee was the inability of the Tribunal to supervise effectively changes in the ownership and' control of broadcasting licences. The Committee considered that a trustee system, modelled along the lines of that used by the Federal Communications Commission of the United States of America, would give the Tribunal the necessary power without unduly impeding the operation of the share market. A detailed set of recommendations, called the 'preferred package', which covered the trustee system and other matters such as hurdles for share transaction inquiries was made. The question is whether there is a simpler, quicker and less costly way 9f handling the present deficiencies identified in the main report. One alternative to the trustee system is to increase the staff resources of the Tribunal. The main report said that the 'heart of the problem lies with the Broadcasting Act'. It should be very clear therefore that the major deficiency in the present system is legislation. No amount of additional staff, and/or increases in Tribunal members, can correct this problem; can, to reverse the metaphor, stop the eggs from being scrambled. However quickly the Tribunal acts-and public accountability processes are not noted for their speed-it will not be quick enough. Without legislative changes, increases in staff would be unproductive and be wasteful of -.scarce public sector resources. In contrast, the trustee system solves the problem, corrects the deficiencies identified in the main report, and does not result in unproductive and wasteful Use of public sector resources. The Committee has concluded: as a means of correcting deficiencies in the existing ownership and control regime of commercial radio and television broadcasting licences, the trustee system is very superior to the alternative of increasing Tribunal resources because the trustee system is more effective, and, more efficient in the use of scarce public sector resources. The supplementary report discusses priority setting but acknowledges that even priority setting cannot tackle adequately major industry restructuring of the kind that took place in 1986-87, unless this is the only work the Tribunal undertakes for quite some time. What is needed in such circumstances is the appointment of associate members, appointed under section 11, and special contract staff. An appropriate recommendation has been made. . The second part of the expansion deals with practical considerations of the trustee system. Seven recommendations are made and they cover duties of the trustee, selection criteria and method of appointment. I highlight two recommendations, which provide: . . . for the appointment of a trustee who shall in specific cases hold the relevant shares or debentures of the applicant pending the completion of an inquiry by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. . . . that where the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal does not approve the transaction(a) the beneficial owner should have six months from the date of the Tribunal's decision (or the end of any cunsuccessful legal challenge to that decision) in which to negotiate an agreement for sale of the interests, on terms. able to it; and (b) if, at the end of six months, no agreement for sale has been made, the trustee should be under an obligation to accept the first offer that the trustee regards as fair and reasonable, after consultation with the beneficial owner. Before concluding there are several points I would like to make with regard to the work of the Committee. Taken together, the main report and this supplementary report represent the first comprehensive, major, public review of broadcasting regulation in Australia since the Green report, 'A Summary of Australian Broadcasting', of 1976. The two reports offer a structured, balanced, carefully argued case for the regulation of broadcasting. Both reports have received the support of all members of the Committee. All Government and Opposition members of the Committee have worked together harmoniously in a spirit of consensus in order to ensure the maximum credibility and impact of our reports. We have been ably assisted by our small secretariat.",31
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,AND INFRASTRUCTURE,Mr MiIdren)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,33
32,Mr DOWNER ,AND INFRASTRUCTURE,"Mayo) (11.32)-Perhaps I can complete the remarks of the honourable member for Aston ( Mr Saunderson), because I have a fair idea of what he was going to say. I therefore start my remarks by thanking the staff of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure on the excellent job they have done. I thank also Leo Grey, who was the consultant to the Committee in the preparation of this report, for the extremely capable work that he did. As the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, I strongly support the broad thrust of the supplementary report that the Committee has produced on the role and functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. I was also a strong proponent of the original report which the Committee produced and tabled in the Parliament a few months ago. I hope that, as time goes on, the Government will take these reports seriously, will examine them properly, and will move towards implementing a much more efficient and rational system of regulation of broadagreecasting generally in Australia than currently exists. As the honourable member for Aston, the Committee Chairman, pointed out, the trustee system, which this supplementary report refers to, was initially one of the recommendations of a major report that we tabled earlier this year. The trustee system is based onÂ· the United States system, which operates under the Federal Communications Commission. The trustee system here will significantly enhance, the power of the Tribunal, in It reasonable way, without impeding the marketplace. All members of the Committee strongly agreed that the current system simply did not work properly. It is a very inefficient regime, and one that comes close to making a mockery of the theoretical and legislative powers of the Tribunal. The Committee has taken the view that there is an enduring role for the l'ribunal in regulating broadcasting in Australia, although, not surprisingly, there are differences of view in the Committee on the degree of regulation needed. However, we all agree that there is. an enduring role for the Tribunal and feel that the current regulations in relation to ownership and control are substantially deficient. The honourable member for Aston referred to some of the alternatives we considered in order to improve the ownership and control regime on the part of the Tribunal. He pointed out that one of the alternatives considered was that of providing the Tribunal with more staff so that it could more readily process changes in ownership and control. Whilst it is true that more staff have that effect, I do not think it would make a significant difference. It would cost the taxpayer substantially more money and we would be left with a number of reasons why the work of the Tribunal would still labour very slowly. It is interesting to reflect on a number of instances when somebody has purchased a substantial shareholding in a particular comtrustee pany which holds a television licence. Althe though there are provisions in the Act for the Tribunal to give approval to that change of ownership over a period of just six months, repeated changes in the corporate structure of the purchasing company can lead to that approval process being dragged out over very long time. One could imagine that, the purchasing company were sufficiently ept at doing these things-and we never want to underestimate the capacity of corshareholder porate lawyers-it could stretch out the proval process for years. Clearly, that is satisfactory. We have to have a proper sysbe tem of approval if we are to have any system of approval at all. This report strengthens the original ommendation of the Committee by outlining in some detail how a trustee system would actually work. The report successfully shows that a trusteeship system can work; that trusteeship system can be an efficient system; that it can be administratively a fairly simple system; and that it can be a fair system. very much hope that the Government-and the Opposition-will take on board this supto plementary report, as well as the recommenabout dations of the original report, so that, said earlier, we can improve the overall manwill agement of broadcasting in this country. The report provides some very important detail. Chapter 2 of the supplementary reBroadcasting port talks about the selection and duties the trustee. The report addresses the issue of the selection of the trustee in a very cautious way, taking into account the desires and concerns of the purchaser. It outlines very clearly as well what the duties of the trustee should be, pointing out that perhaps the most important duty of the trustee in the first place is to safeguard the assets of the corporation involved in the purchase of the shares. Secondly, it points out-very importantly from the point of the broader commay munity-that the trustee will ensure the continuity of broadcasts, both in the circumstances in which a shareholding is being purchased and in the rather unlikely but possible circumstance in which a licensee or an owner is deemed to be ineligible or unsuitable to hold a licence. That is basically what the role of the trustee 'will be. Chapter 3 of the report outlines how the system, which does not apply just to purchase of an interest in a particular licence, will also deal with changes to existing interests in licences. For example, when the Tribunal determines that somebody is deemed ineligible and unsuitable, the interests of that company in the licence will pass a once more to the trustee to be disposed of. if The only point I want to make in relation adto that process is simply this: I want the trustee to be fully in consultation with the in the disposal, of those assets. apOnce the shareholder is deemed to be inelinot gible and unsuitable, the trustee should not able to say, 'I will decide how to dispose of your assets-so there'. The simple fact is ' that the owner of the shareholdings, the recowner of the assets,. ultimately should be able to' determine how he or she disposes of those assets. I do not believe that ultimately that is a matter for the trustee. The concern a of the trustee is only that the assets are disposed of, and disposed of within a reasonable period. That is an important point which II emphasise and it is referred to in the report, although perhaps it is not emphasised my satisfaction. That is all I wish to say the supplementary report, but I hope as I that the Government and the Opposition take up the imaginative and constructive recommendations of the Committee on the whole issue of trusteeship to make the Tribunal substantially more relof evant than is the case at present.",33
33,Mr SAUNDERSON ,AND INFRASTRUCTURE,"Aston) (11.41)-I wish to make a couple of further points. In respect of this report, the knowledge and expertise of the adviser, Leo Grey, proved to be most valuable. As Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure I' take pride in the fact that we have produced practical, realistic and appropriate recommendations which, if implemented, will ensure a more effective regulatory regime in broadcasting. Given that the Committee has led the way on reform in broadcasting, is it any wonder that honourable members are offended by the recent opportunistic attempts by the Â·Australian Democrats to steal the credit for our work. Senator Powell, like a true plagiarist, has stolen the idea and the justification for the change but gives no credit to the true authors. The Democrats have provided no original views on this issue.",34

35,Mr WRIGHT ,INDONESIA AND VIETNAM,"Capricornia)-by leave I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Indonesia and Vietnam from 18 January to 1 February 1989. In presenting the report I wish at the very outset to place on record the appreciation of delegation members of the assistance that was forthcoming from so many individuals who helped guarantee the success of this visit. From the very moment that the visit of the delegation was mooted, the assistance that was forthcOIp.ing from parliamentary and departmental officers was of the highest level, and r thank them sincerely. i particularly want to place on record the appreciation of the delegation to Dalma Dixon and Carol Richardson, and also Claire Brien who finally typed this report. Whilst we were in Indonesia and Vietnam and also briefly in Thailand the cooperation of the Australian Embassy staffs was beyond every expectation, and I want them to know that what they did was certainly appreciated. Likewise, the quality of the hospitality and the degree of support that was received from the officials of the countries that we visited was of the highest order. I believe .that was indicative. of the willingness at the political levels to ensure the success of the delegation's visit. .I wish to thank in particular Mr David Elder, the Secretary of the delegation, whose untiring dedication to his task was probably the greatest single contributor to the positive outcome of the visit. During my 20 years in State and Federal politics I have been part of a number of overseas delegations. I had that very special privilege. Each one has been very well organised and disciplined, and I believe that they have. been of major benefit to this country. The delegation to Indonesia and Vietnam was certainly no exception but, if anything, it reached a new height, a higher point, in terms of the teamwork and cooperation that characterised the delegation members. I pay special and personal tribute to the deputy leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Cook ( Mr Dobie). I add to this my thanks' to the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran) and also to South Australian Senator Chris Schacht. I thank each of them for the part they played in guaranteeing that our visit would achieve its objective of building and strengthening the relationships between this country and our South East Asian neighbours. The four members who made up that delegation, as honourable members would realise, come from different backgrounds. Each has special and different interests that he wants to pursue, and obviously holds different ideologies, coming from the National Party of Australia, the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Labor Party. The delegation members operated as a team. I believe that that cooperation and teamwork was matched only by the Queensland State of Origin rugby league side on Tuesday night when it thrashed the New South Wales blues. We certainly worked together in achieving our objectives. To those in the community who think that visits such as this are some sort of political junket for politicians, I urge that they read this report; I urge that they take time to go through every aspect of the report that has been prepared, because i- is a report that is characterised by its breadth, its depth and its all encompassing nature. The 14-day program sometimes began at 5 a.m. and continued late into the evening. It is a report of the in-depth discussions about Australian oriented issues with the most senior political leaders of two of South East Asia's most important countries-Indonesia. and Vietnam. It is a report that touches on trade, human rights, civil liberties, peace initiatives, future foreign relations, domestic policy, defence issues and the political structures of our countries. Whatever measure we use, whatever system we use to question what took place, the most critical observer would have to accept that the delegation was a major success. I am confident thatÂ· the outcome has already been seen, and it has already led to a better understanding between two of the countries. The report of the delegation makes 16 recommendations which we are convinced will add further to the relationship between these countries. In relation to Vietnam, the recommendations range from a specific oneoff issue, that is, the return of the Long Tan cross for presentation at the Australian War Memorial, to the need for a long-term program of joint economic ventures, particularly in agriculture, mirling and communications. In relation to Indonesia-and this is the aspect on which I wish to dwell-the report stresses the desirability of establishing a regular exchange program that involves young parliamentarians, business people, bureaucrats, administrators-people in every sphere of life-but particularly the journalists Â·of our countries. I believe there is enormous value in a wide exchange,Â· and I target the journalists because of some of the problems that exist between Indonesia and Australia in particular. In my opinion there has been a gross misunderstanding; I believe that, regrettably, there has been a distortion of the issues and the facts, and the reputation of both our countries has been harmed. I know that this situation goes back to the death of journalists in East Timor. I understand the attitude of some journalists who have pursued this issue, but as a. member of parliament who has a special friendship with Indonesia I urge that we put the past in the past, that we as Australians, particularly those in the journalism field, endeavour to embark upon a new future. I am convinced that Indonesia wants to be our friend, and it is time we put in the past and put in the rubbish can the constant reports that appear that Indonesia is some type of military threat. Over many years, over almost a quarter of a century since the Suharto regime came to power, Indonesia has established a stability that is unmatched in this world. President Suharto has set up an administration that has brought about peace and prosperity to 170 million Indonesians spread across some 13,660 islands. It is a prosperity that may not be equal to what we expect in Australia, but it is a far cry from the situation in the early 1960s under the Sukarno regime. The Indonesians have been. faced with a massive task of developing a nationalism, a unity of purpose and a oneness and I believe that they have achieved that. Yes, they have made mistakes, just as we have made mistakes, but for journalists who pursue a negative approach to constantly make out that Indonesia is a threat and that we ought to watch our backs and our northern borders does little for international relations. As I said, I understand the problems of some Indonesians who feel that Australia is different, just as I understand the attitude of Australians who believe that Indonesia is different. Yes, there are differences. We need to understand those differences but we need to expand upon the similarities. If ever there were a need right now itÂ· would be for journalists to go to each other's countries, to sit down and learn about each other and to write the facts. I urge those in the journalistic profession to think through the future for our countries. I 'ask them to take on board the comment that the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, Ali Alatas, made while he was in Australia. He said that a bit of vinegar should not ruin the whole bowl of milk. Whilst there has been a problem in the past, I believe that itÂ· is like that bit of vinegar; but the future relationships between our countries are the bowl of milk. We ought not to let the past ruin the future. I ask journalists to take upon themselves a special responsibility to promote the positive aspects, to examine the negative aspects, to present the truth and to ensure that they present what I believe is necessary to de. velop a closer relationship between our countries. If this is to happen I feel that the South Pacific, linked with South East Asia, will enter a new era of peace, stability and development. Again, I have much pleasure in bringing this report to the Parliament. I urge honourable members to read it as I believe that it will be extremely educational and will give them an understanding of the importance of building bridges between Australia, Indonesia and Vietnam.

36,Mr JOHNS ,KINGDOM,"Petrie) (11.52)-I move: That this House(I) acknowledges the political endurance of the Prime Minister of the United Kil1gdom, Margaret Thatcher, in having attained 10 years government; and (2) is appalled, however, at the policies which have delivered so many of her people into poverty and despair at the same time providing others with enormous wealth and power. Today I wish.to debate Margaret Thatcher's performance as Prime Minister of Britain. I do not want to couch my speech in too strong terms because I genuinely seek to evaluate that Government's performance and to make some comparisons with the performance of the Hawke Government. Mrs Thatcher has served the longest continuous term as Prime Minister in modern British history. She was elected in 1979 and re-elected in 1983 and 1987. It seems to me that her main agenda, oft stated, was to. kill socialism. In this debate I will maintain that she helped also to kill the prospects of half her nation. She killed public ownership, although she did not totally dismantle the welfare state. She killed off the trade union movement, although I must say that the trade union movement had acted so badly in Callaghan's era that it deserved a great deal of the medicine which she, in turn, gave it. There is much that she has left alone. For instance, looking at the expenditure figures on defence, social security, health and education, we see that these have not been torn asunder, as her rhetoric would indicate they have. In fact, she has left alone much that is central to the welfare state. She has improved to some extent the ability to retrain Britons, and we need to be grateful for that. Her Manpower Services Commission has now taken on full responsibility for school leavers in Britain. So at least there is some mechanism-a mechanism of the state, I might say-to enable school leavers to get into work. She also faced an agenda .that was somewhat similar to the Hawke Government's agenda when it first came to power in 1983. We, too, faced major conflict between some of the major players-the trade union movement and business. A theme of the Hawke 1983 campaign was that we would seek to achieve consensus and put conflict behind us. Margaret Thatcher has taken conflict and intensified it. When she entered government in 1979 there was great conflict and there were enormous prob1ems,but my central in argument is that she intensified that conflict. We have handled a similar agenda in a far different way and we have achieved far greater results. We have s01Jght, just as she has, to free up governmenCexpenditure to some extent to give room for new private investment. At the same time we know that we have to regenerate our manufacturing base to compete with the newly emerging nations. Britain had to do the same. Britain was in trouble; it was in a state of industrial decline; and, to some extent, Thatcher has helped to turn that around. I turn now to the cost of her policies. Let me quote from John Vincent's analysis of the Thatcher Government from 1979 to 1987. He states: Its central financial tenet was that a high-tax economy spelled stagnation and decline. Its central moral tenet was that people should get what they deserved, not what they needed. He goes on: . . . Mrs Thatcher instituted in 1975-80 was to give a moral meaning to latent anti-egalitarian feeling among thoseÂ· who had seen their differentials eroded. Of course, we remember that Maggie Thatcher is famous for the term 'social obligation-. After the disastrous high unemployment figures that were brought down through 1980 and 1981 in Britain, she was telling her people that those who had done well under Thatcher had a social obligation to those who had not done so well. She was really indicating, 'Now that I have given wealth to those at the top they should return some of that wealthÂ· to those who have not done so well'. So it instituted a very old system whereby the blue rinse set, the ladies at the charity dos, should pick a charity, raise some money and hand it on. The welfare state should not be used, as it had been used for many decades, in a consensus really between Labour and the Conservatives, to help those who are not so well off. Mrs Thatcher imposed a social obligation on those who had done well from her system, at the same time denying to millions of Britons the ability to compete in the system. That is theÂ· great tragedyÂ· of Thatcher's revolution. In fact, what we have is half a revolution. She is not to be blamed entirely for the decline of the industrial northern regions of Britain-that had been going on prior to World War 11but she intensified it. She did not allow those industries that were on their last legs at least to regroup, redefine and start to improve their performances. Our Ministers, such as the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business ( Mr Barry Jones) and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and others, have enabled our declining industries, such as steel and, more recently, coal, to negotiate a new deal between the trade unions and management. Jobs have been shed, people have to be retrained and new markets have to be found, but in the end, through negotiation, not through damning conflict, we find that some of our once weak industries are now beginning to return. We have not sought to impose that model upon the Australian people but to have all the major players participate in the good discussion that we have in this country that has enabled us, a little like, Margaret Thatcher, to turn around some of our ailing industries. Unfortunately, she has done it by division. She has used her immense power as Prime Minister of Britain simply to throw the trade union movement out of negotiations. Of course, there are those whose comments are entirely damning; Ido not wish to do that in this debate. I am trying to seek out threads of lessons that we might learn from Thatcher and that certainly she should learn from us. Peter Jenkins, a commentator, has started to paint Britain as a Third 'World country. He has listed all thos- domestic disasters of the last couple of years, such as the Hillsborough disaster, the Bradford football conflagration, the Clapham rail disaster, the Kings Cross underground fire and these sorts of things, as an illustration that there are some parallels. Whilst the south of Britain is doing very nicely, and has entered the New World or the New Age, much of the test of Britain is in decline. The analogy he draws is as follows: One is that very large numbers of people are involved. The second is that facilities or equipment are outdated, badly maintained, inadequate to the task. And thirdly, that usually they involved an ill-educated, undertrained people, poorly supervised and often poorly managed. I do not necessarily make a close association between Jenkins's statement and the dictates of Thatcherism, but it has to be said that the Prime Minister of England has to take responsibility for the decline in the ability of the public sector to give good service to her constituents. We have not overseen such decline. At the same time as renewing our industries we have not overseen a decline in public sector service and public sector goods in this country. Quality has been maintained, and probably improved. In Mrs Thatcher's case that is not what has happened. She has deliberately moved to take away the ability of the public sector in Britain to provide decent services to her people. I am suggesting that her agenda was similar to ours, but we have handled it in a totally different way. There is one thing that Margaret Thatcher set out to achieve much like Malcolm Fraser in his time. His first task was to beat inflation. To some extent Margaret Thatcher has done that. When she first became Prime Minister inflation was about 13 per ,cent, speaking from memory. In the first 18 months or so of her governance it rose massively to 22 per cent. We accept it is no use cutting off at a certain point and saying, 'That is the measure of your performance'. Inflation worsened dramatically but then it declined to two or three per cent. She had, it seemed, defeated inflation as Malcolm Fraser never did and never could. But we find that now more recently inflation has re-emerged and is running at about 8 per cent. For her massive dose of bad medicine it appears that Margaret Thatcher has not even conquered that most central of themes, that most central of objectives, that she set herself, which was to defeat inflation. The cost has been terrible. The cost has been that at one point in her reign three million Britons were unemployed. There are now something like two million Britons unemployed. We alI know in this country, from our experience, that once someone is unemployed for a significant period it is difficult to become re-established in the work force; it is difficult to pay off the debts which must be incurred; it is difficult to become re-established in a community which one has had to leave. One may have lost one's house and one's family through unemployment. It is not easy to re-establish things like the schooling of children. Mr Barry Jones-It is impossible in a declining world.",37
37,Mr JOHNS,KINGDOM,"Indeed. The whole intention of Australia and Britain in the last decade has been to take us into a new era of industrial strength. There were always going to be difficulties along the road, but the question is: Who has provided a more permanent solution? Thatcher has provided an impermanent solution for most of Britain and, perhaps, a permanent solution for some parts of Britain. We do not have the regional inequities in this country that exist in Britain, and we understand that. But for all her work on inflation Thatcher has not given the people of Britain an enduring low rate of inflation. What she has given them is an enduring level of conflict because so many of her people are unemployed. Mind you, she also had to face some rather peculiar and outmoded views on the part of the trade unions and we have not. The trade union movement in Britain had failed to renew itself, and had failed to think through the changes that were occurring in Britain. The miners' strike in 1984-5, led by Arthur Scargill, was perhaps the demise of the old trade union movement. I do not have any qualms about criticising that movement at that time-although the trade union movement was also finding it extremely difficult to deal with management at that time. Contrast that disaster, which Thatcher intensified, with the ability of the Hawke Government to deal with our coal mines, our steelworks, our people in the clothing and footwear industry, our metal workers and our vehicle builders. On each occasion the Government has said to the trade union movement, 'Sit beside us and work out a solution. Part of the solution will be that we will have to shed labour, so we will write redundancy packages. Part of ,the solution is that we will have to move labour from one plant to another, so we will help you' do that. Part of the solution is that we must lift the quality of our production. Part of the solution is that we might have to change some of our work practices. Part of the solution is that we might have to deny ourselves real wage increases in the short term in order to give ourselves a'ibreak and compete more readily on an international market'. All of those things can only occur through enduring debate. It takes a couple of years. For instance, I was at a meeting yesterday with the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia and representatives from General MotorsHolden's and Ford. They have been working together now for two years to provide solutions to all of those problems. Perhaps for Thatcher it was too late. In 1979 I suspect that she simply saw an enormous amount of conflict, and a failure on the, part of previous Tory and Labour governments to deal with the whole industrial relations area, so she went for broke. She sought to use legislative power, the media and the stupidity of those who were negotiating in the coal industry, among others, to' break the trade union movement. The legacy of that is that although on the upside there are some good things to come out of Britain-there are some vital and productive industries-will those changes be enduring when there is no longer confidence between the Trade Union Congress and the trade union movement at all levels and management, when there is no more dialogue between the trade union movement and the Thatcher Government? I suggest that some of the wins along the way will be ephemeral, because how can they be sustained when one of the greatest parts of the work force has been disengaged from tpe whole process? It is not invited into debate and discuss, to learn or to teach. Here, central to the Hawke Government and our great task of revitalising our industries, is the acceptance of the trade union movement as having an important input. Our trade union movement has renewed itself, and, in renewing itself, has brought itself to the negotiating table and is now a leader in the debate about award restructuring and, by implication, industry restructuring. I suggest we have a great many lessons to give to Margaret Thatcher. My final comment concerns those who criticise unfairly. I am thinking, in particular, of our good friend Des Keegan, of the Australian. Des is an avowed conservative. He was very excited about Margaret Thatcher's performance. He wrote an article in the Australian headed, 'Maggie may be misunderstood but Thatcherism is loud, clear and thriving'. Des Keegan acknowledges that Thatcher has some problems but, of course, because he is on her side, he is quite willing to allow that she has made some mistakes. He says in the article: The economy is coming about, sectionally, regionally, but, none the less, fairly surely. Industry is beginning to invest in manufacturing and that is where. wealth will be created and jobs will appear. It will also redress the balance of payments deficit, given time by foreign lenders. I wonder whether Des Keegan will give our Government time, because we, too, have significant problems with the balance of payments. That is acknowledged. I believe that that would be true in any modern economy which seeks to renew itself and which must suck in foreign investment. So, Des Keegan and those who agree with all he stands for are quite willing to give Margaret Thatcher's Britain a chance. They are quite willing to acknowledge that current account deficits will be running for some years-but that it is all in a good cause. I might suggest that our current account deficit is also in a good cause. In 1979 the current account in Britain was about half a billion pounds. It is now somewhere near Â£15 billion. We must contrast that performance. If any country has gone into debt, it is Margaret Thatcher's Britain. I do not damn her entirely for that, but those who support her should apply to Bob Hawke's Australia the same rules of analysis that apply to Margaret Thatcher's Britain. Ms Crawford-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",39
38,Mr CADMAN ,KINGDOM,"Mitchell) (12.12)-The previous speaker, the honourable member for Petrie ( Mr Johns), made a comparison between the Australian and British economies,and concluded his remarks by saying that everything the Australian Labor Party was doing was all in a good cause. However, the Government will have to go a long way to convince the Australian community that it is not simply running a radio program with a title like that but is actually doing something for their benefit. Today we should be debating some of the great difficulties of the Australian economy-not giving advice to Margaret Thatcher. Margaret Thatcher is one world leader who certainly does not need gratuitous advice from a failed government. What we should be debating is some of the statements that have been made by people such as the Treasurer. ( Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke)-getting some explanation of the implications for the Australian people. I refer to the following statement made by the Prime Minister following the Western Australian election: All I can say is that my economic intellectual framework within which I was speaking was one which was, in regard to the key indicator of expected inflation outcomes, significantly more optimistic than in fact turned out to be the case. Explain that to the Australian people! Nobody understands it. What the Prime Minister is saying is that he lied before the Western Australian election and told the Australian community that interest rates would falland then, quite predictably, they did not fall. When the Prime Minister was asked why they kept rising, he said, 'I was not really asked whether they would rise first before they then fell'. He explains away that unintelligible statement, which relates to something that has affected every Australian since the Western Australian election, by saying that it was about something that he was not asked about. What a crazy idea it is to give advice to Thatcher when the Australian economy is on the rack. The people of Australia, the home buyers and average wage earners, are suffering. Paul Keating expressed his view of these factors when he was talking on the John Laws program on 1 February about the housing crisis in Australia. John Laws asked him for an explanation of the problem and the Treasurer replied: . . . when you see someone in Sydney in a house with a block of land, with the backyard swimming pool, the rotary hoist, the ground in front . . . that person sitting on that block of land and insisting that no other development is AOK for Sydney, they're the people who are driving up house prices . . . not the government. What a put-down of the average Australian family. Not everybody has a swimming pool, but everyone has a Hills hoist and everyone has a block of land at the front of the house. Australia has one of the highest home ownership rates in the world. Yet here we have the Treasurer being critical of people for having the aspiration, the wish, the goal, to own their own home. We are not debating that today; we are giving faint-hearted advice to Margaret Thatcher's Government. What is wrong with the Australian. Labor Party? Why will it not face the issues of the day? Why do honourable members opposite seek to skate away from the real issues that confront the Australian people? Why do they not debate the substance of this quotation from Mr Hawke in the Australian Financial Review of 28 February 1989, for example? Mr Hawke said: What we want to see is that ordinary Australians have increased standards of living. I give this mitment, unqualifiedone of many unqualified commitmentsthat in this period ahead as a result of wages and taxes, their standards will improve. That is they need, that is what they deserve, that is will deliver. In this coming financial year, there be an improvement in standards, resulting from cuts and wage increases and taking that into account with inflation. Explain that to the Australian people-that gobbledegook, those promises, that pie in sky! On 1 March this year, Mr Hawke said: I hope that out of the summit we will be able establish for people . . . a situation where won't be facing high land prices which are causing difficulties at the moment. That was a quote from the Australian of that date. In 1983, the Hawke Government came to power offering hope. 'It is still ing hope-but no substance. The GovernWhen ment has been hoping for seven years for something to turn up. We ought to erect a hope-meter, because the Treasurer and the Prime Minister appear to be trying to outbid each other in the hopes that they are exUS95c, pressing to the Australian people-with more and more extravagant hopes being offered. They are trying to outbid each other with wishful thinking. All that the Australian people have copped from the Labor Party a whole bunch of wishful thinking. We have had the wish list and the hope list-and the Prime Minister was going on with it at the housing conference. He hopes that things will happen: he sounds like Uriah Heep. Nothing has turned up for the Australian people. The Australian people are fering. I think we ought to make a comparison real results in the United Kingdom with those under the Hawke Government. In the United Kingdom, real take-home pay has increased by one-third in 10 years-not wages, but the real money in people's pockets. Real personal disposable income is at a record level. It has increased by 5 per cent in the past year. The United Kingdom unemployment rate is below the European average. Employment is rising: nearly three million jobs have been provided in the United Kingdom. Self-employment in the United Kingdom has risen. Output per hour has risen over the past 10 years. In fact, it is comhigher than that in Japan. One can thus go through the statistics of achievement of the Thatcher Government. Let us now look at the position in Auswhat tralia and see the results of the. Australian what we Labor Government for the seven years it has will been in office. First, let us consider home tax interest rates. Remember Malcolm Fraser? Everybody thought that poor old Malcolm was not doing any good ana so they voted him out of office. However, Malcolm Fraser's the Government had home interest rates at 12.5 per cent. Today, banks are thinking of raisto ing interest rates to 16.5 per cent and 17 per they cent. What a great achievement for seven years! And those opposite are offering advice to the Thatcher Government!Â· Bankcard interest rates were 18 per cent. They are n0""l' somewhere between 22 and 23 per cent--=offerunder the Hawke-enlightened Government. Fraser went out of office our foreign debt was $24.3 billion, while today it is $130 billion. As to our exchange rate, let us com- . pare Australia with America. When Fraser went out the Australian dollar was worthwhile at the moment it is at US74c. That is a reflection of what the rest of the world thinks of the Hawke Government. Personal income tax for a single income earner was $85 per week when Fraser went is out of office; it is now $146 per week. A single income family, with mum and the kids still at home, was taxed $65 per week when Fraser went out of office; it is now $126 per week. Under Fraser the percentage of income needed to make home repayments was 19.2 per cent; it has risen to 30.7 per cent still sufof average weekly earnings. Let us look at bankruptcies. The Thatcher of Government is creating thriving private enterprise and employment. Under Malcolm Fraser bankruptcies averaged 4,700 per year. Under Hawke and. Keating they average 7,100 a year. Record-breaking bankruptcies have been caused by this Government. On average tax collection by the Hawke Government is around $60 billion. This is our money into the Government's pocket in the years that it has been in office. Under Malcolm Fraser tax collections were $28 billion, under half that collected by the Hawke Government. Let me refer to Commonwealth spending. Malcolm Fraser spent an average of about $37 billion a year; Bob Hawke and Paul Keating are spending $69 billion a year. The spending of our money has risen from $37 billion to $69 billion and then the Hawke Government claims that it can give advice to the Thatcher Government. I have never heard anything so ridiculous. If we compare the results, it is patently clear that this Government is not performing. It needs to reduce the mauling of the Australian community by higher and higher tax claims; it must restore more money to the Australian people; real incomes must increase; it must cut its own expenditure; it must get off the backs of the Australian people and in that way reduce interest rates. Union control of the Government must cease. We are sick of Mr Kelty and his mob running the Government. It is not a cooperative effort as the unions are telling the Government what it should do. It is not a cosy discussion group that is held from time to time. The cosy discussion group is a process 'Yhereby the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the union leaders of Australia tell this Government what they will accept and, if the Government does not accept it, then that is a problem. The unions have. control of Australia. Unions are sensible for employees, but they do not run countries. The Government has to get out of some of those businesses that are run so badly by bureaucrats and return them to the Australian people. Let the Government buy shares in some of these Australian enterprises, let them become efficient and profitable as they have in the United Kingdom. I want to conclude by talking about community attitudes. I have taken a little care to get information about community attitudes to the Thatcher Government and the Hawke Government. They are quite different. The attitudes to the Hawke Government are that Australians are really concerned about the tax regime and inflation. If honourable members look at any survey they will see that two-thirds of the community are concerned about those two factors alone. On the other hand, in the United Kingdom people are not concerned about those factors. Ten years ago they were concerned about union control, but only 30 per cent of Britons are worried about the unions. Eightyeight per cent used to be worried about the unions, but the figure has fallen to 31 per cent. They are not concerned about where their next crust is coming from because there has been a real increase in living standards. In the seven years that the Hawke Government has been in office it has not provided that for Australians. We should look through a scale of community attitudes on controlling inflation, on taxation levels, on killing incentive, on union control by Kelty and his gang, or on young people. Let us look at the young people in both Australia and Britain. Young Australians say that the economy is heading in the wrong direction; they say that taxation is heading in the wrong direction. Young Britons are saying that they agree with what Mrs Thatcher is doing. I am not putting the proposition that the coalition will do what Mrs Thatcher has done but I am saying, 'Let us deal with Australian problems instead of giving advice to Mrs Thatcher about her union movement'. The Britons are happy; the Australians are not. It is time that the Government went to Bankstown and to the western suburbs of Melbourne and found out how the average Australian feels. This Government is arrogant and overbearing. It is run by people who are remote from the real needs of Australians and Australians are telling them that. Their attitude is that they have had enough of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-they want an alternative. The British people are content and will continue to vote in a government of which they approve. The Australian people. will vote out a government which they despise and which offers nothing but hope-and has offered nothing but hope for seven years.",40
39,Mr BARRY JONES ,KINGDOM,"Lalor-Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business) (12.25)-As there are a few moments before theÂ· adjournment of the debate, I thought I might make a small contribution to the motion moved by the honourable member for Petrie ( Mr Johns). It is too early to formÂ· a considered historical judgment on Mrs Thatcher's Government. She has already served for a decade as Prime Minister, having been the first British political leader since Viscount Palmerston to win three consecutive general elections. There are two or three years to go before she needs to face the electors next. She has, as all agree, an extraordinarily forceful personality and has certainly changed the shape of British society and industry more, I would think, than any other civilian Prime Minister in the twentieth century. I think that some of her achievements must be recognised-her achievement in transforming some industries, not without pain, has been real. Ian MACGregor's role in reorganising the steel industry was enormous. In a few years it was transformed from being one of the world's least efficient steel industries ....,. .that is to say least efficient in a major economy-to being more productive than the steel industry in the United States and Europe. I think it is true that the degree of productivity is actually higher than Japan. It is a real achievement. There were and are some significant areas of weakness. For example, there is no doubt that the very traditional historical attitude to education in Britain in some ways has fallen behind our record. I think we have achieved a very significant social revolution in changing the number of young people who complete year 12 and go on to tertiary education. When we came to office in the beginning of 1983 there were about 36 per cent of young people who completed year 12. The estimated figure is now 58 per cent. That is a very marked change. In Britain the figures have been much more static and there is no doubt that, so far as tertiary education is concerned, even though there has been the development of some new tertiary institutions, particularly an increase in the number of polytechnics in the last few years, the number of people who enter tertiary education in Britain is still significantly lower than our number and that the historical elements of class bias are still there. Back in the nineteenth century Disraeli expressed a fear that Britain would be polarised in what he called 'the two nations'the privileged and the people-and that there would be a geographical division. We do not have that geographical division here. We have problems with dispersal because of the nature of the States and the urban aggregations in the capitals, but in Britain there is an unresolved problem about the conditions in the south and south-east where the condition of life is very good. In Scotland, Wales the north area and part of the Midlands the conditions are very serious and, I believe, deteriorating.",42
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,KINGDOM,"Mr MiIdren)-Order! It being 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with sessional order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA Consumer Debt-Pineapple IndustryRoad Funding-Child-Care-Veterans, War Widows and Ex-Service Personnel: Entitlements-Economy-Employment Growth-Australian Telecommunications Corporation-Banking Industry Question proposed: That grievances be noted. EmptyHere Treasurer ( Mr Keating) referred last week to the fact that Australia was living in the fast lane after yet another disastrous balance of payments figure. I have to say that that was a slight improvement on the line he tried to sell last year, when he said the ecohbmy was effervescing like an overflowing glass of champagne. I suggest it was an improvement this time only because it was nearer the truth, although not in the way the Treasurer would have us believe. Many Australians are living in the fast lane, but they are not celebrating. It is all downhill and there is no off-ramp. They are the thousands of Australians who carry the burden of consumer debt as a millstone around their necks. It is time we faced up to this serious social and economic problem. Consumer debt ranks alongside our gross foreign debt, our trade deficit, inflation and record interest rates as yet another of this country's economic disasters. ItÂ· is a disaster because an increasing number of individuals cannot pay their debts. In February this year the Reserve Bank of Australia reported that consumer debt was running at a staggering $40.8 billion. That is approximately $12,500 per average Australian family, not including housing loans. Why is consumer debt sudcredit denl- a major issue? Why are we only now startmg to look closely at the statistics? It because the personal debts of Australians h-ve been hidden from view, supposedly behmd false returns made by irresponsible fiof nancial institutions. While authorities such as the Reserve Bank h!\,ve reported consumer debt running at a steady $23 billion since 1985, the problem has been spreading like cancer. Now we know that individual debt, run up on bank and finance company perlast sonal loans and credit and department store charge cards, is adding significantly to community debt burden. More people are turning to the doubleedged sword of bankruptcy to escape their debt problems. Non-business consumer bank-uptcies in Australia increased by 34 per cent I- 1987-88 before authorities began to recogmse the real depth of the problem. Victoria recorded the biggest rise of 47 per cent, followed ,by Queensland 39 per <;ent Tasaddition, mania 38 per cent and New South Wales and the - ustralian Capital Territory 35 per cent. Behmd the cold, hard statistics are sad stories of many Australians who are in the fast lane and are reaching a dead end. People have turned to debt in search of the wonderful standard of living the Prime ister ( Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer have boasted they hav- created for this country, only to find that It does not really exist, they have been conned. The rea.lity is --at the standard of living of Austrahan families has been decimated by this Government. While the Treasurer has get taken more and more in taxes from Austrareally li-ns, - ustralians are borrowing just to surVlve. Smce 1984-85, the spending power for a couple with four children has fallen by $48 a week and by $32 for single people. Over the same period, the Government has taken . an additional $58 a week in personal income tax. Because people are getting less money credit-when in their hands in real terms they are borrowalways a cost. ing to supplement their incomes. They then have to find extra income to repay that debt. The Treasurer's tight monetary policy is compounding the debt because the borrower is forced t6 pay higher interest ,rates to repay that debt. For example, the interest on Bankcard, one of the most common forms of card facilities, is now 23 per cent. The trend towards credit-card marketing has made is quick fix solutions readily available in attractive packages. The worse of it is that young people have been caught up in the euphoria consumer debt. I would like to quote from some newspaper articles on this issue. An article in the Daily Telegraph of this year is headed 'Child 11, in Credit card spree'; the a - anberra Times, 'Debt up 100 pc to $25b 10 past 7 years'. The Canberra Times again year highlighted a particular case where a 22-year-old had been granted a personal the loan to buy a motor vehicle while already - aving a loan of $7,000 and a gross weekly mcome of only $260 to pay that debt. This country's future is in the hands of a generation of credit card addicts. Young people aged between 15 and 25 spend between $4 billion and $8 billion a year on consumer items. More than 39 per cent have used credit cards at some time or other. In 68 per cent of young people under 19, of whom 8 per cent are aged under 16 have used credit cards. Sixteen per cent of the all young people have a department store .. credit card; 17 per cent of these people were aged 16 and under when they were issued with the card. In Victoria, the 'Charge It' Minreport by the youth and credit task group last month reported that the youngest person identified w-s aged 11. The report supported that the concl.uslon that people were having to rely on mcreased debt to maintain living standards. I should like to quote from that report. One of the respondent's states: . It seems as if the whole gist behind the cards is to people to buy, buy, buy-often things they don't need because it's so easy to put things on credIt when you don't have to pay 'til later. Credit cards give you power, also a bad headache. It's easy to use and hard to pay back. Young people rarely. understand the obligations mvolved when purchasmg goods and services on you use other people's money thete is I was buying goods without really wanting to using them. While a car was a major credit purchase for young people 15 years ago, the situation drastically different today. The majority young people using credit cards are purchashold ing non-durable items such as clothing. Some 95 per cent of store card users buy nonGovernment durables. For credit cards the figure is per' cent, for finance companies 38 per cent and for personal loans 34 per cent; are not small debts. Some 28.8 per cent of young people owe between $2,000 and $5,000 on personal loans and 10 per cent owe more than $10,000. In addition, 24 per cent of young people with credit cards owe between $500 and $1,000. While 25 per cent with department store charge cards owe between $200 and $500. Let us compare that figure with the situation 10 or 15 years ago, when young people were content with pocket money or they did part time work to save in order to buy consumer goods. In the end, bankruptcy is the inevitable course for' many of them. Young people aged between 18 and 25 Queensland, account for an alarming 17 per cent of bankincreases ruptcies in Australia. If they are lucky enough to stave off bankruptcy, it will take them years to pay back $1,000 of credit at a minimum monthly rate. Clearly, our credit laws are inadequate. Although they vary from State to State, most of them do not prevent young people under 18 from being issued dustry. with credit cards. While banks generally require a guarantor, most department stores smaller boutiques, for example, do not quire proof of age or a guarantor. A disturbfarm ing example of the inadequacy of the laws the'right of stores to increase credit limits without being asked and without prior perwith mission of the guarantor. Most States have some form of consumer credit legislation. These protect the contry sumer by stipulating contract agreements and. providing machinery to regulate disputes. Commonwealth Trade Practices Act gives the victims of misleading or deceptive duct some form of redress. What is clearly needed is uniform national legislation or guidelines backed by education programs in schools. Y'/e need to act quickly if the out in consumer debt is to be reined in. The impact on the economy cannot be tolerated or in the present climate. Apart from the social implications of consumer debt, any restructuring of the economy is put at risk by the is adverse impact on the balance of payments, of as consumers rush to buy imported housegoods, clothing and other imports. In view of that threat, I am astounded that this has not made consumer debt an 77 urgent priority. If it does not show more urgency, there will be an inevitable crash in and these the Treasurer's fast lane.",43
41,Mr WRIGHT ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Capricornia) (12.40)-1 bring to the attention of the House the threat to the Queensland and, in turn, the Australian pineapple industry of the ever increasing imports into this country of canned pineapple products, particularly from the Philippines and Thailand. In doing so I acknowledge the importance of promoting an even playing field in international markets. I quickly recognise the value to Australia of breaking down the tariff and trade barriers that prevent our own products from being exported. I also appreciate the major gains that could be achieved for central the area. I represent, because of in exports of coal, meat and sugar, and in other regions of wheat. Just as it has 10 been recognised that there is still a need to protect the sugar industry, and I believe in your own electorate, of Ballarat, Mr Deputy Speaker, the clothing industry, there is now a need to protect the nation's pineapple inThere are only 550 farmers in this indus';j or try, which is not a lot. Only about 2,000 reworkers are involved in the processing and aspects of the industry. To those one is could add the transport people, the railway employees. I suppose in all we are dealing about 4,000 livelihoods, but that is 4,000 Australians. The industry is worth approximately $150m a year. It is a domestic induswhere the vast bulk of the production is sold locally. Last year 131,000 tonnes went The through the Brisbane Northgate Golden Circle cannery. The pineapples produced are conworth about $240 a tonne to the growers. The direct return to growers is some $34m, to which one can add the value of the fresh fruit production, the wages for 3,000 to 4,000 blowpeople, which is another $70m, and the transportation earnings. In Queensland, just sending pineapples from my own electorate in central Queensland to Brisbane is worth about $500,000 to the Queensland railways, and that does not take into account the transportation of domestic pineapples, fresh fruit, going to the retail markets in the south. One could add to that the value to this country of the 10,000 tonnes of pineapples that were exported last year. The problem is a very simple one. This country is being targeted by those who have taken over pineapple production in thecountries I mentioned, particularly Thailand and the Philippines-Mr JulI-And Indonesia.",45
42,Mr WRIGHT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Yes, but very small numbers in Indonesia. We could add to that the industries in 'Faiwan and China. I accept that, but there we are talking of very small quantities. I accept also the need to help developing countries, or DCs as we call them, to ensure that they can improve their quality of life. If one takes the case of the Philippines, the pineapple in.dustry there is not run by the filipinos; it is run by the Americans, the multi-national Dolan Damontes, who left Hawaii because of the costs of production and went to the Philippines. They are paying $3.60 a day to the filipinos to produce this product and then, in my word, dumping it on the Australian market. In 1983 we had 9,000 tonnes of fresh fruit equivalent-this is tonnages of pineapples that one measures out to produce it in terms of canned weight. There were 9,000 tonnes of fresh fruit pineapples in 1983. In 1987-88 it grew to 20,000 tonnes. In the first nine months of this financial year it has already reached 20,000 tonnes. If one does a quick calculation, that means it will be 25,000 or 26,000 tonnes by the end of that 12-months period. I suggest that this country is being flooded by the pineapple products of the Philippines and Thailand particularly. They are undercutting Australian producers by 20 per cent to 40 per cent. In stores such as Franklins, Coles and Woolworths a 450 gram tin of the Australian produced product sells for 60c to 70c and the imported product sells at 40c to 50c. How can those firms do it? It is because they are getting this product at lower cost through cheap labour in another country. In doing so they are threatening the livelihoods of people in this nation. The retailers ought to re-think their purchasing policies. Recently there was a case where Walton, an American billionaire, called upon the managers of all his retail outlets to buy American products where they are ayailable. Whilst we have made an appeal to Au'stralian consumers to buy Australian, I believe it is time that that appeal was extended to retailers like Franklins, Myers, Coles, the K-Mart stores and all the other independents to start buying Australian products to sell. They ought to give preference to Australian-made products. I believe that, whilst that would help, the ultimate answer has to come back-in the short term, at least-to quotas. I know that we have this attitude of saying, 'Break down the barriers-set the playing field as even as possible so we ourselves can export', but unless we do something to protect this industry, we will continue to challenge and threaten the livelihoods of thousands of people and we will cost this country millions of dollars. We need quotas. They have been seen to work in other areas. They cannot be quotas just made up of certain tonnages. Let us link them to tariffs. Let us come up with a two-part tariff system, as we did with the clothing industry, where we set a quota, an amount of goods that can come in at a certain rate, but over and above that there is a penalty tariff rate. I believe that in the short term-and I stress the words 'short term' because things may change as we are able to make our own industry more efficient, as we are able to tool up and develop export markets ourselves-we must protect our pineapple industry. That industry is worth $150m and thousands of jobs. By allowing these products to come into this country we are not only threatening the potential to export but also causing further problems for our imbalance of payments and .our overseas debt. There is also a need for a review of the tariffs for what we call the developing countries. I just do not believe that Taiwan, with its high quality of income per individual, is really a developing country. It is like the nonsense with some of the Arab countries, where they are classed as developing countries in terms of petrochemical products. What nonsense! I think there is a need to review what the developing countries list is all about. Certainly, Taiwan should be taken off that list and where it is known that products are coming from countries that are not really developing countries in terms of the benefit to the locals, such as the Philippines and Thailand, then I believe that that tariff reduction that we give to the DCs ought to be reviewed. 1 acknowledge the need to ensure that our own industry is efficient. I accept the fact that we can look at ourselves'very closely in that industry-although the pineapple indus- . try certainly is efficient in terms of production and processing. But we need to head off the escalation in the dumping of pineapple products, particularly by the Americans via Thailand and the Philippines. It may well be that we will have to allow up to 10,000 tonnes to come. It may be we even have to. go to last year's figures of 20,000 tonnes, that is where it has to stop. If it does not we will face a major threat. At the moment 18,000 tonnes of pineapples-worth $5m or $6n1-are still in the fields in Queensland. Those pineapples are lost. They cannot be picked and put back into the domestic market because that would destroy that market. Anyway, the cost of picking them would not be worth the return. That crop will be lost. People are starving in this world, yet food like that is just being wasted. The pineapple cannery simply cannot use the product because of the import competition that is coming through Franklins stores, K-Mart, Coles and other supermarkets. I think that fair is fair; the time has corrie to. do something about it. There was an inquiry by the Industries Assistance Commission (lAC) back in 1981-82. Perhaps .we need another reference. I am not sure that the lAC always achieves the best for some of our primary industries because of the approach that is sometimes taken. It does not always look at the socio-economic consequences of communities. But still it may be worthwhile looking at another reference back to the lAC. But, most importantly, there is a need right now for the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, to sit down with the processors and the farmers and talk this issue through. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has been to Northgate and I appreciate what. he has done in that instance. Also, I am very muchÂ· aware of what the local member has done on this issue. But we now need to try to sort out this problem, otherwise there will be a threat to thousands of livelihoods. Some 550 small communities of farmers could be wiped out and $150m lost to this economy. 'Quotas' may be a bad word at the moment, but there are times when these ought to be established and held. This is certainly one instance when we should have a base quota on a certain amount of pineapplesand I argue for a 10,000--onne limit-and then a penalty rate tariff for anything over and above that. I argue again, I stress, I reiterate: unless this is done we shall wipe out a very important primary industry-a very efficient industry that has been built but over many, many years-and lose thousands of jobs in this country.",46
43,Mr MCARTHUR ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Corangamite) (12.49)- Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to draw the House's attention to the matter of road funding and the difficulty faced by road users and local councils in road construction because of the lack of funds provided by the Federal Government. This big spending Labor Government has increased outlays from a base of $44.7 billion in 1982-83 to $87.4 billion in 1988-89. In simple terms, this Government has doubled the outlays, yet in that context the bicentennial road funding program has remained constant. In my electorate of Corangamite; we are getting very strong comments from locaf councillors and road users that the Federal Government has not fulfilled its commitment to road funding. Councillors, motorists and road users are very concerned about the state of the roads in my electorate and throughout Australia. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table of figures relating to the bicentennial funding program. The figures were supplied by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) in answer to a question on notice. The Minister has agreed to the incorpQration. Leave granted. The table read as followsExpenditure under Federal roads assistance programs since 1980-81, in both nominal and real terms, has been: Federal road expenditure 1980-81 to 1988-89 Nominal Terms ($m), 1988-89 ($m) Prices) 1980-81 628.0 1,154.1 1981-82 658.0 1,130.2 1982-83 850.9 1,264.6 1983-84 1195.2 1,663.8 1984-85 1244.7 1,633.9 1985-86 1250.0 1,533.1 1986-87 1250.0 1,427.0 1987-88 1250.0 1,325.0 1988-89 1221.5 (I) 1,221.5 (I) (I) Budget allocation. Includes the Australian Capital Territory. (2) Real Terms calculations are based on implicit price deflator for gross non-farm product.",47
44,Mr MCARTHUR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"This table clearly inlot dicates that bicentennial road funding was doubled in round terms between 1980-81 when it was $680m and 1983-84 when it was $1,195m-nearly $1.2 billion. If we follow the figures through to 1988-89 we see that this year's figure still remains at $1. lion-that is the key element. No amount of distorting the figures or changing the view can alter the fact that funding for the bicenwill tennial road program has remained constant in money terms and therefore in real terms it has dropped between 30 and 40 per cent. Let us look at the overall road funding program, which is complex in relation to the local, State and Federal contributions. simple terms, the Federal Government, State governments and local government each contribute about one-third to make up a total tion contribution of $4.4 billion. In the Barwon region, where statisti- have been compiled on this, the State contributes 34 per cent, the Federal Government contributes 28 per cent and local government contributes 37 per cent. Of course, there is a considerable amount of debate about the road cateuse? gories-national highways for which the Federal Government has a responsibility, ban arterial, rural arterial and local roads. Because of change of' use, the category guments cause a lot of concern to those authorities which have to make the judgarea. ments and the allocations. Realistic assessments have to be made the basis that the national highways take about 8 per cent of travel throughout tralia. The rural arterial roads constitute about 28 per cent of travel use. Urban arteReal Terms (2) rial roads have about 40 per cent of the use of traffic, whereas they constitute about one per cent in length because of the vast nature of the Australian continent. Local roads constitute about 23 per cent of traffic use. Local government officers have made the interesting observation to me that 85 per cent of road length is under the jurisdiction of local government. Roads in Australia move about 70 per cent of domestic freight and it is estimated that that will increase by 50 per $6.5 million for cent by the year 2000. Road construction in Victoria is a matter the of some concern. In my local area the design was estimated to last 25 to 40 years, but under the present funding arrangements a of local roads will not be reconstructed for 70 years. For instance, in the shire of Colac the sides of the roads are now being graded to make sure that their foundations remain true and intact. The basic structure is being kept in the hope that the funding 2 bilprogram will change. Of course, with all those roads that are more than 25 years old, maintenance is an escalating problem and continue to be so unless we address this difficulty. Vehicle loads are increasing-double-deck stock carriers, B-double trucks and 42-tonne semitrailers bring very much greater loads onto the sides of roads and severely test the load bearing capacity of roads that In were designed 20 or 30 years ago. Also, community standards require better roads. The basic dilemma facing road construcauthorities is the true cost of this infrastructure. The transport industry is very competitive, as we all know, and the cost of rail versus road has never been really carefully costed out. In this competitive situation do the transport operators pay the true and competitive cost of the infrastructure they In the Barwon region where the local council produced the pamphlet Roadwork urNetwork Facts, it put the arguments very clearly on behalf of all the local councils. arThis document sets out for members of the public how the council sees the road in that Of course, this can be applied to the rest of Australia. The council suggests that on the roads are a community asset and should be regarded as such. It advocates a change Ausin priority of funding-that roads should move' up the scale and receive funding from the Federal Government, the State Government and local government sources. In the Geelong area there are 4,000 kilometres of roads which are estimated to be worth $850m in terms of capital assets. The problem that the council puts forward in the pamphlet is that there is no simple solution to maintaining the roads and continuing ongoing funding arrangements, especially in relation to road accidents. The difficulties that we face in Victoria are duplicated around Australia. In 1987, 700 people died in Victoria and 23,000 people were injured. The Road Construction Authority-the RCA-estimates that the road environment contributed to about 33 per cent of those accidents. In my electorate I have a very concerned councillor of the shire of Leigh, Councillor Kevin Blake, who is a persistent and vocal supporter of increased road funding. He represents one of those rural shires which have a number of roads running through them for which funding is hard to come by-from both State and Federal sources. He has put a submission to the Victorian Road Construction Authority suggesting that road maintenance be completed on schedule and that roads on which repairs are started should not be left up in the air, which is so often the case under this present Government. He has also suggested that new works should be started and completed, with funding available throughout the whole project; and that roads should be reclassified according to a change in use. In rural Victoria, with heavier transport and with faster vehicles taking short cuts, some of the country roads need reclassifying and upgrading. Councillor Blake, along with his colleagues in all thC? other rural shires, suggests that the three tiers of mentÂ·Â·maintain their proportion of contributions to road works. I would like to refer the Parliament to the letter sent by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support to all municipalities throughout Australia defending the Government's position in relation to road funding. He conveniently overlooks the point that I made earlier-that the bicentennial road funding remains at $1.2 billion. In this letter,which the Minister sent out to 850 councils, he complains that road users have been running a propaganda campaign to support road funding; he talks about 20,000 brochures and how terrible it is that the road users should even put their case. He goes on with some very misleading information about the way in which Federal money have been allocated. We all know that the Federal Government, through the Budget allocations, allocates 20 per cent to the States. One cannot suggest that all that money will be allocated to roads. Yet that is the basic thesis of the Minister and, likewise, of the Minister for Local Government, Senator Reynolds, in their communications to councils around Australia indicating that the Government has fulfilled its commitment to road funding. When the next coalition government takes office it will be in a very difficult environment, with an overseas debt of $120 billion. But we will be looking at a different set of priorities and will be mindful of our commitment to road funding throughout Australia and to local government. This big spending Labor Government admitted yesterday that consumption was running at 8 per cent while productive capacity was improving by only 4 per cent per annum. The difficulties faced by a Peacock Government in increasing road funding in the short-term will be quite considerable.",48
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,49
46,Ms CRAWFORD ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Forde) (12.59)-I wish to address the question of child-care and, in particular, the Queensland Government's attitude to child-care. As many members in the House will know, the issue of child-care is an integral part of the work force planning governstrategy to enable women to re-enter the work force and also to alleviateÂ· situations in families with the provision of occasional child-care for families. Therefore, it is important that the Queensland Government participate so that Queensland families and children can be part of this new child-care place strategy. In the last 20,000-place strategy the Commonwealth and Queensland governments agreed to the allocatioq of 3,251 places. This year the Commonwealth proposes to expand the strate-y to provide 3,799 places for Queensland families and children but the Queensland Government has refused to sign the agreement. We might well ask why. What does the Queensland Government have against the provision of child-care for families within that State? It cannot be simply .a notion of a particular type of child-care which it finds abhorrent. Indeed, the proposal covers long day child-care, occasional child-care and outside school hours child-care, as well as fully federally funded family day care services. This is all part of a national child-care strategy which is jointly and cooperatively run by the States and the Federal Government. What is the Queensland Government's objection to ensuring that Queensland children have the very best quality child-care as provided for in other States of Australia? Indeed, there are hundreds of thousands of Australian children now being cared for in services funded under this joint program. The program has undergone unparalleled expansion under the Hawke Government. In 1983 there were a mere 46,000 places across Australia. There are now 114,000 child-care places available within Australia. This makes an enormous impact upon families and upon those children because they can be assured that this is quality, supervised child-care, in facilities which have appropriate space, open space and fresh air. An editorial in the Australian suggested that one of the problems with the federally funded child-care centres was that such centres had open air and open space for children to play in and this was obviously too expensive. We do not think that anything is too expensive for the children of Australia, particularly those in Queensland. So I exhort the Minister for Family Services in Queensland to move to ensure that that State becomes part of this national child-care strategy and part of the $1 billion which has been spent on childcare services since 1973-74, $850m of which has been spent by the Hawke Government alone. Indeed, in any given week, 132,000 Australian families are benefiting from childcare services. These range from occasional child-care to give children and families a respite. from each other for a few hours to long day care to enable the parent to enter the work force. Other services include after school care or before school care so that people who are in the work force or involved in study courses or whatever, can ensure that their children are cared for carefully after school, that they are not on the streets or part of the latchkey syndrome. The Queensland Government says a lot about its concern for families and children, but when it comesÂ· to actually signing on the line in order to participate in a national child-care strategy, the reality does not match the rhetoric. We want Queenslanders to be included in these 132,000 families who are benefiting from this strategy. Indeed, these child-care places will go to those families in greatest need of assistance. The priority arrangements that operate within the federally operated child-care centres ensure that children at risk, children of families most in need, have their care needs met. Indeed, it is imperative that these families be part of our federally funded program which ensures that the fees are not beyond their means. These people are just as entitled to quality child-care as anybody who has plenty of money. Financial circumstances should not be and are not a barrier to quality child-care under our federally funded and cooperatively managed child-care programs. Why then is the Queensland Government not willing to participate in such a program? Why does it not want to ensure that Queensland families and Queensland children can be part of what is acknowledged to be one of the best child-care programs in the world? This program's services are targeted to parents training for, or wishing to re-enter the work force, who need affordable, accessible child care. We have heard much rhetoric in this place about the feminisation of poverty, about women in single-parent families being the poorest members of our community. One of the major ways of breaking that cycle is to ensure that programs that assist or enable women to re-enter the work force are accessible and affordable to them. Child-care places are part of that program and part of those initiatives. Thus child-care becomes an integral part of family life, whether it is for a few hours, a long day, or simply outside school hours. Undisputedly, this Government has a strong commitment to the child-care needs of parents at home as well. We are not simply talking about those people who wish to re-enter the work force. Very many of our most disadvantaged. people find that at times they need a break from their children. So the occasional care program comes into its own. The need for such care is demonstrated by the vast numbers of people who use our occasional child-care places. The national child-care strategy acknowledges that. In fact, the Federal Government is attempting to ensure that another 360 occasional day care places are made available for Queensland families and children. Over a period this may provide places for hundreds, indeed thousands, of children in two, three, four or whatever hourly lots, when parents feel a need for a respite from their child. Why then is the Family Services Minister in Queensland not prepared to acknowledge the needs of those families who want occasional child-care? It is not a party political matter-New South Wales has entered the national child-care strategy; in fact, it was the first State to do so. Both conservative and Labor State governments are entering into the cooperative arrangements for the provision of child-care. I am aggrieved about this and I think it is a further indication of the way in which the Queensland Government continues constantly to ignore not only the needs of the people but also the desire of the Queensland Community, which is entitled to the very best quality child-care. I exhort the Minister to attempt to sign our cooperative funding and become part of the national child-care strategy so that Queensland children can be cared for by the best child-care program in the world.",49
47,Mr TIM FISCHER ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Farrer) (1.09)-Today I grieve on behalf of veterans, war widows and ex-service personnel. I have notified the Minister for Veterans' Affairs ( Mr Humphreys) that, in accordance with my undertaking, I will not make any reference to the Austrlj.lian War Memorial, but will concentrate on the drift in affairs within his Department in relation to repatriation matters generally, veterans' entitlements and the lack of a fair go for those who served their country in time of war. I commend the very strong contributions made by the father of the House, the honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren), on a number of recent occasions and I support much of what he has said in relation to this key area of Government administratiQn. The administration of repatriation over the past three years, and more particularly in the past year, must always be examined in the context of who is at the top of the treethat is, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I say in passing that in many ways the Minister is a good chap-I freely acknowledge that and make no personal reflections on him. But it has to be pointed out that not once but twice it took an Australia-wide telephone meltdown on talk back radio to inject some sanity and reality into his deliberations on an administrative front. So it was that I led a campaign in conjunction with veterans' organisations to persuade the Government to exempt certain buildings around Australia-including the repatriation hospitals and the Australian War Memorial-from having to fly their flags at half mast on the occasion of the formal funeral for Emperor Hirohito of Japan. But that did not happen by accident; it was the result of an enormous reaction right across Australia. Eventually it led to the intervention of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and ultimately the two Ministers involved-the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West)-saw the light of day. But that only occurred after a tremendous grassroots reaction which I certainly helped to kick along in order to sheet home the right message to these Ministers to get that decision right-which they duly did. , Again this week we saw the cruel, agonising approach to a quadriplegic Vietnam veteran in Sydney. Again, it was a case of telephone meltdown on talk back radio both in Sydney and around Australia. Again, the Prime Minister intervened to address this particular administrative decision. Earlier today the Standing Committee on Community Affairs tabled a report in this House---'-a guide to social security payments and the fairness, courtesy and efficiency of the Department of Social Security. I freely acknowledge that the Department has some very capable, workmanli)<:e and professional senior staff-the Commissioner, the deputy commissioners, and others who try their very best. I would suggest that this - Committee should be looking at the Department of Veterans' Affairs with exactly the same terms of reference-to examine the fairness, courtesy and efficiency of that Department. I can tell honourable members that at the grassroots level, at the coal face, where veterans and warÂ· widows and other ex-service personnel are fighting for their entitlements, they are encountering attitudes other than fairness, courtesy and efficiency. Honourable members need not just rely on my word for this. Let me quote from the columns of the Vietnam Veterans' Association publication Debrief An article in that publication said: In recent times considerable attention has been focused on the existence of a 'cell' of bright young legal eagles operating within the Wong-towered auspices of the Department of Veterans' Affairs in Canberra. The principal function of this cell, which I can assure you does indeed exist, is to make veterans fight every inch of the way and incur as much expense as possible in order to obtain benefits which are rightfully theirs under current veterans' legislation . . . The veteran community is regarded as the 'enemy'-to be defeated whenever possible and by any means possible. Those are not my words, they are the atypical words of a veterans' organisation in the publication Debrief The matter is referred to again in a later issue because the excesses of the Department's advocacy branch continue unabated. Thanks to the related work of Bruce Ruxton and others we now find that a document from the Department of Veterans' Affairs suggests that we should not pass on information to veterans. It says: It is not intended to advise or encourage clientsthat is, veteransto make applications. This document, which is dated 23 September 1988, deals with the overpayments issuethe issue which got the Minister into so much trouble this week over that quadriplegic Vietnam veteran. That document is hiding information from veterans who have received overpayments, have had to pay extra taxation as a consequence of those overpayments and have then had to repay those overpayments. The Department is hiding from those veterans the fact that they should be eligible for adjustments in relation to the taxation they have paid on the excess which they received during the period of overpayment. Those overpayments quite often occur, not through the fault of the veteran-as you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, with your experience in dealing with this issue-but through administrative error by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. If one reads the small print of the Minister's statement one will find that the long and short of the affair with the quadriplegic veteran is that his Department's administrative error-plus, I think, a fairly hefty direction from the Prime Minister's Office-caused him to back down. As Bruce Ruxton said in respect of this operational document issued within the Department of Veteran's Affairs, clearly the Department is ripping off veterans. Mr Ruxton said that the document aimed to create a smokescreen to deflect criticisms of the Department when it was, in some cases, responsible for both the overpayment and the high tax. That is the opposite of providing a fair go for veterans. The coalition's commitment is simply this-to provide a fair go for veterans, war widows and ex-prisoners of war. The lack of a fair go at present is manifest across the whole of the administration and the policy of the Department. I will be fair and say that there have been. some benefits passed on by this Government in the four years since that famous miniBudget of May 1985. During that period we have seen a number of specific cutbacks and complex changes, but equally there have been some improvements. I acknowledge the introduction of the extreme disability adjustment, but it is granted on very stringent criteria which should be reviewed. Similarly, I acknowledge the bringing forward of the consumer price index increases contained in the recent economic statement by the Treasurer ( Mr Keating). But those improvements are small beer compared with the feelings of concern of veterans as expressed at the Sydney Town Hall recently and elsewhere over those cutbacks and complex changesÂ· which have turned the concept of a fair go for veterans on its head. As the Minister reviews the corporate plan and the performance of his Department, I appeal to him to look again at erring on the side of the veteran-erring on the side of a genuine applicant to the Department for disability pension, for medical treatment and the like, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant legislation. As a consequence of the Minister's supplementary answer yesterday, we now know that under the defence service home loan arrangements the Government is required to pay an additional $17.5m of subsidy to the Westpac Banking Corporation for every extra one percentage point of interest rates on housing. We do not object to that: Westpac is the owner of that particular scheme and the payment is in accordance with quite proper arrangements. The honourable member for Ryan ( Mr Moore) has pointed out that that is a legitimate arrangement: we acknowledge that and we support the scheme. But we do object to the high interest rate regime which is causing so much hardship around this country, including for veterans and ex-service personnel. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs must look again at the whole modus operandi of his duties in respect of looking after those who served their country in time of war and see that a fair go is granted to our veterans and war widows-particularly in relation to cancer of unknown aetiology.",51
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,53
49,Mr CAMPBELL ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Kalgoorlie) (l.19)-ln factory speaking in this grievance debate today would like to assert my belief that we have nothing to fear but fear itself. Those are my words; they are the words of Franklin Roosevelt. But I believe them as true for Australia today as they were for the United States in 1933. I want to grieve about the economy, or more particularly about the nonsense that is talked about the economy by economists and politicians. I note that current account is the present bogy to which we are all genuflecting. We are assaulted sides by the magnitude of this problem. We are told in all seriousness that every single person in Australia, man, woman and child, owes $7,500, or that every family owes about $20,000 worth of the foreign debt. This, course, is absolute nonsense, but it is told us quite seriously by politicians and econoare mists. The. Australian people do not owe money. They had no say in it. They were not consulted by Elliott and Bond about their massive overseas borrowings when they set out to build and extend their empires. The Australian people do not have to pay that money back; that is the responsibility the people who borrowed it. Despite the irresponsible of the commentators, there is no similarity between the situation in Brazil, Argentina Mexi""o and that in Australia. The difference is quite clear. In those countries, the ment borrowed the money and the country must pay it back. In Australia, the Commonwealth Government did not borrow the money. In our case, the Commonwealth Government probably has more in foreign currency, bullion and liquid assets than it owes and therefore is in net credit. One would imagine that the large corporations that set out to borrow this money know how to pay it back. I do not believe that they just went out and mindlessly borrowed money and I am sure that most of them are paying it back. But if they do not pay it back, it is they who will default, not the Australian people. We also have to look at what this current account deficit is and at some of the ways in which it is calculated. For instance, if an Australian company has a wholly owned subsidiary in Hong Kong, which borrows money from an American bank to buy a or to build a factory in Thailand and I pays back the loan from the profits of the Thailand operation through its Hong Kong not subsidiary to the American bank, that will still be registered in Australia as a current account deficit to this country. Or, for instance, if Ansett buys some aeroplanes overseas and sends them to New Zealand to pay off a debt it owes, that purchase is still registered in this country as a current acthe count deficit. This should be taken into account. Also, quite clearly, in many cases the all current account is balanced by assets held overseas and this is not taken into account. There are areas of conspicuous consumption which the Government should address. I find them quite obnoxious and I would of. hope that the Government would crack down to on them as hard as it can. Often these things best done by example. There are areas this here in which the Commonwealth itself and State governments could operate. I might say that where current account debt occurs in State governments or in statutory authorities, these entities should be forced to be more efficient in order to meet those payments. of They should not simply put up their prices or charges to pay back these debts that they references of some have incurred. There are things that the Government or could do. For instance, there are many public servants in this country-both State and GovernFederal-who drive around in large fourwheel drive vehicles. In my electorate they are everywhere; one often sees a Toyota or a Nissan with one public servant in it. If the Commonwealth and the States were to replace those vehicles with much cheaper Russian-made vehicles, there would be three immediate consequences: the capital expense would be halved, as would the amount that this contributes to the current accounthonourable members should remember that they are all imported vehicles"""""":running costs would be greatly reduced because the vehicles are much more fuel efficient; and maintenance costs would be much lower because parts are much cheaper. So there would be significant savings to the Commonwealth and the States. It is true that some public servants might feel themselves somewhat downgraded, but in the present climate I think it is the sort of contribution that we would all be prepared to make. I might add that I have recently acquired one of these vehicles for my Port Hedland office and find it entirely satisfactory. In terms of ride and road handling, it is probably better than some of the others. The other important consequence is that, if we were to expand trade this way with the Soviet Union, that trade would come straight back to us. The Soviet Union would simply buy more from Australia. That is not true of Japan. It is certainly in our interest to be expanding our trade base overseas. That is just one little thing that the Commonwealth can do and there are quite a lot of others which I will tl;l.lk about later. We do have to address this problem of the current account because it is a problem. Most of the money that makes up the current account is money that we have to pay by way of interest for money borrowed overseas, or dividends returned as equity, or profits repatriated overseas. That is the great bulk of the current account. The way to attack that is either by reducing consumption or by increasing productivity. Reducing consumption is not easy and I think we really do have to look at increasing productivity. I believe that this should be tackled by every available means. We should certainly be looking at anything that impedes productivity-work practices and bad management should all come under close scrutiny. I certainly hope that the Government will do this-it must play a part in this area. We have in Australia today a situation where, there is simply no risk capital market-there is. no risk capital available-because the private sector is frightened. In these situations the Government< must be prepared to step in and not run away from the issue. The Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) was set up for this purpose, yet we find it funding shopping centres and things in which the private sector should be involved. We find it funding the very shopping centres which push up rents in country towns and cities, which increase the cost of consu-er goods and which, in the final analysis, increase consumption. This whole attitude is crazy and I think the Government must' 'reevaluate that. The AIDC should be, adequately funded and told to direct itself to areas where it will increase, Australia's real potential. What is the real potential of Australia? It lies in developing areas where we have a natural or an intellectual advantage. There are many such areas. It grieved me to hear an answer given in this House yesterday by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) in respect of the uranium industry. It is sheer nonsense to say that there is no window in the market for uranium because those figures are calculated on a very conservative basis. They are' done by taking note of the stockpile, taking note of the capacity to increase production from existing mines and noting that there is still a shortfall. This shortfall is arrived at by simply adding up the uranium which will be used by existing facilities or those under construction. It is not pie in the sky like some of the previous and' very silly estimates of uranium need. ' As a result of government action-and I am talking about the actions of the Fraser Government as well as the present Government-we have a situation where Australia, with 30 per cent of the world's easily available uranium, has 10 per cent of the market. Canada is quite the reverse and that is the achievement of government policy. An area in which we have a natural advantage has been stifled by government action. There is no way of getting round that. We are told that the present miners have trouble selling and that is true at the moment, but those people know that in the future that will get' better. We are also told about the spot price,-:-a quite dishonest argument because 90 per cent of the world's uranium is bought on the long term contract price. Only 10 per cent is bought on the spot price. The reason for that is quite simple: as a percentage of the cost of production,Â· the cost of uranium is minimal. If it doubles or triples it really does not make that much difference. Companies would much rather lock themselves into a sure and guaranteed supply because breaking continuity, a lack of supply, would cost them far, far more than paying that little extra for uranium. I am running out of time and there are many other things I wanted to say on this very important issue. I implore the Government to look very broadly at increasing productivity because increasing productivity and growth in the economy is the only way we can go. In doing this we must not be deterred by pressure groups. I believe it is unfortunate that not only here but also in the rest of the world we are becoming increasingly dominated by pressure groups-groups that have no real power. But power is a strange thing; if it is not tested all power is real. I believe that it is the responsibility of government to test the power of all these pressure groups and to always work in the national interest even if it incurs some temporary pain.",53
50,Dr HARRY EDWARDS ,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Berowra) (1.29)-Much is continually made by Government members about the growth in employment recorded as in excess of 1.3 million persons since the Hawke Government came to power.Â· Today I want to make some assessment of that, put it into perspective and assess the cost at which this has been achieved. There has been a very high price to pay and that is my grievance. Specifically, that price is the vast increase in the country's overseas debt, from less than $30 billion in 1983 to $120 billion-nay, probably nearer to $140 billion today; more than a four-fold increase. The resultant vast increase in . the burden of interest payments overseas impacts directly or indirectly on every Australian family to the order, on average, of some $50 per week. No wonder .living standards have fallen. Associated with that has been the devaluation, the debasement of the Australian dollar, which has fallen in value by one-half over the period in terms of the yen. No wonder that there has been the vast buy out-or sell-out, looked at from this side of Australian assets. As has been said, this Hawke Government has put the country up for sale at bargain basement prices. When people complain about the great increase in foreign ownership of Austra.lian assets, land and businesses and so on, they should direct their indignation and wrath primarily at the inadequate, failed economic policies of this Government that have largely encouraged it and brought it about. Yet the Government, particularly the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), remains so complacent despite the threat of a major economic crisis, stemming from a lack of international confidence in Australia, befor- this country at this very time. I return to my theme-the much advertised growth in employment under the Hawke Government. First of all, employment growth in Australia has always been much higher than the average for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. In the 20 years froin 1968, employment growth in Australia averaged 2.5 per cent annually. This compared with just over one per cent per annum for the total OECD. One immediate factor in the difference is that this difference correlates with relative rates of population growth, which is much faster in Australia. In passing, let me stress this: the strong employment growth has not been confined to the years of Labor's much vaunted but greatly overrated accord. Indeed, Australia has experienced a. particularly strong rate of growth in employment over the whole period since the Second World War. Thus there was consistent rapid employment growth in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s. But also under the much maligned Fraser Government, while employment growth was slow at first as the economy was bent back into shape after the destructive Whitlam years, from 1979 there was strong employment growth with the economy generating some 530,000 jobs over the period of the Fraser Government to the cyclical peak of September 1981. This is shown in a table which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard. Leave granted. The table read as followsYear Feb. 1975 5,827.7 1976 5,949.9 1977 5,987.4 1978 5,999.6 1979 6.065.8 1980 6,224.8 1981 6,376.9 1982 6,454.7 1983 6,295.7 1984 6,398.1 1985 6,631.7 1986 6,898.0 1987 7,064.3 1988 7,291.9 1989 7,617.8 N.A - Not Available. Dr HARRY EDW ARDS-That growth was robust, comparable to that of recent years under the Hawke Government, but that is never acknowledged by the Labor Party. It was cut short by the severe 198182 drought, the onset of world recession and the wages mayhem led by the metal unions with plenty of support from the whole gangthe present Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke), then only recently translated from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and Messrs Dolan, Crean, Kelty, Carmichael, the lot. There has been no such major interruption to growth since the coming to power of the Hawke Government, but that cannot be said to be due to the ministrations of this Government. The situation has been the same in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the world generally. Continuing employment growth with a prolonged worldwide upswing in business activities since 1983, albeit with the considerable slowdown in 1986, has not been peculiar to Australia but worldwide. What needs to be recognised is that whereas the job growth under the Fraser Government was soundly based on resource development as its motor force, under the Hawke Government job growth benefited in the early stages from the bounce-back from the 1982 recession, the breaking of the drought, the Fraser wages pause and the upswing in the world business cycle.

It may, as I said, be something of the order of $140 billion with the blow-out arising from the dramatic weakening of the Australian dollar in recent days. People need to get a very clear picture. The debt rises inexorably every second of every hour of every day. Right now, this country is some $50m extra into hock than it was at this time yesterday. There was reference recently to a debt clock set up in New York. As the United States has moved into debtor country status-but its problem is not nearly as great as ours-the clock ticks away over New York to bring home how quiCkly and frighteningly the debt grows. We need such a clock in here. To return to my theme, one might say that in gross terms the employment growth to which I am referring has cost upwards of $70,000 per job or, if one relates it to the last half percentage point of job growthabout 20 per cent of the total growth-it has cost upwards of $350,000 per job. I will come back to that. It also needs to be recognised that the total of more than 1.3 million jobs since the coming to power of the Hawke Government . embraces a very rapid increase-more than 40 per cent-in the number of part time jobs. The increase in full time employment . over the period was actually. S70,000. However, the full time equivalent, so to speak, the total increase was still of the order of one million jobs. The growth in employment is, of course, to be welcomed. I should also make the point that over the period there has been a context of low investment .in plant and equipment, expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product, and largely due to Keating economic mismanagement. Thus, there has been inadequate capital deepening for greater productivity, hence abysmal productivity growth, and that also has made for relatively greater labour demand. My final point is that, despite the growth in employment, the rate of unemployment which is the true measure of an effectively functioning labour market and of an effective overall economic policy, has been stuck at around 7 per cent. I recall that at the cyclical peak of the Fraser Government-September 1981-that unemployment rate was 5.6 per cent. In sum, continued unemployment, abysmal growth in productivity, the massive increase in Australia's overseas debt and lower standards of living for most AustI'alians heavily qualify the employment growth outcome. Indeed, what this country needs is not boasting about employment growth, which has been bought at a great price, but a willingness by the Government to go to the Parliament and the nation, the people out there, and tell them the situation as it is: that there is a major economic crisis before the country at this time; that the I country, the economy, has very serious problems; and while more can and should be done in: the shorter term, there are no overnight solutions, no quick fixes, but rather a long haul to cut back the balance of payments deficit, to stabilise and, in time, reduce the overseas debt, to begin the process of restoring Â·living standards. The key thrust of the policy must be in .the area of increasing the nation's production through increased productivity-that is the nation's income. When an individual is in debt, is that not his first priority-to increase his income, save more, reduce his own spending to meet the interest payments and to begin to pay back the debt? So it is for the nation. All the areas of so-called micro-economic policy are crucial. These must include changof ing the rigid and inflexible wages and industrial relations system; increasing productivity on the wharves, in coastal shipping and so on; ceasing restrictive work practices which impoverish everybody; and privatising publicly-owned businesses for greater efficiency. One only has to state those prerequisites to understand why fundamental economic progress has been so limited, productivity growth so abysmal, and why we have the present veritable paralysis of policy under this Government. It stems from the very nature of the Government's main constituency-the ACTU-which paralyses significant action in these areas. EmptyHere talk about two issues today, the first being about an article in yesterday's Australian Financial Review entitled 'Austel faces budget cut even before it starts up.' I want to express my disappointment that an institution, the legislation for which went through this House only last week, apparently is already being subject to Budget cuts. That legislation went through the House after extensive and exhaustive committee work in consultation with the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) and his Department. Austel has very important responsibilities, one of the most important being its consumer responsibility-that is, to ensure that the telecommunications carriers rectify those problems that consumers find. It will not be concerned just with handling individual complaints-the Ombudsman tends to do that reasonably well-but it will actually recommend changes to practices, procedures and policy. I think it is regrettable that there should be suggestions of funding cuts. Should these go through there will be some difficulties. I would also like to place on record my belief that in carrying out its responsibilities to the Government, Austel will not be in a position to want to redefine all those matters that have already been defined in the Bill and open up renegotiations in areas which have already been subjected to significant deregulation. The other matter I want to discuss this afternoon is the banking industry. Once again a couple of newspaper items have drawn my attention to the problems being faced by battlers in my electorate. I believe this sort of thing is Australia-wide. The first item concerns the ANZ Bank's announcement of a 28 per cent increase in profit to $617m. For the record I point out that the 1988 profit figures were: Westpac, $693m, up 69 per cent; National Australia Bank, $531m, a 62 per cent increase, the Commonwealth Bank, $237m, a 38 per cent increase; and, ANZ, $505m, a 31.2 per cent increase. I have said publicly before-perhaps a little ungraciously-that the banks are wallowing in profit. But what really caught my attention was an article about Westpac which suggested that Westpac was hinting at another review of its charges. I find it most uncomfortableand I am sure the HouseÂ· also feels discomfort-that the banks' charges are not subject to any monitoring whatsoever. But Westpac went on to say-and I think it is important to get this on the public record-that there is cross-subsidisation between banking products. Cross-subsidisation is not new, but the real point is who is cross-subsidising whom? Are the little battlers cross-subsidising some of the corporate accounts? People might find that reprehensible. On the other hand if the corporate accounts are subsidising the battlers there may be some justification. But I guess the most serious issue is that no-one is monitoring the cross-subsidisation. I hope that Opposition members, who feel strongly about having Telecom Australia's cross-subsidisation on the public record as quickly as possible-as announced by their shadow Minister-will want to see the banks' crosssubsidisation open to publ-c scrutiny. There has been concern throughout Australia about the whole self-regulatory regime on which the banks have been allowed to operate for some time. I notice that the banks have announced that they are going to follow the English model and establish a consumer ombudsman. Whilst I believe that this is a positive step forward, I have severe reservations about it. I am quite unrepentant about calling for the establishment, by statute, of a Federal ombudsman to inquire into the banking structure. One of the reasons why I am concerned about the banks is that in February 1989 a study in England called the Jack report was very critical of that self-MONICA",55

52,Mr HAWKER ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Wannon)-Last week I had the pleasure of visiting a primary school in myelectprate, St Patrick's, at Port Fairy. The children had been studying parliamentary processes, and they raised two petitions, both of which I would like to read. Unfortunately, they do not meet the forms of the House, but nonetheless the children did ask me to present them to the chamber. The first one, with 35 signatures from certain residents of Port Fairy, draws the attention of the House to Antarctica, prays that we stop all mining in Antarctica and prevent any more pollution of the area. The second petition, which has 54 signatures, prays that everything that affects the ozone layer be banned. I was most impressed with the way these students have been working to understand the forms of Parliament. While, unfortunately, these petitions do not quite meet the forms of the House, I would still like to present them in this manner.",58
53,Mr SAWFORD ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Port Adelaide) - On :22 and 23 April this year, the Australian Formula One Power Boat Grand Prix wassuccessfully held for the first time on the Port River in my electorate of Port Adelaide. I was privileged to be the guest of Commander Paul de Graaf, from HMAS Encounter, aboard the recently launched hydrographic vessel HMAS Paluma, built in Port Adelaide by Eglo Engineering, and currently undergoing sea trials. South Australia, of course, provided magnificent weather, at a venue where every spectator could see all the action. I have no doubt that in the future the Formula One Power Boat Grand Prix in Port Adelaide will be a very special date on the calendar of great sporting events in Australia. But the most significant points for me were the comments of visitors to our city. They were both amazed and delighted at the renaissance of Port Adelaide, under the Hawke and Bannon Labor governments. That renaissance is, of course, in stark contrast to the soul destroying neglect of Port Adelaide by conservative State and Federal governments over previous decades. Visitors recognised and acknowledged the obvious encouragement by Labor governments of the creative developments of maritime and railway museums of international repute, the preservation of historic heritage buildings and the revitalisation of commerce and industry. Being in Port Adelaide that weekend reaffirmed a pride in developing an Australian identity, an appreciation of our history-MONICA",58
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired. EmptyHere face my 90-second statement with the title of 'The Sting has stung'. Last night, with Senator Puplick, our shadow environment Minister, I had the opportunity to travel to Sydney to meet Sting, the former front man for that great British rock group, Police, who now has his own music and a campaigning attitude to the environment. He was there with the Indian Chief Raini, of the Brazilian Kayapo tribe. Certainly people in Australia would know the impact and the significance of his world :tour to generate awareness of factors affecting the habitat of the indigenous Indians and the desecration of the ecosystem through the logging and burning of the tropical rainforest. Sting hopes to generate funds-and I am pleased to congratulate the Hawke Governwiped ment on its donation of $250,000-to allow the Xingu National Park of several hundred thousand hectares to be created and preserved, and if successful, to be used as a model to preserve more, if not all of this environment known as 'the lungs of the Earth'. I made the point that wherever you spin the environment wheel, the world is in trouble-not only with the forests of Borneo and South America, but also with the man.made polluting tragedies here in Australia and the Antarctic. Other problem areas include our meagre rainforests, which are under pressure, the wetlands of Kakadu, Tasmania and Australia's woodchip industry. I guess it is ironic that Japanese logging interests do to our environment what they would not allow to happen to their own. We, as players on this world stage, have to bring the developersMONICA",59

Mr Lane is a former policeman, Liberal Party Minister and National Party Minister in both the Queensland coalition and National Party governments. In the election the Nationals' vote was halved-from 32 per cent to 16 per cent. Of the 16 per cent of votes they lost, half went to the Australian Labor Party and the other half went to the Liberal Party of Australia. The Liberals have held that seat for years; it is a seat which encompasses most of of the conservative areas of Brisbane. The Liberals, who were standing aside like little doggies waiting for the National Party to go down the tube, could only pick up half of the vote that was really theirs. The Liberal Party in Queensland is doing absolutely nothing. The only interpretation which can be placed on these figures is that the National Party is finished in Queensland. It will be out in the city and in the provincial areas. The only result that can come out of it is the fact that the Labor Party, with a 89 per cent, three-party preferred swing to it, will most certainly pick up about 19 seats at the next State election. The Liberals can go back and become anotherMONICA",59

58,Mr DOWNER ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Mayo)-Last week the Premiers Conference was held here in Canberra and one of the interesting aspects of that conference was the way in which the State of South Australia found itself in a comfortable position, whereas all the other States found themselves down the drain. That is interesting, because in the next few months South Australia will have a State election. In the few seconds I have, let me just say something about the morality of this. Last year at the Premiers Conference-and honourable members may not remember this-Western Australia got the generous deal and South Australia gave up a substantial proportion of its Loan Council borrowings to Western Australia. What has happened this year? Western Australia has gone down the tube and South Australia has got a bonus. The morality of that kind of public finance policy deserves to be condemned by all members of this House. People's livelihoods and people's welfare are at stake when it comes to public finance; it is not a matter for party political games. Mr Bannon, the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) deserve to be condemned for using public finance to play their cheap party political games.",60
59,Mr MILTON ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"La Trobe)--,-The Opposition has been very critical of the Uranium 'Review Committee, of which I am a member, which has been set up by the Australian Labor Party (ALP) to review Labor Party policy on the mining, export and use of Australian uranium. However, the problem with the Opposition is that it just does not understand the democratic processes of the Labor Party because these sorts of processes do not operate in their parties. What the Labor Party is doing is giving members of the public, community and industry groups; together with Party members, the opportunity to assist in the formulation of a vital policy area. The Committee is visiting the capital cities of every State and Territory and holding meetings to receive written submissions and listen to verbal submissions. In all respects, the ALP policy process is more open and democratic than the processes of the Liberal and National parties, as recent events have testified. I urge all members of the public to continue to make submissions to our Committee and address them to the ALP Head Office in Canberra. r urge them to seek an opportunity to meet with the Committee. It is interesting to note that to date an overwhelming number of the submissions have been opposed to uranium mining. EmptyHere my statement on Sting. There are excellent wilderness and conservation societies to join, such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, and I urge all people to make that effort to support those groups. I am pleased to say that last night in Sydney, Sting was able to sign up as a financial member of the Wilderness Society, such is his concern for the protection of the environment-in Australia, as well as throughout the world. Perhaps the world should consider the ability of our pioneers and forefathers of 50 or 60 years ago. To them, the ozone layer would have meant the balcony row at the 'O-zone' pictures; the greenhouse would have been som-where where one could grow vegetables; woodchips were used to light the fire at night. Perhaps we should go back to those great resilient days-use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.",60
60,Mr LAMB ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Streeton)-I wish to draw the attention of the House to an article which appeared in the Australian on 15 May 1989, and which attributed to the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), the words 'new jobs create debt'. The honourable member criticised this Government for creating 1.3 million jobs since it had been in office. He did not contest that claim but he criticised it, and then went on to say that the Government should think about the international debt that was being run up as a result of every new job created. He said that each job created by this. Government had cost Australia a sum of $70,000 in its international debt. This gives the first clue to what the very silent Opposition is abQut on matters of economic policy. One can be sure that under a Peacock Liberal Government no more jobs will be created. Under a Peacock Liberal Government jobs will be lost because its argument is, by corollary, that every job that can be destroyed, every extra person that can be put on unemployment, will reduce our external debt by $70,000. This is one of the most shameful statements ever made by a pretender to the treasuryship of this country. It is disgraceful indeed.",60

I thank these constituents from the of Toowoomba for their time in being here today. It is with great pride that I acknowledge that city's recently publicised position as the best place to live in Australia. That reputation is not misplaced. As I said in this place last year, Toowoomba's people are hard working, conscientious and God-fearing-a combination which I say is hard to beat.

As far as I am concerned, nobody typifies local government more than the former mayor of Port Pirie, now Alderman Bill Jones. Bill, who is here in Canberra, has given tremendous service to local government. He has not kept the best of health. He has been an outstanding mayor and ambassador for Port Pirie and I welcome him to Canberra. I certainly hope he has a good time and, now that he is back as an alderman, I hope his health withstands it and that he carries on with the good work that he is doing for the city of Port Pirie.",61
63,Mr HAWKER ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Wannon)-I would like to draw the attention of all honourable members to an article written by Kenneth Davidson in the Age today. This article exposes the sham of the present Government and, in particular, its attitude towards savings. 'It s-ows why we. have such a debt problem in Australia. This article, which quotes the Reserve Bank of Australia's most recent publication, points out the difference in return between someone putting money on deposit at fixed term and someone"" gearing up to invest in a house. By the time a person puts money on fixed deposit at, say, 15 per cent, has paid tax and inflation has taken effect, the average return would be something of the order of 0.7 per cent. If someone puts money into a house and then rents it out-as time is fairly short, I will not go into the details-his return could be as much as 43 per cent. So it is little wonder that Australians are not saving. In fact, they are borrowing because the tax system and the inflation rate under this Government encourage them to continue to borrow the maximum amount, particularly to invest in city housing, ,which is pushing up the price of housing for everyone-MONICA",61

This is posing a major problem for local residents. The existing dwelling has caused a lot of difficulty because that was built against the wishes of the local residents and now there is a proposal to expand it. Local residents believe, quite rightly, that we could turn the Scarborough beach front into a replica of Surfers Paradise and clearly we do not want that. Local residents are very concerned about the development of crime and they believe that it is not in their best interests to have this development expand.

NA MICROÂ·ECONOMIC REFORM EmptyHere to the Prime Minister. I refer him to the fact that in Sydney last night the Governor General said that, among other things, much more needs to' be done in micro-economic reform and restructuring of a broad range of Australia's industries, includi.ng the waterfront and coastal shipping. I ask the Prime Minister: Do the Governor General's remarks accurately reflect the Prime Minister's advice to him on this subject?",61

Therefore, I have given no advice to the Governor General on this matter. Having said that, which reflects the facts, I can say that I agree with the statements of the Governor General. I conclude by saying that what we have done in six years of government leaves for dead and totally in the shade the total ineptitude and inactivity which was displayed by the Opposition in its 30 years of occupation of the government benches. NA",62
68,Mr LAVARCH,ECONOMY,Can the Treasurer inform the House of the implications for the Australian economy of the national account statistics released this morning?,62
69,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"The national accounts show pretty much what the Government has been indicating have been the conditions in the Australian economy for some time: that is, that we have seen a strong growth in demand, an unsustainable growth in demand, which, of course, is leading to an unsustainable growth in imports and debt levels, but we are still seeing an enormous shift in investment. The very large-20.4 per cent-figure for the last quarter's national accounts, which many people expected to be revised down in this quarter, in fact has been followed by another 7.6 per cent. So we have had 20.4 per cent in plant and equipment investment and 7.6 per cent following for this quarter, which means that the growth over the year to the March quarter was a massive 25 per cent. That is a 25 per cent increase in investment in plant and equipment. In debate in the House yesterday the Opposition said, 'Prove or establish that you are getting this investment in plant and equipment'. There it is-25 per cent. It is enormous. It is a matter of severe embarrassment to the Opposition, which could never preside over anything as strong as that. The fact of the matter is that it is too strong; that is, the economy cannot assimilate these investment levels. The result is that the drawing of a lot of these producer goods from abroad has sent imports up to very high levels. Those high levels have meant that demand has spilled over into the current account. With demand running at around 11 per cent and product growth at around 5.4 per cent, which is exceedingly strong, it will mean that about six percentage points of gross domestic product on these figures are being carried as imports. This, of course, is unsustainable and too much. That said, there are some other very good features of the accounts. We noticed in terms of the implicit price deflator that the final private consumption expenditure deflator shows inflation tracking down. at 1.8 per cent in the September quarter, 1.5 per cent in December and 1.3 per cent in March, giving us a 6.5 per cent over the year. As, the Government has been saying, particularly at the time when the consumer price index came out at the end of January, the number showing inflation accelerating towards 8 per cent was flawed. A closer measure of the private consumption deflator indicates 6.5 per cent, with that clear deceleration of 1.8, 1.5 and 1.3 per cent. That is very good news for the economy. Overall, the strength of demand-gross national expenditure-is unsustainable and these levels of investment growth are unsustainable. But the Government has already put the tightest policy settings in place to deal with this problem; that is, we have fiscal , policy running for a fourth successive year of negative outlays growth. At the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting last week we took another $2.75 billion ,of borrowing demands from the savings pool of Australia, thereby relieving the call upon the current account deficit. Monetary policy has been tightened since the .beginning of the second quarter of 1988. That has meant by now interest rates for bills, if one wants to use bills as an indication, are up about 7 percentage points from the period in early 1988. Today the Reserve Bank of Australia responded to yesterday's tighter monetary conditions by shifting the re-discount rate a further 0.3 percentage points. Inte-es,Â· rates are high and will remain high until there is clear evidence that demand is slowing and the current account deficit is trending down. As well as that, the Government has a tight wages policy in place. Through the wage-tax trade-off we expect wages growth next year to be about 6.5 per cent, which is, of course, phenomenally good considering the demand conditions which the labour market has faced. Those arms of policy-that is, a further tightening of fiscal policy at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting; another year of negative outlays growth; a tight monetary policy; a tight wages policy-are the policy arms in place to deal with the portents coming from the history which is coming from the national accounts to the last quarter. .('<s - he year progresses we will see policy ekmg Its reward upon demand. We will see imports falling, producing a better current account prospect in the next financial year. That will mean that the policy response will be a- effective.one and that we have policy runmng at optlmums now to deal with the very strong demand conditions reflected in today's national account figures. xAND R-RATED VIDEO INDUSTRY EmptyHere Prime Minister. Given that the Government has control over the Xand R-rated video industry in Australia through the clearance of European and American master video tapes through Customs and the control of mail order and dispatch through Australia Post, I refer the Prime Minister to his answer to a question from me in the House seven months ago concerning Xand R-rated videos. The Prime Minister responded then to the people of Australia: Caucus has determined that a working party be formed to examine means by which a reduction in the. level ?f violence. in all categories of publicly avaIlable VIdeos, espeCially the R-rated category, will be brought about. I ask the Prime Minister: How many members of the Labor Caucus are on the committee? Has the committee met? If so, on approximately how many occasions, and what decisions have been taken?",62

71,Mr DUBOIS,AUSTRALIA COUNCIL,"I direct my question to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories. Can the Minister demonstrate what impact the Australia Council has had on the arts in Australia?",63
72,Mr HOLDING,AUSTRALIA COUNCIL,"I thank the honourable member not merely for his question, but for his continuing personal involvemerit in this area. It is' not commonly realised, particularly amongst members of the Opposition, that in Australia today the arts and their related structures form what is roughly a $4 billion industry. Currently in Australia there are 30,000 practising professional performers and musicians. Each week 350,000 Australians attend a live theatre or music performance. Ninety-five per cent of Australians have indicated in polls that they closely relate to the success of our artists and performers and that their success gives them a sense of pride in Australia's achievements. Some credit for this achievement must go to the enlightened policies that have been followed over a number of years by the Australia Council. The Council, on any view of it, has an excellent track record. In 1968, only 15 dance, drama, youth and puppetry companies received assistance. for year-round operation. In 1989, 66 performing arts companies received support and attendances at performances by companies assisted by the Council in the same period increased by some 37 per cent. Of the bodies operating under the aegis of ,the Council, the Literature Board is particularly noticeable for its contribution. In 1974, Australian books made up only.15 per cent; by 1985, this had risen to 53 per cent. In 1972, 19 novels were published in Austni.liaÂ· in 1986, over 200 were published. Up t1988, the Literature Board had assisted 1,184 creative writers and subsidised the publishing of 140 titles. One grant alone, a grant of only $3,360 provided to the Fremantle Arts Centre Press, financed the initial publication of A.B. Facey's well-known A Fortunate Life. Since then, over 500,000 copies have been published and the book has been turned into a successful television series. Dr Woods-Page 2.",63
73,Mr HOLDING,AUSTRALIA COUNCIL,"I realise that the Council upsets some honourable gentlemen opposite. They spent some time on a committee looking for an exotic title so that they could condemn the work of the Australia Council. It is their policy, as far as we know-it was part of what was previously their policy-to abolish the Australia Council because they believe their Minister-if they ever get onecould make all these funding decisions. If he did, he would be making a decision at the rate of one every two minutes. Mr Downer-Go back to the script.",63
74,Mr HOLDING,AUSTRALIA COUNCIL,"Back to your dummy! Andrew Peacock found out what the honourable member for Mayo was about. More than 100 Australian works were performed in the United States in 1988-89. It is clear that the Council has reached and supported many professional artists. There are currently 11,170 clients on the Council's books. In 1988-89 the Council will provide $50m for support of the arts. During the period of the Hawke Government, artistic creation and endeavour in Australia has reached an all-time peak. That is due to the policy of this Government in supporting a body like the Australia Council where we have a clear, independent assessment of the way in which these funds are granted. It would be regrettable if any major party in Australia decided to abandon that important policy and philosophy, which has served, and is serving, Australia so well. NA",64
75,Mr COBB,MR MALCOLM FRASER,"Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to the book by Bruce Francis entitled Guilty: Bob Hawke or Kim Hughes? Is the Prime Minister' aware that there appears to be irrefutable proof in this book that Malcolm Fraser fabricated a number of stories to support his well-known opposition to South Africa? In particular, is the Prime Minister aware that Mr Fraser claimed to have been in South Africa when the 'rebel' Australian cricket team arrived there, whereas he was not even in the country, and claimed that he, Malcolm Fraser, witnessed certain television interviews of the tour that have since been shown not to have even taken place? In light of the Prime Minister's recent lobbying of support amongst High Commissioners for Malcolm Fraser to become the next Commonwealth Secretary General, will the Prime Minister now undertake to study the allegations made in this book to determine whether he considers Malcolm Fraser now deserves the Government's support for such high office?",64
76,Mr HAWKE,MR MALCOLM FRASER,"I welcome this question as yet further evidence of the fundamental splits, divisions and hatreds within the coalition. Here we have the remarkable situation of a member of the National Party using the Parliament to launch a most vicious attack upon the previous Leader of the Liberal Partyor the one before the last or the one before that; I have lost count. The man who was the Liberal Prime Minister of this country for seven years is now having launched upon him a most vicious attack by a member of the National Party. So I welcome the question and am more than happy to answer it. Let me say this: I am quite happy in this regard to appear in this place, anywhere in this country or anywhere else, as a defender of Malcolm Fraser on the issue of race and colour in general and South Africa in particular. As distinct from some despicable members of the coalition-from which I basically exclude the Liberal Party-Malcolm Fraser has a completely impeccable record on the question of colour in general and on South Africa in particular. That is not only my judgment, but also, importantly, that of the Commonwealth, of which Australia is a proud member. Malcolm Fraser, in the job that he did as a distinguished member of the Eminent Persons Group, did his party, this Government and this country proud. That body of people, objectively, dispassionately and with great commitment, undertook an analysis of what was happening in South Africa. Those people did that not on the basis of going there to seek to stir up further hatreds or confrontation, but with this objective in mind: to try to ensure that the Government of South Africa could see that the interests of the white people in South Africa, as well as the interests of the blacks and the coloureds, would be best served not by further fighting, bloodshed and death, but by coming to the negotiating table. They talked with representatives of the South African Government as well as with representatives of the front line states and with representatives of the black people. Their report, which was unanimously endorsed by all members of the Commonwealth, was accepted not only within the Commonwealth but around the world as one of the most enlightened and constructive documents that had ever been put forward. It was not a document which was concerned to say to the Government and the authorities in South Africa, 'We just pour all the blame on you'. There was a recognition of the problems in development in South Africa. The report constructively pointed the way to how there could be a way through this tragedy-a tragedy, I repeat, for the whites as well as for the blacks and the coloureds. It pointed the way, by the processes of constructive dialogue and negotiation, to the emergence of a democratic form of government in South Africa in which all people could be properly represented. That report of Malcolm Fraser was presented to a special meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government in London and it was respected by those who received it at that special Heads of Government Meeting in 1976 and endorsed subsequently by all Heads of Government. I suggest it would be a truly remarkable thing if 49 Commonwealth Heads of Government were wrong and the honourable member for Parkes were right. It would be a truly remarkable situation. I am a bit of an odds man, but the honourable member would need very remarkable odds to suggest that in that situation he would be right. He is wrong. Malcolm Fraser and those who were with him were right. I reject absolutely the suggestion that either Malcolm Fraser or those associated with him in the compilation of that landmark report would have indulged in, or in any way been guilty of, misrepresentation. The issues are too fundamentally important for that because in South. Africa we are facing not only the question of the rights of the non-whites, but also the conflict which could engulf that area of the world. Fortunately we are witnessing a time when, even compared with some two years ago, developments are taking place in that region. For those developments merit needs to be given to a number of disparate countries. In that I include South Africa, the United States, the Soviet Union, Cuba and Angola in which, as a result of negotiations which, as I said, two years ago would have been considered remarkable, almost unbelievable, we now have the processes under the supervision of the United Nations whereby we see Namibia emerging by way of peaceful transition to independence and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. We are witnessing all these things as part of the turning point in history. We are witnessing those changes in southern Africa, the withdrawal of the Soviet Union from Afghanistan and constructive moves in Indo China which, hopefully, by the end of September this year, will see Vietnamese troops out of Cambodia and the possibility of the end of the continuing tragedy of Cambodia. In this environment where people around the world are welcoming the emergence of sanity, good sense, constructive negotiation and a willingness to put aside past prejudices to a considerable extent, at the time in the world when we are seeing those things happening and all men and women of good will are welcoming what is happening, we hear this pitiful, . pathetic, repugnant attack by a member of the coalition upon an honourable former Prime Minister of this country. NA NA Mr BRUMBY., - Can the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy inform the House of the current arrangements for appointing members to the boards of the various statutory marketing authorities under his portfolio?",64
77,Mr KERIN,AUTHORITIES,"I thank the honourable member for Bendigo for his interest in statutory marketing in general. The primary industries statutory marketing authorities occupy an important place in the Australian system of marketing agricultural products. There are currently nine such authorities, which carry out promotional, trading or regulatory tasks on behalf of producers. These authorities have enormous responsibilities in an industry sector that relies heavily on exports. International trading and rural products, as honourable members know, are becoming very complex and competitive and, therefore, the authorities must be dynamic and commercially effective organisations. Probably the second biggest trading entity in Australia is the Australian Wheat Board, example. The Government's approach has been to establish policies that allow board directors and managers of the authorities to get with the job of directing and managing withold out distraction, especially from agro-political battles. When this Government came to fice there was a situation, for example, in the meat and livestock industries where the conflict between the producers and' procesThat sors was such that the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corketing poration was almost ineffective. Two prereqfinance-at uisites must be met if the Government's policies are to work: first, the best available people with relevant skills and expertise must ing. be appointed to the boards and, secondly, there must be effective accountability. That is why we have progressively been introducing for all authorities new procedures whereby board members are appointed through objective selection criteria basis of recommendations by industry selecwhich tion committees. These arrangements are in place in the wool industry, the meat indushome try, the meat and livestock industry, the dairy industry-in fact, in most of the nine thorities. They are working very well. That is the only way in which we can obtain the best possible people to do the job of promoting, selling or facilitating apart from industry-political spats. , Until now this approach has had bipartirately san support, arid that is why I am amazed at the somersault of honourable members opposite who insist on a grower majority on the Wheat Board. They do not really trust the Grain Council of Australia to get grower majority on the Wheat Board. It is in the hands of the industry itself. With 46,000 wheat growers to pick from, if people with suitable skills and ability cannot found, it is a pretty poor pass indeed. members of the Liberal Party whether they really think that the best people to run organisation that is responsible for selling and marketing more than $2 billion-worth product are members of the National Party of Australia and it cronies? Do they really believe that we should continue the patronicy age that has marked statutory marketing and research over the years to put in National Party hacks for ever and a day? It is an this country. for absolutely absurd notion. It is the reason why So many of the statutory authorities missed opportunities over the years. If the Liberal Party of Australia is to go on along with this nonsense and continue the jobs for the boys, National Party hacks syndrome, it really will put back Australian ofagriculture. Membership of boards such as the Wheat Board should reflect the expertise required to carry out its functions effectively. means that it should comprise people with experience in the production and marof wheat, promotion, transport and least. It certainly does not serve the purpose of being a sinecure for tired old agro-politicians, as the Opposition is proposNA",65
78,Mr BLUNT,INTEREST RATES,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister. In view of the reported predictions by both the Westpac Banking Coron the poration and the Commonwealth Bank, were described by the Treasurer as 'the more responsible banks', that rises in loan interest rates to 16t per cent or possibly as high as 17 per cent are imminent, auwill the Prime Minister now withdraw his statement that home loan interest rates will not rise any further this year? , Mr HAWKE-I have nothing to add to what I had to say earlier this week on this subject. The situation has been put accuby my, friend and colleague the Treasurer, and that is that monetary policy is tight at present and it will be kept tight as long as is necessary to deal with the fundamental a economic issues confronting this countrythat is, that the level of demand is running too high. We cannot continue to tolerate a continuation of that level of economic activbe ity if we are to be true to the commitment I ask that we must all have-that honourable members on both sides of this House must an have-and that is to ensure that the outcome is sustainable in terms of our external acof count.

79,Mr SCIACCA,AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. In view of the continuing disruption to civil aviation through the nonavailability of air traffic controllers, larly in the Sydney area, can the Minister advise the House what action \las been taken to attempt to return operations to normal?",67
80,Mr WILLIS,AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS,"It is the case that the aviation industry continues to be disrupted, especially, in Sydn-y, and the major reason is the phenomenal level of supposed sick leave that is being taken. For instance, in the past two weeks to last weekend, 90 per cent of air traffic controllers at Sydney took sick leave on a least one day. The present level of sick leave, of course, as that figure would indicate, is well above normal levels. For instance, in the week from 5 May to 12 May, 135 sick days were taken by Sydney air traffic controllers, compared with 20 days for the same period in 1987. On many occasions more than 20 per cent of rostered staff have been off sick. It is clear that sick leave is being used in an orchestrated way to disrupt the operations of the industry, and thllt is a clear breach of the union agreement that was made one month ago. That union agreement with the Civil Aviation Authority involved undertakings that the parties would move to finalise the award restructuring; that there would be a review of staffing levels; that there would be an agreement to seek to upgrade radar equipment at Sydney and Melbourne airports as soon as possible; and that industrial action would cease. Although the agreement involves other matters as well, they were the key elements. While the remainder of the package is being pursued, developed and adhered to, quite clearly industrial action has not ceased. That occurred for aÂ· couple of weeks, but certainly in the past two or three weeks that has not been the case. The level of sick leave now is clearly an indication of the resumption of industrial action and a breach of the agreement ,to obtain pay rises of up to 42 per cent. ,That is what this action is fundamentally about; it is an attempt by the air traffic controllers to break the wage fixing guidelines and to obtain wage increases' of up to 42 per cent. The case is before the Industrial Relations Commission; it has been there for the past couple of days and I understand that the award restructuring is virtually finalised. I am not entirely sure what has come out of particuthe Commission today, although I understand from a rough report that the parties have been sent off to finalise the award restructuring and report back in the next week or so. The air traffic controllers must understand' that this award restructuring is the only way-I stress the words 'the only way'-in which they have any chance of getting a wage increase. There is no way that the Government will consider a wage increase outside the wage fixing guidelines, which' means adherence to the award restructuring principles. The air traffic controllers seem to have been. deluded by some people in their own ranks into believing that the Government will cave in and that there will be, some concession of a wage increase far beyond what could possibly be given under the award restructuring principles. The air traffic controllers in Sydney have to understand that there is no possible hope of that tactic succeeding. A continuance of the action they have been taking will definitely mean no further wage increase but it will mean total confrontation with the Government. The Government has been drawing up its plans as to what it will do if the award restructuring in the Commission today does not lead to an immediate cessation of the industrial action. If that industrial action continues despite 'the acticiri in the Commission today, the air traffic controllers must understandI ask them particularly to bear this in mind at their meeting in Sydney tonight-that they are asking the Government for total confrontation, and they will get it.

81,Dr HEWSON,ECONOMY,I refer the Treasurer to his answer to his first qu-tion today. I ask him to confirm that there will be no further tightening of any of the arms of economic policy in view of the national accounts figures released today which show that the gap between the growth in demand and in production has now widened from 4 to 6 percentage points in the year to the March quarter.,67

83,Dr HEWSON ,ECONOMY,What is the answer?,68
84,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"If the honourable member had listened he would have heard. I said that, in the last week, we have decreased the call on savings by the public sector by $2.75 billion-the better part of one per cent of gross domestic product (GOP). Monetary all conditions are tight; they tightened yesterday when the treasury note tender came in. day we validated those rates, which has tightened the impact of policy further, our wages policy has remained tight. That our position. What is the position of the Opposition? Mr Acting Speaker, let me ask some rhetorinto ical questions. In terms of the fundamental issue of public policy from a prospective budding Commonwealth Treasurer, what is the stance on fiscal policy desirably as objective of the Liberal-National party coalition? To that most fundamental question, honourable members opposite do not have an, answer. On monetary policy shadow Treasurer urges me to continue tightening interest rates. On wages policy, the Opposition's policy is to relate wage creases to productivity. It measures producof tivity as running at less than one per cent. In other words, members of the Opposition think they should be believed and be credible in saying that they would go to the marketquota place, which has been trying - to pay wage increases of 15 per cent, and offer less than one per cent: The Opposition has no fisca- policy. Basically it is arguing all the time for a recession. It is arguing for a tighter fiscal policy and tighter monetary policy, yet it has no wage policy. The fact of the matter not know where the OppositioIi is going. Worse than that, the,Opposi,tion does not have the courage to say where it would like to go. We are sitting on top of the tightest fiscal policy in the Organisation for Ecomitted nomic Cooperation and Development. I am going there at the end of this week. Not one country will have had outlays growth in negative for four years straight. Not one country will have shifted the savings balance by 7 percentage points of GDP. Could honourable members imagine the Opposition cutting Government spending by 5 or 6 percentage points of GOP? All the previous Government ever did was spend it. We have the tightest fiscal, monetary and wages policies in place. The Opposition is incapable of doing any of this. It would fall back to the old routine of putting the burner through the place. It would go back to the scorched earth policy of a recession; that is it is good for. I understand this is to be par for the course, particularly for the Tohonourable member for Wentworth. He would have a recession, because that is what and he advised the former Leader of the Oppois sition last time. He said, 'Put the burner through the place, let us have a recession', We had a recession. That recession put us office and it will keep us there. I NA - - , Mr ,COURTICE-Can the Minister for an Trade Negotiations advise the House as to the success of Australia's action against the sugar import regime of the United States of America under the ,General Agreement on the . Tariffs and Trade (GATT)?",68
85,Mr DUFFY,SUGAR,"As a matter of background, the United States has maintained restrictive inimport quotas on sugar since 1982. The size quotas has declined substantially as far as Australia is concerned, with United States imports of sugar from Australia falling from a high of 715,000 short tonnes in 1981 to a allocation of only 96,343 short tonnes in 1989. Australia's concerns with the United States sugar policy are 110t only that it has a serious effect on our access to the United States market but also that, if the policy continued, the United States would soon a build up unsellable stocks which would lead to exports of heavily subsidised sugar onto is that we do the world market. In 1988 a GATT dispute panel was set up, at Australia's request; to examine the conformity of the United States sugar import quotas with the GATT rules. The panel subits draft report and findings to Australia and the United States on 16 May this year. As I indicated on a previous occasion, the in accordance with the procedures, the panel's report will remain confidential to the parties until 9 June. At that time, if no negotiated solution has been reached, the report will then be circulated to all GATT contracting parties for consideration at the next GATT council meeting, which will take place on 21 June. The keeping of these reports confidential to the parties is a process which is integral to the GATT dispute settlements process because it provides a further opportunity for a negotiated settlement satisfactory to both parties. In light of this it would not be proper to comment in detail on the panel's report. However, from Australia's point of view the findings were solidly based and we believe that they will be welcomed by the Australian sugar industry. In conclusion, the honourable member for Hinkler has a particular interest in this matter. I acknowledge his support and that of the honourable member for Leichhardt, the honourable member for Herbert and the honourable member for Capricornia in our approach to this GATT case and, in particular, the role played in supporting the removal of the domestic sugar embargo. The removal of that embargo would have played no small part in strengthening our ca:se before the GATT. NA",68
86,Dr HEWSON,ECONOMY,I ask the Treasurer again for a simple yes or no answer to this simple question: Will there be any further tightening of any of the arms of economic policy?,69
87,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"The Prime Minister has said, ""and I say it at every press conference, that the Government keeps' all of the policy arms under watch all the time. The Governmentllas been entirely flexible since 1983 in dealing with' ecoriomic conditions as they obtain, and we shall continue to be flexible as they obtain. But, in the Government's judgment, the settings which obtain at the moment are entirely appropriate in moderating the kind of demand conditions that the national accounts reveal. It just shows the sort of manic naivety of the Opposition, particularly of the honourable member for Wentworth, that he is saying, 'Will you please, as Treasurer, say you will not touch policy any further?'. This is supposed to .be someone who understands ,economic policy, which is nonsense. He is .saying, 'Will the Treasurer say that he will not touch ecoI nomic policy any further?'. It is unbelievable. The stupidity of the question is faintmaking.",69

90,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"If a rank backbencher asked such a question as, 'Will the Government say it will not touch policy? Will it confirm it will not tighten policy?'-which was the question-Opposition members-Yes or no.",69
91,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"That is right. It is an absurd question-that I will not tighten policy regardless of what happens; no, the Government will say, 'No, we will not tighten policy; we will wait and see and if the game deteriorates any further we will just not do anything about it'. What sort of a mug is the honourable member? NA",69
92,Mr CUNNINGHAM,TAX CUTS,"Will the Treasurer advise the House of the role the tax cuts to take effect on 1 July will play in moderating wage demands and, thereby, contributing to the correction of Australia's current account imbalance? Mr-KEATING-The Government's wagetax arrangements announced in the April statement will guarantee moderate wages outcomes next year through a period of accelerated demand. This is a new phenomenon in Australian economic history, particularly in the last 15 years. Whenever we have had demand conditions like this we have had a wage explosion, like the one presided over by the former Treasurer and Dr Hewson, now the honourable member for Wentworth, when he was advising him. But on this occasion, because of the wage-tax arrangements, we will not see wages moving at 15 or 16 per cent, as they did in their days, but at 6t per cent. That being the case, our competitiveness will be maintained and, therefore, our prospects of reducing the curre'nt account imbalance improved. This is not the Opposition's policy. I have now seen five or six references from the shadow Treasurer urging that the tax cuts not be implemented. On 3 May the honourable member for Wentworth said: . '. . the Treasurer's April 12 package which lowered the prospective budget surplus by $5.5 billion, That is, through the tax cuts. On 16 May he said, about me: He's busily giving away if you like half his prospective surplus-half his savings-in order to buy his way back into an election victory. He went on to say: And of course as I say he is reducing his prospective surplus by half-he is cutting public sector saving. In other words, the honourable member for Wentworth disapproves of the tax cuts being paid. I am glad to see he is nodding. On 17 May, on John Jost's program, he said: . . . you have the Treasurer on the one hand ruling out any new measures to encourage private sector savings and on the other hand reducing public sector saving. He has the potential' next year of a Budget surplus of $ 1O-$12B and he is giving back. half that in the form of a tax cut package. He is disapproving of it. He goes on to say on 17 May: What about the extent to which he has run down his own public sector savings. Today, in response to Allan Wood asking, 'Do you think the Government should be going ahead with the tax cuts?', he said: But what we were concerned about is putting tax cuts in conjunction with, if you like, wage increases that were unrelated to productivity . . . In other words, if they are not related to productivity, they are too high and the tax cuts should not be paid with them. That is what the Opposition is saying.",69
93,Deus ex machina,TAX CUTS,Opposition members interjectingMONICA,70
94,Mr KEATING,TAX CUTS,"That is the only conclusion to draw. I table these five quotations from the official Opposition spokesman on Treasury matters disapproving of the fact that the tax cuts have been paid. These tax cuts are there to give a moderate wage outcome. This is what the honourable member for Wentworth wrote in 1985 about this subject in the EC(momic Record: . The policy conclusion is clear: limit the rise in wage rates as much as possible. This does not mean striving forzero wage increases for a prolonged period. If too ambitious a program of wage restraint is pursued, it will break down and probably be followed by a wage explosion,. which will increase inflation and unemployment. The appropriate policy is not to strive for the impossible but to see that genuine wage restraint is achieved. That was dead right in 1985 but is dead wrong now. The honourable member for Wentworth, with the world champion conveyancer beside him, is arguing that we ought to have wages related to productivity growth running at under one per cent, which is in contradistinction to what he wrote in 1985. He is urging that the tax cuts not be paid and being so dishonest as to not be entirely explicit about it. What we will have is dishonesty from him, on a basic question of policy. The Leader of the Opposition stands up on the first day of leadership and says, 'Living standards are the issue in this country; living standards need to be improved', while his shadow Treasurer says the tax cuts should be withdrawn. On the one hand we have the Leader of the Opposition being all things to all people and saying living standards ought to be improved, despite the fact that those which we have are built on overseas savings, and the shadow Treasurer saying on five separate occasions-the latest today-that the tax cuts should be withdrawn because they are running down public savings. That is the only conclusion that can be drawn. He is urging that the Government retain a surplus of $10 to $12 billion next year-in other words, that the tax cuts not be paid. I will leave it to the media and the public to decipher which will be the prevailing view within the Opposition. Let us make it clear: the shadow Treasurer is against the tax cuts. He wants to preserve the surplus intact without tax cuts. While he is doing that, his colleagues are arguing for an increase in wages related to productivity, which he understands is running at less than one per cent. NA NA",70
95,Mr TIM FISCHER,PARLIAMENT,"Mr Acting Speaker, did you, last Tuesday, confirm that synchronised sound and picture grabs of the proceedings of the House of Representatives are currently not permitted? Were there breaches of these guidelines last night on, at least, Channel 7 and Channel 10 and, perhaps by degrees, Channel 2 and Channel 9? Whilst the coalition fundamentally supports deregulating and amending these guidelines, will you advise the House what the situation is at present and what action has been taken . in relation to the events of last night?",70
96,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT,"I thank the honourable member for Farrer for his question. The House should be aware that I have received representations from a number of members about the television coverage of an incident in the House yesterday. The facts are that the television stations requested, and were granted by me, as has been the practice of various Speakers over the years, access to the in-house television system during Question Time yesterday so that they could update the file coverage with footage of the new Opposition front bench. I might point out to those members who seem to find this interesting that the Whips of all parties were advised and, I understand, agreed. The usual undertakings were given by the television stations that the footage would not be used in association with simultaneous audio proceedings in the House. I understand that those undertakings were breached by at least one television station. I am concerned by the action of that television station and others, as I am sure honourable members would be. I have decided to refer the matter to the Joint Standing Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings for further consideration. I conveyed this decision to the Press Gallery Committee today. I hope that the Broadcasting Committee will be able to meet some time this week and report to the House.

97,Mr HAWKE ,IMMIGRATION POLICY,"Wills-Prime Minister) (2.50)-I move:' That this House: , (I) acknowledges the important contribution which immigration has made to the economic, social and cultural development of Australia; (2) recognises that bipartisan support for mantlement of the White Australia Policy and the adoption of a non-discriminatory immigration policy have been to the overwhelming national and international benefit of Australia; (3) welcomes the support now publicly expressed by the newly-elected Leader of the Opposition on 9 May 1989 for a non-discriminatory and bipartisan immigration policy; and (4) reaffirms its unambiguous and unqualified commitment to the principle that, whatever criteria are applied by Australian Governments in exercising their sovereign right to determine the composition of the immigration intake, race or ethnic origin shall never, explicitly or implicitly, be among them. The motion before this House today will, I hope, go down in the annals of this Parliament, to the historic credit of every member in this chamber, as relating to the day when all Australians pulled back from the edge of a major national schism. Today we declare that, whatever the temptations, we shall never return to the fear and the prejudice of the past. As a parliament we will exercise leadership. More than two decades ago a coalition Government and a Labor Opposition combined forces in a courageous display of principle and vision to expunge a racist legacy from the public policy of our nation. The national consensus on this issue was rocked in 1984, but on that occasion decency and wisdom prevailed. We thought it would continue to prevail, yet in our bicentennial year, of all times, we were suddenly threatened with a return to the dark days. For 10 months now, since 1 August 1988, Australia has been racked by a divisive and damaging debate that need never have occurred and should never have occurred .. Today, 10 months since it all began, the Opposition is led by a man who is, I trust, prepared to help lead Australia back from the threat of destructiveness of the so-called immigration debate. On 25 August last year, when the House last debated such a motion, the honourable member for Kooyong ( Mr Peacock) reminded us of his own record on this issue. Twenty-seven years previously, he commenced his own political career by getting himself censured by the State executive of his own Party for being critical of my Party's then immigration policy. May I say that I, too, recollect being in a minority within my own Party in those days on this the disissue. Both of our parties have travelled a long way since then. For two decades, until last year, our parties shared the enlightened common ground that race and immigration were volatile elements that should never be mixed. In these past months we have seen what happens when they are. My Government welcomes the stand taken EmptyHere cock) on this fundamental question of principle. His announcement that he would re-establish a bipartisan immigration policy has been applauded by all reasonable sectors of the community. Beyond that, his forthright espousal of racial neutrality on questions of immigration carries with it the potential of national healing for Australia. I pay an unqualified tribute to his principle and his common sense on this issue. This promised return to bipartisanship is also reflected in the return to the Opposition front bench of two members of the Opposition-the honourable member for Dundas ( Mr Ruddock) and the honourable member for Goldstein ( Mr Macphee)-who stood by their convictions and crossed the floor last August. I still recollect the words of the honourable member for Goldstein on that occasion. He said: Non-discrimination is to me the most fundamental thing in my life . . . it is extremely important that the government of the day give the lead and the opposition of the day unequivocally assist in the ed-cation of people about the facts of life. It is in the national interest to dispel fears, not to reflect and endorse them and not to have a knee-jerk reaction to them. Today we are on the verge of a return to a bipartisan immigration policy, a return to the great tradition established by previous Liberal leaders, such as Holt, Gorton, McMahon and Fraser-the same bipartisanship that gave the necessary support to the Holt Government in initiating the dismantling of the White Australia policy. This bipartisan support has contributed to the overwhelming national and international benefit of Australia. Domestically, bipartisanship has offered united political leadership to oppose and to marginalise that tiny and often abhorrent fringe that believes that Australia can turn its back on its future and retreat into the dark recesses of the past. The implication that some of our fellow Australians are second-class citizens is one that no responsible political party or leader should countenance. The ugly incidents of recent months, from verbal vilification to threatened and actual violence, remind us all of the imminent danger of giving any legitimacy to the dark, unreconstructed side of the national psyche. Internationally, this temporary departure from bipartisanship has again projected abroad an image of Australia that for almost a quarter of a century our two parties, both in government and in opposition, have been attempting to correct. How can we hope, as we must, to link the nation's long term economic future with that of our Asian neighbours if at the same time there are doubts about Australia's credentials on such a fundamental issue as racial equality and tolerance? Our neighbours are looking for signals from us that our hands are clean on this issue. The passing of this motion will be greeted by them with relief. I want to remind the House of what I said when we debated a similar motion here last August: One of the great and rare distinctions of Australian political leadership in the last generation has been its bipartisan rejection of race as an element in immigration policy. This has been a triumph of compassion over prejudice, of reason over fear, and of statesmanship over politics. . I say this most sincerely to honourable members on the other side of the House: the Government invites and encourages them to support the motion and to re-embrace unqualified bipartisanship on Australia's immigration policy once and for all. It is once again time to put principle before populism, reason before prejudice, and statesmanship before politics. As in 1967, it is appropriate and necessary for both Government and Opposition to make common cause in the national interest, in the real interests of social cohesion, economic rationality and fundamental principle. This motion represents an unambiguous and unequivocal commitment to such a genuinely non-discriminatory immigration policy. It is a clear statement to Australia and to the world that the White Australia policy, in whatever contemporary guise or nationalistic rhetoric it seeks to express itself, is dead and is buried, and that Australian governments will not include, explicitly or implicitly, race or ethnic origin in their immigration selection criteria. It is an opportunity for all members of this House to endorse a principle and a philosophy that express most powerfully the core of Australian values-that equality can never be compromised by race, colour, belief or country of origin-and to acknowledge the significant contribution that immigrants from all parts of the world can make, have made, and will continue to make to this country. Logically, it is impossible to do that without simultaneously acknowledging, as did the shadow spokesman for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas, last week, that 'Australia is a multicultural society' and that 'multiculturalism plays a significant part in ensuring that we have successful settlement of people in Australia'. The Leader of the Opposition himself said last August: In my own view I am very happy with multiculturalism, provided it doesn't override a loyalty tralia. Let me say that I could not agree more. On Australia Day last year I said that what defines an Australian is simply a commitment to Australia. Since then I have repeated that multiculturalism presumes an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia, to its interests and. to its future. Put simply, if we are to continue to select migrants without regard for the colour of' their skin or their country of birth and if we are to make them feel at home in our society so that they are treated as equals and are able to contribute all their skills and talents, then we need a supportive and complementary domestic policy. That is what multiculturalism is about. The Government remains strongly and absolutely committed to multiculturalism. We hope that at some future time the Opposition will once again embrace support for this important principle. I remind honourable members that it was in the autumn sittings last year on 17 March that this House, in the old Parliament House, voted unanimously t9 express supportÂ· for multiculturalism. However, in orper to give the coalition parties time to work out a revised position on this issue, and so as not to cloud the fundamentally overriding issue of racial equality, the Government has quite deliberately not sought to include a reference to multiculturalism in this motion. I hope that the spirit in which the Government drafted the motion and glj.ve the Opposition a full week's notice on the motion and the wording of it will pervade this debate. For the information of the House, I table the letter which I sent to the honourable member for Kooyong on 17 May. Despite our efforts to provide notice of motion, which we did, we learned only through the media of proposed amendments to it. My office, and the office of Senator Ray, made every effort right up until 11 p.m. last night to obtain advice of the amendments from the offices of the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Dundas. We explicitly sought them on the basis that, if at all possible, we would accept them. Unfortunately cooperation was not forthcoming. It was made clear by the honourable member for Dundas and Senator to AusAlston that the Opposition's amendment, the so-called nine principles, was put forward only on the basis that it should replace the Government motion. When they approached the office of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) 15 'minutes before this motion was to be debated in the Senate this morning, the Minister made it clear that we were willing to consider accepting the nine points as an addendum to our motion in the interests of parliamentary unity. So, too, did Senator Button in the ensuing debate. Let me reiterate that we,on the Government side, are willing to take the nine points put forward by the Opposition as an addendum to our motion although I should note that the so-called bipartisan principles are considerably different from the nine fundamental migration principles presented in the annual report of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. I note with profound disappointment, for example, that point nine has carefully removed reference to a multicultural society. Nevertheless, if acceptance of the nine points as an addendum to our motion will allow us to speak with a' single voice, we will do it, but we cannot and will hot accept the nine principles as an alternative to our motion. Some of the principles are clear, but others are open to a range of interpretations. As the tragic events of the last 10 months have revealed, the fact is that some members of the Opposition-I emphasise some members-have been all too willing to hide behind such ambiguities and to appeal to racist sentiment in the guise of high principle. For example, principle 3 states: That the size and composition of migrant intakes should not jeopardise social cohesiveness and harmony within the Australian community. I know what members on this side of the House mean by that; namely that we will ensure that government policies-multiculbipartisalJ. tural policies-will be implemented to ensure that our cultural diversity goes hand in hand with social harmony and support for our overarching institutions. But I also know, do all members of the House, the way that principle has been misused by some members of the Opposition to defend and justify the selection of immigrants on racial grounds. During the unfortunate events' of 1988, those members of the Opposition most vocal on the issue of social cohesion claimed that despite the changes to their policy nothing had fundamentally changed on the issue of racial non-discrimination. It has been sugter! gested that following the statement by the Leader of the Opposition on 9 May no their amendment to the Opposition's immigration policy is required. It is simply necessary to remind the House of the comments made by Senator Stone. When asked by George Negus on the Channel 9 Today program on 15 September 1988 whether the revised Opposition immigration policy meant fewer Asian immigrants, Senator Stone replied categorically: That is so . . . if we've gone through this four or five weeks of absolute turmoil in order to have nothing changed, what a lot of goats we'd look, wouldn't we? That was Senator Stone's interpretation. It is a position that we, on this side of the House, absolutely and unqualifiedly rejectWe repudiate as arrant nonsense the idea that people of any race, colour, ethnic group or religion present a threat to social harmony or are less likely. to be .committed to the future of this nation. The key point, however, whiCh is of enormous satisfaction to the Government, is that the Senate nevertheless passed a motion unanimously on a principle on which it was deeply divided only a few months . ago. I urge the House to take the same action. Let us never again in this House, in this Parliament, in our time, hear the. voices of rancour and discord that have been sounded in debate on this issue. Let us send a message to all Australians and to the countries of our region that the Australian Parliament has restored unity and unanimity on the fundamental principle of a non-discriminatory immigration policy. Australia needs leadership on the question of immigration and its needs leadership. I therefore call upon all members of this House to put the events .of the past year behind us and join together in a return to responsible nationa11eadership as on the question of immigration. Let this divisive debate end today. Although we may differ on the details of immigration policy, never again let us part company on the fundamental principle of racial equality. EmptyHere Opposition) (3.07)-This motion has all the overtones of a political stunt. Look at the Government members departing from the chamber. They are so interested in this matIt is the typical tactic of members of the Australian Labor Party. If they cannot dump own views on us, they will walk out. I have a newspaper editorial that sums it up.",71
98,Deus ex machina,IMMIGRATION POLICY,"Government members interjectingEmptyHere ship, will you? After that sanctimony I am not surprised. The article, headed 'Tawdry tactics', was in the West Australian newspaper of Wednesday, 24 May 1989. It states: The Federal Government should drop the idea of launching a motion in Parliament against any racial discrimination in immigration policy. The Government will have a lot to answer for if, for the sake of political point-scoring, it merely revives the ugly immigration debate which was so damaging to the nation last year. EmptyHere pledged that the Liberals would return to a nondiscriminatory bipartisan immigration policy. The matter should be allowed to rest there. I endorse the remarks that I made at that first press conference after I was elected leader-it is hardly surprising. No party and no individual in this Parliament has a monopoly on compassion or on non-discrimination but if one listens to the sanctimony of the remarks by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) one would think that he can rewrite history, as I will show. I will place my Party's record in government beside Labor's and there will be no doubt who has the better record-it is us. The last time we were in government the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr MACKellar) was the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and he adopted a set of principles to guide Australia's immigration program. He did this in 1978. These principies have been endorsed by the Hawke Government and by successive Ministers for immigration; for example, by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr West, in 1983, and by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hurford, in 1986. It is these principles that represent the bipartisan 'consensus the Prime Minister professes to support. We do not agree with much of his administration of. the portfolio, and we have said so. The FitzGerald Commission of Inquiry to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies did not either, and on the practice therefore of the principles, which he has conceded, there can be differences. But if it is genuine as distinct from confected agreement that the Prime Minister is looking for, then he ought in fact to be voting for an amendment I will move which restates those principles. Any other approach is simply, in my view, a political ploy. For exaQ'lple, he addresses a particular element. Honourable members should have a look at the amendment that will be circulated in my name which I will move at the end of this address. For example, principle 4, to which, we have always subscribed, states: . . . the principle of non-discrimination means that the policy should be applied consistently to all applicants regardless of their race, colour, nationality, descent, national or ethnic origin, sex or religion. There is a whole series of others which the Government has endorsed. One would expect therefore that the Government would have no problem in withholding its devious little resolution as a whack at the previous Leader of the Opposition. We will not get into that. Why play politics on the issue? If the overriding consideration is an endorsement of the principles of bipartisanship, then it is clear; The fact is that the Government tried a ratty little ploy, the press picked it up, and the Government has fun away and is now saying, 'Oh, if we could have an addendum'. We do not want these attached to some criticism of the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard). We want the Government to do what it is asking for: endorse a set of principles which it has endorsed before, and which today, in this House, it is walking away from. Incidentally, the principles form the basis of the coalition's policy on immigration, which I naturally support and which I table in the House today. In that policy, the nine amendments are supplementedMONICA",74
99,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION POLICY,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition cannot table a document without seeking leave. EmptyHere document. Leave granted. EmptyHere principles are supplemented by two recommendations of the FitzGerald report which scathingly attack the Australian Labor Party's record of administration. Those two recommendations, which are additional, concern citizenship and the rights and duties of immigrants. Basically, they are the sameadditions as are included in the Government's own revised migrant entry handbook. The path ought to be absolutely clear. We have kept the amendment to the principles which the Government professes to endorse. Let us endorse them today, without addition and without qualification; without petty political points and with the genuine spirit that the Prime Minister claims he wants. I have reason to doubt the Prime Minister's bona fides in this arena. I also' have reason to doubt his Party's bona fides in this arena. This is something that has occupied me for almost the entire period of my political career. As I mentioned last time, in 1961, when 1 first stood for parliament, the Party now in goyernment-then in opposition-had within its platform the maintenance of. the White Australia policy. I campaigl1ed against that. Then in ,due course, when I was endorsed in-Kooyong and came into'this Parliament, that Party had allegedly amended its platform and had expunged it, from the record. But who did it have on its front bench in those' days? It had one Frederick Michael Daly. I used to listen in the corridors of this Parliament as grubby, so-called senior Labor politicians, with a wink wink and a nudge nudge, talked about how great and. shrewd it was to have Freddy Daly traversing the country to keep the old and the bold faithful to the cause because they did not agree with this abandonment of the White Australia policy either. It was sickening and it was despicable. Fred Daly stayed there arid stayed there as a token gesture to the past, to keep the old guard happy. That was that Party at that time. Let me take the House to 1975, a time which was to set the scene for the largest influx of people from Asia to Australia. Near the time of the fall of Saigon I pleaded with the then Government, as did others, to open its arms to those who were seeking freedom and refuge from a war-torn country. I pleaded particularly on behalf of those I had come. to know who were working in the Australian Embassy in Saigon. All that transpired when Whitlam was Prime Minister at that time was that one-one-Iocally engaged staffer was allowed to come to Australia. The restÂ·were abandoned, despite contrary recommendations explicitly put to the Government of the day by the Embassy staff, ranging from the Ambassador down, who indicated that a number of them could be at risk if they were left abandoned in Saigon. Whitlam later attacked those Vietnamese who had worked for us and others who might have wanted to come as-expletive deleted-'Vietnamese BaIts'. Let me explain, for the elucidation of the House, that 'BaIts' were mentioned because earlier Whitlam had unilaterally granted de jure recognition to the Soviet Union of the Baltic states. The Baltic community in this country was appalled that with the stroke of a pen this could be done. That is how that reference has come in. Secondly, there was a lot of pressure in theÂ· Parliament at that time, just before the fall of Saigon, about the future of some children. Under great pressure, Prime Minister Whitlam, with a decision of great magnanimity, allowed one-I repeat, one-plane load of orphans to be flown to Australia. We had the unedifying spectacle of Embassy officials being directed urgently to scour the orphanages of Saigon to fill that plane-that one plane-to meet a current domestic political pressure. That was the one and only contribution he would make at that time. I know this because I was there around that time. In the later 1970s, when the boat people started to come, the Liberal Party, following the tradition it has had for such a long period, decided that this country must accept these people who were coming to our shores. The honourable member for Warringah was Minister for Immigration at that time and I was the Foreign Minister. I can recall on more than one occasion being confronted by journalists quoting the words of one R. J. L. Hawke, President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and President of the Australian Labor Party, criticising us for taking these people. I will not use all of the quotes. I frankly find that period so distasteful I do not want to go into that; I mean that. I remember the Prime Minister in Darwin and elsewhere and I therefore regard his speech today as sanctimonious in the extreme. I will just read one of these quotes. I heard the words of the present Prime Miriister when he was talking about compassion at that time. He said: Of course - e should have compassion but people who are coming in this way are not the only people in the world who have rights to our compassion. Any sovereign country has the right to determine how it will exercise its compassion. That was a nice bit of manipulative compassion, if ever I have heard it: how it will exercise its compassion and how it will increase its population. I have been around this issue for too long. The Prime Minister did me one favour by referring to the censuring of me by a division of my Party. I have a very long re-ord in this arena, but so too has my Party. My Party has a very distinguished record in this arena. I say today on hehalf of my Party and the National Party that there is bipartisanship over these fundamental principles. They have been endorsed by the Labor Party, and if there is such a desire for us to speak with one voice on the principles we pursue in the field of immigration, than all the Government has to do is forget the addendum it has elsewhere and pick up these principles and endorse them without reference to statements by other people. It is the endorsement of the principles that is important, not the playing of politics. Just as it did 48 hours ago, the Government has now fallen into a trap of its own making. If I felt strongly about it the other day, I can tell the House I feel far more strongly about it today. I listened to a man who played with this issue 12 years ago and who has come in today speaking in a. tone that is the antithesis of that. But I remember, and many people here remember, that when we were seeking to persuade people to a humanitarian view and a proper approach, there was one man standing in our way, and it is a record of hypocrisy that does not stand up with what was said today.",75

EmptyHere That all words after 'That this House:' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'reaffirms the nine bipartisan principles of t-alian immigration endorsed by successive Governments, namely: Principle number 1 That it is fundamental to national sovereignty that the Australian Government alone should determine who will be admitted to Australia: no person, other than an Australian citizen, has a basic right to enter Australia. Principle number 2 That apart from people admitted as refugees and for family reunion, migrant entry criteria should be developed on the basis of benefit to the Australian community, and the social, economic and related requirements. within Australia: as a general rule, Australia should not admit for settlement people who would represent an economic burden to Australia through inordinate claims on welfare, health or other resources; who would endanger the community by criminal or other anti-social activities; or whose entry would be to their own detriment. Principle number 3 That the size and composition of migrant intakes should not jeopardise social cohesiveness and harmony within the Australian community. Principle number 4 That immigration policy should be applied on a basis which is non-discriminatory: there are external restraints on the extent to which Australia can apply a non-discriminatory policy; some countries will not allow their nationals to emigrate; other countries allow only those with exit permits to leave; some countries will not permit the emigration of skilled and professional workers; some countries will not allow advertising for migration purposes; others will not allow immigration offices to be established within their territories, or allow immigration officers to operate within their territories and, in addition, there are varying degrees of interest in migration to Australia in particular areas-the principle of non-discrimination means that the policy should be applied consistently to all applicants regardless of their race, colour, nationality, descent, national or ethnic origin, sex or religion. Principle number 5 That applicants should be considered for migration as individuals or individual family units, not as community groups: an exception would be refugees in designated refugee situations, although even in such circumstances the criteria for selection should be related to the characteristics of individual applicants. Principle number 6 That eligibility and suitability standards for migrants should reflect Australian social mores and Australian laws: polygamous unions should not be accepted, nor the entry of child fiances or fiancees, the concept of immediate family, Ausfor eligibility purposes, should be derived from the Australian norm, i.e. the unit consisting of husband, wife and minor unmarried children. Principle number 7 That migration to Australian should be for permanent settlement although there should be no barrier preventing the departure of persons wishing to leave: the guest-worker migration flow, until recently popular in the industrialised countries of Western Europe, should not be adopted for Australia. Principle number 8 That while migrants should have the same rights as other Australian residents to choose their place of residence individually or collectively, enclave settlement should not be encouraged: immigration policy should not consider communities for mass movement to Australia in situations where closed enclave settlement would occur. Principle number 9 That polices governing entry and settlement should be based on the premise that migrants should integrate into Australian society: migrants should be given every opportunity, consistent with this premise, to preserve and disseminate their ethnic heritage'.",77

131,Mr JULL ,INFRASTRUCTURE,"Fadden) (3.38)-This is the third occasion this year on which the Opposition has presented to this House a matter of public importance expressing its concern and fears about the present development and administration of aviation in Australia. Today we must once again place on the record those fears and those concerns. In Question Time today, in answering a question from the honourable member for Bowman, ( Mr Sciacca), the present Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr WiIIis) gave us on this side of the House no joy at all as to whether we will see any improvement in the administration of aviation in this country. Never before have we seen so much chaos in the airways, especiaIly around Sydney. Never before have we seen direct evidence of what that chaos is doing to the economy of this country. I quote an Australian Associated Press report from this mqrning which has already appeared in most of the major newspapers of Australia. , That report stated: Tourism chiefs say the air traffic controllers' dispute which has closed Sydney Airport more than a dozen times since' February has cost Australia millions of lost tourist dollars. ' Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia Chairman Len Taylor says in the past few days overseas deals worth more than $5m-many from the UShave been' cancelled because of complaints stemming from air traffic control disputes earlier this year. Mr Taylor says Canberra should intervene to stop any more contracts being lost. He says he was told on a recent visit to Japan that the number of Japanese tourists being sent by their travel agents to Australia is down as much as 50 per cent on last year. He says the major complaint is about the many problems of Sydney Airport and particularly the impact of the controllers' actions. That says it all. At a time when Australia has a huge balance of payments deficit and we are after every bit of foreign currency can lay our hands on, we have this ongoing dispute. We congratulate the Minister on his statement today that, if the resolution does not come about later in the day, he will tough. The last time we debated in the House a matter similar to that being debated today was on 12 April. We were told on 12 April that the Minister was going to get tough, that the stand-down provisions were there, that the Government had done all the right things, and that we were not going to have the problems. I hope that his statement toof day proves to be a bit more fruitful than one he made more than six weeks terday Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport was once more in absolute chaos. Most of us in this House have had to experience the delays that have been going on at that airport for months and months. Yesterday we got to the farcical situation of the air traffic controllers allowing 10 slots per hour to handle the traffic at the busiest airport in Australia. We could concentrate our debate today purely on what is going on with air traffic controllers, but the whole administration aviation in Australia has been a disaster der the present Administration. The problem in Australia is more than that of the air traffic controllers in Sydney, where there an international air terminal that is a farce and that is now being extended five years too late. We have inadequate radar systems at Sydney Airport; they are more than 20 years old. Time and time again we are told that they will be upgraded, but they have not been upgraded yet. That is part of the problem. In answer to a question in Senate yesterday Senator Gareth Evans, who handles aviation matters in that chamber national airport. admitted at last that inadequate radar sys: terns operate at Tullamarine Airport Melbourne and at Perth and Adelaide airfrom ports. What a dreadful situation! This Administration got the wrong equipment: ordered route surveillance systems, systems that were not adequate to handle arriving and departing traffic at those busy airports of Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. We know the situation at Cairns Airport, the fastest growing airport in Australia. The radar problem there is simply that it is non-existent. Time and time again, since Cairns was opened up as an international airport, we the Government has been called on to provide those facilities so that that terribly busy airport can handle its air traffic safely and well. We are now told that that radar will get be installed, and it will probably be two years before we see it in full operation. We saw the tragedy at Coolangatta last year. Once again, inadequate radar protection was involved. We know the situation that exists in Darwin. Certainly, extensions are being made there, but the Darwin terminal is substandard and has been for years. We know the difficulties in Perth, where there is a the brand new international terminal. What a ago. Yeswhite elephantÂ· that is! Brisbane is fast becoming the second busiest international airport in Australia. It has a tin shed for an international terminal and five gates, but it is now becoming the principal alternative airport to Sydney. A few weeks ago during the Sydney air traffic controllers' strike, 13 747s were on the runways and the parking bays at Brisbane international airport in a scene that was described by the local newspaper as resembling a of supermarket Up to 5,000 people were locked unaway on those aircraft, unable to get out for 2! hours. What an absolute disgrace this is! What an absolute farce it is when we conis sider that we now regard ourselves as the foremost sophisticated international tourist market in the world. We are providing Third World facilities for aviation. Frankly, our international visitors would be treated better at the airport in Managua, Nicaragua, than they ever would at the major airports of Australia. What a <iisgrace that is! I have the been to Managua and I would rather go through there than through Sydney's interLet us look at the domestic situation. The in Government has trumpeted the fact that 1 November next year we will go into deregulation of our domestic air services. I it doubt whether we will ever see another major domestic airline operator being able to operate in Australia. I sincerely hope that the Trade Practices Commission will soon present its report on that hideous deal done in the middle of the night between Senator Evans and the present major operators that tied up the domestic terminals for the next 20 to 25 years. The Government says it will be all very well because any new operator would have to be able to have two gates at either terminal. Do those opposite honestly believe that a serious airline would go in under the terms and conditions imposed in a competitive situation by Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines and expect to get a fair deal? Of course, they will not. Sydney is the major problem; Where can the extension there go? The only place it can go is on the international terminal. Melbourne is a problem. Where will the new facility there go? It will have to go miles away from the present terminal. If the people of Australia at this stage believe that they will get any major advantage from den-guÂ­ lation of our domestic air services, they should think again. Unless this Government changes those leases, unless there is a facility for new operators to come into the. scheme of things, I very much doubt that new domestic operators will be able to get their act up and running. Two major concerns want tQ get into the business of providing a deregulated service; they want to get into the business of at last being able to provide the people of Australia with fair air fares. Let us never forget, despite what the Government says, that the people of Australia pay some of the most expensive air fares in the world because of the system that we have wrapped up at the moment. The Government has to come clean and facilitate the full deregulation of the domestic industry. We could go on about the equipment problems being faced by Qantas Airways Ltd and by Australian Airlines. We have debated before the very real difficulties that Qantas faces in terms of staff shortages. We could debate what has happened because of the direction by Qantas to close down its training facilities for engineers. Qantas is a fully owned government company at the moment, and this Government must take some responsibility for that decision. Look at the export dollars that are now being sent overseas because Qantas has to utilise United Airlines, Aer Lingus in Ireland-would you believe-and KLM in Amsterdam to service the aircraft. Rather than being an employer of young Australians and technically equipping young Australians, our major carrier is exporting jobs and hard currency overseas to be able to pay for that. We were told by.the Government that its new arrangement would be magnificent. It said that it would set up the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) and that we would then have efficiency in the running of aviation services in Australia. Would I be too bold if I suggested that the establishment of the CAA and the F AC was an ideal way for the Government to get itself out of the mess, to hand over the problem, because it was all too hard? The Government spoke of efficiency. I will tell the House how inefficient our present system is. Presently on the staff of the CAA there are. 7,600 people; the Federal Airports Corporation employs 1,020 people. Honourable members should remember that the old Department was to be got rid of. They will be pleased to know that 600 people are still left sitting in that Department. That gives us a grand total of 9,000 people involved in the administration of aviation in Australia. At Brisbane Airport there is a staff of 130 people. I am darned if I can find out or work out what 130 people have to do to occupy their time there. The statistics are interesting. Seven thousand aircraft are on the Australian register. Therefore, 9,000 people are employed to administer 7,000 aircraft. In the United States the ratio is one employee for every three aircraft. That really sums it up. The sad thing is that what has really happened is that the high standards that Australian aviation enjoyed for so long, including the atti-. tude around the world that Australia was foremost in the aviation industry, are fast going. It is pathetic that to a great extent the CAA and the F AC now have to focus on becoming revenue raising bodies rather than administrators, assistants and facilitators of that industry. There is a state of crisis in general aviation in Australia, and it would do the Government well to go around and talk to industry bodies and private operators, because people are leaving that industry at 100 miles an hour. In fact, there are now pilot shortages in the 'general aviation area. We have all heatd representations from aircraft owners about the new gate charges. No-one knows the legality of those charges. There is a situation where people are paying fees at an airport that is run by the FAC in, say, Melbourne whereas here in Canberra, where the airport is half owned and operated by the Royal Australian Air Force, the RAAF looks after the runways and the infrastructure but the people of Canberra pay the same rates as people at Archerfield Airport pay. We have seen the amazing situation where the charges that are being levied in some airports are much greater than in others; we have seen a situation where some of the charges relating to aircraft operation have increased by 800 per cent since the advent of the FAC; and we have seen 'a situation where some sections of the general aviation industry are threatening to revolt and are at least taking legal action and obtaining legal advice about the constitutionality of these charges. A crisis point is coming for general aviationin Australia, and obviously the Government is not prepared to do too much about it. The real situation is that the Government threw over the whole administration of civil aviation in Australia to the FAC and the CAA and said, 'Righto fellows, you make it pay for yourselves because we are working on too small' a base'. That action was not considered, and now it is the small aircraft operators who have to pick up the tab. That is not right or fair, and it will impact on the standard of living of many Australians, especially those in rural areas. We face the most remarkable situation where a commercial director of one of the major aerodromes for light aircraft in Australia has come out quite' publicly and said that he would rather pay time and a half on a Saturday to have FAC personnel mow the airport grounds rather than employ private enterprise at one-third the cost. The trouble is that the bureaucracy in the F AC and the CAA is still running rampant, and there are no business principles in what is supposed to be a business operation. The F AC is of particular embarrassment to the Government, and the Government admits that, but the sad thing is that the safety standards and operations of Australian aviation will suffer unless there is drastic reform-and soon.",81

However, the Opposition is totally ignoring a couple of fundamental points. The first is the obvious question, 'What are the Opposition's policies and what did it ever do about the situation?' One would think that the problems referred to' by the honourable member arose overnight but, in reality, these problems have existed for many years. M .. Connolly-You have made it worse.",84
134,Mrs KELLY,INFRASTRUCTURE,"This Government has not made the situation worse, but the success of the Government's policies, particularly in the tourism area, has made, the situation much worse. There is no doubt about that. One of the reasons why there is huge pressure on our aviation infrastructure in this country is the undoubted success of this Government's tourism policy. I will refer to that matter later. The second factor is that this Government has been prepared to make decisions and initiate policies. Further, we have made a major decision to deregulate. The Opposition talked and talked about deregulation, but never at any stage was it prepared to take these tough deCisions. This Government is spending an enormous amount of money through its agencies the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) on infrastructure support of the airways and airports, and I will refer to that matter later. Again, the Opposition failed to say what it would do-with the exception of one proposal. Members opposite have said that they would sack the people in the F AC' and the CAA. That is no solution to the problem at all. We admit that the problem exists. There is enormouS strain on infrastructure around this country but we heard no constructive comments at all from the Opposition. I reiterate the points that were raised by the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) in Question Time today about the important issue of the air traffic controllers' dispute, because that is the one aspect of the previous speaker's contribution on which, I assure honourable members, there is agreement. The air traffic controllers' dispute has gone on for longÂ· enough. In the week beginning 6 May, 135 sick days were taken, compared with 20 in the same period in 1987. Mr Tim .Fischer-Is that a symptom of a bigger problem?",84
135,Mrs KELLY ,INFRASTRUCTURE,"Sure, it is a symptom of some problem at Sydney airport.. It is a symptom of the fact that the air traffic controllers are not abiding by an agreement that they reached with the CAA on the weekend of 15 and 16 April. The CAA has kept its side of the agreement; the controllers in Sydney have not. ItÂ· is integral to any agreement, to any undertaking, that both sides abide by the agreement. Surely even members opposite would agree with that. What this Government has done through the CAA is to try to facilitate an agreement and a sensible discussion so that these matters go to arbitration. The controllers should honour their undertaking in this agreement of the weekend of 15 and 16 April. We wait for them to do that. I now address some of theÂ· reasons why there is a fantastic strain on the aviation infrastructure around Australia. The answer goes back to a point that was made yesterday by the previous speaker the honourable member for Fadden. Regarding tourism, the other part of his shadow portfolio-which he obviously forgot about today-he said that tourism is now second only to wool as Australia's biggest export earner. Obviously, that has a huge economic effect overall. I will not refer to that issue, but obviously there is enormous benefit to this country, and it is one of the reasons why there has been such a strain on our infrastructure. I cite the example of Qantas Airways Ltd. From 1981 to 1983 Qantas sustained a loss, but from 1984 to 1988 profits increased considerably-from $58m in 1984 to $153m in 1988. That is the economic effect for Australia's international airline, and those figures do not cover the number of jobs created, the money that international tourists spend in Australia or the countless benefits of tourism. It is hard to see from the Qantas bottom line the bad effect that this Government might have had on tourism. What are we supposed to do? Should we say to people, 'Don't come to Australia, .because we don't have the huge infrastructure support.'? This Government is saying, 'Come to Australia. We are doing all we can to expand our infrastructure support in the aviation area.' This matter of public importance is total nonsense. We considered the issue of safety. Of course, one of the reasons why there is now such emphasis on safety is that the skies are busier. If the Opposition had its way, there would not be a safety problem, because members opposite do not want any planes to fly in. Is that the sort of policy that members opposite have? Let us have a sensible argument and discussion about this matter. Let us try to achieve bipartisan support. Why do not members opposite stand up and say, 'Congratulations. The Government has done a great job in tourism and, as a result, there is pressure on the infrastructure'. We all know that. But what would members ppposite do? They say that they would sack people in the F AC and CAA, but that would not help. ,Regarding safety, the Government commissioned a report which was released in February this year and which recognises that there at:e fundamental legislative and organisational difficulties regarding aviation safety standards. I am now aware of those difficulties. I was aware of them years ago when I was a member of a parliamentary committee, but not. a great deal happened in those years. Action was not taken under the Liberal Government. I am now taking action in relation to those problems. Most of the recommendations in that report will be implemented. It is interesting to note that the Civil A viation Act was introduced into this Parliament in 1988. It was the first piece of aviation legislation concerning aviation safety put before this Parliament since 1960. The previous time any aviation safety legislation had been before this House was 1960. ThatÂ· says a great deal for the activities of the previous Government. In 10 years of conservative administration nothing was done to establish a rational, workable framework for aviation safety standards. That is the story behind this issue. The Opposition blames the Government for the enormous pressure on our aviation infrastructure. We have that pressure because we have been successful in the tourism area; we have had a huge tourist boom. Mr Tim Fischer-Where is the radar?",85
136,Mrs KELLY,INFRASTRUCTURE,"I will talk about the radar. Where is the radar and where is the infrastructure? Unlike members of the Opposition, who just talk and have no policy, this Government is actually delivering on these matters. Let us look firstly at the radar. Urgent action is being taken to replace radar sensors throughout this country. Contracts are expected to be let in July for the acquisition and installation of new radar sensors throughout Australia at a cost of $140m. The first sensors are scheduled for Cairns and Coolangatta in late 1989, followed by sensors for Sydney and Melbourne. As I have said, currently a lot of the radar equipment is between 25 and 30 years old. It must be replaced and it is being replaced. The message I want to get across today is that the Government acknowledges that there is a problem and it is acting on it. Some of the newer equipment, for example, the ATCARDS system in Melbourne, has not performed as well as expected. Whose fault is that? Basically, we have to say that it is not performing as well as expected. It was commissioned in April 1988. An amount of $lm has been spent since on software and hardware enhancement. The new sensors I mentioned earlier will help. An options paper either to upgrade or replace ATCARDS, which is also in use in Adelaide and Perth, will be available at the end of June. Obviously I will look at that. This Government regards it as an important priority. We are spending money on rectifying it. The other issue the Opposition raised is the massive infrastructure support around our airports. Members of the Opposition talked about the number of planes in the sky but they forgot to mention that people actually fly in them. We are concerned about the safe arrival of people in this country and providing reasonable services at airport terEmptyHere support not only the number of planes in the sky but also the number of people who actually use the service. This Government is presiding over the most massive investment program on airport infrastructure in Australian aviation. The Federal Airports Corporation, which by the way is another Labor Government initiative, commenced operation only on 1 January EmptyHere $454m worth of expenditure on major airports, inclUding massive expenditure on a new international terminal building at Sydney and works at Brisbane and Melbourne. In fact, my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West) recently announced the referral of the expansion of the international terminal at Melbourne to the Joint Committee on Public Works. The Government has taken the decisions to provide this infrastructure. I am the first to admit. that this will not happen overnight, but the commitment has been made and action is being taken. The Government has also taken the tough decision on Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. As many of my colleagues know, that was not an easy decision. Mr Tim Fischer-It took you a long while.",86
137,Mrs KELLY,INFRASTRUCTURE,It did not take us a long time. We made .the decision. The trouble with the Opposition is that it does not have policies on anything. Today in this debate we have not heard about any of the Opposition's policies on any issue in aviation. What is the Opposition's answer to every problem? It would sack everyone in the F AC and the CAA. Simplistic solutions do notÂ· work. I would hope for bipartisan support on some of these issues. I would have thought that the safety of our airways would have been one issue on which the Government and the Opposition could have had some bipartisan agreement. Mr Smith-No one is disputing that.,86
138,Mrs KELLY,INFRASTRUCTURE,"Today we heard nothing constructive at all in the Opposition's comments. Basically, we have a commitment for enormous infrastructure support at our airport terminals. If honourable members opposite had read the F AC submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure-I bet that no Opposition members have actually read it-they would see that the FAC envisages the commitment of not only $451m in 1989-90 but also a further $1.6 billion over the eight years to 1998. Why do we need to spend allÂ· this money? Firstly, we need it because tourism, under this Government, has been such a success. Secondly, we need it because of the years of neglect by the previous Government of any infrastructure around our airports. Why do we need to spend all this money? A lot of the airport had been run down because of the inertia and inaction when the mob opposite were in govern-ent. We are taking action to deal with the radar problems, the safety issues and the infrastructure support at airports. We would like some sort of support from the Opposition. The CAA is spending a great deal of money in providing airways investment. It is planning major capital works to modernise and restructure its air traffic infrastructure. This aims both to improve productivity and replace facilities nearing the end of their operational life. 1I have told the House about the radar. The present program is estimated to cost over $240m over a seven-year period. The major elements of the program are: First, the consolidation of staff into five main centres, which was the main issue raised by the Opposition. We are trying to get more effective use of our people and obviously this is possible through the use of modern communications technology, such as satellites. Secondly, the commissioning of a new aeronautical data interchange network. Thirdly, the introduction of new air traffic service centres at Brisbane and Sydney; a new approach control at Canberra Airport using improved technology. Finally, the establishment of a national aeronautic information processing system and centralised briefing units. 1I have gone through these matters in some detail to prove to the Opposition that this Government is acting on what it has identified as a great need in Australia: to provide better infrastructure support for our massive tourism area and a better system for our domestic travellers. We need support from the Opposition. We would also appreciate a bit of support from the air traffic controllers as we work to provide a better service in this country. If the air traffic controllers used the channels open to them instead of acting in a very arbitrary way in closing down airports I am sure we would see a much better service around this country which would also enhance our international aviation record. .",86
139,Mr SHARP ,INFRASTRUCTURE,"Gilmore) (4.08)-1 welcome the contribution made by the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support ( Mrs Kelly). It has enlightened us considerably. Today she made several claims in this House, many of which were totally false. For example, the Minister claimed that the Opposition has no constructive comments to make. However, earlier in her speech she said that she agreed with many of the points we had made and she thanked us for them. She also said that we have no policy in these areas. 1 take this opportunity to point out to the Minister that we happen to have policies. 1I have a policy in front of me now which is called a tourism policy. Unfortunately, 1 did not bring with me the Opposition's aviation policy. 1 could have done so if 1 had had the time; we also have one of those. Within that policy document the Minister will find some very constructive comments which, if she read them, highlight the fact that, ages ago, we decided that we would do some of the things that need to be done to Australia's aviation industry to solve the problems we have today. We started to try to solve those problems back in 1982. During the Minister's speech 1 heard the honourable member for Canning ( Mr Gear) interject that we were not going to do anything about the third runway at Sydney Airport. 1 take this opportunity to remind the honourable member that, at the end of 1982, the then Fraser-Anthony Government made a decision in Cabinet to go ahead with that third runway. Unfortunately, that was never done because the Australian Labor Party got into government and put the lid on it. This Government stopped it and it has been stopping it ever. since. We have had a ridiculous debate going on during this year about a third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport or another airport altogether at Badgerys Creek. While I am speaking on that subject, 1 take this opportunity to point out that had the Government followed the decision that was made at the end of 1982, we would not have this problem today; Sydney Airport would have that extra runway operating, and we would not have the congestion which we currently have. If there had been a Liberal National Party government in office since 1983, we would have done something about the radar, too. The Minister asks us what would we do, and I can assure her that we would have done something about that. We would have built the third runway and dealt with the problems with radar throughout Australia. The Minister made many points in her speech today. During the last eight years, I think it is, air traffic has increased at Mascot airport to the tune of 60 per cent, yet nothing has been done to upgrade the radar; nothing has been done to increase space at the airport for extra traffic. Nothing has been done at all. The Minister makes a great play of the marvellous things which this Government has done for the tourism industry. I have been the shadow Minister for tourism. I have had to sit and enjoy the galling experience at conferences of listening to two Ministers for Tourism in this Government claim full credit for everything that has gone on in the tourism industry. I can assure the Minister that the growth of the tourism industry has more to do with private entrepreneurs throughout Australia than with this Labor Government. That growth would have happened with or without this Government, I can assure the Minister. This Government's policies have not helped in any way whatsoever. Indeed, the Minister should speak to some of those tourist operators, and they will tell her exactly what they think about some of the things this Government has done. While I am on this subject, airline operators would tell the Minister what they think. Last year this Government allowed air navigation charges to increase by 336 per cent. That is an unreasonable increase. That is just the tip of the iceberg. We saw the introduction of the arrivals tax. What happened to that? My goodness, nearly a million people would have refused to pay it, had it continued for the year. We saw that tax end up in the High Court. We saw the international airline operators win a case against the Government over the arrivals tax. That tax was found to be illegal. There was a promise from the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) that they would consult airline operators before they did anything. What did we see? The arrivals tax came in without any consultation at all. What did we see on 27 March this year? We saw a 6 per cent rise in landing fees at F AC airports. When did that rise come into action? Not six months later, after consultation had taken place with the airline operators, but four days later on 1 April. Four days after the airlines were told there would be an increase in landing fees, it was implemented with no consultation. This is what this Government has been about. It takes full credit for the boom in tourism, and does nothing but tax it, nothing but increase costs, nothing but impose ridiculous taxes upon the industry in order to' try to get more money for activities that are unrelated to boosting the economy of Australia. We have a chaotic situation in the aviation industry today. Part. of it is caused by the chronic problems at Sydney Airport, and part of it is caused by the air traffic controllers' in their dispute with the Government over a number of issues. Just on a month ago the air traffic controllers were promised action by this Government. We in this House were. promised action by this Government. A month has passed, and what has happened? Nothing. We have not had any statements from the Government dealing with the problems. We have had no definite statement about what the Government is going to do about the radar. We have had lots of promises, but nothing definite. We have got no definite statements about extra staff to. overcome staff shortages. We have had no promises in relation to claims for extra allowances. That is why we have got this problem today. It is because this Government sits and ponders-it sits and fiddles while Rome burns. It does nothing but talk. These are some of the reasons why we have got problems today. This is also having an impact throughout regional areas of Australia. This House should not think that the chaos at Sydney and other airports in major States is having no effect on regional tourism. I live in New South Wales, in a regional area, and part of my electorate is serviced by air services that operate out of Sydney Airport. I took the opportunity today to speak to one of the major regional airline operators. He enlightened me as to some of the problems that he is facing. For example, I think he services 23 centres in New South Wales and gets only 10 services a day to service those 23 centres. To service all those centres he is having to hub and spoke. They are the new buzz words in the aviation industry today for regional aviation. What it means is extra costs to the passenger and reduced competitiveness with other forms of transport to the major cities. This operator informed me that in recent times the Government has imposed a $200 fee forÂ· landing their aircraft during peak periods at Mascot airport. Consequently, 20 to 25 per cent of his passengers have dropped off, and as a consequence of that in the month of April he lost $250,000. That loss is a result of his restricted access to Mascot airport. The Government says, 'That's all right. Don't worry about that. Go out to Bankstown. Hub and spoke from there if you want'. I can assure this House that Bankstown airport is no great shakes either. Any member who has flown into Bankstown will know, as I do-I am a pilot, and I have flown myself into Bankstown airport-that it is a very dangerous airport to fly into these days due to the congestion there. I experienced hubbing and spoking the other day when J. flew from Sydney to Mudgee. We did not fly straight to Mudgee; we flew from Sydney to Dubbo. When we got to Dubbo we were told we would have to wait for another flight, to fly back over part of the track we had just covered in order to get to Mudgee. That is what regional tourism is getting from this Government. Regional tourism is suffering very badly as a consequence of the inaction of this Government. This is important when considering the tourism industry and it- future development. The second wave of tourists who will come to A-stralia from overseas have already been to places like Sydney, Brisbane and the Gold Coast, and will want to visit regional areas of Australia. The experience of other countries which have had tourism booms is that the second round of tourists always wants to get out into the heartland of the country, because they have seen the cities and want to get out into the bush. That is why what we are talking about today is of so much concern to the regional people of Australia. We want to see something happen. We want to see this Government resolve the problem with the air traffic controllers. We want to see this Government stop fiddling about with its environmental impact study and taking so long over it, because we know it can be done in less than half the time if the Government is really serious about doing it. Let us get on with the job of providing better services for our airlines, better services for our tourists and better services for the busiriessmen and other people travelling throughout this country for various reasons, because unless we have those better services we will have a chaotic, dangerous air service, and jobs which could be created will not be created, and we shall miss out on money that is so desperately needed for our economy.",87
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,INFRASTRUCTURE,Mr MiIdren)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired;,89
141,Mr GEAR ,INFRASTRUCTURE,"Canning) (4.18)-The previous speaker, the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp), posed the rhetorical question 'Had the Opposition been in government'. Let us thank goodness that it was not in government and did not continue in government after 1983. If it had, concerning the domestic airline industry, one only has to look at the Airlines Agreement Bill 1981 to see what the Opposition would have done had it not been for an avalanche of protest. Contained within that Bill was a proposal which would have given the terms of that Bill a minimum currency of 10 years. I must pay tribute here to one of my Liberal colleagues, the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack), because I can remember that in 1980 he mounted a significant campaign on behalf of Western Australians-and good on him for doing it. If it had not been for people like him within the Liberal Party and in the industry we would have had an agreement from the Liberal Party in 1981 which would have tied the industry up for another 10 years. That means that in 1991 we could have made the decision that we made back in 1987. The honourable member for Gilmore should not talk to us about what the Opposition would have done. We know what it would have done: it would have bottled this industry up until 1991. The honourable member for Gilmore also talked about increasing charges, as did the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Jull). They should look at why charges are increased. Why are charges increased for people who fly in aircraft? The main reason was all the cross-subsidies which are built into the system. I would have thought that the Liberal and National parties,. which always espouse free enterprise principles-but never practice them-would have welcomed those charges and the fact that the people who use airlines would at last be paying for them. There was a massive cross-subsidy from the general taxpayer to the airlines of this country. . Not only that, but when the Fraser Govbecause ernment was in office we saw the ridiculous situation of jet aircraft flying around Queensland because members of the National Party in Queensland did not want to fly on the props. Some of the things they did were absolutely ridiculous. The honourable memthat ber for Fadden compared the ratio of ployees in the Australian 'airline the situation in America. Let me, first of all, pose this question: Would we swap Austrasions lian safety standards for American safety standards? Is that what the honourable member for Fadden is imploring us to do when he starts comparing those ratios people in the industry in Australia, which has the best record in the world? The honourable member compares us with AmerAdelaide? ica, where the industry has been deregulated. The people in America who have experithought enced deregulation would gladly embrace what we have here in Australia. The honourexactly able member's argument was totally. fatuous. And in the same breath he talks about safety standards. How contradictory can anyone get? Further to that, it is dishonest, because he is comparing a system in Australia with system in America, where as many of the employment opportunities in the public sector in Australia are in the private America. It is a totally false argument. These are the sorts of arguments that are put by the Opposition. Members opposite say that they have policy. It is one of the best kept secrets Australia. I have never seen it; no-one has ever heard of' it. What meaningful policies has the Opposition put forward since 1983? For example, after six years what is its tax policy? What is its health policy? One does not know. What is its aviation policy? We do not know. If the honourable member for Fadden and ,the honourable member for Gilmore really want to do something for the Australian aviation industry, they should just stay on that side of the House. That means that we will stay on this side of the House, and we will do something about this industry. The honourable member for Gilmore talked about the Fraser Government making a decision on the third runway for Sydney Airport. It did make a decision, but it was the wrong one. It was the wrong decision it was for a close spaced parallel runway. The runway that we are putting in is a medium spaced parallel runway and will double the capacity of the one proposed by the Fraser Government. So, even that decision made in 1982 was the wrong one. Had runway been built, the capacity that we emwill build into the Sydney Airport would industry with have been lost. Worse than that were some of the decimade at the time about where to put airports-for example, the international terminal at the Adelaide Airport. Everyone who flies into Adelaide Airport trundles past the of international terminal. Do we ever see a plane there? Hardly ever. Why would those opposite put an international terminal at I will tell honourable members why they stuck it there. It was because they they could win a seat in the upcoming election. They struck one in Cairns for the same reason., They lost both seats-and good luck to them. Every time honourable members opposite tried to intervene and stick those international terminals where they should never have been, the a people in those localities voted against them. Mr Cobb:-Like the Parramatta stadium. sector in That was a bit parochial.",89
142,Mr GEAR,INFRASTRUCTURE,"The honourable member opup posite talks about the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown). The a honourable member for Parramatta was one in of the greatest Ministers in this Government. He was the Minister responsible for turning around the tourism industry in this country. Had it not been for his efforts, we would not have had the sorts of strains in relation to capacity that we are talking about today. In fact, had members opposite stayed in government there would not have been any strains-because there would not be any tourists. Mr MACKellar-You are not Irish ? you. .",90
143,Mr GEAR,INFRASTRUCTURE,"Well, you should know. The simple fact is that, although honourable members opposite struck in those international terminals, they still lost the seats. There is a huge domestic terminal at Launceston while the termin.al at Hobart is very small: The honourable member for Bass ( Mr Smith) is at the table; he is from Tasmania and he would know what, I am talking about. Why do- Launceston have that huge terminal whtle Hobart has that weeny one? I will tell honourable members why. It is because the bloke who used to be the Minister lived in Launceston. That is the basis on which members opposite used to make their decisions. It had nothing to do with tourism; it was nothing to do with what the airlines wanted. It was all about pork-barrelling. Notwithstanding, they lost all the seats-and good luck to them. . Mr Smith-Who holds the seat for Bass now?",91
144,Mr GEAR,INFRASTRUCTURE,"Temporarily. Since the present. Government has been in power, I am glad to say, we have built in my home city of Perth an international terminal that was long overdue. Fancy the honourable member for Fadden getting up ,here and talking about infrastructure and airports, after what has gone on in Brisbane! If, when honourable members opposite were in government, they had planned properly and put money where - t was. needed, it would not have been spent In BrIsbane. It would have been spent in Sydney. The problems now with congestion in Sydney should have been apparent when they made their decision about the runway and about where money would be spent. The honourable member for Fadden had the audacity to get up here and talk about the number of people in the engineering training school at Qantas Airways Ltd. The Qantas engineering training school was shut down in 1981. As the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support ( Mrs Kelly) has pointed out, that is when'it was making its losses-when members opposite were in government. Qantas closed down the apprentice training school in 1981. Today, that school is up and running. It is chock-ablock. However, there was a four to five are year lapse involved when there was no-one . , coming through that school-and thatÂ· was because of decisions made under the former Liberal-National Party Government. The fact is that we do have to go overseas and recruit some labour. However, that would not be necessary had members opposite had a decent policy when they were in government and had they viewed the airline policy through the proper channels. That should have been more important than worrying about where they could get a few votes from and whether to spend money on projects in marginal seats. I am fairly thick skinned, but what about some of the arguments that they put up nowadays? Their record really is pitiful. As the Minister has pointed out, the sorts of arguments that we have heard today do not really address the problems. It was nothing more than a whinge session. Those opposite get up and say, 'What . about this, what about that, or why don't you do this?'. As the Minister has pointed out, the fact is that every criticism that honourable members put up was shot down in flames. As the Minister has rightly pointed out, the problems in the airline industry in this country are being addressed by this Government. Many of the problems that we are confronted with in relation to tourist facilities are due to the abilities of the honourable member for Parramatta, when he was the Minister responsible for tourism, in turning one of the smallest industries in this country into the second biggest industry in Australia. It seems to me, as I have said before-and I will conclude on this point-that if the Opposition wants to do something for tourism in Australia it should stay in opposition.",91
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INFRASTRUCTURE,"The discussion is concluded. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Lionel Bowen, and read a first time. Second Reading I Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General) (4.29)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill amends several Acts within the Attorney-General's portfolio. The Bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature or which correct existing legislation. None of the amendments concern major new policy proposals or what are called sensitive policy issues. Only the amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to provide for reference appeals in the Australian Capital Territory will have any financial impact, increasingÂ· the expenditure of the Director of Public Prosecutions by an estimated $21,000 per year-less if outside counsel are not engaged. The proposed amendments are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. I will confine my comments to a few of the more noteworthy amendments. Amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 The Bill will insert two new offences into the new part VIIB of the Crimes Act 1914, which deals with offences relating to telecommunications services. The offences will proscribe unauthorised call-switching devices and unauthorised interception devices. The unauthorised call-switching devices have been found to be used in conjunction with the commission of betting offences and are capable of defeating attempts to trace the calls of those involved in the commission of such offences. The new offence will prohibit the manufacture, possession, use, sale, offering for sale or advertising of unauthorised callswitching devices. Turning to interception devices, whilst the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 currently prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, the interception of telecommunications, it does not contain a prohibition relating to devices by means of which interceptions are effected. The Joint Select Committee on Telecommunications Interception recommended such a prohibition in its report tabled on 20 November 1986. In introducing the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 1987 on 30 April 1987, I indicated that the Government was not at that stage in a position to act on the Joint Select Committee's recommendation. The amendment to the Crimes Act 1914 gives effect to the Government's decisions on this issue. It makes it an offence for a person to manufacture, advertise, display or offer for sale, sell or possess devices used to effect interceptions in contravention of the Interception Act. The new offence will not apply unless the device could reasonably be regarded as having been designed for the purpose of intercepting in contravention of the Interception Act. There is an exemption where a person is in possession of a device in the course of his or her duties where the Interception Act contemplates the lawful interception of communications. Further, t-ere is provision for regulations to prescribe circumstances to which the new offence will not apply, for example, to allow manufacturers to develop and supply devices so that interceptions may be made as provided by the Interception Act. Offences triable on indictment only Amendments to the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963, the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 and the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973 included in the Bill will ensure that, for reasons of the sensitive nature of proceedings for offences against these Acts which may involve high matters of state or foreign policy, prosecutions for these offences can only be brought on indictment. Attorney-General's consent to prosecutions Amendments to the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 and the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963 will ensure that the requirement that the consent of theÂ· Attorney-General, or, in the latter Act, a person authorised by the Attorney-General, be obtained for the institution of proceedings for an offence against either Act is extended to proceedings for 'related' offences under the Crimes Act 1914, for example, attempting or conspiring to commit such an offence. Amendment to the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act 1977 The Act provides that a verdict of guilty of the lesser offence of committing an attack on an internationally protected person may .be brought, as an alternative, at the trial of a person for murdering or kidnapping an internationally protected person. The amendment will enable the alternative verdict to be brought on the trial of a person for attempting to murder or kidnap an internationally protected person, and is intended to correct a problem highlighted by the Federal Court in Duff v Regina. Amendments of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 The Act is to be amended to allow the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal, or the Commissioner when that Tribunal has remitted disciplinary proceedings to him for imposition of penalty, to reduce in rank or dismiss from the Australian Federal Police a commissioned officer found guilty of a breach of discipline, without the necessity of seeking the approval of the Governor General. Amendment to the Customs Act 1901 Under provisions of the Act, a .listening device warrant, issued by a judge to the Australian Federal Police or the National Crime Authority to assist in the investigation of a narcotics offence, may authorise eritry on premises for theÂ· purpose of installing, maintaining, using or recovering the device. A definition of 'premises' is to be inserted to make it clear that 'premises' includes any area of land, structure, building, ship, vehicle or aircraft. Amendments to the Evidence Act 1905 An amendment will authorise superior courts, when ordering that evidence be taken abroad under part I1IB, to give directions for the use of that evidence in a committal hearing, a criminal trial or a proceeding for a civil remedy arising out of that matter. Currently, the evidence of a witness abroad must be taken each time in separate proceedings for use at committal hearings, any resulting trial on indictment, and related civil proceedings. This isÂ· a wasteful procedure, and the Director of Public Prosecutions has requested the amendment to enable evidence taken abroad to be used successively in proceedings of this kind. The orders will be discretionary. The court hearing a proceeding will also have a discretion whether or not to admit the evidence obtained abroad. The amendment will give superior courts the power to rescind or vary orders made under part I1IB. It will be possible, for example, for a defendant to seek a fresh examination of a witness located abroad to deal with issues that emerge at the committal hearing or afterwards. The Act is also to be amended to allow the Attorney-General to prohibit evidence being given in Australia for use in civil or criminal proceedings in foreign courts, where the taking of the evidence would be prejudicial to Australia's security. Amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Amendments to the Act will confer jurisdiction on. the Federal Court to hear 'reference' appeals in respect of any question of law arising from a trial on indictment in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. A reference appeal is one whereby a question of law can be submitted to an appeal court after acquittal, without the liberty of the defendant being affected. The amendment will bring the Australian Capital Territory law into line with most of the States and the Northern Territory and will ensure that the correct view of the relevant law is established as a precedent, thereby ensuring that errors at the trial level are not repeated in later cases. Amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 The Act is to be amended to enable Ombudsman's offices around Australia to receive and handle privacy complaints on behalf of the Privacy Commissioner. This is a costeffective way of enabling the Privacy Commissioner to be represented Australia-wide and will provide individuals with a convenient access to his office. Amendments to the State and Territorial Laws and Records Recognition Act 1901 The amendments in the Bill adapt the operation of the Act to take account of the grant of. self-government to the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island. They provide for the proof of instruments, records and official acts with respect to Ministers and Legislative Assemblies of these Territories, complementing similar provisions in the Act relating to the States. However, I foreshadow that the Government intends to move an amendment so that the provisions relating to Territorial Legislative Assemblies will not apply in respect of the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island. That has been brought about by a recent request of the Assembly of that Territory. Amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979' ' The Bill contains a number of amend the ments to the Telecommunications tion) Act 1979. First, amendments will allow approved members of the Australian Federal Police, when executing warrants, to be given journed. technical assistance by civilian technici-ns employed by the Australian Federal Police. It has been found that such assistance may be necessary when technical difficulties arise during the execution of a warrant. Secondly, an amendment will allow lawfully intercepted information to, be given in evidence in proceedings under section 13 of the Mubeen d-tained, I move: tual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 in relatio- to offences for which the penalty bills be varied as follows: is imprisonment for at least three years. Under that provision, the Attorney-General may authorise the taking of evidence or production of documents before a magistrate in Australia for the purposes of a proceeding relating to a criminal matter in a foreign country. Such proceedings are not ones in which information lawfully obtained by interception may"" currently be given in eVIdence. The amendment will allow Australia to give an assurance of reciprocity to other countries from which Australia may wish to seek intercepted information relating to prosecutions for Australian offences.' Thirdly, the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption is to specified as an agency which may apply for the issue of warrants under the Act and to which intercepted information may be comthat municated by other agencies. Finally, the Bill provides for the use of billing information obtained by Telecom Australia by means a technical interception to be used by com in proceedings to recover a debt due it. Amendments to the Trade Practices Act One amendment to the Act will ensure the Trade Practices Commission has adewould quate time to consider applications for nonseek merger authorisations. At present, the Minister has a power to limit to four months the time taken by the Commission to determine non-merger applications. The amendment will provide that the time taken by applicants in responding to requests for additional information by the Commission will not be included in that four month period.

My shadow ministerbut illl colleague, the honourable ,member for Dawson ( Mr Braithwaite), will concentrate on the other matter. I do so in the context that once again ,we' have before the House this and other 'legislation on a range of issues vitally important to the Australian commuLet nity. Yet, once again, as the Leader of the EmptyHere the Government' ducking for cover, ,rolling Bills into a cognate debate, applying the lotine when it has time for patent political exercises, simply to' avoid full and careful scrutiny of its actions in this place. I could express outrage, I could express disquiet. Given the Govt\rnment's poor re,cord in delivering quality health care for Australians, it is hardly surprising that should adopt, this tactic. We on this' side the House can'well'imder,stand why the ister 'for Community Services arid Health (Dr Blewett) would prefer that the of the Australian people was not focused on Medicare or on his role in lbwering health care standards. There can be little joy the Minister in presiding over a health care system which is becoming notorious for its increasing mediocrity and ever-lengthening public hospital queues. However, we would be failing in our duty if we did not do our best to ensure that the problems so evident in the health system were corrected and not just papered over until after the next election. Almost each and everyone of the health items covered by this particular Bill deserves its own debate. Those items cover - he ability of the aged and chronically ill to exercise their right to private health insurance and private hospital care; they cover the survival of the private health insurance industry and the private hospital sector; the future of general practice medicine; the promotion of dayhospital treatment; and the correction of past government mistakes in relation to pathology. All of these matters, contained in one omnibus Bill, deserve full and careful But the Government is intent obupon denying the oJ?portunity for any such debate in this chamber. It has the numbers; it will lower the guillotine as and when it 1 c,an say to the Minister, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we have no alternative to ensure that those' passages of the legislation we cannot support as they are currently drafted are subjected to the clo-est possible scrutiny)n the Senate. The closest possible scrutiny in, the Senate is what the Governme-t will get and what it deserves. me make it clear that there are some sections of this Bill we do support. We support the amendments to the Australian Institute of Health Act, because we are guilcommitted to ensuring that confidential health information is handled sensitively and carefully. At the time the Privacy Bill was being debated last year, we successfully amended the Government's legislation to protect records necessary for the proper conall duct of medical research. The amendments it incorporated in the legislation being disof cussed this afternoon are completely in line Minwith the views we expressed at that time. We are therefore happy to support the pasattention sages of part 2 of this Bill. We ate also happy to support those portions of the Bill which put the delivery of for pathology services back onto firm ground. The amendments in relation to pathology are long overdue, in view of the unprecedented turmoil created by the Government's thoroughly misguided implementation in November last year of a. totally inequitable and unworkable pathology services table. The chaos created by this decision could so easily have been avoided if the Minister had listened to the pathologists and, indeed, if he had heeded the advice of his own Department. Instead, he pushed ahead with a new table which, on the admission of his own officers, contained a draft of what his colleague the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) might describe as unintended consequences. While it is gratifying that the Government is now taking steps to rectify the problems of its own making-it took a court decision to ensure that it did-at the same time it is disturbing to note that the Government has obviously learnt nothing from what we might call the pathology exercise. I can only conclude that the Minister has learned nothing from the pathology exercise, because there can be no other explanation for the Minister's blind and obvious determination now to repeat the same mistakes he made about pathology in relation to general practice and day surgery. I will speak through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because it is not possible, under the forms of this House, to talk to the Minister directly and personally. If I were able to do so, I would say to him, 'Minister, it is all about consultation; not with a select few but with wide, genuine consultation with all of the players in the relevant sector of the health industry. Talk to the experts in the field. Find out how the theory will work in practice. Contemplate the problems of implementation and see whether they might not be ironed out before you charge ahead. Do not go rushing headlong into another situation from which there can only be further embarrassing retreat'. There is much to commend encouraging greater use of day-only hospital treatment. There is much to commend in encouraging general practitioners to upgrade their skills and lift the standard of medicine they practise and the quality of health care they deliver to the Australian community. Let there be no doubt that we in the Liberal and National parties strongly support the principles behind both of these moves. However, we do not and cannot support the way in which theÂ· Government is seeking to make these changes without first gaining the full support of all those who will be expected to put the new arrangements into operation. Health policy is far too important an issue and area to be used as a testing ground. The Government's day surgery proposals are a perfect case in point. Any kind of surgery carries certain risks. For the Government to rush into new day surgery arrangements without engaging in exhaustive discussions with representative organisations of the medical profession and the National Day Surgery Advisory Committee is, in our view, the height of folly. All that is required is consultation and discussion. To proceed without that is not only the height of folly but downright stupid. Quite frankly, I cannot understand it. In respect of day surgery, therefore, I am forced to say to the Minister that, in spite of our in-principle support for the concept we will oppose the Government's day-only hospital treatment amendments in the Senate and will recommend, as I recommend now, that further discussions be held. Those who are directly concerned with implementing any changes in this area want to talk to the Minister and they want to talk to him now. Day only hospital treatment is, along with the proposals on general practice, further evidence, as I have said, of the way in which the Minister simply charges ahead. I turn to general practice, which is the backbone of our health care system. It must be treated with extreme caution, or the fabric of the whole structure will simply fall apart. But instead of acting with caution, the Minister has pushed on and struck a deal which is not supported by the vast majority of general practitioners, the very people who will have to operate in any changed environment, the very people who will be charged with the responsibility of delivering any changes which may flow from this legislation. The lack of extensive consultation with all parts of the medical profession and the way in which the Government's proposals place immense power over general practice in the hands of the bureaucracy and one section of the medical profession is something with which we do not agree. We are not alone on this. It is not something we have thought of by ourselves or made up. Our objections are shared by the majority of the existing members of the medical profession, and indeed even those studying for entry into that profession. They support our view that there are very good grounds for believing that this Government is engaged in a power grab. with They also support our view that the Governthat ment's plans discriminate against many eral practitioners; in particular women general practitioners, rural doctors, part-time general practitioners, those working in fields such as sports medicine, student health clinand ics, women's health clinics and family planquality ning clinics, as well as against current future years of medical students. Despite what the Minister would have believe, the creation of a vocational register of general practitioners in the way in which it is set out in this Bill-and indeed in way in which it is not set out in this Bill, inquiry. because s,o much of the detail necessary to implement successfully such a register the scheme and the proposals that would behind it are not before us in this place; are still to come-has more to do with improper posing controls on the medical profession than increasing the efficiency and effectiveprivate ness of the delivery of overall medical servin ices. For our money, and we see it whenever the Minister gets a chance in Question Time, it is an attempt to divide the medical profesthe sion and get the members of that profession squabbling amongst themselves instead fighting the real enemy, which in this case and in this portfolio is the Government itself. The reason why the medical profession should be confronting the Government is that we have a government that is solely concerned with propping up the Medicare structure when we know in so many important areas most that Medicare is. failing, failing badly and failing in its own terms. Instead of looking for new crutches to support the system, Government should be asking itself and those who are involved in delivering health care what sort of medicine will achieve quality health care for the whole community. Such fundamental issues are not something to be dealt with in haste. There is no point in saying, 'We had long, detailed consultation with this group and that group'. It is the Parliament that is charged with the responother sibility of making decisions on behalf of the Australian public, and for the Government to ram through important decisions in a lotine debate is not the way in which it should be handling this matter. That is why in respect of those provisions as they deal general practice I can say quite clearly we support the concepts, we support genthe principles, we are in total agreement about the need for ongoing vocational training and the need for Australia's general practitioners constantly to update their knowledge their skills in order to be able to deliver health care in this community. But and we are far from satisfied about the way in which this Government is suggesting that this us principle and these proposals be implemented, and when this legislation is in the Senate we will be referring this section of it the to a Senate select committee for extensive Something else not to be dealt With in and haste in the public arena, as opposed to go private discussions the Minister may have they with one group or another or as opposed to but nevertheless confidential bureaucratic consideration, is the amendments to health insurance arrangements set out part 4 of the Bill. In his second reading speech on the Bill the Minister described these new arrangements as being 'designed to maximise the security and protection of insured aged'. I do not want to put too fine a point on it, but nothing could be of further from the truth. The Minister has done everything possible to hoodwink the elderly and the chronically ill, to make them believe that the changes are in their best interests. Frankly, this is a cruel hoax perpetrated amongst and against some of the disadvantaged member:s of our community. . The Government's proposals will do noththe ing to achieve long term improvements in the private health insurance system, They will do nothing to protect the insured aged from further increases in contribution rates. In fact, they are more likely to worsen the situation by driving good risks out of the private insurance system. Who can blame the young and the healthy for looking at their personal finances when faced with yet anrise and future rises in health fund contribution rates and deciding that they will opt out, that they are no longer willing or guilable to pay private health premiums in addition to the 1.25 per cent Medicare levy which the Government rips out of their taxable income. If the Minister and his Government genuinely wished to protect the health care int-rÂ­ ests of the elderly, they would not be wastmg their time rearranging the deck chairs on the health fund Titanic. Instead, they would devote their energies to restructuring Medicare. They would go full steam ahe-d to, corre7t their failure .to deliver MedIcare s baSIC promise. Let me remind the House, if the Minister does not need reminding, that that promise was 'access for all according to need, funded by all according to means'. Clearly, Medicare as we ':low k-ow it d?es not stack up very well against thIS promIse. In fact it does not stack up at all. Elderly Austraiians find themselves either languishing on ever-lengthening pu?lic ho-pital waiting lists, if they are not prIvately. msured, or driving themselves into penury If they are endeavouring to maintain their private cover. The last Australian Bureau of Statistics health insurance survey revealed that 600,000 social welfare beneficiaries, including age pensioners and the unemployed, were scrimping and scraping to keep up their private health insurance because they could not rely on Medicare to give them access to care in times of need. Yet even those who are prepared to make such sacrifices cannot be guaranteed a hospital bed as the cost of private. hospit-l treatment denies access to those WIth baSIC health insurance cover. In addition, substantial co-payments for those with higher cover are driving many of the aged back onto the public hospit-l wai-Â­ ing lists. And despite the overwhelmmg e-lÂ­ dence that Medicare is failing and failing m its own terms, failing to live up to the promise that was made for it, the Minister for Health refuses to admit the burden placed upon the aged by his health scheme and will not change its structure to remove that burden and fundamentally improve the situation. There is one simple reason, one single word which explains why no such admission is made and why no such action is forthcoming. We should not be surprised about it in this game, I suppose. That word, of course, is politics. The Minister and his Government have decided on no changes to Medicare prior to an election, on the basis that any change is an admission of shortcomings. They have also decided on a no change policy for fear of drawing attention to the damaging impact their fiscal policies have had on the whole health care structure. Instead, the Government has decided to stick a bandaid over a weeping sore and hope that the pla-ter stays in place until after the. next .ele-tIon: The bandaid contained in thIS legIslatIon IS the reinsurance pool, which the Governm-nt plans to use to scoop up all the hospItal costs of health fund contributors aged 65 and over. If you had studied the legislation, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know that th- b-sic plan involves increasing the contrIbutIon which a large number of newer and smaller health funds have to make to the pool and redistributing this money to the older and larger funds which have a - il?her prop-rtion of aged contributors. In addItIon, there IS the offer from the Government of a one-off injection into the pool of a measly $20f!1. I.say 'measly' advisedly. Throughout Its entIre hme in office to date the Government has contributed a meagre $47m to the reinsurance pool. This does not even match the $50m which was the smallest ever contribution which the previous Liberal-National Party Governme-t made to the pool. During our last term m office we put $525m into the reinsurance pool. What I would like to know and what the Australian community would like to knowin fact, it is entitled to know-is the answers to a couple of simple questions. The Treasurer ( Mr Keating) was unable yesterdar and again today to answer even the most SImple questions about the economy. I hope that, at the conclusion of the debate, we will not add to that the Minister for Community Services and Health. They are very simple questions. The first one is: If the Government is so concerned about the aged, if it is so convinced that the reinsurance pool holds the answers to private health insurance, why. has it not been willing to put more money mto the pool in the past? Als-, why is it that - he legislation we are debatmg today con tams specific provisions to remove any Co-monÂ­ wealth responsibilities towards the r-l-s.urÂ­ ance pool-not just a measly responslblhty, but any responsibility-beyond the end of the current financial year? If the Minister does not get the chance to reply in this debate, it will not be our fault. The Government has. guillotined this debate. But the public demands and deserves answers to those simple questions. If the Minister does not get the opportunity in this debate because of the steamroller tactics of the Leader of the House ( Mr Beazley), perhaps he will be good enough to find another opportunity because they are questions that demand answers. It is possible to hazard a guess, and that is that the $20m is expected to provide some sort of breathing space. Dare I be so cynical as to suggest that this Bill was expected to tide things over until after the next election. There i!! no doubt that the reinsurance proposals share the risk, but whether they do so fairly or sensibly is highly debatable. It is obvious 'to me that there is a fair degree of consensus in the total private health care sector that the overall impact will be adverse and that it will accelerate-not arrest-the decline in what is already a rapidly dwindling supply of private health fund members. If one wants to chalk up some of the hallmarks of this Governm-nt, one of them is that we are now down to a situation in which only 46 per cent of the population is privately insured. Well done, Minister for Health! I have no doubt that the Government's main objective in this legislation is remove Medicare from the election agenda. The Government's proposals will not fix the problems of access or cost. The proposals will not increase the numbers of people taking out private health insurance. They will not reduce the cost of private health insurance, nor will they result in any increase in the utilisation of private hospitals. Indeed, they will ultimately cause contribution rates to rise, membership rates to fall, a further drop in the use of private hospital resources and consequently longer queues in our public hospital system. We on this side of the House would be failing in our. duty to the people of this country-in particular, to the aged and chronically ill-if we did not do all in our power to scrutinise closely these Government proposals, which we believe will have dire consequences. I have clearly foreshadowed that, becausCf we will not have a committee debate in this chamber, this scrutiny will be brought to bear in the Senate. To be successful and worthwhile, any changes to health insurance arrangements must be capable of fostering an efficient industry and of providing incentives which will help to contain health care costs. In turn, such incentives would help to contain health insurance contribution rates. The plans that the Government has put forward in this legislation do none of these things. In fact, the incentives which are there will reward inefficiency, not efficiency. The incentive to strive to attract more and more good risk contributors will be largely removed and those funds which spend their contributors' money in an attempt to sign up more of these good risks will achieve little more than the subsidisation of their competitors. Such a disincentive can only undermine the overall risk profile within the industry and result in an upward spiralling of contribution rates. We will end up with fewer insured people and more and more people relying on public hospitals. At the same time the Government is going out backwards in terms of its contribution and responsibilities to the reinsurance pool. I will ask the Minister another simple question; I would be grateful if he will pay some attention. How long will public hospital queues have to get before the Minister and his Government will to be willing to admit that they got it wrong and that it is not working? Tinkering with the reinsurance pool is not the answer to the problems of the private health insurance industry and the under utilisation of the private hospital sector. Perhaps even worse is the fact that the Government's proposals will penalise especially the lower socio economic groups, including the aged-the very people it claims to be concerned for. I find this one of the absolutely perverse things about Medicare: the people who should be its priority-the aged, the chronically ill-are in many cases the very people who are being shunted further and further to the back of the hospital waiting queu,es, even those who are insured. The reason they may have insured at all is that they do not rely .on and do not have faith inÂ· the public hospital system as it operates under Medicare. They have scraped together enough of their pension or welfare benefits to take out private insurance, but they can afford only the basic table. What do they find? They cannot even get private hospital cover. Once the Government understood that an essential ingredient in the operation of a public health insurance system is a strong private health insurance sector; What do we find the Government has done? Wefirid that the Government has taken money out of the reinsurance pool over the years and, as one other example of its failure to support the private health insurance system, it has removed the Commonwealth bed-day subsidy. As I have said, the Government's main objective is the removal of Medicare from the election agenda: That is what this legislation is all about. While I cannot get irito the decision-making process on the Minister's side of the Parliament, I would bet London to a brick on that this' legislation was conceived when the. Government thought an early election might be on and it couldÂ· bang this legislation through by gUillotiqing it in this place and whacking it through the Senate, put the bandaid on the sore, rim to the polls ,and, from the Government's point' of view, hopefully get away with it and win, and then come back into this place when next in government and do what i- necessary. Perhaps the Minister for Community Services and' Health would not be the responsible Minister then. Perhaps there would be someone who is riot tired' and burnt out iIi this portfolio and wl10 has the enthusiasm to do what is necessary. What is necessary? A couple of simple things are necessary. If we are to have the best health care system that we can afford in this country we have to have the 'right balance between the public and private sectors and we have to answer the question of who pays and how much. The Government does not have the tight balance between the' public and private sectors: It' has an ideological commitment to the public sector and an ideological commitment against the private sector. People are flowing out of the private sector because there are no incentives and rio rewards for belonging to private health funds. They are queueing up at our public hospital systems, and the Government is left with a typical socialist solution, that is, to ration :supply. The frustration on my part is that I have almost run out of time. There is no committee debate in this chamber. All I can say is that we will talk out the time because at least we on this side of the House have members who want to talk about the real issues. And in the Senate the Government will get all it de'serves.",95
148,Ms MCHUGH ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Phillip) (5.11)-ln this cognate debate on the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill and the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill I want to direct most of my attention to the latter Bill, but I cannot possibly speak without addressing the issues which were raised by the Oppo-ition, in an attempt to understand what those opposite are up to with their' extraordinary delaying tactics. It is absurd for them to propose blocking the new general practitioner (GP) fee arrangements and the reinsurance changes. The people who will suffer are the patients, particularly the pensioners. The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack), in trying to defend these delaying tactiCs, actually said that scrutiny is what we will get and scrutiny is what we deserve. What do the patients and the pensioners deserve? Do they deserve just to be the victims of Liberal Party, National Party and Australian Democrats politicking? Scrutiny is already taking place. Major studies of the private hospital and private health insurance industries are already being carried out by Federal, State and Territory governments and a report will be given to the Australian Health Ministers in April next year. The Opposition's suggestion that the legislation be sent off to a Senate committee will just disadvantage the people that should benefit.' The' tactics and proposals of honourable members opposite simply duplicate what is already happening. This is a delaying tactic from an Opposition which has no policies of its own. Those opposite actually consider that we might not want Medicare on the agenda at .the next election. I certainly hope that Medicare is an issue at the next election, when those opposite try to put up their policies in the face of the support of Medicare. I certainly hope people get to vote on that. The fact is that all Australians will be denied higher Medicare rebates and pensioners will pay more for health insurance if the Opposition succeeds in this tactic on this Bill. Both the reinsurance and the GP fee arrangements have been worked out through extensive and prolonged consultation. The shadow Minister said that we ought to ask the experts in the field. We certainly have done so in that regard, as well as in relation to same day surgery. My colleagues will deal with that matter. Let me now talk about some .of the consultation on reinsurance. The changes to the reinsurance arrangements are designed to share the cost of.-ospital care for people over 65 amongst all health funds, protecting the elderly from excessive increases .n health insurance contribution rates and providing increased stability to the private health care sector. I support thill legislation as a committed Medicare supporter, but. the legislation is being brought forward because the Government believes in and supports the private and public sectors in this area. The changes are supported by the 'health funds, representing 90 per cent of all privately insured people. The shadow Minister said that we ought to get support for what we propose. These proposals are supported by every pensioner organisation. Listen to what Derek Shaw, the Chief Executive of the Hospital Benefits Association, has to say. He sent this letter to every member and senator. He states: HBA provides health insurance cover for more than half a million Victorians. In expectation of changes to Reinsurance, HBA has already absorbed, without contribution crease, the latest increase in Victorian public Â·fees. If proposed Reinsurance changes are adopted by Parliament HBA will be able to reduce contribution rates by $1 per week per family for all contributors to HBA's top table which covers 286,000 people. , The Opposition is trying to stop that hapfact pening! Derek Shaw goes on to say: Reinsurance change would enable HBA to further close the gap between private hospital and the highest HBA cover. That is what the Opposition is trying to stop, despite the approval of the pensioner organtives. isations, which have pleaded with the position to support these.changes. Their are falling on deaf ears. So far the are supported by the Australian Pensioners Federation; the Combined Pensioners Assocognate ciation; the Australian Council on the Agetion ing; and the various councils on the ageing in the States. Yet the Opposition tells us that we are trying to disadvantage the pensioners. The Opposition cares more about a few small business people than about the health and well-being of elderly Australians. Most importantly, by blocking this legislation honourable members QPpo-ite would also stop the $20m currently earmarked from the reinsurance fund from getting there at all. How is that for a cruel hoax qn the aged and on patients! The new GP fee arrangements are designed to improve quality of patient care by providing incentives to GPs to undertake continuing medical education and quality assurance. ,No-one is disadvantaged"" nor does the legislation discriminate; rather, some 90 per, cent of GPs, both full time and part time, will benetj.t. There are generous eligibilityprovisions aimed at including as many GPs as possible. The Opposition is abandoning general practice and quality patient care. n the new arrangements which are due to come into effect on 1 August are blockedand I remind everyone that that is. what the Opposition is trying to, do-GPs and their patients will miss out on an additjonal $136m in Medicare benefits in 1989-90, equivalent to about $10,000 a year in extra income to each' eligible GP. Try sell-ng that to them! The Opposition will also prevent general fee increases for all doct-rs, GPs and speciaJists going ahead on 1 August. That is wbt the rate inOpposition's delaying and blocking tactics hospital will do. That will deny patients higher re,bates and better quality care. The Opposition said that we should consult. Who does it consult? Its members have shown themselves to be, the slaves of the Australian Medical Association, despite the that the AMA is. becoming increasingly irrel-vant to GPs. Those opposite talk to the even AMA. What is more, they talk to the right charges wing elements of the AMA, who have no interest in general practice-only an interest in pursuing their destructive political objecI certainly hope that this is on the Opelection agenda whenever there is an elecpleas tion. We will quote every word that Oppochanges sition members have uttered. I return now to the other matter in this debate, the Supported AccommodaAssistance Bill. I want to do that because it is such important legislation. It authorises the Commonwealth to enter into a new five-year agreement with States and the Territories to provide-services for homeless people in crisis under a new supported accommodation assistance program (SAAP). The current SAAP will end on 30 June this year. This Bill seeks to implement the major recommendations of the report by Colleen Chesterman, Homes Away from Home, an independent evaluation of the current SAAP. The Chesterman review was very impressed with the operation of the first SAAP because it established a legitimacy at the national level of government for such an assistance program which is targeted specifically at homeless people. Homelessness is a national concern, and the national Government must take a leading role in implementing measures to alleviate the problems being experienced by those Australians who are homeless. The Government proposes to increase funding for. the new SAAP by committing $40m over the next three years on top of that already contributed by the Commonwealth. This will bring the total to $240m over the three years to 1992. It is very encouraging to see that the State governments are also continuing to contribute funding for SAAP. The provision of adequate funding is absolutely crucial to the future viability of the program, but' the real test is whether that funding is reaching the people who are most in need of assistance. As the Minister.' for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples) said, on anyone day over 11,000 people throughout Australia receive assistance under SAAP. Many of the services offered have now been placed on a secure financial footing for the first time. That is a major achievement of this Government. The actual service providers too are now involved in planning and priority settings for the SAAP programs. The groups that the new SAAP programs will assist are young people over 16 years of age, women, women with children who are either homeless or in crisis due to domestic violence, families including single parent families, and single men and women. Crisis accommodation is clearly absolutely essential, but it should be the overall objective of Government to provide the mechanism to assist homeless people to make the jump to more permanent and stable accommodation-to lift people out of permanent homelessness. That was one of the objectives of the first SAAP program. It remains the prime objective of this program and a crucial component of the Government's social justice strategy. Despite the fact that the Commonwealth Government has significantly increased the funding for homeless people, there still remains much to be done. As I have stressed, the new SAAP program will improve the linkages with other types of assistance, that is with longer term and more stable accommodation. In the minutes remaining to me I will illustrate what homelessness is like in my area and the activities of State government and local government in this regard: The electorate of Phillip covers a large part of the eastern suburbs of Sydney, many parts Of which are very affluent. It is well known that there is an acute shortage of affordable accommodation in the inner city areas of Sydney, and my electorate is no exception. The Bondi Beach region is being particularly hard hit not only by continually rising rents but also by the activities of many of the real estate agents in' the area. Rising rents in particular are placing affordable accommodation out of the reach of many people who have lived in Bondi all their lives. Rents have risen by over 30 per cent in the past 2t years, far outstripping the CPI rate. Tenants in the private rental market are being hurt badly. When it becomes impossible to pay the rent, homelessness is one of the possibilities that tenants face. The New South Wales Government's ministerial inquiry into homelessness was chaired by Mr Max Raine, one of the largest real estate agents in Sydney, who deals extensively with property in the inner city of Sydney. One may wonder why the New South Wales Greiner Government put a real estate agent in charge of an inquiry into hornlessness and what a real estate agent would have to say about homelessness. I will cite the findings of the inquiry. Max Raine stated: . . . indications are that there are not a large number of people, probably around 250, who search for shelter and actually fail to find a bed for the night. Max Raine was also quoted in a local newspaper in my electorate talking about those who end up spending the night at Bondi Beach. Do honourable members know what he said? He said: Nobody sleeps on the beach unless they want to. His evidence was that, because he walks his dog at the beach every evening and he did not see anyone, those people did not exist. His recommendations reflect his fundamental ignorance of the problem and are nothing more than a blatant attempt to give more power to the landlord and the property developer at the expense of the people. The Raine report also stated: Women appear to represent a small percentage of the homeless population. Max Raine should ask the people in my electorate such as those from the Chapel by the Sea at Bondi which caters for such people. To get a more realistic picture, he should listen to people there. The SAAP program was set up to assist homeless people such as these. It is no good saying that the problem does not exist, as the Raine report stated. The problem is very real and it is up to all three .levels of government to work together. Local government has a definite role to play, because it is much closer to the problem. I will certainly encourage theWaverley council, which historically has taken a lead in all public housing programs, to make a submission for funding under the new SAAP program so that it can provide assistance to the homeless at Bondi Beach. Members of the council have already expressed a willingness to do this and I will certainly support their efforts. Their efforts will benefit from this new legislation. , Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE (Dawson) (5.24)I am alarmed that we are being allowed only 10 minutes to address this most important subject. I am also alarmed that there are five or six different parts to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill, all of which should be debated as if it were a separate Bill, and debated properly. Some parts of the legislation have been available for debate over the past 12 months. I will cover two areas, the first being nursing homes. In that regard I refer to referral to other bodies and incorrect classifications. The nursing homes issue was illustrated in an advertisement that appeared in the Age of today; the Government has spent a considerable amount of money under the name of the Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples) to bring this matter to the notice of the Australian people. That demonstrates one thing: if such an advertisement is necessary, the Government must realise that it is in deep trouble with its program particularly in relation to small nursing homes. In spite of what the Minister said in Question Time a few days ago, the fact is that small nursing homes are closing. However, in that advertisement the Minister states: No nursing homes will be forced to close. In actual fact, the honourable member for EmptyHere present addressing the problem of nursing homes that are facing closure. We see this expenditure, this waste of money, on an exercise in relation to which the Government is at fault. It is also at fault in regard to the report I'm Still an Individual. I refer to this issue because, whatever else is covered by this legislation and the Disability Services Act 1986 a disabled client or one who needs care is no longer recognised as an individual. The debate tonight is in terms of funding and quality of care. The message I am receiving from those who direct assessments in the homes is that the assessment system is being changed; whereas the patient was assessed according to the need for quality of care, he is now being assessed according to a ratio of funding which means that, in most cases, quality of care is no longer available. Quality of care is no longer available because the institutions and nursing homes that must provide that care can no longer afford to do so. I suggest that the Government analyse the word 'individual'. It should consider its social justice program and what equity means in relation to guidelines and attitudes under this legislation regarding nursing homes and disability services. The Opposition approves of the nursing home aspect, but we question some elements of the measure. The Bill is a little indefinite where it refers to 'a substantial number of cases'. One wonders what makes up a substantial number of cases. For instance, if in one month assessments are substantially underclassified, does that represent a substantial number of cases, or does the phrase 'a substantial number of cases' refer to cases over a period? I would have thought that the latter was the case; the former situation would not give the proprietor or the person who is making the classification the ability to take advantage of an education program to classify in the proper way. A situation of underclassifications will be the result of one or two things: ignorance of how it should be done properly, which means that people must be educated; or, secondly, persistent downgrading to obtain a benefit that this part of the legislation intends to correct. But the Minister might like to refer to that aspect at some time in the future. I now refer to appeals. We do not believe that a decision of the secretary can be appealed fairly and with justice to the Minister. In addition, there is no time limit in which the Minister must make the determination. In this regard, we suggest referral as an option, or after the Minister's decision, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)-and that is what our amendment calls for. That would result in a hands-off situation, which we believe is necessary. We will oppose the amendments to part 5 for one reason. I understand that about 65 people will be involved, although only 45 are attached to 'the nursing home sector, seven of whom, I believe, have said that they will sign contracts, leaving 38. The message we are getting from these people is that they have no faith that in the transfer the guidelines will do anything to assist them in the transition stage. Many cases have come to our notice, and I refer to one by name-Crowle Home. The staff of that home has indicated that, if the home comes within the guidelines of the Disability Services Act, in some cases the cost of providing care will double or even triple. This nursing home has given figures in that respect. There is no guarantee under this legislation that the concerns of those people will be accommodated. Another home which is listed is Fairholme. I believe that this is the only nursing home in the Southern Hemisphere that caters for epileptics. That nursing home has been in operation for some 21 years. There is no guarantee that, in the transfer, the people will be lqoked after with the same quality of care that was provided before. I am talking about people who require nursing home assistance. What will happen to those people who do not fit into the guidelines? The major concern I have found within the industry, particularly in those nursing homes that are listed for transfer, is that the Government, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) and the Department do not recognise the degree to which the intellectually handicapped could be affected. Only today I had the opportunity of visiting three separate establishments in Sydney. One establishment which teaches living skills has been providing this service to its clients for quite a number of years. It was very interesting to be able to talk with those people and to measure their improvement during the period they have been under the care of these providers. Yet the skill for living does not come within the categories provided in this legislation. It certainly mentions independent living skillsÂ· but the skills that these people are being taught may not be included. There are many other aspects that people are concerned about. I was told that this establishment will not qualify for funding under the new system. The second establishment I visited provided care from cradle to grave. I know that it is the intention of the Minister and the Government to remove this aspect of the system. These people are making a determined effort to comply with government guidelines. As far as I could see on my inspection, they are doing everything they can in relation to education, skills, employment, and accommodation. These establishments are prepared to give it a go. However, they are not getting a guarantee from the Government that, if they are prepared to give it a go, the funding will follow. Some of these establishments believe that, if they have funds of their own in reserve, reserves that are required in present circumstances just to maintain the momentum, they will not be given the funds until the reserves are eaten into. The other establishment I visited offered people employment opportunities. This establishment does not come under the 'big institutions' category in the guidelines, yet these people are providing an excellent service. Because of the poverty traps in the invalid pensions area they are limited in what they can pay their clients. These are all matters which should be addressed but are not being addressed. In the meantime it is apparent that the Government firmly intends to transfer these institutions into tried, uncosted category without any concern about what has happened in the past. These establishments resent, as I do, the suggestion that no change has taken place in them over many years. Their tried and proven methods of service are now no longer valid because of these new service categories. The week before last I mentioned in connection with disability services that Australian providers are changing. It does not matter what program we have; there will be occasions when people abuse the system. This legislation is setting out to correct some of that abuse. But we cannot judge the whole from the activities of some. Heaven forbid, if we applied that standard to the standard of representation we get in this chamber we would all be blessed with a very bad name. I do not believe that it is fair to say that change has not taken place. These people are prepared to face change but they have to be given a transition period and they need a. funding guarantee. The Minister, in the debate I referred to earlier, said that there had been a massive increase in funding for disability services. That is quite true. He mentioned a doubling of the effort. He did not say that that was in nominal terms. In real terms, that was an increase of about 40 or 50 per cent. If the Minister involves himself in this limited categorisation and in the changes, where the costs will be much greater, he will be impairing the quality of service. It will follow that while quality care will be provided to people who are able to afford it, others will be driven back 20 or 30 years. When they go back into their own homes they will not be prepared to show themselves as a result not only of the funding mechanisms but also of the changes the Minister is insisting on making to the industry without any consideration of the costs. We intend in the Senate to refer this section of the legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which is already looking at the employment of disabled persons, suggesting that it consider the whole mode of change, and the categorisation of the accommodation arrangements that are in place, and give the industry an opportunity to consult with it. At the moment, the industry is not consulting with the Minister; a new, un- we only have confrontation.",100

Certainly that was warranted at the time. I always drew the distinction that the complaints that came to me were in the main complaints about specialists, not general practitioners. With that as a background I am happy to say, as a member of the Government, that I support a pay rise for doctors. Dr Charlesworth-And so you should.",105
150,Mr GEAR,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"As the doctor says, 'And so I should'. The pay rise is going to general practitioners. I believe that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), who is at the table, is to be congratulated for finally getting the most responsive section of the medical profession to sit down and talk with the Government about the level of fees. I am hopeful that, as a result of this legislation and. as a result of those negotiations, the general practitioner fee in this country will be adhered to by the medical profession. Certainly, of all those speciality branches in the medical profession general practitioners in particular have charged their patients at or below the scheduled fee. I think the provisions in this legislation that give effect to general practitioners receiving more money ought to be endorsed. I also support the community rating principle, which is one of the central tenets of the legislation before us tonight. The community rating principle is not a recent innovation; it has been around for a long time and it has been s-pported by governments of all political persuasions for good reason: market forces do not actually work in the medical industry, if I can call it that. At one time or another we all need the services of the medical profession. If we .were to rely on market forces the elderly would be paying significant amounts of money for their health insurance and young, healthy people would be paying next to nothing.

To compare private insurance and Medicare, let us look at a couple of different measures to indicate the success of universal health insurance over private insurance. I will use the United States of America as an example of where there is a private health insurance system, and I will use Australia as, currently, a country that has a universal health insurance system.

Mr GEAR-The article is titled, 'The USA-a costly mess'. It goes on: If you're an American and you get ill,' watch out. Further on. it says: The Economist, in an editorial, has described the US system as having ""expensive oversupply, empty and unneeded hospital beds chasing a dearth of patients, and redundancies to come"". That is the sort of private health insurance system we would get if we were mad enough to bring it into Australia. Let us look at the sorts of measures we should use when considering health .insurance, its effiCiency, and how we measure that efficiency. The way I would measure it is to find out how much of the dollar contributed by the person being insured actually gets back to the patient. That is the measure of effiCiency which should be used: how much of that dollar is consumed in administration costs, and how much of it actually gets back to where it is meant to go, that is, insuring the client? I am relying on the same discussion paper from the Consumers Health Forum Australia, called Health Care Mar;.. kets. These are that paper's figures, not mine. That paper makes the comparison. It states that 14c in every dollar in a private health insurance system goes on administration. In Medicare it drops to 4c. Ninety-six cents in every dollar in Medicare actually gets back to where it was intended to go. The Canadian national scheme, on which ours is based, has got it down to 3c. Who in his right mind would advocate going back to a private health insurance system? I will tell the House some people who would. The people who would advocate going back to a private health insurance system in fact, they demand it-are the speCialists, I know, from complaints that I have had, that many speCialists will not even see somebody in their surgery unless that person has private health insurance. One should ask oneself why? Why would somebody, educated at public expense, in public hospitals, with all their training, deny treatment to somebody just because the only insurance he has is Medicare? Of course, it is the doctordollar relationship in that case. I am happy to say it is a minority of the medjcal profession but it still exists. It is not hard to see the sort of people who go about this country promoting private health insurance schemes, inducing their patient-sometimes, as the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack) pointed out, at great personal inconvenience and cost to themselves-to take' but private insurance. Usually it is the elderly who take out the insurance because, by and. large, they are duped by 'these specialists into believing that if they have private health insurance they will get their operation straight way. What a lot of people in Australia do not know is that by taking out private health insurance they are removing the one barrier between the .surgeon and their wallet, and that is Medicare. As soon as somebody is a private patient the. specialist c-n send him the bill. We have got to address this issue, because people promoting private health .insurance never do. When people write to me about private insurance this is one of the things they always point out. They say, 'I didn't realise that by taking out private insurance 1 was going to get a bill in .excess of the schedule fee.' If they had been Medi- . care patients, treated in a public hospital, they would not have got that bill-they would have been charged the schedule fee and there would ,have been no cost .to the patients. By taking out private health insurance they still cannot fully cover themselves. That is an area we must look at. Certainly, it is no argument for private health insurance. The other criticism we constantly hear concerns waiting lists.",106

The Consumers Health Forum says this about waiting lists: Some people associate the waiting lists with Medicare. Many factors contribute to waiting lists, however, and the funding arrangements are but one of many. It is wrong to draw the inference that Medicare contributes because it is national, or because it is universal. The. problem lies in fee-for-service medicine.

The Government has allocated two hours for this cognate bate. Twenty-one have indicated their desire to speak; that is the level of importance the back benches and the front benches of this Parliament give to this debate. But this ernment, by press release, by total abuse Executive power, chooses purely and simply to allocate two hours. This Bill should never have been part of a cognate debate in the first place; that is the other mechanism the Government has used. According Notice Paper, debate on the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill would otherof wise have lasted for five minutes. This legislation proposes expenditure of $400m the first three years of its operation. Five minutes debate on legislation involving $400m is an outrage. Furthermore, that must be seen in the context that, during this week, some three hours of parliamentary debating time has been consumed by the Government taking opportunities to get at the Opposition. It is interesting to note that they have failed. The Government moved a censure motion and found itself censured. It survived only because of its numbers. Those opposite tried to get smart today on one of the most sensitive issues that we have ever seen, raised the immigration debate for purely opportunernments. istic reasons, and then actually voted against the nine principles laid down in their own publications as to what is the basis of our immigration policy. Their tactics are getting The as bad as their economic policies. The first point that I want to make in regard to this legislation is that the Opposition supports the Government's initiative. for The Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill will continue a program that was originally established in January 1985 to provide a wide range of services, including refuges, drop-in centres, halfway houses, meal servcounselling and referral and advocacy services to people in crisis and, primarily, of can course, in need of transitional accommodaThere are already 800 establishedÂ· supported accommodation assistance program (SAAP) services operating from 1,200 outlets around Australia. The national SAAP client data collection indicates that on any day more than 11,000 people throughout are assisted under this program1,500 in youth refuges, 2,500 in women's derefuges, 4,200 in general crisis accommodation services and 3,100 receiving meals. Others receive counselling and advice. Included to some extent-although this legislation Govmakes some changes to that-are services of relating to the great tragedy that now confronts our country, homeless youth. The Opposition does not believe that there is enough in this legislation-and nor is it necessarily which the appropriate implement-to look after to the those young people. An article in the Canberra Times, I think 22 February, in responding to some of the earlier remarks in the Burdekin report, in pointed out that there are between 20,000 and 25,000 homeless children in Australia, with 40,000 to 45,000 at risk of. becoming homeless, according to conservative estimates. That is a major tragedy. Although this legislation contains provisions in relation to a number of existing services for homeless youth, it is notable that it specifically states all that no new services will be provided from these funds for those under 16 years of age. I will not contest the Government's decision to do that. The Minister points out in his second reading speech that homeless youths under 16 are the responsibility of State govI think we in the Opposition would say that they are primarily the responsibility of their families and that it is a great indictment on the economic and social policies of this Government that young people are choosing to desert their families. The Opposition is of the view that, in giving financial assistance, we have to be very careful that it does not become an incentive for children, particularly those under 16 years of age, to leave their families. Throughout our Future Directions document we make it very clear that the best means of servicing and helping young people in our community is thro-gh the family. We argue very strongly that all possible forms of assistance through lower taxation must be provided for families, because it is very important to hold families together. Of course, that is not achieved by taxing them into oblivion. It is not achieved by increasing the interest burden of home mortgages by 5, 10 and 15 per cent. I use those figures without exaggeration, because when the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), from his very secure financial si-Â­ uation, casually. calls on the Reserve Bank to crank up the rediscount rate by half a per cent-or, as I think was the case today, by 0.3 per cent-contributing to a one per cent interest rate increase, that amounts to one per .cent over the previous 15 per cent. That , is not one per cent in terms of the cost; it is probably an increase of 5 per cent or 6 per' cent, or more, in the COSt, to a family. My mother said to me more than once as a child that when poverty comes through the door love flies out the window. Government policy is putting financial pressure on many families today. The Government's own Economic Planning Advisory Council has advised it ,about the increasing tax burden imposed on people over the past 20 yearspeople on three-quarters of average weekly earnings. We know, though, that the three-quarters of average weekly earnings criterion is a bit of a myth, because very few people earn that. However, a typical Australian wage earner on three-quarters of average weekly earnings has seen the tax burden on the family increase from 3 per cent of income back in the pre-Fraser days-and I am talking about a 20-year time span-to IS per cent today. Today, IS per cent of the income earn-d by a family on three-quarters of average weekly earnings is consumed by taxation. . We must then add the effects of this arrogant and incompetent Treasurer's tough monetary policy. The increasing interest rate is felt by people who might have taken out their home mortgage when the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) was on one of his election campaigns, when he told people not to worry about interest rates, saying, 'Trust me, they are going down'. He did that again before the Western Australian election. Presumably, there are still some Australians who believe the Prime Minister, and I wonder how many went out and contracted a mortgage thinking that they could afford it. They might have had just enough money to afford it and have taken the Prime Minister's assurance that their interest rate was not likely to increase. But that has happened. The Bill that we are dealing with now deals with transitional crisis accommodation, the queues for which will get longer. Tonight, at this very moment, people will be sitting down at their dinner tables and before they get up they will ask themselves whether they can afford to stay living in their house. Mr Cunningham-What a lot of rot! Mr TUCKEy-It is all very well for the honourable member for MCMillan to say that it is a lot of rot and that no-one is under housing pressure. It is fine for him: he gets the same salary as I do-and he gets an extra amount of money because he is the Government Whip. He does not have the problem; he is not the person I am talking about. I am talking about people on three-quarters of average weekly earnings. The honourable member can joke and smirk, but back in his electorate there are tonight people asking themselves whether they can afford to stay in their home. We are talking about crisis accommodation-MONICA",108

167,Mr TUCKEY,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"We are talking about crisis accommodation, and the Minister's interjection is irrelevant. He is also showing his extreme embarrassment. I am aware of the time constraints, and I intend to conclude my remarks. However, the point has to be made that this is what the legislation is about. The more the Government keeps its interest rates and taxes on low income families at the levels that exist now, the more it will have to spend on crisis accommodation. It is an outrage, and it is the policies of the Government that are driving people into these crisis situations. The honourable member should not shake his head, because the fact is that they are.",109
168,Dr CHARLESWORTH ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Perth) (6.00)It is hard to know where to begin after the canards, the red herrings and the falsehoods that we have had drawn across the trail today. Of course, the old perennial of public hospital queues has been thrown up at us. It behoves me to mention the fact that, like some of the honourable members on the other side of the House, I worked in the hospital system during the 1970s. Hospital queues have always been a part of the system; there have always been waiting lists. For the hospital system to function effectively, that is a state of life. If one looks at any Western nation's health care system, one finds hospital queues. People on the other side of the House, the great free marketeers, would endorse the philosophy of Margaret Thatcher. When we look at Margaret Thatcher's position in respect of the national health scheme, we do not find any change because that is a system that works. If the Opposition embraces the American system, fair enough. Let me refer to the comments made by Professor Stuart Altman a year ago in Australia. He was a Federal health economist and an adviser to the Congress and to the Reagan Administration. What dil;! he have to say when he came to Australia and looked at our system? Talking about the system in the United States, he stated: We as a country have been unwilling and unable politically to really make the kinds of choices that people say we have to make. I think that the United States is going to continue to see rapid increases (in health costs), at least through the end of the century and it could approach 15% of GNP. You have to believe that at some point the payers are going to become so furious that they finally will muster the political will to do something about it, but quite frankly, I don't see it in the cards regardless of who wins the next presidential election. What does he have to say about our system? Mr Reagan's adviser on economic health policy stated: So I leave you with the feeling that, if you want an exciting, well-functioning health care system-stay in Australia. That is what he had to say about the system that exists in the United States. It is a system which leaves 30 million people, the huge underclass that exists in the United States, a great body of people with no cover and no health insurance. Is that what the Opposition is endorsing? We do not know what it is endorsing, but I wish we did. If members of the Opposition had come into the chamber with a health policy and said, 'This is what we stand for', then perhaps we could comment on it and there could be a reasonable debate. But over time we have had three, four or five different policies and yes, the honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey) is right, he did produce a policy when he was the Opposition spokesman. I have a quotation from the President of the Australian Medical Association in Western Australia on Mr Tuckey's policy. What did he say? He stated: The answer could well be no. The answer could well be that it will not be any better. He continued: Take for example the American health care scene, where powerful health funds have reigned supreme, so that the medical profession has found itself squeezed and propelled into all sorts of fancy named cost cutting health care schemes. That is what could happen. The medical profession does not want that. What we have here today is a proposal-I suppose that it is a back flip in a sense. The honourable member for Canning ( Mr Gear), the one who people say is a doctor basher, has said, 'I support an increase in payments to doctors'. Yet the Opposition says, 'No, we don't want that'. This proposal for general practitioners is not something that we have just dreamed up; it has been well thought out. It is related to the content of the delivery of service. If we look at the amount of consultation and at the problems that have been identified in general practice, we find that the majority of general practitioners will agree that there are a number of problems. There is the problem of lack of incentives for general practitioners to spend time with their patients and there are problems with the low . incomes of general practitioners and their ability to resource their surgeries and to pursue further education and more training. The present training system for general practitioners is inadequate. The gentlemen on the other side of the House know that. How can they come in here and deny it? Yet the suggestion is made that in some way all of those forces that support this proposal are Government fronts, socialist bureaucrats who are supporting a proposal that we should improve the way in which general practice operates in this country. It is said that we should improve the training of general practitioners and give them the time to spend with their patients, improve their diagnostic ability and improve their skills. That is what this proposal is about; it is about improving the remuneration to them at the same time. It is a sensible proposal. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is not a Government front. Are members of the Opposition suggesting that it is? We will not believe them. Let us look at what the Australian Pensioners Federation had to say. It stated: We are supporting the proposed reforms to general practice . . . The Australia Pensioners Federation represents 70,000 pensioners in this country. I suggest that that is hardly a Government front. We have had a beating from the pensioners over a period, but the Australian Pensioners Federation states: We are supporting the proposed reforms to general practice because it will allow doctors to put care back into their practices. By reimbursing willing to undergo further training and quality ance measure, people will receive better health care and the local doctor better rebates-consumers and doctors will win. It is hardly reasonable for the Opposition to suggest that in some way this is a cocked up scheme by the Government. What did we hear from the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack)? He said, 'The theory won't work in practice. You are pushing this too soon. There hasn't been enough consultation'. But this proposal was put forward some time ago and the Australian Medical Association (AMA) , along with the Royal College of General Practitioners, was given the opportunity to be involved in consultations. The Australian Medical Association chose not to be involved in those consultations. Last week in an article headed, 'Top doctor quits AMA in fees row', we find that the representative of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners on the AMA, Dr Fisher, resigned because he could not work with the AMA. He suggested that the AMA was not interested in solving this problem; it was not interested in a solution. But the shadow spokesman says, 'The theory will not work in practice; you are just pushing it forward'. Yet last November what did we have? The AMA in a few months came up with a scheme, pushed it forward and said that everybody should start. Was that well thought through? Was there consultation then? No, not at all. The AMA said, 'We will just do it and it will be okay'. Now the AMA is complaining that there has been no consultation. This proposal has been well thought out; it has the support of large numbers of general practitioners. The AMA does not represent all the general practitioners in the community. How many doctors does it represent? Its membership is falling. I understand that the AMA is in crisis and that its leadership has difficulties. This proposal is about providing better health care at the primary level which will be improved. People will have the opportunity to spend more time with their doctor, to talk to their doctor about the problems that they face and their doctor will have the incentive and the possibility to improve his skills and to become a better primary care doctor. If those opposite the do not believe that, okay, they should get up doctors and say that they do not want it and that assurthey do not think general practitioners are any good, but that is not the point we are trying to make. There is one other issue here; that is the restructuring of the reinsurance pool. The suggestion by honourable members opposite is that in some way this will bring about the downfall of the health care system. We already know that there are vested interests out there and that the private hospitals would like to do better. It is interesting to note that the number of people who have hospital insurance as part of their private package has increased since this Government has been in office. So there has been an improvement in the number of people who have access to private hospitals. I say to the Opposition in respect of this matter that the suggestion that the old and the infirm will suffer is a nonsense. Again, I will quote from the Australian Pensioners Federation: We are supporting the proposed health insurance changes because any delay of this legislation will lead to further unfair victimisation of older people. Indeed, that is what it is all about. Anyone who wants to make the sick, the elderly and the chronically ill pay will oppose these changes. If they want a system which is fairer and which provides stability and evenness, they will support the legislation before the House.",110
169,Dr WOOLDRIDGE ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Chisholm) (6.11)I rise in this cognate debate .to speak on the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. Let me say that earlier today, when I looked at which Minister would be responsible for this debate and saw listed the Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples), I was particularly disappointed. I acknowledge that the Minister for Health and Community Services (Dr Blewett) has come into the House to listen to this debate. . The two things I wish to speak about are the proposed changes to reinsurance and the proposed changes to general practice. There has been much talk about. why the changes to reinsurance have come about. Certainly, the private health industry in this country is in enormous difficulty. I wish to talk about two independent impressions which have not been raised in this debate. The first is that of Mr Dick Scotton; the second is that of the Health Insurance Commission. I have in my hand a paper by R. B. Scotton, who is now at the Public Sector Management Institute at Monash University, writing about these proposed changes. This is the man who was the architect of Medicare. What does he say about these proposed changes? The first thing he says is this: . . . the proposed changes to the reinsurance pool will accelerate the trend towards adverse selection . . . Marginal good risk individuals will drop their insurance . . . thereby increasing the adverse selection of the total pool. Secondly, the architect of Medicare states: The two possibilities therefore appear to be that either the impact of the new regulation will be small and pointless, or that it will be large and destructive-destructive in the sense that it will hasten the demise of the private insurers. The second comment on these proposed changes comes from the Health Insurance Commission. This is a draft letter-admittedly, just a draft-but it was confirmed by the manager of the Medicare division of the Health Insurance Commission at a public meeting in Camberwell of over 100 people at which I was present. That was before he was 'heavied' by officers of the Minister's Department. This is what the Health Insurance Commission thought of the proposed changes: I quote: If the aim of the proposal is to encourage an increased level of health insurance within the community, thereby increasing utilisation of private hospitals, it will fail. Let me remind the Minister that this is the view of the Health Insurance Commission. The letter goes on: I believe there is a strong view within the actuarial profession that the concept proposed is mathematically flawed. Has the Minister looked at that problem? I doubt it. The letter continues: The incentive to continually strive to attract good risk membership into funds is largely removed.Â· The fund which spends its contributors' money in an attempt to continually attract good risks will achieve little more than a subsidisation of its competitors. Such a disincentive can only undermine the overall risk profile within the industry, leading to even more expensive contribution rates. Much of the incentive for tight claims management will be removed. Given the algorithm to distribute the reinsurance pool, there is no doubt the cost of the basic table will rise to a relatively greater degree than that of the top tables. In effect, this will penalise the lower socio-economic group. The overall impact will be inflationary while the overall increases in rates will cause even more members to elect to drop their insurance. It will reduce the number insured and introduce an environment where contribution rates will dramatically increase. Disadvantages of the proposed arrangements far outweigh any perceived advantages. These are the views I heard from the manager of Medicare in front of 100 other people, before he went quiet and was told to toe the Government line. I would be happy for the Minister to deny that. We have heard about a lack of consultation. It appears there was great consultation withÂ· one group. I remind the Minister that when he makes a major change, he cannot expect the Opposition to allow him to ram it through when the other organisations that have a stake in it, such the Australian Medical Association, the private hospitals or-if the Minister wants to throw them off and dismiss them, which I can understand-the Australian Catholic Health Care Association and similar groups are saying that what the Minister is doing is wrong. We are very concerned about what is happening to the existing funds. We would like to help the Government, but we will not allow one group to be bought off at the expense of all others without consultation. That is what the referral to this Committee is all about. The $20m, which is in fact $10m a year-only a fraction of what the Government has torn out of the private health insurance industry-at least is a start. I would be surprised if we needed legislation specifiunder cally to do that but, if the Government wanted to do that, and that only and it requires legislation, I am convinced the Opposition would support it. These other thfngs are ill-considered. There has not been consultation throughout the industry. The majority of the industry saw this for the first time last Thursday week, after the Minister tabled it in Parliament. I am sorry if the Minister disagrees with me, but that is what they tell me and I have spoken to people in everyone of those organisations.",112
170,Dr BLEWETT ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"They are not telling you the truth, and that is not unusual for some of them.",113
171,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"That is reinsurance. I wish to talk also about the changeS to general practice. General practice is in a very difficult state at the moment. In Australia for the past five years we have been graduating 50 per cent more doctors per 100,000 of the pORulation than does any other comparable country in the world. As to general practitioner fees, in spite of the Minister's assertions otherwise, if one looks at the net income component of the increase in the schedule fee, as the Minister's Departyears ment defines it, it amounted to 17.2 per cent between 1983 and 1987. By how much did average weekly earnings go up? By 32 per cent. By how much did the consumer price index go up? By 32.7 per cent. General practitioners have a new kind of competition. I do not mind competition, but this sort of competition has been encouraged by the as Minister's scheme. I will read to the House a letter given to me last week. It is dated 23 March, and is from a group called Health Monitor. It states: Dea- Patient: This Medical Centre practices preventative medicine, and is now a hepatitis-B Vaccination centre. If you would like to protect yourself and your family against the Hepatitis-B virus, please contact our receptionist . . . to arrange participation in our . . . program, which involves a pre-vaccination blood screening, and a three-dose vaccination regime, and a post-vaccination 'blood test. As, this clinic Bulk Bills, an amount of $15 per vaccination is the only cost to you. That amounts to five visits and two blood tests, none of which I imagine should be paid Medicare. Let the Minister tell me how his monitoring system will pick up that sort of thing. I have here a pamphlet on hepatitis-B which tells us all the terrible things that can happen to us but does not give any ,realistic understanding of the incidence of hepatitis-B or the relative risks. I also have another brochure advertising the clinic. This is the sort of thing that has happened under Medicare. That is the sort of competition that doctors are finding very hard to cope with. What has the Minister said on this legislation? I have his speech with me. He said: I am concerned that the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has been involved in a campaign of misinformation, with its - claims that part time GPs, the majority of whom are women, will not be eligible to register, when a simple inquiry would have revealed that this was patently false. I will tell the Minister what a simple inquiry revealed. This inqu;ry ranged over a fourweek period and was made by a number of doctors whom I have called Doctors A to E: On 20 April, Dr A phoned the College and spoke to Dr Ian Tulloch. She was told that 'predominantly in general practice for five required eight sessions a week'. Anything less had to be worked on a part time formula. On April 24, Dr Joanna Flynn from the College stated at a Victorian Medical Women's Society meeting that the details had p,ot yet been worked out and would be finalised at a meeting in Sydney on 5, 6 and 7 May. On 10 May, after that meeting, Dr A again rang the. College and spoke to Elizabeth Marson. She was told that three sessions in a practice for six months was equal to two months full time. Up to six months locums could be counted, provided they were in the one practice for more than a week. On the same day Dr B rang the College in Sydney and was referred to a Melbourne telephone number. She was told that five years full time or part time was okay. When she asked whether one session a week was all right she was told that it probably was but she would have to apply to the register. When she asked about the criteria she was unable to be given an answer. On 11 May Dr C spoke again to Dr Ian Tulloch in Melbourne. She was told that two sessions a week for five years was all right, so long as it was predominantly in general practice, but that both sessions had to be in the same practice. Dr Tulloch said he did not yet have all the details. On the same day, Dr D rang the College in Melbourne and was told they were still working out the finer details and she would be mailed something in June. The same day Dr E tried five times to contact Dr Tulloch and gave up. On 17 May Dr B from Sydney rang the College and was again referred to Dr Tulloch in Melbourne. He told her that working two sessions a week in general practice was okay so long as that was all they did. That is what the Minister describes as a simple inquiry. It resulted in seven different answers in four weeks. Can the Minister see why people out there are worried? The Minister said that the proposal would not discriminate against women doctors. Women have a particularly difficult time in the medical profession because of the length and the difficulty of the training. If the Minister thinks that that sort of rigid training does not discriminate, he should look at the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. There are 12 female surgeons in Victoria. The Bill gives the. college the power to determine who is on the register, and no other college has that power. The Minister has said that special groups will not be disadvantaged. Yet the College is now saying that if a doctor works two sessions a week in general practice and three sessions in women's health, they will not be eligible. Does that make sense? The worse thing about this proposal is the closed shop nature of it. Prior to my entering Parliament I was involved in discussions as a representative of the younger doctors with members of the College, with the family medicine program and with the Australian Medical Association (AMA), and I can tell the Minister that after all those discussions representatives would tell me that what this was really about was the hope that one day they could control medical manpower in general practice. What they want to do is put up a hurdle that is so great that it will stop people entering general practice. The Minister has talked about what happens overseas. He has told the House that in Canada this happens and in England this happens. I would like to tell him what the Dougherty report said. This was a report the Minister commissioned. I am sure he knows it. In the United Kingdom: four years training including registration. This is compul. sory. I am referring to page 267 of the report. In New Zealand: voluntary, one year. In the United States: voluntary, three years. In Canada: voluntary! two years. What are we doing in Australia? Involuntary, six to seven years; and that is what it is, because we have one year internship with proposals around the States to make it two, and to become a Fellow of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners it is now five years. These conditions are not applied anywhere else in the world. This scheme will reduce the number of women that can do that sort of training, just like the College of Surgeons has done, and the Government will consign to the scrapheap some of the most idealistic and capable young people that this country has. Yes, there are problems in medical practice, and if the Minister wants to increase the rebate I would personally support him and I would think my Party would support him. The idea of continuing education is a great one. Increasing the rebate is obviously important. I have some problems with audit, but basically it is not bad. But putting this hurdle in the way of people trying to enter general practice-and that is what it will do-is just not on. What has the Minister said on radio? I heard his Murray Nichols interview yesterday. It was kindly taped and sent up to me. 1 was surprised that the Miriister, as the longest serving Health Minister in this country, was not prepared to debate with a young doctor who had never been on the radio before in her life. However, he made a few statements and, I am sorry to say, they are wrong. He said it applies in other countries. Well, 1I have said what the report he commissionedsaid. The Minister spoke about 'a practitioner being 30 years old before having children' and stated, 'Well, other specialists are not finished before they are 30 but they can still work'. He should have a look at how it affects women in the College of Surgeons. Given the restraint of time 1 will not swer specific allegations from members on the Government side, but 1 would say to the Minister, as sincerely as anyone can say in this place, that my motivation for getting involved in politics-and it was not party politics; it was medical politics'--was seeing what the system did to my colleagues, seeing people at four o'clock in the morning slumped in a corner in the residents' quarters crying because they could not cope. My first job as a young doctor was 104 hours a week and that was what 1 was rostered. Now things are a little better, but the strains the hours and of the system of initiation the older members of the medical profession impose on the younger is simply not fair. These are young people with great idealism and great hope, and it is not the medical school that takes it out of them; it is the residency years. These proposals will enforce on a large number of people who have tried to keep open some options of flexibility, a system whereby they are subject to the same' outrageous pressures that some of the speciality colleges place on their trainees, and it will have the same effect. It is unjust, unfair wrong.",113
172,Mrs JAKOBSEN ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Cowan) (6.25)-I am delighted to concur with the spirited contributions earlier in this debate by my colleagues the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh), the honourable member for Canning ( Mr Gear) and the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), all of whom have a thorough grasp of the subject and made very fine speeches. 1 thought that the comments of the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack) at the commencement of the debate today on the reasons for the guillotine being applied to these Bills were totally misplaced as he must have been aware that the Senate has placed some constraints on this chamber and we are bound by them. If the honourable member is genuinely concerned about the lack of available time to debate the matters currently before the House, perhaps he ought to prevail upon some of his colleagues in the Senate to have a look at that again when it comes up. 1 think all members of this place would have welcomed the opportunity to speak on a number of the matters a little more fully, an- but we are faced with these constraints of time. The Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill which we are debating today implements the first stage of the new general practitioner fees package, which the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) has just spoken on. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has recently agreed to this package with the Federal Government and 1 believe it is also supported by the Doctors Reform Society, or at least it has been in some proof grams that 1I have heard on the radio. These that new arrangements will promote better quality patient care, 1 believe, and they will encourage doctors to undertake meQical education on a continuing basis, as well as maintaining quality assurance programs. While general practitioners are usually able to provide a reasonable service for patients affected by illnesses with which they are familiar, they cannot always, often because of pressure of work, as he pointed out, keep up with the latest medical developments or acquaint themselves with research and informed comment on the serious ailments afand fecting some of their patients. This is a particularly unfortunate circumstance, and 1 take the honourable member's point about the pressures that this will place on the medical profession, but many of them are already under incredible pressure and the answer is to increase the number of doctors as well as increasing their access to, and the incentives for them to improve their knowledge of, new developments. How many doctors, for instance, have had an opportuni-y to properly study the literature on diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)? How many hospital; know the types of AIDS treatment presently being trialled in Australia and elsewhere? How many general practitioners have had time to make themselves aware of the latest research on the widespread malaise known as chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic enbit cephalomyelitis (ME)? As some members of this House will know, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) in particular, I have an interest in this illness and I use it as. an example in. this debate because it encapsulates the problems faced by general practitioners in terms of their ability, and sometimes their willingness, to upgrade their diagnostic knowledge and skills as well as their familiarity with newer breeds of treatment and medication. This shortcomdoctors ing can have disastrous results on the comdoctors munity they are endeavouring to serve, and I know they are honestly endeavouring to serve the community in many cases. For instance, at a receJ;lt meeting held my electorate, ME sufferers expressed exmuch treme distress about the reluctance of the medical profession to accept the disease as something other than hysterical in its origin, an opinion which has been discredited recent research but which was commonly held SOme years ago. Almost every chronic fatigue syndrome sufferer has consulted nubattle, merous doctors and had a variety of different and incorrect diagnoses made. I point out to the House at this point that these people have been diagnosed as having not only psytained chiatric illness, which is the most Common, or being referred to psychiatrists and psytising chologists, but also things as varied as thritic complaints .or mid-life crises----,all sorts of things-and the drugs that they have taken have done them no good at all. In many instances in fact the drugs that have been prescribed have contributed to a fursider ther deterioration in their already fragile of health. Needless to say, the cost in money terms to the sufferers has been considerable, decal spite Medicare benefits, even though no sonal benefit has accrued to them from the consultations. Often they discover a more broad minded or well-informed doctor purely by accident, and on occasion the disease is diagnosed in passing by somebody trying to treat their symptoms in, say, a children's children have this disease as well. The doctors, after many years of treatment, suddenly say, 'Look, it may be chronic fatigue syndrome or post viral syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis'. Once the person seeks that sort of treatment he or she has a more chance of improving the condition.",115
173,Deus ex machina,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,116
174,Mrs JAKOBSEN,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I mentioned the importance of doctors being well informed on illnesses which are not very well known in the comm\lnity. I named as an example the illness of myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome. I was concerned that many patients were visiting a lot of and were being misdiagnosed because were not aware of the disease or did not believe in it. I also mentioned that it cost patients a lot of money. Their health was going downhill because of the drugs that were prescribed for the illnesses that they in were allegedly suffering from. I think it is better that these people find a doctor who is prepared to look at their illness as if it is ME. Whilst a cure may not be available, at least there are forms of treatment which by can bring about a marked improvement in the patients' condition which would enable them to conserve their strength for the real that is, the private battle of their personal immune system with. the disease. The vocational register of general practitioners proposed in this Bill will be mainby the Health Insurance Commission. It will register a medical practitioner as pracpredominantly in general practice and aras having appropriate training and experithose ence in general practice .. Enrolment on the register will be voluntary. In assessing a doctor's medical practice, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners will Â«<>nwhether the practitioner provides a state comprehensive pri-ary medical service, including treating a wide range of patients and conditions using a variety of accepted mediskills and techniques, providing services peraway from the surgery on request and making provision for patients to have access to medical care after hours. Practitioners whose practice has been predominantly in general practice for five years, whether full time or part time, will be eligible for registration. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners will recognise them under those circumstances. I note with interest the comments of the honourable member for Chisholm about the 'closed shop', particularly as we have had one in the medical profession in this country for a number of years already. Anyone who doubts that statement should talk to doctors from overseas whose qualifications have not been recognised and who are unable to obtain access to an internship for hospital training which would upgrade their knowledge of Australian medical practice to the point where they could actually pass the necessary exams and then use their skills to help sick people in our community. It has certainly been the Government's, aim to include as many general practitioners as possible within the eligibility criteria-not to exclude them. The private health insurance aspects of this Bill also are important in that they improve the protection available to elderly people with private health insurance coVer by spreading the insurance risks of covering Australia's aged population fairly among all private health funds. The proposed changes will increase stability within the private health sector, advantaging the majority of health fund contributors in the short term and also the entire private health care industry in the longer term. In the context of the contribution of the honourable member for Tangney on this aspect of the Bill also, it is necessary out, as did the honourable member for Phillip, that these changes have been acceptedby the Australian Council of the Ageing as well as by all groups which represent pensioners. This Bill deserves the support of the majority of general practitioners as well as the broader community. I congratulate the Minister on his perseverance and farsightedness in bringing this legislation into being.",116
175,Dr WOODS ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Lowe) (8.05)-1t is with some sadness that I rise to address some of the issues raised in the community services and health legislation. These are some of the most far-reaching changes which have been introduced by this Government for some time; yet is has put the guillotine on it. We have, I think, a total of two hours to discuss matters which really should take much, much longer. There are two issues I want to address in the short time which I will take up in view of the constraints upon us. The first is the reinsurance issue and the second is the changes to general practitioners' structures, salaries and training. The reinsurance issue is a classic example of how the Government-and the Minister for Community. Services and Health (Dr Blewett) in particular-has misinformed us and told half-truths about the situation. The problem is not, as the Government has portrayed it, one of community rating. The Opposition has always and will always support community rating. That is not in question. The problem faced by the Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia (VHIAA) and other' non-profit-making organisations in this field is not related to the intrusion of funds such as Health Australia and some of the closed funds. That this is true is clearly demonstrated by the fact that Health Australia and those similar new funds have only 2 per cent of the market. ,How can one honestly and realistically expect any impact upon the market by such a small percentage of the market? The truth is that the problem lies in the reduction of the numbers of people who are privately insured. The percentage of people who have private insurance has gone down over the last few years, since this Government took office, from a figure in the high sixties to the latest figure of 46 per cent. That is the basic problem with the to point health insurance system at present. The target of the VHIAA should not be Health Australia or the closed funds. The target of the VHIAA should be the Government. The Government is the one that is making it diffi9ult for people to continue with insurance. It is making it uneconomical. It is really undermining the whole system of insuring oneself privately against the risks of being sick. There are two ways of fixing this problem: one is to make sure that there is more private insurance. This is what the Opposition's health policy will do. The second is to inject into the reinsurance pool adequate funds from the Government. What the Government has done is basically pitiful. It has claimed that this year it would normally put in $lm. Since the beginning of its administration it has put in some $47m. The proposal in front of us is a sweetener of $20m, which is a one-off sweetener. It is conscience money, a bandaid. Let us just compare the Government's figure of $47m in total with that of the Fraser Administration, which put in $525m. This Government has taken out $200m. Therein lies the problem, together with the fact that so few people are now insured. What this Government is trying to do is to come to a political solution before the next election, cover it up with a few bandaids and hope that the problems facing the industry do not come out before the election. There is no short term solution to this. This isa short term, bandaid solution. We need long term solutions to the problem. In terms of the changed structure of general practitioners' training and remuneration, first of all we support the concept that general practitioners should have their training improved. They should be encouraged to train better and in more detail. There should be some system of monitoring this. We support the concept that those general practitioners who are better and better trained should in fact be paid better. We support .the contentbased proposals made by the Australian Medical Association (AMA) a few months ago, which the Government, I might point out, at that stage rejected. We have no problems at all with that concept. We have problems with the way the Government is trying to put this into being. It is trying to divide and rule the medical profession and, in particular, the general practitioners. On the one side we have the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. On the other side, we have the AMA womens' groups, those people with special interests and the majority of general practitioners, who although they would like extra remuneration are agreed that this centralisation by the Government is entirely inappropriate and in the long term will destroy the profession. Of course, the College is happy. It has been given unequalled power to limit the number of general practitioners. As my colleague, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) said earlier, one of the aims of the College and .other groups has been to limit the number of general practitioners because in the long run it gives them both more power and more money. To have a register controlled by the Health. Insurance Commission and to have Federal control over this list fills me with foreboding about the socialisation of medicine. It is only one stage away from the preferred provider system, that is, saying, 'You are on the list. Ther-Â­ fore, you can actually practise under Medicare and get rebates under Medicare. You, however, on the other hand, are not on this list. You are not able to practise under Medicare'. It is one stage down the road. The Government may shake its head and disapprove of that theory, but it is only just around the corner if we allow this sort of nonsense to go through. We certainly encourage education;We certainly want to reward excellence, but not in this way. The groups that will suffer are very clearly the minority groups in many ways; for example, women. One may say that is a funny description for 50 per cent of the population. But in general practice the female general practitioners are a very large and significant group. Those with special interests, such as those with sports medicine interests, will suffer. It is entirely wrong that a patient who has, for example, a sporting injury and who attends a doctor with special expertise in this particular area should receive a lower rebate than if he or she attended, with the same injury, a person from the College list who may not have the same expertise. He or she will get worse service and have to pay more for it. Very similar situations quite clearly can apply to student health clinics, occupational medicine practitioners and women's health clinics. Why should the patients of those doctors who have specialties and for whom broad training is inappropriate be penalised by getting lower rebates for attending, in many cases, experts in the field? Quite clearly, this proposed system favours those who are able to enter general practice via a structured program, as opposed to some of the other ways of educating and improving themselves. There is very little evidence that this is a good way of producing quality practitioners. For example, many women who would like to sit the College examinations, and who may well have done so in the past, under this system would probably become ineligible. Quite clearly, many practices realise the major benefits of having a female practitioner for many illnesses and conditions. If we look forward to what will happen in terms of the employment of doctors, we will see that there are all sorts of problems that the Government clearly has not thought out. Firstly, if a patient finds that one doctors he is seeing is not on this list, that doctor will have the stigma of being a trainee doctor and patients may well choose not to see him or her, which in turn will decrease the trainee's experience, or may claim that they would like to see a 'properly trained' doctor. That may be an unnecessary expense. On the other hand, who is the average practitioner running a practice going to employ to help him? If he employs somebody who is not on the list, somebody who has not been through the particular structured training program, the rebate the practice will get, the income the practice will get, willÂ· be that much lower. Quite clearly, even though the patient may get the same or better service, the practice will suffer financially. Quite clearly, such practices will not employ those doctors, thereby generating another catch 22 situation. It is our belief that continuing medical education and quality assurance should be encouraged, but that they should be controlled by the profession, not by some elitist group within the profession as such. It is very interesting to note the stance of the AMA in this regard. It basically said that we should not give more power to an elitist group within the profession, which is its un. derstanding of the College of General Practitioners. If more funds are available, surely that money which is taken and will be taken by administration should be available for hands-on general patient care to improve the lot of the patient, not to improve the income of some administrators. There is a closed shop. The honourable member for Cowan ( Mrs Jakobsen) mentioned that there was a closed shop at present, and I would not argue with that. There is a closed shop because the Government has decided that it will keep a closed shop. That is not an excuse for maintaining a further closed shop within the broader closed shopa' closed shop of general practitioners who' will become an elitist group. I reiterate: we support the principal of encouraging training, education and experience of GPs, but this is the wrong way to do it. It will destroy the profession and it should be changed as soon as possible.",117
176,Mr IAN ROBINSON ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Page) (8.13)-I rise to contribute briefly to the debate, which of the has been wide ranging but which nevertheless has raised very significant issues that I am sure the community at large will expect this Parliament to give more time to. There is great concern throughout Australia about the care of that section of the community that needs hospital treatment and, likewise, that section of the community that is in need of accommodation in the appropriate categories provided for the aged. I am concerned to find an increased incidence of difficulty in the matter of hospital treatment. Only in the last couple of weeks I have seen first hand in my own electorate the problem of a lack of adequate facilities in public hospitals. An aged person suffered a series of minor strokes. In the early stages a general practitioner (GP) and a specialist were consulted. After being affected once again by a further stroke, the person had to be transported to a very large local hospital. The waiting time on arrival was five hours. The trauma for the patient and for the family was just horrendous, so much so that a phone call was made to the GP to indicate the difficulties. After some discussion it was decided by the family to take the patient home. In this day and age this sort of occurrence reflects very badly on any government, Federal or State. There is a partnership between governments )n providing health care. Breakdowns of this kind are just not good enough. A week or so later the decision was made that medication was no longer appropriate for this same patient. This major public hospital decided that the patient should no longer have a bed in that hospital and the patient was transported to another hospital 20-odd miles away, simply because that transfer meant a change of hospital category. The patient went into a hospital that provides very wonderful care for people in a particular condition. In this case, the end of medication was apparently the yardstick for determining the classification. There is insufficient flexibility and insufficient understanding of the real import of what is involved when people are in a critically ill condition, as was the case with the patient to whom I have just referred. So much trauma is involved that not only the patient but also the patient's immediate family are under great stress and strain. The determining of the categories for treatment and occupancy of beds, the availability of advice and care, and the requirements imposed in terms of where the medical profession must draw the line and the paid staff of an institution take over are all matters which have got out of hand, and this reflects very badly on this Government and on State governments. It is not a matter of politics; it is a matter of a very great need to return to the basics. We have had a wonderful health system in this country and it has virtually broken down. The fault lies not with fundamental differences in political views on health. The breakdown comes because of the inability of the various sectors within the system to be able to negotiate, to reach sensible agreements and to provide, as a consequence, a satisfactory service for the public. It is a tragedy that we see this trend occurring. I fear that this legislation is not a resolution of the problem. The two Bills before the House do not address the fundamentals that are causing the problems. There may be a slight palliative somewhere along the line, but a totally inadequate one. This morning the Canberra Times carried a headline to a leading article which said: 'Health care a right or a lu-ury?'. There is no doubt that health care is a right and that any question of luxury does not arise. The content of that leading article is very pertinent to the debate in which this House is engaged. The Government has a responsibility which it should recognise.",119
177,Mr OKEEFE ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Burke) (8.20)-My contribution will be brief, because I know that time is on the wing. I am very happy to support the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill. I believe that, since it was introduced in 1983, the supported accommodation assistance program of the Hawke Labor Government has been one of our real success stories. We have been through a phase of continuing policy development, involving the review that led to the extension that is incorporated under this legislation. Through this program we have genuinely faced up to the fact that many people, for one reason or another, find themselves in difficult personal circumstances and require assistance. All the things with which people need assistance, whether a roof over their heads, the means to make a contribution in society through employment, accommodation or other assistance, are key factors. I believe that we have achieved enormous success through this program. I do not feel embarrassed tonight in pointing to examples in my electorate. For example, in Kyneton, a medium sized provincial town in rural Victoria, a particular kind of accommodation crisis occurs from time to time. Kyneton has a well developed program of supported accommodation, which was established under this legislation. I know that, when the Minister at the table, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) visited my electorate 18 months ago, he was impressed by the way in which our programs were being brought to effect in these rural provincial areas by a professional and committed attitude on the part of people at the local level delivering the services. By way of contrast, I cite an area such as Sunbury, which I suppose could be described as a satellite centre outside Melbourne and in which, one might think, there was full employment and thriving activity. Sunbury is close to the airport and has all sorts of things going for it, yet in that modern community there is still a need for specialised supported accommodation programs, and submissions are still being received for further assistance. Recently I was talking to the honourable member for MCEwen ( Mr Cleeland) who, under the Victorian redistribution, will take over from my area the town of Craigieburn, in relation to which an application for a hostel worker to be appointed under this program is pending. I hope that the submission will receive favourable consideration from the Minister when it comes before him. Mr Smith-Speak up, he can't hear you.",120
178,Mr OKEEFE,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"One must row the boat for the things one wants in the electorate. That is why we are appointed and we must take every opportunity. I will certainly support the honourable member for MCEwen in his representation on behalf of his group. I was very interested to hear the interjection by the honourable member for Bass ( Mr Smith) because, when we are debating even hon-controversial matters that ought to be virtually apolitical, such as this Bill, we should have no doubt that our friends in the National Party of Australia will be wandering around their electorates throughout Australia, and certainly in Victoria, saying how they have money for this program and money for that program under this legislation. I see it all the time, because I am a country member. The National Party members wander around preaching their populist cant, saying, 'Isn't it terrific. We have a grant for this that.' Where does the grant come from? It is provided under this program, which was introduced by the Minister at the table on behalf of this Government. It focuses on those priorities. Of course, those National Party members stand up in this House and oppose the legislation, moving to amend it and talking about all the things that are wrong with it whereas, out there at the coalface where it really counts, where the votes are to be won and where the community must understand what is really going on, they say, 'Isn't it wonderful. I have all (his money for supported assistance, particularly in rural areas.' I draw a parallel with another aspect, because these people continue with their populist cant. The Party brings to Canberra people who, it claims, represent country people, but it produces people like Senator Stone who is a career bureaucrat from Canberra, who has been a Treasury character all his life and who now goes around saying that he is a National Party representative of country people. He has never been in the country. The National Parti'in Victoria has just dumped Senator MCGauran, but young Senator MCGauran who represents the National Party here purports to be a representative of country people. However, he is a Melbourne city councillor and a motel owner, and is now involved with the Pavilion Hotel in Canberra. I tell you, he is into supported accommodation. He is probably using his travel allowance and encouraging members opposite to help his investment with supported accommodation on government T A. That is the kind of supported accommodation program that members opposite like. They come into the House and carryon about this kind of legislation. Mr Smith-It would have to be at a discount.",120
179,Mr OKEEFE,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"I certainly do not intend to be distracted by interjections such as that. I know that I am under some pressure from the Whip to move along the debate as quickly as I can, so in summary I want to say that the introduction of the program in 1983 was, I believe, one of the very good initiatives of the Hawke Labor Government. It has certainly received a good response in Victoria and and has been welcomed by the Victorian Government, complemented by the activities of the Victorian Government in its efforts to assist what we have done to provide emergency and supported accommodation. Where it matters it works, and to the extent that members opposite come into this House and express reservations about this Bill, they do themselves no credit because, in the end, while there is toing and froing in this place and while there is debate, there is also the aspect that the Australian people are looking for positive cooperation in areas where there is no real debate, not opposition for the sake of opposition, not dispute for the sale of dispute, and not blocking in the other place simply to be restrictive and to make things difficult. The people are looking for more from this process; most importantly, they are looking for quality programs and quality assistance. This legislation enables the supported accommodation program to go on, and I am happy to support the Bill tonight.",121
180,Mr TAYLOR ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Groom) (8.28)-In this unfortunately abbreviated debate this evening I will restri-t my comments to the reinsurance provisions of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill, but first I would like to reflect on one or two points that were raised in this place earlier this evening by the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh). The honourable member talked about support by gtoups representing aged people for the reinsurance provisions and the legislative package. All I can say to the honourable member is that she should have listened to what the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack) said on that point. Clearly, the groups representing aged people in this country are being hoodwinked by the legislative package. This Bill is not, as the honourable member for Burke ( Mr O'Keefe) has just said, an uncontroversial piece of legislation. As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, it is very controversial indeed. I would also like to counter the comments of the honourable member for Phillip about those who support the provisions by referring to those who are opposed. The list of those who are opposed reads something like this: the Australian Private Hospitals Association, the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of Surgeons, the Australian Association of Surgeons, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, Health Australia, F AI Insurances Ltd, dozens of health funds belonging to the Health Insurance Restricted Membership Association of Australia, and hundreds of thousands of private health insurance contributors. I would also like to draw attention to another point the honourable member for Phillip made. She said that she was a committed Medic-re supporter. All I can say to the honourable member is that, very clearly in my view, she is committed to failure. Why? We hav,e a system with Medicare where we see, costs inextricably rising as the queues lengthen. As far as honourable members on this' side of the House are concerned, our opposition to the reinsurance provisions could be summarised by eight broad points. With the indulgence of the House I would like to refer to those eight points. Point one: it seems that the Government's plan to change the private health fund reinsurance pool will result in health fund contributions rising, not falling, as the Government has promised. The increased cost of insurance will lead to even more' people opting out of private health insurance and depending solely on an already severely overtaxed public health system. Fewer private health insurance members will mean less money in the reinsurance pool, forcing all funds to .increase their prices. Health insurance, therefore, will be priced out of the reach of many Australians, particularly the elderly and chronically ill, who need it most. The honourable member for Tangney referred to this point earlier inÂ· the debate. Point two: the changes discriminate against elderly people and treat them as second class citizens. Health funds will no longer be di-' rectly responsible for the care in hospitals of contributors aged 65 and over. These benefits will be claimed from a faceless reinsurance pool, not from patients' chosen health funds to which they pay their contributions. Point three: despite what the honourable member for Canning ( Mr Gear) said earlier in this debate, the planned changes will force private health, care contributors to pay for the Government's mistakes. Members of the solvent health funds will have to contribute to the reinsurance pool, through their funds, to subsidise claims made on other funds which are in financial difficulty. Yet the financial crisis facing this industry is largely of the Government's making. Medicare has resulted in a huge drop in the number of people privately insured-from about 75 per cent in 1984 to about 46 per cent today. Over the past six years the Federal Government has taken away more than $430m in support for the sick and elderly by, withdrawing subsidies to the reinsurance, pool. Point four: the Government is imposing sectionalised taxation by forcing successful health funds to pay for other funds' financial problems, which in some cases have been exacerbated by mismanagement. This is clearly evidenced by recent events with some of these funds in a number of States. Point five: the Government is placing even greater strain on the community ratings principle by turning more people away from private cover when it should be encouraging more back into it. Of course, the policy that will emerge shortly from this side of the House will correct that point. Point six: the changes seem designed as a cosmetic solution to prevent the political embarrassment of health funds collapsing before the next election. As many of my colleagues have said previously, the Government has not addressed the real problems-the failure of the Medicare system and the Government's own withdrawal of support of the reinsurance pool-and it has not considered the longer term effects of these changes. Point seven: the token $20m one-off payment the Government is promising to the reinsurance pool this year is little more than a bribe to sell the changes. Finally, point eight: the changes will lead to large scale reductions in private health care available to Australians. Private hospitals may face closure and many specialist and ancillary services may bt( priced out of the reach of ordinary people. I should like to finish my brief comments this evening by referring to a couple of points the honourable member for Tangney made earlier in the debate. He said that elements of this legislative package are yet another bandaid on the health care sore-a point with which I agree-and that we are simply rearranging the deckchairs on the health care Titanic. Just to expand the Titanic analogy a little further, all I can say is that many on the other side of the House will go down . electorally with the Hawke ship, a ship which is poorly maintained, a ship which leaks like a sieve, a ship which has more ballast than substance, and a ship which is top heavy and about to capsize with a big bang. Such a ship can do only one thing: it must sink into political oblivion.",121
181,Ms CRAWFORD ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Forde) (8.37)-1 think the hOf,lourable member for Groom ( Mr Taylor) has elucidated the Opposition's real problem with the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill and the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill, which are being debated cognately-that is, the deep-seated opposition of members of the Opposition to Medicare and Medicare cover, which ensures that two million Australians who did not have cover before now have cover. We also see that elitist approach to life reflected in their opposition to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill ensuring that the general practitioners' register will acknowledge that general practitioners are major contributors in .looking after patients within the Australian industry. We find this kind of elitism at the heart of their opposition to this legislation. Most people in Australia see general practitioners and are treated by general practitioners. The preventative medicine programs, which are inherent in general practice in this community and which are acknowledged in this legislation, are the real problem for many members of the Opposition. The honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) cited a case which supports his belief that many female members of the profession are being disadvantaged-the fact that there are only twelve female members of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. I ask him: Why are there only twelve female members of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in Victoria? This is a deep-seated problem for the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and for society at large. It is not that women are less able or less willing to undertake the rigid and stringent programs of the College. Â·1 suggest to the honourable member for Chisholm that many partners of women surgeons are unwilling to make the kinds of sacrifices that female partners of male surgt9ns are willing to make. It is a societal problem; it has nothing to do. with the legislation which is before us. It is inherent in the delivery of medical services to many people. The Opposition is looking after its own. in regard to the private health insurance area. To date nobody has mentioned that the cost of private health insurance, which was 4 per cent of average weekly earnings in 1983, has fallen to a little over one per cent of average weekly earnings under this Government. Private health insurance has enjoyed an expansion and has had to become more profitable. This Bill addresses the reality of an ageing Australia. Of the 15 Â·per cent of totally insured people in private insurance the elderly claim33 per cent of the money. The national pool and th- national rein!lurance pool addresses this problem. That is why age pensioners, the Council for the Ageing and other aged groups in our community acknowledge that this Bill is a reasonable way to go. This Bill addresses the very real problems of care for the aged in our community. It is not about private insurance companies making Â· money out of the aged and chronically ill; it is about the delivery of care which we, as a Â·community, must accept and acknowledge. This Bill also addresses a newÂ· pathology serviCes table. I am delighted to see that at long last we have a table which is acceptable to pathologists, individuals and the Government, because many peopleÂ· are paying in excess of $100 more than the scheduled fee for pathology services. I remind members of Â· the Opposition who are touting the cause of their own f.fiends and their own friends' pathologists that many of our pathologists write their own pay cheque. There are very few people in the community who are entitled or able to do that. . We have heard no mention here today of the new program for day surgery-a program which will revolutionise medical treatment in this country. Why not? Because it will address very many of the issues which doctors have had control of for too long in our country. What it means for patients is that they will be cared for at times most convenient to themselves. It will reduce public waiting lists, and it will reduce the cost of operations which can and should be done, and are being done overseas, in day surgery. Why, we ask ourselves, are Australians hospitalised more than any other people in the western world? Well we may ask, and well we may ask it of our medical profession. Such hospitalisation is not essential or necessary and is certainly not in the patient's best interest. This Bill introduces day surgery which will ensure that people are treated in the best possible way. Of course, it will lead to a reduction in public hospital waiting lists. Included in tl)is Bill is the Nursing Homes Assistance Act. As the former member for Burke has said, there are moments when we all look to our own backyard. I have two homes in my own electorate. which come under this Nursing Homes Assistance Act. They are the W. R. Black hoine, which cares for very severely disabled and handicapped children, and the Montrose home, which is run by the Royal Queensland Society for Crippled Children. At Montrose they have taken up the spirit of the Disability Services Act and deinstitutionalised 50 to 60 of their residents, and are in the throes of turning the current 90-bed dormitories into independent living style programs. For that home, the sunset clause will mean changes to the lifestyle of their residents. That home has taken up the Disability Services Act and ensured that its residents are treated as individuals, and that the days of huge institutions for very many of our people who are most disadvantaged in the community are over; and this is as it should be. I also remind the Opposition that in 198182 it spent a mere. $80mon services for the disabled. In 1987-88 the Hawke Government spent $125m equivalent. That acknowledges the care which we have for the disabled by ensuring that disabled people can move from institutions which are 30 to 50 years old and live meaningful, useful lives over which they have control. Are we suggesting that those people who happen to have some disadvimtages in our community are not entitled to take the kind of control over their lives that members of the Opposition and I have? I sincerely hope Opposition members are not, because we do not want a return to the Dark Ages, to workhouses, or the kind of massive institutions which the Opposition is suggesting here. This Nursing Homes Assistance Act acknowledges that and acknowledges the kind of direction in which we are moving in terms of care for the most disabled and disadvantaged in our community. I can only commend our Government, and I am proud to be part of it. This Bill also deals with supported accommodation. Once again, we must look at the history of the Opposition. In 1981-82 it spent a mere $6m a year on such accommodation. Opposition members are the people who are now crying about homeless children; they are the people who have all the rhetoric about families and housing. Since 1983 the Hawke Government has spent, on average, $32m a year on supported accommodation, and in 1987-88 $50m will have been spent on it. We have still not acknowledged the work which is done in the Burdekin report. In my electorate, to our shame, and to the shame of many of the people there, we have a number of homeless children, and already the supported accommodation program which we instituted in 1983 has been able to address that. We have a number of homes in our area which house hundreds of children each night. We also have a program which acknowledges that there are people in need. It is about time that the Queensland Government and other governments acknowledged that many of the children on the streets are children who should be in their care-and who are legally in their care-for whom they are providing no homes at all. This supported accommodation program acknowledges that this accommodation should never be a substitute for the kind of care and legal custody which our State governments are supposed to provide. Brian Burdekin acknowledged in his report that State governments had failed to look after very many the children who were put in their care. It is with great pleasure that I acknowledge the work which will be done by Bills, not only the Community Services and Jiealth Legislation Amendment Bill but also the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill. These Bills go to the heart of what Government is about-caring for those people who have needs, and caring for everycerns body in the, Australian community, not those who have.",123
182,Mr MCARTHUR ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Corangamite) (8.48)We have heard a spirited support for the Medicare program from the member for Forde (Ms Crawford) in which she failed address most of the issues. She failed to address the queues of patients who are ble to get into hospitals. In Victoria there are 30,000 people who cannot get a hospital bed. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr is Blewett), is hoping the Medicare issue will go on to the back-burner in the coming eleclong-held tion campaign. Let him be assured that the Opposition will bring it up front, and we will put a proposition to the Australian people that will overcome most of the problems that his control. the Medicare socialised medicine has brought to Australia. In Victoria, the hospitals in my electorate of Corangamite at Colac, Camperdown, pathologists. Beeac, Lorne, Apollo Bay, Winchelsea, GeeAustralia long and Birregurra cannot operate as they used to because of the operation of Medilarge care. They are being starved of funds; they are being starved of capital money; and they are facing a very bleak' future-the suggesskilled tion of amalgamations and formation of nursing homes to overcome the difficulties that Medicare has imposed upon them. I would like to refer to three issues. This debate is curtailed, and it reflects upon Government that on this major issue, with considerable amount of legislation before the been reached. House, we are allowed only two hours to address such very important matters. The matter of general practitioner registration one that my colleagues the honourable memcially ber for Lowe (Dr Woods) and the honourLikewise, able member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who are medical practitioners and who unfits derstand the arguments, think should be of jected. We see a very simple proposition which would be well supported by the Minister at the table: that a closed shop arrangethese ment would be created by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. Hard working doctors would be disadvantaged, as would those students who are now this preparing for a medical career and who, I understand, have demonstrated their conquite clearly on the campuses around only Australia, and those female doctors who would like to go into medicine after six years of training at university and another two years of training at residencies and who would then be likely to move into general practice. The proposition that the Governto ment is now putting forward involves another five years of some sort of trainingunawhich is a bit unclear from reading the literature-before doctors can receive their final ticket of accreditation from the centralised government. One of our main concerns that it will be a centralised Canberra accreditation, and thereby, of course, fulfil the ambition of the Minister for Health and Community Services, who is at the table, to have the Australiari Medicare and medical arrangements fully nationalised and under I now turn to the matter of pathology. The honourable member for Forde made an impassioned speech about the profitability of All honourable members around received deputations from those hard working pathologists who had invested sums of capital in their equipment, which constituted some 60 per cent of overhead costs: It is modern equipment and needs operators to service the patient base. The Government, in its desire to cut costs, cut the last 25 per cent margin, which made a crucial difference to those pathologists who were trying to service the public. After some the discussion, the Government has seen some a reason, and a reasonable arrangement has However, the philosophy of the ,Government is quite clear. It wishes to cut down on is those providers of medical technology, espeif they have a high capital component. all honourable members have been approached about the pharmaceutical beneprogram, Again, the attitude of the Govreernment is quite clear. It has cut down on the margins on the drugs and is trying to down on the fees of those well qualified chemists who dispense drugs in a very sensiencouraged ble and caring manner to members of the propaganda. public. That is another product of the Medicare arrangements around Australia. The major thrust of this legislation is the argument relating to private health insurquestion ance. Here we come to the nub of the Medicare debate, and the Minister and the second time. Government are again taking a bandaid approach to the problems of Medicare. They want to maintain the private health funds up to the next election. They know they are in some difficulty, because Medicare ated in an environment in which the people of Australia thought it was for free. Looking at the previous arrangements, we find that prior to 1975 some 75 per cent of Austrabe lians were covered by health insurance, that the remaining 25 per cent were covered der the pensioner category, and that those disadvantaged persons were able to get free treatment in hospitals if they were without sufficient funds. By 1983, 64 per cent of the followed. population was covered by private insurance and, in this so-called free Medicare environment, the percentage of the population in followsthe private health insurance category had fallen to 46 per cent. The Minister at the table and the Government are keen to promote the idea that Medicare is free and they have put forward the myth that the Medicare levy, which generates $2.2 billion, covers the tot!!.l .cost of medical and hospital costs in Australia. However, we all know that the total cost is about $5.6 billion. It is a total furphy to say new clause: that Medicare is free and that the Medicare levy in fact covers the costs. As to the 46 per cent of the population who are covered, we find that Medibank Private, under the present Government and with certain advantages, has taken up a quarter of the people in the insured bracket. The closed funds have 8 per cent and the newer profit oriented funds have 2 per cent. It is the two funds in the latter category who have been most vocal about this legislation. The basic problem will not be solved under the Medicare regime. Everyone is aware of the difficulties that are facing the insurance industry at present, with the ageing population and with high usage by insured patients over the cut age of 65. Also, the older funds have an ageing profile, and no younger people are to join because of the Medicare",125

WhenÂ· the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack), spoke to the Bill he posed two questions in particular to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett). They are two simple questions which the Minister ought to answer. The first is: If the Government is so concerned about the aged, as he has expressed, and believes that the reinsurance pool contains the answer, why has it not put more into that than this very small amount of $20m? Secondly, why does the legislation remove any responsibility to the pool on the part of the Government beyond the end of this financial year? I conclude my remarks there in order to give the Minister a chance to reply.",127

I have listened all night to a complaint that there has not been sufficient time to debate this issue. I point out that the sole reason why this House is working under a guillotine is that honourable members opposite and the Australian Democrats in the upper House demanded a series <;>f Bills by tonight in order that they should be debated in this Parliament. I think it is about time that members of the Opposition, who joined with the Democrats in that insistence, looked at their own actions in these matters-because that is the reason why all of us have not been able to debate these matters as fully as possible. In answer to the particular questions which were addressed to me-and I am perfectly happy to answer them-it is the Government's view that private insurance is a responsibility which is not directly the Government's; that is, the private hospitals and the private insurance system must work together. We want to see them work in a fair way,and that is why these proposals are designed to have the burden of the elderly shared right across all funds. That is the Government's position. Notwithstanding whatever honourable members opposite say, we believe that this is an improvement on the present system, and those opposite are trying to stop an improvement being carried through. That is the answer to both those questions. We believe that private insurance is very much an individual responsibility, but we want to see it fairly organised between the private funds so that the responsibilities for private insurance are spread fairly-as they are at the moment.

190,Mr LLOYD ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Murray) (9.02)-Drought bonds were introduced by the coalition Government in the 1960s to encourage farmers to ensure or provide self-help by cash deposits as well as hay and water reserves against drought. In 1976 the coalition Government broadened the scheme to cover all the factors which can significantly alter farmers' incomes and the drought bond holders were able to transfer into the new income equalisation deposit (lED) scheme. The scheme paid a low interest on the total deposit and remained until 1983 when the Labor Government removed the tax link from the scheme because it was alleged that the incentive was too generous. However, this effectively ruined the scheme and few deposits have been made since then. The Labor Government has been under pressure to restore a worthwhile scheme to encourage self-help, reduce natural disaster relief and rural adjustment assistance payments and allow farmers to compensate for the greater tax they still pay because of their taxable income variability even with income averaging. The scheme has similarities with the previous scheme, but it is tax linked and thus needs amendments to several Acts. These include the Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Amendments to the Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1984 are necessary to establish how deposits, withdrawals and interest are to be handled and amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are necessary to provide tax deductability on deposits and for the taxing of withdrawals. The scheme will work in the following way: Farmers will make a minimum deposit of $5,000 in a year of high income and withdraw a minimum of $5,000 in years of low or no income because the greatest savings are to be made when deposits are paid in during a year when the farmer is in the highest tax bracket and withdrawn when his taxable income is in the lowest bracket. Deposits and withdrawals can be made in multiples of $1,000 after the $5,000 minimum. The money, which must not exceed the net farm income for the year, will be paid to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy together with a $20 handling fee. A farmer cannot have any more than $250,000 in the scheme at anyone time and it is claimed that this represents average farm costs for three years. Deposits must be held for a minimum of 12 months before withdrawal except in hardship cases. There are two elements to an income equalisation deposit. Interest will not be paid on the part of the deposit which is considered to be deferred tax. It will, however, be paid at the short term Commonwealth bond rate, presently about 14.5 per cent, on the investment portion of the deposit. The tax deferred component will be considered to be 39 per cent of the total deposit, the second highest tax rate, as that is claimed to be the average tax rate of farmersÂ· when investing in the old scheme. This means that depositors will be paid interest on 61 per cent of their money. Interest will be paid by cheque to the depositor annually and it will be taxable. When a farmer withdraws his money there will be a 29 per cent withholding tax which will be adjusted either up or down when the farmer files a tax return. The 29 per cent is the second lowest tax bracket and, once again, it is claimed by the Government to have beert the average rate of tax paid by farmers withdrawing under the previous scheme. The Opposition welcomes the reintroduction of a more realistic income equalisation deposit scheme and will be supporting the legislation, but we do have an amendment which we believe will clarify some lapses or gaps in the legislation. In practical terms we are very critical that in 1983 this Government terminated a worthwhile scheme. It is obvious that it was terminated because hardly any money has. been invested since. We are also critical that the scheme was not put into place for this financial year. In' the May statement of 1988, 12 months ago, the Government announced that the tax link scheme would beÂ· reintroduced. There was adequate time for legislation to be put in place so that there would have been IEDs for this financial year. That would have been very valuable. This scheme, which will start on 1 July next year, is considerably reduced in value because that very important year has been lost, particularly for wool growers. As we know, two seasons ago the price of wool increased considerably although in real purchasing terms to wool growers it is probably no higher than it was eight or nine years ago. It is now falling and, therefore, the ability of wool growers to invest in IEDs has been reduced. Because this scheme has not been in place this year there has been a dramatic tax advantage for the Government because of provisional tax particularly on wool growers in their current year's tax. Because this Government deferred the scheme for 12 months it has probably been worth anything up to $1 billion in Budget surplus at the expense of the farmers of this country. There is a very practical problem and it is a very important problem confronting this legislation; that is, that when the scheme is administered I believe it will appeal only to the higher taxable income farmer because there is a 39 per cent notional rate. When there was some discussion about a single rate tax quite recently we were repeatedly reminded that the average farm tax rate is well under 30Â¢. A couple of years ago it was considered to be well under 25Â¢. In other words, even in a good year the average farmer will not have any great incentive to invest in this scheme. I believe that the Government needs to have a second look at what it is proposing and perhaps have a second threshold or lower level of notional tax set somewhere around average weekly earnings which would be somewhat similar to the average tax rate for farmers generally. It could be accompanied by penalties for those farmers who should really not have been in at that rate in the same way that any calculations for provisional tax are more than 10 per cent out.. I believe that it is necessary to have something other than just this 39 per cent notional tax rate on deferred tax if it is to have any appeal to the average farmer. One purpose of our amendment is to clarify the situation concerning part of this legislation. I ask whoever is replying for the Government to inform me whether my interpretation of the tax and provisional tax procedures areÂ· correct. I say that quite sincerely because there is considerable confusion and we have received contradictory advice from the Department. If farmers are to be encouraged to participate, they will certainly need to have a clear understanding. I want confirmation of the following: When a farmer makes a deposit, his taxable income for that year is reduced by the amount of the deposit. However, provisional tax for the following year is still calculated on the total amount, that is, the taxable income before the deposit reduced it for the current year. When the deposit is withdrawn, the deposit is added to the farmer's taxable income for that year, but it is not calculated for provisional tax for the following year as it is treated as irregular income. In other words, there is provisional tax on the way in, as though the deposit had not been made, but there is no provisional tax on the way out because it is treated as irregular income and it would be unfair to treat the same deposit twice for provisional tax purposes. I also want confirmation whether share farmers, such as dairy or grain share farmers, are included in the scheme. The amendments that are being circulated in my name give definitions of the investment component and the notional tax rate. The amendments also ask that the notional tax rate be calculated each year and be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and in both Houses of the Parliament. It is not the Opposition's intention to alter in any way the Government's intent with the legislation as set out in the second reading speech by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin). Rather, it is our intention to help the Government to clarify its intent in the Bill. The Opposition believes that the notional tax rate should be notified each year. This will allow primary producers to know what part of their deposit will bear interest and what amount will be regarded as deferred tax. I hope that the Government intended to do these things, but placing it in the legislation makes the Government's intent clear to people reading the Bill, without having to search regulations, if it was the Government's intention to include it at that time. I will move my amendments during the committee stage. As we have only very limited time, I just want to say that I am very disappointed that the Government has not been able to be more cooperative with the Opposition by introducing the Bill earlier than just two days ago, when it expected the cooperation of the Opposition in the passage of the legislation at such short notice so that it can be finally put in place for next year. As we have cooperated, I believe the Government could have been more helpful inÂ· that regard. In conclusion,Â· our amendments are genuine to try to assist the Government with some more of its shoddy legislation and to assist people by clarifying the intent of the legislation. The Opposition supports the legislation but believes, first of all, that the scheme should never have been terminated for practical purposes in 1983 and, secondly, that the scheme should have been introduced in time for this current financial year.",128
191,Mr BRUMBY ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Bendigo) (9.13)-I rise to support the Income Equalization Deposits Laws Amendment Bill. It is an important Bill because it introduces a new form of income equalisationÂ· deposits (IEDs) for primary producers. In doing that, the Government is giving effect to its commitment of 12 months ago when it said that it would have in place by 1 July this year a new income equalisation deposits scheme to assist primary producers. So we have met our committment and from 1 July this year, subject to the passage of this legislation, which I understand will proceed through this House and the Senate, there will be a new income equalisation deposits scheme in Australia which will benefit many thousands, indeed tens of thousands, of primary producers around Australia. Before I get into the details of the legislation, I want to say that over the years a great. deal of work by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin) and other.backbenchers on this side of House has gone into devising this new scheme of income equalisation deposits. I particularly want to compliment the work done by the honourable member for Calare ( Mr Simmons), now the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the honourable member for Burke ( Mr O'Keefe) and the honourable member for MCEwen ( Mr Cleeland). I have also been one who over the years has spoken strongly in favour of a new income equalisation deposits scheme. Were you not in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would have also included the honourable member for Ballarat as having played a significant role in reintroducing this scneme. I want to take up a point that was made by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd). In a press release which he issued today, headed 'IEDs Long Overdue', he claimed that the Government has saved hundreds of millions of dollars in tax by delaying the reintroduction of this scheme. I simply make the point that the Opposition's official policy on taxation and particularly tax cuts, as the policy stands at the moment and as expressed by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), is that, if it were in government, it would claw back the tax cuts which we propose to make payable to ordinary Australians from 1 July this year. There is something of a serious inconsistency-a bias if you like-in Opposition policy. Members of the Opposition are saying that they would like to have seen IEDs extended to farmers 12 months ago. Yet they say that ordinary taxpayers should not have got tax cuts 12 months ago nor should they be getting them from 1 July under this Government's package of tax cuts. So they are saying that it would have been all right for farmers to have got tax cuts in the form of IEDs 12 months ago, but that for the ordinary workers in regional and provincial cities, the ordinary employees around Australia, the tax cuts we have promised from 1 July this year should be withdrawn, clawed back. The Opposition policy is totally inconsistent. If it wants to be consistent in its tax policy; what it would have to say is that, in the spirit of attempting to get a higher Budget surplus in Australia, it would claw back not only the tax cuts we have promised to ordinary Australians from 1 July this year but also this lED scheme which we are introducing from 1 July. But the Opposition is not consistent and, of course, it never was consistent in government. As I have said, I support this legislation. It will take effect from 1 July this year, on exactly the same date as the tax cuts payable to other Australians will take effect. There are great benefits to primary producers from this new scheme of IED!; that we are introducing. It is patently true that primary producersdo have erratic incomes over the years. Their incomes vary according to the level of farm costs, but their incomes also vary par3016 REPRESENTATIVES 25 May 1989 ticularly in relation to international commodity prices. In recent years we have seen enormous fluctuations in the level of those commodity prices. In response, we see that primary producers' incomes can fluctuate from a loss making situation in one year to a very profitable situation in the next year. The benefit of an income equalisation deposit scheme is that in good years farmers can put away some of their profit-in effect as a tax deduction-and withdraw it in later years if their income is low. In that respect, the scheme provides a form of income stability for primary producers. Of course, from the Government's point of view, there are also compelling arguments in favour of an income equalisation deposits scheme. The main one is that it removes to a large degree that element of income instability from primary producers. In so doing, it allows primary producers to manage better their income from year to year. In years of low income because of bad commodity prices, it will enable primary producers to draw on those deposits and so reduce their dependency on the welfare system. In the last few years in the Mallee area of Victoria, low international prices for wheat have caused enormous hardship and there has been a significant cost to government in welfare payments for the support of wheat farmers in those areas when their incomes have been very low. In turn, those of us who understand the way our rural economies function appreciate only too well that if there is a significant downturn in primary producers' incomes, it tends to flow on through some of the provincial towns and cities, and jobs can be lost in those centres when the incomes of primary producers decrease. What this scheme is all about is providing additional stability to the income of primary producers, and in that sense I strongly support it. I want to answer very quickly some of the claims made by the Deputy Leader of the National Party. He made a number of comments particularly in relation to deposits and the interest on them. The proposal in the legislation is .that interest will not be paid on the fulL amount of a deposit. It is not appropriate to pay interest on that part of the deposit which would otherwise be paid in tax, as this part represents deferred tax payable when the deposit is later withdrawn. Income Equalization Deposits Bill Interest will therefore be paid on the investment component of the deposit, which is the deposit less the amount that would otherwise be paid in tax. As it is not possible to know each depositor's individual tax rate in the year of deposit, the investment component for all deposits will be determined having regard to a tax rate which will broadly represent the marginal tax rate of depositors. From 1 July when we introduce this scheme, that will be 39 per cent. The formula is set out in the legislation. By way of example, it means that the investment component forÂ· a deposit of $5,000 made on 1 July will be $3,050. The rate of interest which is payable on the investment component will be the short term Commonwealth bond rate. Deposits will start to earn interest from the date the deposit is accepted by the Department ofÂ·Primary Industries and Energy. Let me make a few comments about that proposal. The proposed investment component approach is designed to be fair as well as administratively simple. This approach, contrary to what the Deputy Leader of the National Party said, has a precedent in the tax arrangements for life office businesses. It allows an investment component to be determined for interest purposes in the year of the deposit when an individual's tax rate will not be known. It can be said that this approach involves an element of rough justice at the margin. But the extent of this will be relatively minor. The effect on depositors at different marginal tax rates can be illustrated by an example, which I will provide, where a deposit of $10,000 is made, and we are assuming an interest rate of 14! per cent. The investment component approach would result in an annual interest payment of $884, compared with a payment of $768 if the depositor's marginal tax rate was 47 per cent, or $1,029 if it was 29 per cent. The difference at the margin therefore represents approximately a one percentage point difference in interest on a $10,000 deposit. I want to reiterate that point because the Deputy Leader of the National Party certainly gave the impression that the choice of a 39 per cent rate was a savage impost on primary producers. That is not true. I repeat the example I just gave. Under the scheme proposed, the interest payment would be $884. If the depositor's marginal tax rate was 47 per cent it would be $768. If it was 29 per cent it would be $1,029. The difference therefore in effect represents a one per cent difference in interest rates. Let me say also that the adjustment to determine the investment component of 39 per cent from 1 July is based on the tax rate which is applied to the life insurance business of life offices and it represents assumed tax rate of policy holders. The Govrealise ernment expects that depositors in income equalisation deposits would have a similar income profile. If one analyses tax related IEDs which were made before 1983, one will see that the large bulk of deposits were made by depositors in the second highest tax bracket. That is the nuts and bolts of the scheme. As I have said, many members on the Govtreated ernment side over the years have contributed to the development of this new income That equalisation deposit scheme. I believe it appropriate that it is being introduced on July this year, at the same time as tax cuts for other Australians will be implemented. We have all had to make sacrifices over recent years in the light of the terms of trade way. downturn in 1986-87. The Government has had a budget for surpluses. We are returning surpluses on the public sector borrowing quirement. We are returning a fiscal surplus of more that $5 billion, so times have not been easy. We have done the right job and I am pleased to see that these IEDs will introduced from 1 July.",130
192,Mr HAWKER ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Wannon) (9.26)-Nearly to six years ago the Government scrapped income equalisation deposit (lED) scheme. At that time the Government was warned that the scrapping of the scheme would be a sad loss to the farming community. Nearly five years ago it was my duty on behalf the Opposition to move an amendment which in essence was exactly what the Government has introduced today in this legislation. amendment included a tax link, it included interest on an investment component of an income equalisation deposit scheme, and short it was in essence, as I have said, exactly what it has taken the Government nearly years to realise that it should have been introducing earlier. I was interested to listen to the eloquent arguments of the honourable member for Bendigo ( Mr Brumby), which were so similar to the arguments I put forward nearly six years ago on this point. But he then told us that this scheme is something new. The rate debates are recorded in Hansard. The honourable member might care to read them. It should not be forgotten that this scheme was announced in the May 1988 mini-Budget. the It has taken the Government four years to what a terrible mistake it made when it took away the old income equalisation deposit scheme. As I pointed out then, and as the honourable member for Bendigo so eloquently argued tonight, it was not a question of giving farmers a tax break; it was a question of giving them the opportunity to put something aside for the bad times, but to do it on the basis that they would be in a similar - way to other taxpayers and not placed in some favoured position. is why I find it very difficult to underis stand the honourable member for Bendigo I when he tries to compare tax cuts for Australians on 1 July with the reintroduction of the income equalisation deposit scheme. I really do not think the two equate in any Furthermore, I think the honourable member for Bendigo missed the other imporretant point about the income equalisation deposit scheme, a principle that should be extended into many other areas: It is a positive step to encourage savings. If ever Ausbe tralians needed some encouragement for savings, it surely must be now. One only has look at the problems facing our economy the now to see how many of them stem from the fact that this country does not have an adequate savings policy. It does not offer proper incentives for people to save. In fact, in many cases it gives them a positive incenof tive to do the exact opposite. As the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd) pointed out, it really is extraorThat dinary that it has taken the Government over 12 months to introduce the legislation reintroducing the old income equalisation dein posit scheme in a new form. The honourable member for Murray put a very valid argusix ment to the Government in asking why it was delayed so long. I think it pertinent to show what has happened to the income equalisation deposit scheme, to look at the old scheme before 1983-84 and to see what happened when the Government changed. While I commend the honourable member for Bendigo for his eloquent case tonight for the reintroduction of the old scheme in another form, it would be well to recall what he had to say when the old scheme was scrapped and the Government brought in some glorified savings account system which it still called an income equalisation deposit scheme although it was no longer tax linked and was a disastrous failure. It no longer attracted any funds because, as the Government was warned then by me and others, the scheme that was introduced then offered no incentive to farmers to use it and to save, and the figures I will table shortly will show that it certainly did not work.

The Government brought in the changes in 1984. There was a fairly rapid rundown and by 1988-89 it was down to $34,800,000, which was about a fifth of what it was in 1982-83, only six years earlier. But more significant is the amount of money which was lodged. In 1980-81, before the drought nearly $72m was lodged. In 198586, after the scheme. had been scrapped by the Government and its glorified saving account brought in, the figure was only $847,000. That is in stark comparison with the figures for earlier years, going from $71m to $847,000. The following year it was just on half that amount at $443,000. It had a very significant impact. It is pertinent to note some of the comments that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy made in his second reading speech. I hope that his colleague the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) will take note when he tries to draw someÂ· of his phoney comparisons with past years and past performances of our economy. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy pointed out in his second reading speech: The implications of unstable rural incomes clearly are not restricted to the agricultural sector but flow throughout our economy, influencing the level and nature of economic activityThis is the key pointHonourable members will recall the depressing effect upon the economy of the drought of 1982-83Hear! Hear! when the net value of rural production fell by 80 per cent. It is something that both the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer ought to be reminded of regularly when they come into this House and draw inane comparisons with the performance of the previous government in its last years and some of their own Government's performances. The Minister went on to make some pertinent comments when he referred to the number of reports which have been presented on this subject-for example, the 1974 Green Paper, the Industries Assistance Commission report in 1975, the 1978 report, and Professor Lloyd's report in' 1986. All of these reports have said again and again that a tax linked income equalisation deposits scheme had a lot of merit. I wonder why it has taken the Government that long to realise what a stupid mistake it made when it scrapped the whole scheme in 1984. It ought to be made quite clear to anyone who is under any misunderstanding that the income equalisation deposits scheme is not some form of tax cut, as was almost implied by the honourable member for Bendigo. It is in fact a means of allowing primary producers, notWithstanding the averaging provisions, to be treated on a similar basis to other taxpayers. I will give a very simple example. Someone on a steady income of, say, $20,000 a year would be liable under the 1987-88 tax scales for in the order of $4,251 a year. In other words, over two years he would pay about $8,500 in tax. Let us compare him with someone who is on a fluctuating income, which is not an unreasonable comparison. A person who was cropping and who earned $40,000 in a good year and the following year experienced a drought, crop failure, fire or whatever, would pay in the first year $12,951 on his $40,000 income. In other words, over the two-year period he would be paying over $4,000 more than a person who had earned the same amount of money on a steady income. The point is that there is no suggestion here that there ought to be any consideration of a tax break. I take up a point that the honourable member for Murray made. I hope that the warning will go out to all those who may consider using these new income equalisation deposits-that provisional tax will still be levied on the basis of the income, despite the fact that the deposit was made. That is my understanding of it. I hope that the Minister will clarify that point if I have misunderstood it. That may well prove to be a bit of a disincentive to people who want to use it. Nonetheless, I welcome the Government's belated realisation-it seems to have taken many years to come around to this-that it is important that farmers have this opportunity and that they be given the chance to put aside for the bad years. Not only will it help them; it will also help the nation because it will avoid a lot of the cases of hardship that we have seen over so many years. While it is certainly restricted to primary producers, there is a quite valid case for extending this form of deferred savings to other people in the community who do notÂ· have regular incomes. I am thinking in particular of sports men and women who have high incomes for a relatively short period of time and subsequently lower ones. A tax related incentive for them to put aside would have a lot of merit.",133
194,Mr COURTICE ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Hinkler) (9.38)-There have been many Bills before this House that I have had the pleasure of speaking in favour of, but the Income Equalization Deposits Laws Amendment Bill 1989 is one of the highlights of this year. It is one of the best Bills that I have had the privilege of speaking on in the House. I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin) and the country task force of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) on putting together this Bill in the manner in which it has been done. 'I believe that the Prime Minister's country task force is the eyes and ears Of the Prime Minister in the bush. Mr Brumby-You're a key member of it.",135
195,Mr COURTICE,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"I acknowledge the comments by the honourable member for Bendigo. It is relevant at this the Queensland Country Life of 27 April, which says 'NFF Slams Coalition Rural Policy'. Clearly, once again it is the Federal Labor Government that is leading the way in agriculture and leading the way in selfhelp mechanisms for rural people in this nation. This Bill does just that. This Bill is an improvement on the previous one. While the honourable member for Bendigo covered most of the aspects of the Minister's second reading speech, I would like to comment briefly on it in the short time that is available. In the May 1988 economic statement the Government announced that it would introduce a tax linked income equalisation deposit (lED) scheme for primary producers from 1 July 1989. It wasÂ· announced that the new scheme would be designed to overcome the drawbacks associated with the tax linked scheme which operated untilÂ· 1983. In the new scheme deposits will be tax deductable in the year of deposit and assessable for income tax purposes in the year of withdrawal. However, a number of changes will be introduced to ensure that unwarranted benefits are not available. Interest will be paid only on the investment component, not on the whole deposit. The investment component reflects the value of the deposit when reduced by the notional tax that would have applied in the year in which it was deposited. This will ensure that interest is not paid on that part of the deposit which would otherwise have been paid in tax. The adjustment rate will reflect the typical marginal tax rate of deposits. As the honourable member for Bendigo pointed out, this rate will be set initially at 39 per cent, to apply from 1 July 1989. Consequently, the value of deposits will be reduced by 39 per cent to determine the investment component which will earn interest. Interest will be paid at the short term Commonwealth bond rate. Another aspect of the scheme is that a minimum term of one year will apply to depositors. Deposits in any year will be limited to net tax income from primary production in that year. An upper limit of $250 000 will apply to the amount of tax deductable deposits that can be accumulated. For example, $250,000 is roughly equivalent to total farm costs for three years for an average time to look at Australian farm. The scheme will be administered by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Deposits must be made by 30 June of the financial year. A minimum sum of $5,000 will apply to deposits and withdrawals. Deposits must be accompanied by a fee of $20, which will cover the administrative costs. In the light of the introduction of the new lED scheme, the Government has developed arrangements to phase out both the present scheme and the remaining deposits in the pre-1983 tax-linked scheme. The Government believes, as I do, that the new lED scheme will make a significant contribution towards assisting farmers to stabilise their incomes. Basically, the lED scheme is a self-help mechanism. It is much more sensible and commercial than subsidies. I do not believe that subsidies create efficiency; in fact, they create inefficiency. The scheme gives farmers a better way of handling their assets and making commercial decisions. For example, farmers in my electorate of Hinkler have greatly fluctuating incomes for many different reasons. We have the great contrasts in climate-droughts and floods, both of which my electorate has experienced in the last 12 months. We also have fluctuations in commodity prices. One of the best examples of that is the horticultural industry. It is no secret-and last night I was very proud to state it in this House-that Bundaberg is now the leading area for tomato production in Australia. Tomato producers have fluctuating incomes relative to the prices they receive for their product. In one year a tomato producer may well make in excess of $1m. In the following year he may well lose half a million dollars. This again comes from surplus of commodities, or from drought. For this reason the new scheme gives those farmers an opportunity to put aside money so that they can maintain their viability when the prices drop. Everyone in the House would join with me in being thankful that this year has been one of the best for rainfall in some time. As a result, we will see an increase in the volume of commodities and, as our commodity prices are good this year and will probably strengthen-the price for sugar, in particular, will go up-farmers will have some surplus. For that reason, this is the best way in which they can safeguard the future and stabilise their incomes. As someone who has a farm, I fully recognise and understand what it is like to have greatly fluctuating prices, particularly as we are at the mercy of other countries and their corruption of world markets. On that, I recognise once again the great breakthroughs that were made this week, thanks to the Minister for Trade Negotiations ( Mr Duffy), in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Previously I have complimented the Prime Minister's country task force, and I would like to mention in particular the work done by the honourable member for Calare ( Mr Simmons), who was the previous Chairman; the inaugural Chairman, the honourable member for MCMillan ( Mr Cunningham); and the incoming Chairman, the honourable member for Rankin ( Mr Beddall). I had. the pleasure of sitting in on negotiations with the National Farmers Federation President John Allwright and Director Rick Farley when discussing the IEDs. I am very pleased to be speaking on the matter tonight. I am pleased to see that we have support on both sides of the House for the Bill, because it will be recognised in the future as far-seeing, as much better than the old legislation, and as a mechanism whereby farmers can better handle their incomes, in a commercial way, without the past silly decisions on subsidies, high tariffs and protection. In other words, the legislation gives farmers an opportunity to get out there and show that they are and can be as good at commerce, industry and business as bankers or anybody else. This Bill goes a long way to doing that, and I certainly commend it to the House. In closing, I compliment once again the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for the work he has done. Today, his popularity in the bush is going up at a time when, sadly, we are seeing the National Party being forced to go towards coalition with the Liberals. The Bill is far-reaching, very positive and a great asset to primary production. EmptyHere support the broad thrust of the Income Equalization Deposit Laws Amendment Bill, the amendments proposed by my colleague the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd) are important if this new scheme is to benefit fully the rural community and, accordingly; they have my total support. The legislation follows a promise made by the Government in the 1988 May economic statement to restore the existing income equalisation deposits (lED) scheme to a semblance or what it was like before the Government gutted the scheme back in 1983. It is well known that the coalition has always supported the concept of a strong income equalisation deposit scheme to enable primary producers to overcome the problems caused by fluctuating incomes, which are a commonplace occurrence for many farmers and other primary producers, such as fishermen. Our primary producers are dependent on many factors, especially the state of world markets, export prices, climate and interest rates. In recognition of this, the previous coalition Government implemented a taxlinked income equalisation deposit scheme, providing tax deductability on deposits into the scheme and, conversely, tax liability on withdrawals. Interest was earned on the full amount of the deposit. The scheme worked well and it is no surprise that the present Government's decision in 1983 to remove that tax deductability provisions was met with a great deal or opposition. Although the scheme, as amended in 1983, had an interest subsidy component built in, to bring the interest earned on deposits to two perthat centage points above the short term governscheme ment bond rate, the simple fact is that the income equalisation deposit scheme lost appeal. It took five years for the Government realise its mistake and announce that new tax concessions would be included in the scheme. I applaud this decision, but it extremely disappointing that the new arceed rangements, announced in May 1988, have taken 14 months to be introduced. The sigtime nificance of this delay should not be overcosts. looked. Much of the primary industry sector was experiencing relatively good times in last year, when the new arrangements were announced. Wool is an important case in point. Figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Ecoferred nomics show that average auction prices wool have increased steadily over recent years. During 1987-88, when the Governportion ment first announced the new income equalcomponent isation deposit arrangements, the average auction prices of wool was $10.03 per kiloclaimed gram. World markets were not as affected as had been expected by factors such as the 1987 stock market crash. Indeed, world ecoper nomic growth was running at around 4 per this point later. cent, and this strengthened the position of our wool exports significantly. Everyone knew that this boom period would not last for ever. Sure enough, in his address to the Council of Australia earlier this month, chief economist of the Australian Wool poration told it the way it is. In a nutshell, prospects for 1989-90 are not as rosy as for last year. Average prices are expected to fall into a range around per kilogram. Furthermore, the market is expected to be able to absorb the the same. degree as it has recently, leaving an additional surplus of around half a milincluded lion bales in stock. The upshot of all this that many wool producers would have apIn preciated the opportunity to use a tax-limwelcomed ited income equalisation deposit scheme put aside some of their boom time earnings, ready for the inevitable downturn in the wool market. But instead of starting this new scheme on 1 July 1988, the Government chose to delay its introduction by a full year. One does not have to be a cynic to realise the Government chose to delay the new to preserve its taxation revenues. For the benefit of those listening, let me its briefly outline the new scheme. A primary producer making an income equalisation deto posit has his taxable income reduced by the amount of the deposit to a maximum value equal to the producer's net farm income for was the year. Accumulated deposits cannot ex$250,000, although I would hope that this limit would be reviewed upwards from to time to reflect increases in farm The initial deposit or withdrawal each year May must be at least $5,000, although further deposits or withdrawals need not be over $1,000. Interest will not be paid on the part of the investment which is considered detax. It will however, be paid at the for short term Commonwealth bond rate-presently about 14.5 per cent on the investment of the deposit. The tax deferred will be considered to be 39 per cent, the second highest tax rate, as that is t6 be the average tax rate of farmers when investing in the old scheme. This means that depositors will be paid interest on 61 cent of their money. I will come back to When a deposit is withdrawn, the producer will pay tax at the time of withdrawal, unless he can show that no tax is payable. Wool Provisional tax in the year following the the deposit will be based on the total income Corwithout regard to the lED, although the Australian Taxation Office points out that farmers can vary this amount to match their expected income. When the deposit is drawn $9 out it will be regarded as irregular income not and will not be taken into account for the product to base of provisional tax. Finally, the amount of any withdrawal is in the producer's total of assessable is income in the year in which it is withdrawn. essence, the new arrangements will be by primary producers although, as to my colleague the shadow minister, the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd), has said, there are some specific questions that must be resolved. I understand that the National Farmers Federation has some concern about the provisional tax liabilities that would apply to producers involved in the new scheme. However, the Western AustraEqualization lian Farmers Federation has indicated its broad approval for this legislation, notwithhave standing the points I have already raised. One aspect of this Bill which pleases me is that it applies to primary producers as defined under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This definition is not restricted farmers and, thus, fishermen and forestry operators are also eligible to use the scheme. Although the main users of the new scheme will be farmers, I am glad that the tax vantages of the new scheme will be available to all primary producers. Of concern, howlem, ever, is the provision governing the amount of a primaryÂ· producer's deposit which excluded from attracting interest. Under the new scheme, 61 per cent of the deposit attract interest: the remaining 39 per cent deemed to be deferred tax and is calculated on the second highest tax rate, as that claimed to be the average tax rate of farmers low. when investing in the old scheme. Most definitely, this aspect will have to be reviewed constantly to ensure that the averEnergy age tax rate used to calculate interest entitleof ments is altered in accordance with any changes in the average incomes of producers involved in the new scheme. This will ensure that producers do not miss out on any interthe est payments to which they are entitled. When Australia's exports of wool fall as much as $1 billion-as has been forecast this month-the nation's balance ofÂ· paydevice ments will not be the only victim. The intion deposit. comes of many Farmers who would have made use of a tax-linked lED scheme this financial year will be reduced as a result deteriorating prices and contracting world - arkets. Because of the delay in implementIng the new arrangements, they will not in a position to supplement their incomes in 1989-90 with some of the gains made during this financial year. In summary, I support the Bill, with fo-eshadowed amendments, but I am disappOinted th-t the - overnment, having realalso Ised the mistake It made in 1983 when emasculated the income equalisation deposit scheme, did not move more quickly to imtime plement the new tax-linked benefits.",135
196,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Dawson) (9.54)- did I want to associate myself with the Income Deposits Laws Amendment Bill. I agree .with other honourable members who spoken tonight that this is an important Bill as far as the farming sector is concerned and its history goes back to about 1977: Being a practising chartered accountant until I came into this House in 1975, I was often to disturbed when offering taxation advice that there was no factor whereby farmers could relieve the taxation burden in a year of high prices against. the certainty of a.low year one ador two years later. Artificial arrangements were made to overcome the taxation proband that meant that farms were often highly developed, and unprofitably develis oped in economic terms because, in fact, farmers were looking for tax deductions. The will only problem was that, once a farm or a is property was developed, the money could not be taken back and used as a cash reis source in bad seasons or when prices were In this debate we must give credit not only to the Minister for Primary Industries and ( Mr Kerin) for the re-introduction this scheme but also, I understand to the right honourable member for New England ( Mr Sinclair), who in 1977 introduced equalisation, probably without the full backing of farming and agricultural community at that time. Certainly, he introduced that initiative and it was important because, as the by name suggests, an income equalisation deposit (lED) is not meant to be a taxing or an investment-it is an equalisaEven from my brief association with my of practice after I left, I knew enough about the scheme to extol its virtues, but I found as the Minister found when the scheme wabe withdrawn in, I think, 1983 that, to the surprise of many people, only 6 or 7 per cent of primary producers throughout the country had taken advantage of it. I often thought that that was because of the bad advice that the some industry people were giving to their constituent farmers at that time, but it was because of the conflicting advice of init vestment advisers, bankers and some accountants who suggested that the rate at that of interest on an equalisation deposit of about 5 per cent, 6 per .cent or 7 per cent not equate to the higher investment rate that could be gained outside the system in normal investments. Some people deliberately confused the investment aspect with that equalisation factor, and I believe that those people did not serve their constituents and clients as well as they might have done, because they missed the whole point of the exercise-and quite deliberately. No doubt, there were faults in the initial implementation of the Act, but I want to place on record that the Primary Industry Bank of Australia (PIBA) was assisted greatly in the late 1970s by the inflow of money frbm the income equalisation deposits which were at a lower rate of interest and which allowed farmers to regenerateÂ· funds as loans on their property. I am glad that the Minister has reintroduced these deposits and that they will come under his control. I only hope that my experience in the late 1970s will not be repeated in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This is a positive move whereby farm income can be equalised over a range of products, in years when international markets go 'up or come down and certainly when there are fluctuations in the seasons. I might even go so far as to say that the temporary withdrawal of these deposits over the past few years has been a blow to many of the industries which have suffered fluctuating incomes as well as times of great depression. I believe that the Minister would agree with my comments; if he did not, he would not have reintroduced these deposits. I welcome this measure. It is a hedge against the future by equalising incomes. I reiterate that it is not a taxing device. While the average is used, it is not a taxing device as some people thought. I make only one suggestion. I support the amendments that have been circulated by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd), and there is only one further refinement that I believe could be necessary. There is a definition of 'primary producer' for both averaging purposes and in terms of the IEDs, but commercial contractors are . associated with many of those industries. I might even go so far as to say that some small country towns have lived or died according to the strength of the associated primary industries and service industries; those towns have suffered fluctuating incomes. I believe we should consider that matter at some time in the future to allow those benefits. I just wanted to put my comments on the record. I pay a tribute to the right honourable member for New England for having introduced these measures over a decade ago. .",138
197,Mr SINCLAIR ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"New England) (10.00)I would like to make a brief contribution to this debate. Firstly, the Income Equalization Deposits Law Amendment Bill should have been introduced and commenced in this financial year. There is no excuse whatsoever for this Labor Government having delayed its reintroduction. Of course, it was part of a package that it was suggested would provide to farmers an offset against some of those benefits that they were losing.Â·It would have been far better, therefore, had it been available in a period when many, certainly in the pastoral industry, were finding incomes relatively high and they could have taken some advantage of it. Secondly, it would have been better if it had been introduced before the drought assistance to the States had been removed. I am concerned that itÂ· is not just drought, but natural disasters, fire and flood which affect the periodic pattern of rural incomes. I believe that it is a pity that this measure is not available now rather than being told that some future assessmentÂ· of the pattern of drought assistance will enable a new package, which presumably would relate more to the funding of State assistance than the specific ability of individual farmers to offset, through their own savings, the variable pattern of their income. I certainly welcome the reintroduction of this Bill. I thank the honourable member for Dawson ( Mr Braithwaite) for reminding the House that back in 1976 I introduced the initial income equalisation deposits (IEDs) as a successor to the drought bonds, which was the predecessor package that came out of a recommendation by Mr Bruce Wright, the then President of the Australian Wool growers and Graziers Council. The concept in 1976 was part of a young farmers establishment scheme. Our idea had been that money deposited in IEDs would be paid a minimal interest-in fact, at that stage, a long term bond interest; they would be allowed a tax concession; the money would then be reinvested through the Primary Industry Bank of Australia and, in turn, made available to farmers; and would allow long term deposits to be made in the accounts of young people seeking to acquire land. I know that there were fears that a distortion in land prices might flow, but the pattern was one which would have fulfilled our 1975 undertaking to provide a young farmers establishment scheme. Had this lED scheme been allowed to continue, with full tax deduct ability, instead of being removed in 1983, I believe that it would have allowed for an offset against the variation in farm incomes as well as being a vehicle by whichÂ· young people could have reasonable access to long term loans at a reasonable interest rate and hence acquire land. There are several aspects of the legislation in its present form which concern me. While I know that statements have been made about the extent to which provisional tax for the the following year will be payable in the year of deposit, apparently no provisional tax will be payable in the year of withdrawal. I would like the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin) to assure the House in his response that that is so. I know that we have time constraints tonight but I think it is important for the Minister to give an assurance of the incidence of provisional tax. I think there is a problem as far as income equalisation deposits are concerned. There still seems to be some doubt whether a farmer is able to withdraw funds if, for some reason, personal exigencies require him to have access to the money. I believe that that is essential. If something happens-perhaps a death in the family or some other unexpected event-there should be a provision so that the Government if need be, the Minister, or perhaps some other authority such as the Secretary to his Department can give approval to the prior release of the funds. However, the actual tax liability of the family farmer is something that worries us. Some 93 per cent of Australian farms are still owned by families. Many of those families earn less that average weekly earnings. Our concern is that, because of the lack of other schemes affecting drought assistance, this scheme should be available to those lower income family groups. For that reason, as this Bill is under guillotine, I suggest that the amendments that were to be moved by the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd) might be incorporated in Hansard. The amendments, which refer to clauses 4 and 6, have been set out in a document that has been distrIbuted. I ask the Minister whether those amendments might be incorporated in Hansard. If the Minister is prepared to acknowledge that they can be incorporated, it would save me reading them. I want the Minister to have an opportunity to reply to these matters. Our intention in putting forward these amendments is to prevent those in a low income bracket from paying tax at the median tax rate. In other words, those who are in receipt of less than average weekly earnings should not be called on to pay tax at a rate higher than that which their income might otherwise attract. The introduction of this scheme is overdue. It should be available this financial year. I believe that it is a measure which set a pattern back in 1976. Had the scheme continued it would have been utilised to a far greater degree. I am delighted that this scheme has come back with full tax deductability. I trust that the Minister will respond to those few questions, including the amendments which have now been canvassed by me, in the few minutes that are left in this debate.",139

199,Mr KERIN ,SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION,"Werriwa-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (1O.07)-in reply- Mr Deputy Speaker, I was going to answer that matter first. The right honourable member for New England ( Mr Sinclair) raised the matter of the death provision, the unforseen thing. I will look at that matter before the Senate debates this legislation. The figure of 39 per cent is the second highest or lowest tax rate and is also the figure used by the life insurance offices. As the right honourable member for New England said, the genesis of this scheme was the drought bond scheme. The scheme that came into place in 1977 was by the time we came to office being rorted, abused and misused. That was mainly as a result of some smart people using the in-out provisions of tax averaging. The change in the income equalisation deposits (IEDs) scheme in 1983 was to remove the rorts. As the honourable member for Dawson ( Mr Braithwaite) said, only 6 to 7 per cent of farmers used it at anyone time; it was not the same cohort. As. far as we can estimate, anything up to 20 per cent of farmers used it at various times. Average investment was low and a very small proportion of farmers using the scheme were well above the average investment in the scheme. Looking at this in terms of social justice, in many ways it is to keep the better off farmers better off, but in my second reading speech I explained it more in terms of income instability. So it is additional to the tax averaging and it will give a fair amount of equity in terms of taxation liability. The argument that this scheme is here for farmers to put aside money in good times for bad, et cetera, does not really hold, even with the rortable scheme. Certainly no one has ever said that drought assistance was not needed because of the lED scheme. I was quite amazed that there was evidence that in the 1983-84 drought some withdrawals took place,Â· but nowhere near as many as I would have expected. So it was a peculiar scheme to examine in terms of its stated aims. I strongly agree with the honourable member for Dawson, who is in a position to advise people, that the soheme, even with its rortable elements, was poorly sold. People giving advice to farmers should have been able to give sensible advice because the scheme certainly provided a fair degree of assistance. I cannot accept the amendments foreshadowed by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia ( Mr Lloyd). They all centre on the fact that he accepts the mechanism and the rate but he wants the notional tax rate calculated and published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette at a set time rather than relying on a regulation. It is six of one and half a dozen of the other. The problem is that I need to consult the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) on this because the Treasurer has been involved in the drawing up of this legislation. In terms of the interaction with provisional tax and the withdrawal of IEDs, in the year of deposit the provisional tax for the following year is calculated on the prelED full income. When the lED is withdrawn, provisional tax in the following year is calculated on income before the lED is incorporated. So there is tax symmetry in the system for provisional tax. I point out also that farmers, like all taxpayers, have the capacity to apply to the Commissioner of Taxation for modification of provisional tax. This legislation will change nothing in that respect. Tax efficiency demands that income outlays be treated identically. I missed some of the comments made by the Deputy Leader of the National Party. Before this legislation goes to the Senate I will get clarification.",140

Deregulation is still going on at a State level and at the moment a Bill is being debated within the Queensland Parliament on the new package. The suggestion was made in the second reading speech that this is an assistance package. Some might question the degree of assistance that has been given to the sugar industry, and the manner in which the assistance was delivered, particularly from the point of view of negotiation and consultation with the industry in moving towards that deregulated state. As I say, some people would pose the question as to what was the actual assistance in this regard. The package includes the termination of the sugar agreement of 1985, and already we have seen the New South Wales industry move in this direction with the sunset clause on that agreement due to take place on 30 June 1989. The industry is preparing itself, in the coming season, to sell into the domestic market its entire crop of about 200,000 tonnes of sugar. That is already planned. As was indicated by a representative of the industry in Queensland, 5 per cent of the sugar that is grown in New South Wales will supply 25 per cent of the domestic market. I think the Queensland industry accepts that this is the kind of result which deregulation has produced, and it is doing its own style of marketing to ensure that it is not caught . completely offside. :No one can deny that the New South Wales industry has the right, under the new agreement, to go down the path that it is. As I said before, if the industry can get hold of the domestic sugar market, it is the best market to be in. As we understand it, most of that sugar will be industrial sugar, so there will be still be a part to playas far asÂ· the production of refined sugar is concerned. It is also interesting that under this deregulation, because of other aspects of the labour market which will not be deregulated in sympathy with the sugar industry and the removal of the embargo, it will not be possible, because of the high cost of shipping on coastal trade, for Queensland sugar or even New South Wales sugar to be sold into the Northern Territory, West Australian or, as I understand it, Tasmanian markets. Likewise, these are likely to be areas of the domestic market lost to the Australian industry, because, as has been said, it is cheaper to bring raw sugar from Mauritius than it is to take sugar from Queensland to West Australia to process. When we talk about deregulation, the Government should have also looked at and I have been hammering this for the last four or five years-a complete deregulation. It is interesting to note that while the wheat industry and the sugar industry are being called upon to face the world in a most competitive and corrupt world market, we have the most regulated labour system of any country in the world. It is centralised. Its increases are based not on productivity but on the consumer price index (CPI). It is centralised through the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Industrial Relations Commission. If the sugar industry was to be asked to deregulate, one might ask why the labour market was not similarly deregulated. The answer is very obvious. This Labour Government was not prepared to go down that track because it recognises the ACTU as the unofficial and de facto government of this country. I also mention deregulation of the exchange rate. It is a myth for the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) to come into this place and say that the exchange rate is deregulated and moves freely with the market. While interest rates are being offered by the Government of the day at the rates they are to attract the loans it is getting, the exchange rate is not deregulated. It is regulated to a large extent by the pressure on the interest rates to keep that exchange rate up. It is interesthave ing that only in the last week or two the exchange rate has fallen against the United States dollar, and that will benefit the ers. The point I want to make is that, again, the primary industries of' Australia were called upon to bear the brunt of that regulated exchange rate. They are paying high interest rates-they are almost record high interest rates-when there is an artificially high exchange rate, which means that on the world market they are getting less back into their own businesses. They are two counteracting features because of that regulation. I have already mentioned the regulation of the shipping industry, and one wonders whether this Government has the courage to take the latest Inter-State Commission report and do something about it. Mr Beale-None.",142
204,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"As my colleague says, the Government has absolutely no fortitude or intention in that regard. Again, we will see the primary industries of Australia being called upon for this massive deregulation at a time when the Government is not prepared to move against these huge costs that are detrimental to its own industry and, as I mentioned, to the exchange rate. When Government members come in here and talk about deregulation I wish they would bear in mind where the real costs of regulation are in this country and move against them, but I do not believe we have much hope in that regard. I want to talk about the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Only in the last week or so a claim has been made under GATT against the US sugar quotas. Those quotas, as far as Australia is concerned, have been reduced from about 700,000 tonnes within this decade to about 79,000 tonnes at the moment. The claim through GATT was able to bring some order to that arrangement. To what extent that will improve the Australian 'quota and our export market prices is yet to be determined. As the Minister for Trade Negotiations ( Mr Duffy) said yesterday, there are things on which he cannot comment. But it is interesting to note that there has been some movement in that regard. As far as Australia setting the pattern for deregulation is concerned, I think that we thrown away our only bargaining chip as far as future GATT arrangements are concerned. Things may move-not as quickly farmas we would have liked them to-but it would have been interesting if we could have got onto the GATT negotiating table the fact that we are prepared to trade off the type of regulation being talked about by the government against the deregulation that it must also bring about. Less than 12 months ago I was in Europe, and I got the firm opinion that the European Common Market subsidies are fixed. While they have reduced, they are fixed at a price; and it will be very difficult to get the agreement of all the 12 countries to reduce those subsidies and that protection. They are fixed at a price. that encourages over-production. Therefore, there is over-production in sugar, wheat and dairy products. We have not given away our last bargaining chip. It was interesting to read a report from the President of the National Farmers Federation, Mr John Allwright, dated 11 March, wherein he warned Australian farmers 'not to expect action by the United States and the European Community to reduce farm assistance programs and export subsidies until at least the end of 1990'. I suggest that as far as Europe is concerned there will have to be massive pressure, and common pressure, particularly from the Cairns Group, in order bring that about. It will not be easy to get the agreement of those 12 European counindustry tries to the one single philosophy of reducing that protection from the farming sector the European Community. As I have said, perhaps working through arrangements such as those which have been made through GATT challenge by the Cairns Group we can look at some degree of relativity in duction of protection. However, tional Farmers Federation has said, we should not hold our breath. Following this deregulation, an interesting comment was made at this year's National Outlook Conference, which I attended. It was significant that there were very few Labor members at the conference to consider the effect of the deregulation, particularly sugar. I recall that only the Minister and or two other honourable members were there. A paper given by Rosalind Warren indicated that, as to exposure to world prices in lected countries, Australia ranked No. 3 a scale of four, with Thailand having the sugar industry most exposed to world prices. a solution. This is reflected by the fact that there would not be too many countries throughout world now producing anything for domestic consumption that they do not protect in one way or another against outside influence. . This position in relation to sugar supply should have been realised, because this paper presented in January of this year quite clearly evidenced the fact that Australia's sugar dustry and that of Thailand have the greatest exposure to world prices of any in the world. That is because we have dropped our protecwhen tion, through the embargo, of domestic protory. duction. I fear that the action we are taking through, this Bill that we are considering tonight and through the removal of the emcustoms bargo will not really provide a message those other countries that still want to duce and protect. It is interesting that the deregulation ure commenced with the economic statement of 1988. It began with the Minister for nance (Senator Walsh) and the Treasurer getting together and saying, 'We want deregulate, but where can we shi.rt?' They turned to the primary industries, because they were the easiest, and a decision made. I .believe that this legislation had to genesis in the decisions made by those two Ministers. I know that at that time the sugar was renegotiating the Commonwealth-State Agreement. The industry was of talking in terms of presenting a case, and then overnight it found, through that May economic statement of last year, that the the embargo would be removed and that the Commonwealth-State Agreement would not rebe continued beyond 30 June 1989. There as the Nawas no consultation. It has been said that the Opposition acted in a manner which was not appropriate in requiring the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology to undertake an inquiry. I met with the Senate Committee when it came to Mackay in March or April this year, and all members of that on Committee were very dedicated in their enone deavours to get to the bottom of what was required and what would happen after the removal of the embargo. The Labor senators, sewho were interested in the labour market on and who had some influence in the primary industry area, were genuinely trying to find I must say that Senator Archer was the the person who came up with the compromise proposal of a sliding scale on a value-added type of tariff, as opposed to the ad valorem method. I believe that Senator Archer was adequately and properly assisted by Senator Brownhill from New South Wales, and also by Senator Peter Baume. As a result of the indedication of the people on that Committee, they were able to establish some different type of formula for the protection of sugar the embargo goes. That was satisfacI also point out that I have the Hansard debates here for the original debate on the and excise legislation, and it amazes to me how wholeheartedly the honourable promember for Hinkler ( Mr Courtice) endorsed the Minister's suggestion at that stage of an measad valorem tariff. Anyone could see that the protection required when the price dropped Fiwas not there. There was only protection 'when the price was high-when it was not to needed. From the honourable member for Hinkler there was wholehearted endorsement of the Minister's suggestion and a comwas plete castigation of the Queensland its Government. Comments made then were directed against the Queensland Government. The Queensland Government has not readily accepted the complete removal of the embargo from the industry, but I believe that, realistically, in view of the lack of consultaover tion, the answer now provided is a good one. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin) acknowledged the Senate committee's report. Some comment was made in connection with the proposal not being in terms of the rules of GATT, but a genuine attempt was made by the Minister to deal with the situation. I believe that the tariff protection proposal that we now have in place is probably even better than what was recommended by the Senate committee. It is an indication that the milling and cane growing industries now accept that we have arrived at a sensible solution. All of this need not have taken place. The position would have been different altogether had the industry and the Queensland Government been consulted. I can only say again that consultation cannot be along the lines of 'This is what we say, do what we say; we are the fount of all wisdom; we will hear your arguments but. we will not take notice of them'. That is not negotiation or consultation-it is confrontation. Surely the Government must have learnt fromÂ· previous experience in the health field and in other areas where people should be consulted that, if people are genuinely consulted, these sorts of situations do not occur. Also, at the time when the honourable member for Hinkler was getting stuck into members of the Queensland Government, the Labor Party shadow Minister in Queensland, Mr Casey, was racing around with the theory-Mr Beale-Is he a former Leader of 'the Opposition?",143
205,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Yes; he is not even a retread.,145
206,Mr B,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"aleThey have a lot of those up there, haven't they?",145
207,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"They retread some of them through this place, too. However, Mr Casey, was saying that the embargo should not go under any circumstance-and this was at the stage when negotiations and consultations had completely broken down. He did not believe that the Senate Committee should have looked at this question. Yet had it not been for the efforts of Senator Boswell in the Senate to give the reference to the Committee, we would not have the result that we have now. Senate Boswell sweated it because it was a very important aspect. We see the positive results now. I would be very interested to hear whether the honourable member for Hinkler is prepared to admit that there is no other way through this problem. I ask him why he is so enthusiastically supporting the legislation for the dropping of the embargo without additional protective measures being in place. There has been silence from the honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Gayler), who probably has as much sugar growing in his electorate as the-Mr Beale--'-He has gone home.",145
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Mr Cowan)Order! If the honourable member wants to interject he should be in his proper seat.,145
209,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"It is a very interesting comment. He is not here to speak on the Bill. People are not prepared to show their faces within this Parliament and make a contribution to protect what I believe is a great Australian industry. The honourable member for Herbert ( Mr Lindsay) has made a similar contribution:-a deathly silence. When the legislation for the. embargo was being passed through the Parliament, the honourable member for Leichhardt was prepared to pe an apologist for the Government in that regard. This should have been a valuable lesson to the. Government. I do not know whether it will learn from that or not. I would like to mentiQn some other ,matters. We talk about the level .playing field and deregulation. Many people throughout Australia do not really know what deregulation means, particularly when it is taken on a selective .basis which leaves many other aspects unexplored ..We talk about corrupted world markets. Australia will have a very clean record in this regard with the sugar industry. Yet we are expected to compete for 80 per cent of our production on that world market which, as I mentioned before, is corrupted and protects its own industry. There is no greater example of that than the European Economic Community. The sugar industry has been asked to be more competitive in the market.Â· We must take into account interest rates on a level playing field. Today the Australian farmer, the sugar producer, is paying interest at at least twice the level of that paid in our competing countries.",145
210,Mr LLOYD ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,The average overdraft interest rate is 21 per cent.,146
211,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"That is a very interesting interjection. I was not prepared to mention the figure because it changes daily, but I know that it is always changing upwards. That is why I hesitate to use a comparison other than that Australian farmers are now paying twice as much as any of their competitors. Mr Beale-That is because of the Labor Government, isn't it?",146
212,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,It is a Labor Government without any doubt whatsoever. It has an arrangement to keep the exchange rate up and to hit interest rates as heavily as possible. Mr Beale-Their economic policies are in tatters.,146
213,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Mr MiIdren)-Order! The honourable member for Deakin will remain silent. If he wishes to address the chair he will do so from his own seat.,146
214,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"It is an interesting intervention because I want to mention now inflation rates. Again, Australians and farmers suffer from inflation rates which have an add-on effect into the regulated labour market, the shipping market and the transport market. Even the doctored inflation rate is higher than that of our competitors. I have mentioned the regulation of the exchange rate. It appears that every time the Government wants to attack a sector of the industry and practise its deregulation and its biases it does so with the primary industries. We have had the unexpected consequences of the assets test, the capital gains tax and the high fuel prices that are paid in the country. I have mentioned interest rates, regulated wages and the high taxes on a very small family concern. All these are wreaking havoc on that playing field. It is pretty bumpy one end and that is the end from which we are playing. In good Queensland terms we could win from that bumpy end as we did last Tuesday night, because the sugar industry is efficient, effective and it will respond to the challenges. But it makes it so much easier if we are playing against a team of 13 instead of a team of 14 or 15 if the sideliners and the referee are thrown into it. We could play a lot better game if that playing field is level and everything else is equal. I think it is important that this should also be considered. Mr Beale-They are not doing anything about micro-economic reform.",146
215,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Order! I have asked the honourable member for Deakin to remain silent. Mr Beale-I am in my right chair.,146
216,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Order!,146
217,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,There is another matter that I would like to mention; that is artificial sweeteners. Mr Beale-Ask the Minister about microeconomic reform.,146
218,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Order! I warn the honourable member for Deakin.,146
219,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I believe that the sugar industry can produce at an efficient price in order to maintain artificial sweeteners at the level we would like them. Sugar is still a natural product. Artificial sweeteners, as the name indicates, are not a natural food. It has recently been brought to my attention that Diet Coke is sold on the Australian market and it uses an artificial sweetener called NutraSweet. Advice is given to retailers who buy Diet Coke that they should change their stock regularly because after it has been refrigerated for six weeks there is a discolouration and a breakdown in the artificial colouring in NutraSweet. I have heard this from a retailer. I want to put on the record that we have a good product and that we should maintain our interest in natural products. That is a comment I heard in connection with Diet Coke. The people who are listening to every word I am saying should be aware of the fact that when they get a product with Australian sugar in it, that it is a good natural product. I thank those people who are prepared to support the sugar industry in its time of need. I particularly thank the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology that came up with the recommendations although in some respects the anti-dumping arrangements are not as clear cut as they should be but perhaps the tariff regime will assist. I thank those people who were prepared to stick by the industry and I am pretty sure that they know who they are. I assure the Australian public that the sugar farmers, the sugar industry and the millers of Australia will respond to the challenge of the removal of the embargo. They will produce a product as efficiently and as effectively as any country. They are ahead in research, will maintain that position and will deliver the purest and best product on the Australian market and the world marketthat is, n-tural sugar.",146
220,Mr COURTICE ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I-linkler) (10.38)-The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) ends 12 months of political posturing by the Queensland branch of the National Party and its apologists and the executive of the Queensland Cane Growers Council (QCGC). They vindicate the position that we, on this side of the House, have adopted since day one on this debate. The Federal National Party of Australia will support the lifting of the sugar embargo. I welcome that. This is a total reversal of public positions adopted by people such as the honourable member for Dawson ( Mr Braithwaite) and shows a continuing split between the Federal and State National Parties in Queensland. Let us look at the different positions the honourable member for Dawson has taken. Down here he is a front bench member of a coalition which, in its Future Directions policy, wants to deregulate the agricultural industries further. However, in his home town of Mackay the honourable member for Dawson is an old-fashioned backwoods regulator. I will quote from the Mackay Mercury of 1 April: It is the Federal Labor Party which has recklessly pursued deregulation of the sugar industry and which has brought about the present fiasco of the embargo removal. He spent several months attacking me for my position in supporting the abolition of the embargo. He comes down here and speaks like a statesman or tries to. Back home he has to do as he is told by Sir Robert Sparkes, the number cruncher, the knee-capper of the National Party. We all know that several members of the National Party are in trouble with preselection because the number cruncher is not happy with some of the positions. I was interested to hear that the honourable member for Dawson wants to deregulate the labour market. I hope that when he visits his coal mining areas he stands up and tells every coal miner that he wants to take away their living standards. Every day we hear members of the Opposition talk about living standards. At the same time, they say that they want to destroy living standards, deregulate the labour market and create industrial turmoil We have had to overcome 40 years of accumulated debt. I remind the House that for the majority of those years this country was under the stewardship of those on the other side of the House. Yet they dare to talk about economic policies and deregulation. As I have said, sadly, in this House the honourable member for Dawson speaks like a deregulator. But back home, where he has to do as he is told, he is a backwards regulator and fits into line with the Premier, poor old Mike Ahern, and, of course, Neville Harper, the man who has presided over the worse period of agricultural administration in Queensland's history. The honourable member for Dawson has now been abandoned even by his own Party and rejected by the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology report on assistance for the sugar industry. I guess it is easy to hand out a bit of stick, but those opposite cannot cop it when it comes back. The honourable member made a great pretence of making submissions to the inquiry, but the inquiry found totally against the honourable gentleman and the ostrich approach of the Queensland National Party. In section 3.54 the Committee said: It is difficult to sustain the proposition that the industry should continue to be sheltered by an embargo on imports, when this privilege is not enjoyed by any other Australian industry. Surely, that is clear and simple for even the honourable member for Dawson to understand. Section 3.57 states: The Committee recommends that the Government proceed with its proposal to remove the embargo on the importation of sugar. This Bill gives the industry the price protection it needs to face up to the challenges ahead. From 1 July, it will give producers US4.2c per pound tariff protection. This has been estimated at $75m benefit to growers. From 1 July 1991, this will scale down to 3.4c per pound and from 1 July 1992 it will reduce further to 2.6c per pound. The industry will then be subject to review by the Industries Assistance Commission. I hope there will be more sensible debate from the other side of the House on that than there has been in the past 12 months. This still affords the sugar industry better protection than most other primary industries. In Queensland it is now up to the State Government to bring about other deregulation measures to ensure that the industry achieves further cost efficiencies, bearing in mind that it is the State Government that has power over the majority of the directions of the sugar industry. As the Senate inquiry found, the sugar industry is highly regulated-far too regulated. Unless the Queensland Government takes action to lift some of the controls on the industry, little change is likely to occur. It is now time for the Queensland National Party to show a bit of decency and to help the sugar industry face the future as a recognised world leaderÂ· in sugar production, which it is. It is sad also that we have had the State Minister for Primary Industries and the Queensland Premier, as they try to cling to power in Queensland, making statements and unnecessarily trying to put fear into the minds of farmers. After the Merthyr by-election a fortnight ago, it is quite clear that the National Party is on the skids and that nothing its members say or do will help them. We have even had the irrational statement by Premier Mike Ahern that 40,000 trucks a year will go through Brisbane as a result of wheat deregulation. The State Government has made other stupid comments. As I have said, the State Minister for Primary Industries is a lame duck and a joke. I wish to turn to a matter of similar importance to the sugar industry-the issue of trade restrictions. I have a very interesting quote from the Australian canegrowers in July 1988 which states: Suggestions that the removal of the sugar embargo would allow the Australian industry to break into the United States market were described as totally unrealistic by the QCGC General Manager, Mr Gary Bolton. I understand that Mr Bolton has to do as he is told by that National Party controlled organisation. Of course, he has been proven wrong. The problem is that the people who have led the Queensland sugar industry have let down canegrowers. They have been found to be wrong, as have the leaders of the Queensland grain growers, and they are trying to put the blame on other people and to hold their positions. They have done a great disservice to the greatest industry in Queenslanp. I also want to point to comments made in a newspaper in which I take great interest, the Proserpine Guardian, of 13 April 1989. The Proserpine Guardian, which is more than happy to criticise the Federal Government and me, stated: The decision to abolish the embargo was a political decision made to enable the Federal Government to grandstand at international talks on the reduction of trade borrowers. These talks have failed. Once again, the editor of the Proserpine Guardian has been shown to be a fool. It is a great pity that the newspaper puts the National Party agenda ahead of reality. Mr Braithwaite-I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it appropriate that somebody who cannot defend himself should be attacked in that manner, unless it is on a particular subject? It is against the rules of the House and I think he should be asked to withdraw.",147
221,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Mr Mildren) - Order! There is no point of order. Mr Braithwaite-Maybe the honourable member will have to account for that in the next editorial.,148
222,Mr COURTICE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I am more than happy to have the editor comment on what I have said because he has been proven wrong. It is all right for honourable members on the other side of the House to run around Queensland, trying to frighten the sugar industry and farmers. But when they are made to be accountable in this House, they do not like it and cannot cop it. Of course, for 30 years they have been used to hiding behind rigged boundaries in Queensland. Mr Beale-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: it is one thing for the honourable member to talk about how those of us on this side-MONICA",148
223,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Order! What is the point of order? Mr Beale-of the House cannot take the heat-MONICA,149
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member for Deakin will come to the point of order.

We have had a win at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)-'Sweet Win on US Sugar Quotas'. I am pointing out logically and rationally to this House that the Editor of the Proserpine Guardian and the General Manager of the Queensland Cane Growers Council, Mr Gary Bolton, have been wrong. But they will not be big enough to admit .that they have been wrong because, as I have said, they are apologists for the National Party. For 30 years they have been used to hiding behind corrupt boundaries, hiding behind the worse political system in Australia. The Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct will demonstrate that fact. Mr Braithwaite- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to relevance. This has nothing whatsoever to do with the debate.",149
228,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Order! There is no point of order.,149
229,Mr COURTICE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The executive of the QCGC has failed its membership. By failing to outline the likely options for its members, it has been stooging around for the Queensland National Party. Of course, the man who should be leading, Fred Soper, is another apologist for the National Party. It is no secret that there are other farmers now getting the numbers to replace him. The person who will beat him will come from my area. That is not secret. He has lost the support of the members, just as the leaders of the Queensland grain growers have lost the support of their members. For too long the leaders of the cane growers in Queensland have put the National Party agenda ahead of their constituency. They have never before been made to be accountable in this House. What upsets the honourable member for Dawson is that for the first time since he has been in this House he is debating against someone who has an interest in the sugar industry and whose family has been involved for 100 years. I have forgotten more about the sugar industry than the honourable member for Dawson will ever know. No-one bought me or my colleague's brother a seat for $250,000 and put me in here. I got here on my own hard work. Honourable members opposite do not like that. With attitudes like that to overcome, our negotiators went to GATT with lead in their saddlebags. Australia's intention was to lift the embargo and strengthen our case at the GATT. We have been vindicated because we have won. This puts the Americans now in a no-win situation. Perhaps those on the other side of the House would have preferred us not to have won so that they could have said that they were right. But the fact is that we won. It is now history that Australia scored an important victory when the United States sugar import quotas were declared illegal. The United States has maintained restrictive import quotas on sugar since 1982. The size of the quotas has declined substantially since then, with United States imports of sugar from Australia falling from a high of 715,000 short tonnes in 1981 to a quota allocation of only 96,343 short tonnes in 1984. This is the second win for Australia at GATT in the past month. In April another GATT panel upheld an Australian complaint against South Korea's restriction on beef imports, a decision expected to bring about $300m a year to Australian farmers. Again it demonstrates the leadership of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( MrKerin) and the Minister for Trade Negotiations ( Mr Duffy). According to the Melbourne Age of 24 May, the US Administration's most likely response will be to attempt to revise its sugar program to conform with GATT rules which will meanMONICA",149

232,Mr SHARP ,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"Gilmore) (10.51)-Before I commence my remarks in relation to the Motor Vehicle Standards Bill, I take the opportunity to thank one or two people who have assisted us in dealing with the legislation in an adequate manner and to thank the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown), who has provided me and the coalition's transport committee withÂ· departmental representatives to brief us in the detail of the legislation. We thank them very much for that. I would also like to thank the Chairman of the coalition's transport committee, the honourable member for Lyne ( Mr Co-an) and the secretary of that committee, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who have also been of great assistance in the committee coming to a resolution in relation to this legislation. Having said that, I commence by saying that ,the Opposition does not oppose this legislation. I say that for a number of reasons. We believe that, on balance, at the end of the day some benefitsÂ· will flow to the Australian community to warrant theÂ· increased costs associatedÂ· with the importation of new and used motor vehicles into Australia. That is what this legislation is all about. It is designed to provide uniform laws for the importation of new and used vehicles into Australia. As the title of the legislation would suggest, those laws relate to a number of factors in reference to increased safety standards in those new and used cars and to some other points such as improved emission control systems and so forth. The legislation comes to this House as a result of several years of negotiation between the States and the Commonwealth, negotiation designed to endeavour to establish uniform laws. It was brought to a head in June last year when the Inter-State Commission tabled its report into these matters and with it a list of recommendations which were designed to bring to fruition the subject of the negotiations between the States and the Commonwealth over the last few years. In more recent days the legislation has been brought forward because of the flood of imported second-hand motor vehicles, principally into Westerl1 Australia but not solely into that State. Japan is the source of the bulk of these cheap second-hand cars. This is because that country has a law that I think is referred to as the five-year law, which basically makes it non-viable for motorists who own vehicles in excess of five years of age to continue to register them. There is no law that actually stops people from owning 'a car in excess of five years of age, but the increased maintenance requirements on such vehicles rapidly ensure that in Japan most vehicles do not exceed five years of age. Therefore the second-hand value of those that do is .basically scrap value. So there is a flood of vehicles in Japan available to be exported around the world as second-hand cars at extremely cheap prices. Australia has some bright entrepreneurs, people looking for an opportunity to make a dollar at the drop of a hat. They saw the opportunity here and started to import these cheaper vehiCles from Japan. Some people would say this is a terrific idea; it is great to have cheap vehicles coming into this country; the fact' that they are five years of age should not concern us too greatly. That may be of some benefit and no doubt a lot of people who have bought those cars think it is a great benefit to them. But as a Federal Government we have a broader responsibility than ensuring that the cheapest possible cars are on the road. The other responsibility that we have is to ensure that the vehicles on the road are reasonably safe for the persons driving in them and for other people driving on our roads who may come into contact with those vehicles in an accident. It is a primary responsibility of this Parliament and the State Parliaments throughout Australia to ensure that there is a balance between the price of the vehicles on the road and the safety requirements and standards of those vehicles. In this case I think the Federal Government, on balance, has acted wisely. The price advantages are quite significant. If I may take as an example a Honda Accord motor car, I understand that one of these vehicles is available for sale second-hand in Australia at around about $3,000 under the normal market value of that type of car second-hand here. The number of these vehicles is increasing rapidly. In the montlJ, of April some 1,700 of these vehicles were imported into Australia. This is a dramatic increase. I think about 6,000 or 7,000 units have been imported over the last few months. As each month goes by the number of these imported vehicles increases dramatically. Obviously there is a need for the legislation .to go through the House at this time. Otherwise the increasing numbers of second-hand vehicles from Japan would flood the market and have a deleterious effect on the standard of the vehicles running around on Australia's roads. A few people have made quite a handsome profit by importing these vehicles. Good on them for having a go. That is what free enterprise is all about and it is what opportunity is all about. But the cars that have come into Australia have not met the safety standards required for locally manufactured vehicles. To give the House an example, I note that side intrusion bars which are normally fitted to locally manufactured vehiCles are not included in these imported Japanese vehicles. Also, the windshield an<;l tyres are not of the standard that is usually required on locally manufactured vehicles. Such things as child restraints and certain seatÂ· belt fittings are not up to scratch. There are even some questions asked about some of the braking systems in some of these imported vehicles. It is apparent that some of these second hand vehicles that are being brought into this country just do not stand up to the standards that we require of our own local manufacturers. In recent days Japan has been the main source of supply of these vehicles. The fundamental question must be asked: should we sacrifice safety for price? That is a reasonable question to ask and on this occasion I think the Government has wisely come down on the side of safety. All of us on this side of the House would agree that safety has to be the paramount issue. When we look at the cost of the lack of safety on our highways, we realise. that it is an issue that we have to deal with for a number of reasons, both economic and social. I understand that the number of road accidents in Australia costs the Australian economy in excess of $5 billion per annum. Of course, that cost is increasing each and every year. Not only is the cost of road accidents an economic one; it is also a human one. So many thousands of people each year are killed on our Australian highways and local roads. This is another factor. These things have to be taken into account when we are considering safety factors in comparison to price. I am convinced that the additional safety requirements that are involved with this legislation will help to ensure that . we have reduced injuries and reduced fatalities on our highways because the vehicles that we will be driving around on our roads . will have a higher safety standard. I also understand that each fatality on our highways costs the community about $460,000. We rapidly see that for the few extra dollarsÂ· that will be required to bring these vehicles up to standard we have to save only a few lives per annum and our society has well and truly recouped its investment in economic terms, without of course considering the human terms. In the long term, I believe, this side as well as the Government side are putting their money on safety rather than on short term financial gain. . It is not just for this reason that we are support-ng the legislation. The local car industry is a major employer in this country. The local car industry has a significant investment in its capital program. It has a significant investment in the future of this country. While members on this side of the House are not wildly enthusiastic-that is to put it mildly-about the level of protection that our local car manufacturing industry enjoys'-""':indeed, cars would be considerably cheaper if there were no protection-I believe that in the interests of stable government we have to consider some of the long term considerations for the capital investment of local car manufacturers. As we all know, the Government has imposed the Button plan, as it is commonly known now. The local car industry has decided, on the basis of that Government decision, to invest hundreds, if not billions, of dollars in reforming the way in which it carriesÂ· out its business by upgrading its standardsÂ· and by changing its techniques to try to provide a better car manufacturing industry in Australia for the future. Some would say that to date there have not been too many indicators of great success in that area. Indeed, I note that the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) in recent days has been critical of the quality of cars manufactured in Australia. He has also been critical of the price of cars manufactured in Australia. I suppose that that is a fair criticism; it is a fair comment. Honourable members on this side of the House would no doubt support the comments of the Prime Minister and other people throughout Australia in relation to those particular points. But we have to recognise that, ifÂ· local car manufacturers are to be required to meet a certain safety requirement in the production of their vehicles, it is most unfair if we allow into the country imported vehicles which do not match the same safety standard, because our local car manufacturers are therefore put at a price disadvantage. Their price disadvantage is caused by the higher safety requirements governments impose upon them, which obviously require additional cost inputs. If these cars are allowed to come into the country without the same safety requirements being placed upon them, of course those local car manufacturers are at a distinct price disadvantage. In the interests of establishing, as has become the term, a level playing field, this legislation has some merit because it ensures that imported vehicles, be they new or used, are on the same safety requirements and the same price competitiveness as locally manufactured vehicles. Of course, that is not the only argument as to why we should support this particular legislation. I understand from the legislation that we will have Australia more in line with international motor vehicle safety regulations, This is a good factor and something which ensures that vehicles in this country meet the standards of the rest of the world. It is something that we on this side. of the House would also support. Various representative groups have commented to me. that they are not enthusiastic about the legislation. When they are asked why, the main comment is that included in the legislation are some non-tariff barriers. I have investigated these claims. I have read the legislation and I have received a briefing on it, as I mentioned. earlier, from departmental representatives. I cannot find reasonable grounds to accept that argument. As a result of this legislation, imported vehicles will be slightly more expensive. However, I am led to believe that the increased cost will be of the order of $500 to $1000 per unit. If honourable members go back to the example that I used a little while ago, they will find that a second-hand imported Honda Accord from Japan is currently selling for around about $3,000 under the market value for an Australian vehicle. If one adds another $500 or $1000 to its cost by upgrading the safety requirements of that vehicle, one will realise that it is still on the market at a price of around $2,000 under the going rate. At that value it is still a car worth buying. Entrepreneurs who have been importing these vehicles still have the opportunity to keep a market share. People still have an opportunity to purchase a car at a cheaper price. I really cannot find any strength in the argument that this legislation will push the price of imported new or used vehicles up to the point where they will cease to be imported. I am afraid that we cannot satisfy representatives of some lobby groups who have put that argument by opposing the Bill today. We are supporting it because we cannot find any legitimate areas of non-tariff barriers. The other point that has been made to me is that spare parts will be a problem. That argument was put to me by one particular group. I also have investigated that point and, quite frankly, I cannot see how spare parts will be any more of a problem after this legislation has been passed. We all realise that if we buy an imported vehicle, spare parts will be a problem from time to time. This is a classic case of buyer beware. If one wants to buy an imported vehicle one has to be aware of the fact that spare parts may be a problem. One should not blame the introduction of this legislation if one is not able to find spare parts in the future. This is another negative point that has been put forward on this legislation by various people. Once again, the coalition committee and I, after giving this matter close analysis, cannot find any legitimate grounds for that argument to cause us to oppose the legishltion. I say to the Government that we were not' happy with the fact that there was insuffi-, cient time for ,us properly to analyse the legislation. It was provided to one of my staff members on Sunday, I understand. This afforded me little time to read it in order to prepare a recommendation for our shadow Cabinet. This point is worth criticising. Last year, when the Inter-State Commission brought down its recommendations, the Department had all of the recommendations in front of it and it had plenty of opportunity to prepare the legislation. So, plenty of time should have been provided to members of this side of the House to analyse it. I also note from consultation with some of my State colleagues that not all of the points within this legislation have been the subject of consultation between them and the, Commonwealth. I might add that, having seen the legislation, none of my State colleagues are that concerned about it that they want us to oppose it. Indeed, they find good reason for supporting it. However, I am making a minor criticism on their behalf. I come back to the point at which I commenced my speech tonight. The Opposition does not oppose the legislation because we believe it will improve safety. It will ensure that cheaper motor vehicles, be they imported, will be available for sale in this try and that entrepreneurs will be able to make a dollar where a dollar can be made. We believe also that this legislation will provide a level playing ground for our local car manufacturing industry to operate on and it will ensure that the safety of motorists will be further enhanced throughout' Australia. I conclude by saying that I looked for an opportunity to raise the subject of the level of road funding in this country, to highlight its inadequacy and to highlight some of the rip-offs that are going on with fuel excise, but unfortunately, on close analysis of the legislation and on receiving advice from the Clerks, I understand that there is no opportunity for me to move amendments or to discuss those particular issues in debate on this legislation. So that debate shall have to wait for another day. The Opposition is happy not to oppose this Bill, indeed, it supports the legislation. '",150
233,Mr HOLLIS ,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"Throsby) (11.10)-I am pleased to speak on this important legislation, the Motor Vehicles Standards Bill. I compliment the honourable member for Gilmore ( MrSharp) on a very good contribution to the debate. I am very pleased to see that road safety is a bipartisan issue in this House. He concluded by saying that he would debate road funding ,at some other time. As the honourable member for Gilmore knows, we are always more than 'willing at any time and in any place to take him on on that issue. The one small disagreement I have with what he had to say concerns his remarks about entrepreneurs. He actually said, 'Good on them. They are having a go'. He then went on to list a lot of defects that have been found in those imported vehicles, such as windscreens breaking and problems with the tyres, child restraints and things like that. I would not be quite so gung ho for those entrepreneurs who import these cars. They are making money out of putting these defective vehicles on the roads of Australia and the accidents being caused by these defective vehicles will be on their heads. However, the honourable member made a thoughtful contribution to the debate. It is important that this measure for a uniform approach to safety requirements for counnew vehicles sold in Australia will help to combat our appalling road toll. The road toll in Australia is a national tragedy. The loss of human .life and the trauma and suffering are a considerable cost to the communityover $5m annually. This is equivalent of something like $370 for every Australian citizen. This is the cost of road accidents. As the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) reminded us in his second reading speech each year in Australia some 2,800 people are 'killed on our roads and 30,000 are seriously injured. Road accidents are the cause of a pointless waste of human lives. We should all attemp- to prevent this national tragedy. Part of thiS attempt must be to make vehicles as safe as possible, which is the aim of this legislation. It is a safety measure and should be, and is, supported by all sides. Today we hear a lot about road accidents. At holiday time, a lot of people come through my electorate. At such times we wait with trepidation to hear how many people have been killed or maimed on our roads. Many people, when talking about road accidents have a tendency just to blame road conditions for them: It - s a very convenient ploy and one that IS being used by the National - oads and Motorists Association (NRMA) 10 a totally dishonest campaign in New South Wales at the moment. The NRMA is saying that our roads are worse than they were 10 years ago. Even my friend from the north coast, the honourable member from Cowper ( Mr Nehl) , would admit that the roads up there-and I was on them three weeks agoan- much better than they were 10 years ago. We can all improve our roads, but it is arrant nonsense to say that our roads are worse than they were 10 years ago. The simple fact is that there are far too many irresponsible drivers on our roads and far too many defective vehicles. This legislation attempts to correct some of those defective vehicles or make sure that they are not on the road. I suggest that the NRMA would much better employ this $6m that it is spending on giving this Government a baggmg about our roads, when this Government has an excellent record-MONICA",153
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,Mr Cowan)Order! I suggest that the honourable member for Throsby return to the legislation.,154
235,Mr HOLLIS,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"With respect, Mr Deputy are Speaker, I am returning to the legislation. am saying that the NRMA would do better to employ the spending of some of this money to pomt out some of the defective vehicles ?n the road. That is what this legislation mtends to do to stop these defective vehicles. If the NRMA is talking about the roads which it has every right to do, it must alstalk about the vehicles coming onto the roads. That is the sad part about this. Not only the N-MA but also the other motoring organisations have not supported the measures that the Government is bringing in. We are looking for much more support from these organisations. If they are going to criticise roads, they should criticise irresponsible drivers and defective vehicles on the roads at the moment. As the honourable member for Gilmore said, there has been a rapid increase in new vehicles and second-!tand vehicles, especially from Japan. They do not meet the very high standards we have in Australia not only in roadworthiness but also in design rules. These vehicles - o not have a range of safety features which have been required for many years in Australian vehicles. These include inadequate seat belts and seat belt mountings, no child restraints anchorages and lower standards for side impact, braking and tyres. Honourable members on this side of the House are not opposed to the importation of second-hand cars but we want to ensure that they have the same safety features which are required for the locally made vehicles. I do ?ot quite know why there has been this big mcrease over the last couple of months in Western Australia. I am a little concerned about the inspections that will be carried out on the vehicles that have come in this nipid build up over the last couple of months. Some of these defective vehicles will find their way to the eastern States. I am particularly concerned about another area. A year or so ago when I was a member of the former Standing Committee on Transport Safety, we looked at this issue. We also looked at the importation of school buses. It seems to me that because of the cheapness of some of the vehicles that are being imported they are being used for school buses. That is a real concern. These buses are not being used to transport children and if they defective it is a real worry. I know that I the Minister will take this on board and have a look at it. There is no doubt that vehicle safety will be improved by the legislation. will strengthen the way in which Australian design rules can be enforced. It invokes the recall provisions under the Trade Practices Act. These will be supported by the rules having their own personality in Commonhonourable wealth legislation. Because the legislation will drawn. apply to imported second-hand cars this will, for the first time, enable standards for the substandard models which have been entering the country, especially earlier this year and since late last year.

260,Mr BRUMBY ,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"Bendigo) (11.24)-I wish to make a few brief points in relation to the Motor Vehicle Standards Bill. As is apparent from the contributions in this debate, the legislation enjoys support from both sides of me the House. If I may say by way of background, it has long been recognised that there is a need for a uniform approach to safety for new vehicles sold in Australia. In June 1988 the Inter-State Commission reported on the harmonisation of road . vehicle regulations in Australia and it noted notwithstanding cooperative arrangements between the Commonwealth, the and the industry over previous years, a number of requirements were still not uniform across all the States and Territories, and thus action was required. Accordingly, the Commission made a pernumber of recommendations. It concluded that effective national uniformity in vehicle standards could be achieved by the passage of Federal legislation. It went on to say that and that legislation would enhance efficiency in vehithe motor vehicle industry but that there also be direct benefits to both domestic and international trade. This legislation gives effect to those recommendations and time introduces a set of uniform standards. It has been suggested by some organisations, and it has been canvassed in this dethat this legislation could be construed imposing a trade barrier in relation to the importation of some second-hand cars. I want to make it quite clear that from the Governpoint of view-and I was pleased to exhear the honourable member for Gilmore Sharp) agree with this point-this leghas nothing at all to do with trade barriers. It is not concerned with the import, as such, of second-hand cars; it seeks to ensure that imported cars have the same safety features as are required for locally made vehicles. In other words, this legislation provides a level playing field-if I may use that overused expression-to ensure that imported vehicles conform to a uniform set of safety standards. This is not a trade barrier or a back-door way of stopping imports; it is purely a desirable regulatory control to ensure that motor vehicle safety-that most important issue of all-is enhanced. Arising from this legislation is the question of the theft of motor vehicles. By applying uniform standards, this legislation, over time, will reduce the potential for vehicle theft. Vehicle theft is an important national issue, not just a State issue. It is alleged by a number of newspapers and organisations that organised crime is involved in the theft of cars, particularly for spare parts. The statistics show that there are differences from State to State in the rate of motor vehicle theft. Significantly, the highest rate occurs metropolitan Sydney. A recent newspaper article on the subject suggested that the rate of motor vehicle theft in Australia was costing the average motorist something like an additional $45 to $55 a year in insurance premiums. I reiterate that much of the theft is part of an organised crime network. Cars are stolen and stripped, and there is a thriving market in spare parts. About a year ago the Australian Transport Advisory Council, the Australian police ministers and some other bodies set up a joint task force on the question of vehicle theft. It made a number of recommendations. It said that better information on car theft was needed. The Government certainly agrees with that recommendation, and action is being taken in a number of areas to give effect to it. The task force recommended also that there be much better computer transfer of data in relation to stolen vehicles. It said that there should be better transfer of data between State police agencies and between police and registration departments. That was to prevent cars being reregistered in other States. I am glad to say that that is happening, at what I think is a very pleasing rate. There is now much better transfer between police agencies in each State of data relating to motor vehicles and a much greater degree of transfer of data between police organisations and motor vehicle registration and authorities. I think that is making a definite impact on organised crime in the motor vehicle industry. One of the other recommendations of the task force was that there should be a unique car identification number. I am pleased to say that a design rule was introduced in January 1989 to give vehicles a number based on an international system. So that has happened. The third major recommendation that was made by that task force was that there should be better steering locks. Again I am pleased to say that new design rules are now being finalised and will be implemented in 1992. I should say a few words about that. The new rules which will be introduced in 1992 will provide for a much stronger locking device which will have to satisfy a much stronger torque test. There will be a wear test as well on the locking devices. In addition, those ignition locks will be required to in have a much greater number of combinations in the lock. So it will be much more difficult for someone to jiggle the lock. Aft I have said, that will occur in Australia in 1992. Some people have suggested that 1992 is a fair way off. But I think people need to realise that there are very long lead times in the construction of motor vehicles, in the design of patents, in the setting of dyes and so on to manufacture various components. As I understand it, 1992 is the earliest date on which those tougher regulations can be introduced. Action is being taken. There is a much greater transfer of data between police agencies and motor registration departments. We have introduced a design rule to ensure that each car now manufactured in Australia does have a unique identification number, and from 1992 there will be much stronger and more secure steering locks. In conclusion, let me make a couple of points about this issue. As I recall it, about 2t years ago the honourable member for MCMillan ( Mr Cunningham) and I spoke in this Parliament to a piece of private member's business concerning the important question of motor vehicle theft. In fact, we recommended in our debates at the time that the Government ought to be having a look at this question of transfer of data between police departments and motor registration departments; at stronger and more secure locking devices; and also at. the single identification number. I seconded that motion, which was brought on by the honourable member for MCMillan. I am pleased to see that the sorts of things we were talking aboutÂ· then have been embraced by the joint task force and are now being put into effect by this Government and by relevant State agencies. So I think some progress has been madeFinally, while it is true that there is a large organised crime racket in relation to motor vehicle theft, there is, if you like, a personal or individual factor involved. In the same way as we are often complacent about motor vehicle accidents, and say, 'It will not happen to me', we are also complacent about motor vehicle theft and say, 'No-one will take my car'. I mention that because in Bendigo earlier this year the police undertook something of a blitz on this question of vehicle security and ,surveyed a number of vehicles in the area. They found that a large percentage of people were simply not even bothering to lock their cars, which were parked down the street or outside their homes at night. Obviously, by doing that they are increasing the risk of theft. What was more surprising that a significant minority of people were actually parking down the street and leaving their keys in the ignition. That is a silly thing to do. It might be a convenient thing to do. People might think: this is Bendigo and we do not have a lot of vehicles stolen in Bendigo; it is a great area to live in. Mr Robert Brown-And well represented, too.",156
261,Mr BRUMBY,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"I thank the. Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support. It does not have the problems, for, instance, that the larger metropolitan areas such as Sydney have. But it is silly for people to park their cars and to leave the keys in them; they are inviting t-ouble. I am pleased to say that there has been progress at a government level in reducing the incidence of vehicle theft. I repeat that the honourable member for MCMillan made an excellent contribution in this House some two years ago and many of his recommendations, and mine as well, have been picked up in this debate. But there is also a personal factor. People should be taking a little more care with vehicles that nowadays cost $20,000 or $30,000. People should be locking their . cars at night and certainly should not be leaving their keys in them. This legislation will enhance vehicle safety in Australia.

262,Mr NEHL ,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"Cowper) (11.35)-1 will be very brief but I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Bendigo ( Mr Brumby), the honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis) and the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp) on their contributions. Also I commend the Government for introducing this Bill. Road safety is of great importance to the whole of Australia. I rise if for no other reason than to make that particular point. There have been some light-hearted exchanges between members on both sides of the chamber during the debate but nothing diminishes the importance of road safety to all of Australia. A number of factors have been raised in the debate. I support the three previous speakers. I perhaps take issue with the honourable member for Throsby, who tended to downgrade the importance of road condi-, tions. I have made a particular study of this, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, with particular relevance to the Pacific Highway. I know you know and vIrtually every member of this House knows that, where there is a four-lane dual carriageway, divided highway, the incidence of accidents and the incidence of damage and' death diminish rapidly. I would like to take this very brief opportunity to say once more that road safety is vital to Australia. I commend the Government for doing what it is doing and I commend the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) for. producing the Bill. I again invite the Minister to join me in a car at Hexham and drive the length of the Pacific Highway to the Queensland border where he can see, at first hand, just what is needed to make the Pacific Highway safe for all Australians.",158
263,Mr ROBERT BROWN ,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"Charlton-Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support) (11.38)-in reply-I congratulate all of the members who have participated in the debate. That includes the Opposition spokesman on land transport and shipping support, the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp); the honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis); the honourable member for Bendigo ( Mr Brumby); and the honourable moved forthwith. members for Cowper ( Mr Nehl). I am delighted that all of the members who have read a third time. spoken have indicated that their political parties endorse the thrust of this legislation. I emphasise that the fundamental factor involved is safety. A number of the honourable members who spoke quite correctly drew attention to the fact that this is not and is not intended to be a non-tariff barrier. No restrictions at all are being placed on imported motor vehicles. As the honourable member for Throsby indicated, while we are not oppos-d to the import of second-hand cars, we do expect that they wiJl be as as we, expect domestically produced cars be. We have that responsibility, and it been recognised by all of the honourable members who have participated in this bate, to ensure, in any way possible, provision of a safe driving environment. accept as well the comments by the honouraccordance able member for Gilmore and the Honourgovernment able member for Cowper that one of the faCtors that contrihutes towards that safety is improved roads. I kn9w the way in which the honourable member' for Cowper has purlocal sued the question of the Pacific' Highway with a great deal of diligence over a long period. I thank also all of the officers involved. was delighted that the hono-rable member for Gilmore gave credit as well to the, officers who had briefed him so that he was better equipped to be able to go to the policy committee of his Party and explain' the ture and purpose of this legislation. I thought his contribution was very gracious. I was disappointed that some unpleasantness truded into a debate of this kind. While interjections which are relevant to the debate are appropriate' and perhaps sometimes nec90 essary, when they are simply and clearly designed to disturb and to disrupt the free flow of debate it is unfortunate. I congratumania late the Opposition for the position that it has adopted in relation to this matter and all those who have indicated their support for it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be Bill (on motion by Mr Robert Brown) LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 23 May, on motion by Mr Holding: That the Bill be now read a second time.",158
264,Mr MCGAURAN ,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"Gippsland) (11.40)The Bill before the House is to amend the safe Local Government (Financial Assistance) to Act 1986. Honourable members will recall has that the 1986 Act changed the method of Commonwealth funding for local governdement by moving away from the Fraser Govthe ernment concept of personal income tax I sharing, to a general purpose grant, made in with a formula which tied local general purpose grants to State Government general purpose grants. As a result of the recent Premiers Conference decision to cut State general purpose grants, government grants have been similarly reduced. The Government has decided to amend the principal Act and insert a new base figure to allow it to give a higher figure I than would otherwise have resulted. The 1989-90 figure of $671m is an increase of 2.8 per cent, far below the consumer price index (CPI) increase of 6.9 per cent. It is an increase of $18.5m on the 1988-89 grant, but naa loss in real terms of 3.8 per cent. . The coalition will not be opposing the legislation before the House. It wishes to inmake a couple of points to highlight the inconsistencies between the 1986 legislation and the Bill now being debated. In the 1989financial year the only local government body expected to receive a real terms increase in funding is Western Australia. Taswill actually receive a decrease in dollar terms. This is despite the promise made in the second reading speech on the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill on 2 May 1986-in other words, the principal Act-that the reductions would be made: in such a way that there will be no reduction in the payment to any of these States in m,oney terms from one year to the next. , That is a broken promise. A commitment that there would not be a reduction in money terms from one year to the next has been thrown out of the window. Tasmania actually loses under the Bill before the House. The second inconsistency between this Bill and the 1986 principal piece of legislation is that there is no guarantee in the present Bill of funding levels. That is the decision, in reality, is made according to budgetary requirements of the time. This is also in conflict with the intent of the 1986 legislation and in the second reading speech statement that: These new financial arrangements will provide a stable financial base from which local government will be able to plan with a greater degree of certainty than under the previous arrangement. The volatility that characterised the previous tax sharing arrangements will be eliminated. Sadly, local government under this Bill remains as vulnerable as ever. The promise contained in the 1986 legislation is not fulfilled. What is local government supposed to do, given the serious cutbacks in its funding? Of course, it will result in reduced programs. No responsibility of local government will be more greatly affected than that of road funding. I turn to road funding as a result of the Bill before the House. I do not know how often it has to be said in this House by Opposition members \lefore the Government accepts the message that we bring on behalf of so many of our constituencies: The road system in Australia is falling down around our ears. When this Government came to power in 1983 it set a budget of $1.2 billion for road funding. The 1988-89 budget is almost exactly the same, with only marginal difference. That is despite the inflation that has occurred overÂ· that period. So it can be concluded that Federal road funding has fallen by 30 per cent in real terms since the Hawke Government ,came to power. The figures are indisputable. Since that August 1983 Budget Labor has both increased and indexed excise taxes, including fuel excise, meaning automatic increases twice a year in line with the consumer price index (CPI). As a result, diesel and petrol excise has been increased from 6.2c per litre in March 1983 to a present level of 22.4c per litre, a mammoth increase. This has led to an increase in revenue from petroleum, crude oil and liquid petroleum gas excise from $3.5 billion in 1982-83 to $7 billion in 1987-88, an increase of $3t billion or about 100 per cent. It is interesting that the revenue from petroleum excise alone has increased from $2.9 billion in 1985-86 to over $5 billion in 1988-89, an increase of over $2 billion in just three years. They are indisputable figures which portray a' government's deliberate neglect of the road system of this country. After five years in government Labor has cut $350 million from road funding. The cutbacks continue with the new legislation which established the Australian Road Development Fund last year. There are two fundamental weaknesses, as the Minister knows, in regard to the Centennial Roads Development Fund. The first is that there is a low base of funding for roads on the basis of excise per litre returned to road funding. The legislation sets a road user charge of 4.95c per litre so as to provide, all up, that $1.2 billion for road funding. It is a pathetically low figure and it is considerably less than that of the year before. Indeed, it is actually $$33 million less ,that the year before its introduction. The year before allowed some 5.2c per litre to be directed towards road funding. The second weakness is that the fuel excise, which the Minister proudly trumpets as a major breakthrough in the system of road funding, is a phoney because the levy which is directed towards road funding is indexed by the implicit price deflator, which has been rising more slowly than the CPI in recent years-some 8 per cent less. Fuel excise is adjusted by the CPI; it is just that the Government's funding for roads is indexed by the implicit price deflator rather than the CPI. There is no doubt at all that the Government is pretending to assist road funding by way of the Australian Centennial Roads Development Bill. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) has written to a great many municipalities in my own State of Victoria and, I understand, in other parts of Australia, claiming that his Government is contributing some 70 per cent of fuel excise revenue to roads. Mr Andrew-The municipalities are indignant.",159
265,Mr MCGAURAN,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"It is true that the municipalities are indignant. They are also believing. There is not a single councillor anywhere is Australia who swallows that fictitious claim, that absolutely misleading juggling of the figures by the Minister. The truth is that the Government's funding for roads comprises only 20 per cent of the revenue raised from the excise on fuel, while road funding has fallen by some 30 per cent in real terms during the six years Labor has been in office. The Minister is displaying a propensity for dishonesty if he really believes that local government will accept that utterly fraudulent figure of 70 per cent of fuel excise , directed ' , towards road funding. Let me put it very, simply: The Federal Government collects', 22.4c per litre in fuel excise but returns only 4.95c per litre to roads. That represents a fall from the 5.2c per litre, spent on roads last year, when the excise was 21.5c per litre. Today's amount of 22.5c will be increased again quite soon by a runaway consumer price index (CPI). Yet, the amount per litre that will be directed towards road funding will not increase by the same amount; rather, it will be judged by the price deflator index which, I suspect, if not in the short term then certainly in the long term, will be considerably lower than the CPI figure. Over the past few years the implicit price deflator has been running more slowly than the CPI. All in all, the' Government's record relation to roads is absolutely shocking. The Bill that we are now considering, representthe ing as it does massive cutbacks to local goventirely ernment in real terms, will the problem. Yet, it seems that the seriousness of the situation has not dawned on the Government. The honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis), with all the cant pocrisy for which he is known, spokeaboilt road safety in relation to the standards of vehicles. He dismissed out of hand the ,influthe ence that bad roads might have on causing road accidents. He said that, it was arrant nonsense to say that roads are worse now than they were 10 years ago. I wound suggest that he is out of touch with conditions relating to his own constituency, let alone other parts of Australia, if he maintains that sort of fiction. I was at a meeting held in the past few days at which the Minister for Land Transdis- port and Shipping Support ( MrRobert Brown) was present. I remember well that he said: that he did not know whether the roads are worse now than when he left local government in 1980. The honourable member for Throsby said, without any qualification and doubts, that it was arrant nonsense to say that roads were worse now than they were 10 years ago and yet the Minister has said that he is not so sure. Quite frankly, if he had a skerrickof honesty he would admit that roads are very much worse than they were 10 years ago. If the Government does not face up to its responsibility in regard to local Government, which bears the bulk of responsibility for local and arterial roads, then roads will deteriorate even more over the next 10 years.",161
266,Mr KERR ,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"Denison) (11.53)-A peculiarity of this debate has been the comments that Australia's road system is falling apart around our ears, that the road system has been deliberately neglected and that roads are very much worse than they were 10 years ago. However, the reality is that for the six years of the Hawke Government, as compared with the last six years of the Fraser Government, road expenditure has increased by 20 per ccent in real terms. This suggests one of two' things: either that the standard of road construction, maintenance and care exercised by State authorities in building and in maintaining roads has changed dramatically for the worse over the past six years or that case put forward by the Opposition is baseless. The reality is that it is only compound entirely baseless. One has only to look at the facts. Federal, general purpose assistance provided by the Hawke Government to local government is hy30 per cent higher in real terms than that provided by the Fraser Government for the comparable six year period. In, road funding, case is even more clear cut. In that area' the amount of money that has been allocated is devastatingly in favour of the present Government. A'S has been mentioned in this debate, in its last six years the Fraser-Howard Government allocated $163m to Tasmanian roads. In the first six years of the Hawke Government we allocated $328m to the Tasmanian road system. In real terms,if one takes into account inflation and adjusts,. the Hawke Labor Government has allocated 3.5 per cent more to Tasmanian roads in its six years than the Fraser Government did in its last six years. In 1988-89 we allocated $13m to Tasmania's national highways, $18.3m to Tasmanian arterial roads and $13.4m to Tasmanian local roads, which is a total of $45m. In 1988-89 the Hawke Government allocated general revenue of untied grants of $428m to the Tasmanian State Government, which can of course be used for any purpose, including roads. The total amount of money allocated to the State Government over the last six Budgets from 1983-84 to 1988-89 has been $3.1 billion. To local government there has been an allocation in untied grants of $18.5m for 1988-89, and since the Hawke Government came into office the total in untied grants to local governments has been $122m The arrangements that are provided for in the present legislation are to make certain that local government is not disadvantaged by changes that were made at the most recent Premiers Conference-not, in a sense, to alter the formula but to accommodate changes in the structure of capital grants which have been shifted across to the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. That withdrawal of funds from the general pool of funds to the States would not affect the formula and disadvantage local government. These arrangements have been put in place and reflect a commitment by this Government to there being three tiers of government-State, Commonwealth and local. It is a commitment that is not mirrored on the Opposition side. Some months ago, against the express wishes of all local government organisations Australia-wide, the Opposition mounted a scare campaign against referendum proposals that would have recognised the position in the Australian constitutional framework of local government. It is really a piece of political humbug to come into the House and say, 'We defend local government', when it has been demonstrated by action that the previous Government failed to provide for local government to anywhere near the same standard that this Government has done. And when measures are put forward which advantage local government, the Opposition fails to support them. Let us lookÂ· at the case that has been put forward. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran) put forward what would have been in some circumstances an interesting case for spending more money on roads. Take away the implication that he is criticising this Government for spending less, which is a palpably false explanation-take that political humbug out of the equation-and it may be a decent case to put forward that we should be spending more money on roads and putting more money into local government roads. It is a perfectly logical and coherent case to put forward. But is that the Opposition policy? We do not really know. There is no statement on the record about Opposition policy in this area. The former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard), gave the following press conference on 1 December 1988: What is your policy on road funding, are you going to increase them and if so by how much? Answer, Roads will be much better under us. Question, ""Will you be increasing road funds."" Answer, ""We have not made a decision on that."" Question, ""Why not?"" Answer, ""For the simple reason that you can't make a decision on an item like that which is essentially a discretionary budget decision about percentage of funds in isolation from other decisions that you make on the fiscal side of a spending and taxing nature."" Question, ""Isn't Senator Stone on record as saying he would cut them by $\00 million?"" Answer, ""He may be or he may not be. I don't know. But you're asking me what the policy is."" Question, ""Is that policy?"" Answer, ""The policy is that we have not made a decision on the precise quantum."" Question, ""So it's possible you could cut road funding?"" Answer, ""We haven't made a decision."" Question, ""That means it's possible."" Answer, ""We haven't made a decision on the actual quantum. I'm not trying to be clever. I'm just saying we have not made a decision."" Given that position, it is extraordinary humbug for members of the Opposition to come into this chamber and, against a background of fact where there have been real increases in .road funding over the last six years, to criticise this Government for failing to spend sufficiently on roads and not place themselves on the record as to what they would do. It really demonstrates an inability to comprehend the basics of political decency which is that if you seek to criticise, you at least owe an obligation to those you are criticising to put your own position on the record. It really seems to me that we are engaging in some of the cheapest political rhetoric time and time again in this House. Members of the Opposition take the cheap shot, criticise, but fail to put their own policy prescriptions forward so that an informed assessment can be made as to whether the Australian people would be better off under policies that they would advance against those which this Government has implemented. Of course, it is easy and it works for one or two days, a month or six months. Those opposite might accept that it takes a while for oppositions to put forward policy proposals and put packages together that can be subject to public scrutiny. But this has been an ongoing issue of great public concern. It has been an issue which has attracted the attention of the media, motoring organisations and many other organisations in the community. Yet the Opposition persists in a narrow, negative attack without putting its own position on the record. It simply is not good enough and it displays a contempt for the intelligence not only of members in this House but for the general Australian public. In responding to the comments made by the honourable member for Gippsland I simply say this: the record of this Government is strong in terms of its commitment to local government. It has ensured that over the term of its office funding to local government has increased in real terms. Not only has it done that in terms of increasing the general revenues available to local government; it has done so in other structural ways-for example, by subjecting government business enterprises to rating by local governments. This is a very important and welcomed initiative that has had the warm support of local government throughout Australia. TheÂ· Government has also increased funding forÂ· road construction and maintenance quite substantially over the whole term of its period of office and very substantially in my State in particular. It is a particularly important source of funding in Tasmania for the construction and maintenance of the national highway which links Hobart through to the north-west coast and through the major economic roads which are now recognised through the new funding program that has recently been announced. I conclude my remarks by saying that we face a challenge in this House to debate issues in a lively and intelligent way, but it really does debase the currency of debate if all one does is point fingers and criticise without ever coming up with a constructive alternative. And too often that is the currency of this debate in this House. It has been so tonight. I would hope that it is soon within the powers of the Opposition to put forward some spending program, to put some numbers on the figures it would spend in terms of road funding and the whole range of social and welfare programs and health programs. These are initiatives that the Australian public is entitled to know about if it is to cast a judgment in any meaningful way between the competing sides of this political process. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you and the House for the opportunity of making these comments and conclude by saying that in broad terms the measure that is before the House corrects an anomaly. It makes sure that the broad initiatives that the Government has pursued during its term of office are not impaired by an accidental or unintended consequence of different structural changes determined at the Premiers Conference and ensures that local government has a reasonable share of the economic cake so that councils can meet the very important programs that local government is devoted to across Australia. Friday, 26 May 1989",161
267,Mr ANDREW ,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"Wakefield) (12.06 a.m.)We are debating tonight at this very late hour in this almost empty chamber the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 1989. The Bill results from changes to the general purpose payments to the States proposed at the recent Premiers Conference which would have affected the formula for local government payments. As these changes would have adversely burdened local government, an amount to partially compensate is included in this Bill. As the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran) said in his opening remarks, the legislation is not opposed. As he also said, the figure of $671m is, we recognise, an increase of 2.8 per cent, but it should not be forgotten that this is way below the consumer price index increase of 6.9 per cent. It is an increase of $18.5m on the 1988-89 grant, but a loss in real terms of 3.8 per cent. While the Bill is not opposed and while it is essential for local governing authorities across the nation, it is not good news for local government. I want to quote from the news release that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) had the audacity to make available to the public when this legislation was proposed in the House. He said: Local government will receive an extra $18.5m in 1988-89 under Federal funding arrangements announced today. The Minister said the decision on Local Government funding took account of the Commonwealth assistance to the states, agreed to at yesterday's Premiers conference. ""The Federal Government's recent decision to allow local Government authorities to levy rates and charges on Telecom and Australia Post properties, and the increased funding it will now receive in general purpose grants, mean that Local Government will be better off by about $47m in 1989-90,"" Senator Ray said. He said this reflected the Federal Government recognition of the special needs, and the contribution of Local Government. To pick up a comment constantly used by the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Kerr), may I say relative to the Minister's news release, humbug. The truth is that local government was once funded under a personal income tax sharing initiative of 2 per cent, which meant that it received 2 per cent of the personal income tax revenue in real terms. If one looks at the figure proposed for 1988-89, local government will receive as a proportion of personal income tax 1.5 per cent-Mr Jenkins-It is 1.55.",163
268,Mr ANDREW,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"I am happy to add any number of additional figures. It matters not whether it is 1.55 or 1.5 as I stated. It nonetheless is way below the 2 per cent proposed for local government and received by local government in the early 1970s. General purpose assistance to local government in 1982-83 was $424.5m and in 1989-90, as we have heard time and time again in this debate, it will be $671m-a fall, I repeat again, of 3.8 per cent on last year's figure. That is hardly good news for local government. The irony is that, of all the institutions constantly castigated in this House, the most derided and the most held upÂ· for scorn is inevitably big business. Even we on this side of the House, recognising the attitudes that Australians take to tall poppies, have .understood some of the criticism levelled at big business. This Government has claimed to be the very Government that encourages small business, but it is the Government that has failed to deliver, to encourage the most accountable form of government in Australia. It has failed during its entire term of office to encourage local government in any form. Given the derision that the Government currently dishes out to big business, all of this sits rather uncomfortably with the constant friendship of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) with the key big business personalities in the nation. This is the Government which, having claimed to be the friends of small business, has most successfully fostered and encouraged the biggest of all big business, Federal government and centralised power. Anyone listening to the debate in this House could be forgiven for thinking that people occupying seats of power in Canberra suppose that all wisdom has been vested in this chamber or, even more pertinently, that all wisdom has been vested in the Government. The attitude of State governments to local government has frequently been no better. Relative to this Bill and relative to the grants we are currently considering, Australia needs a 'small is beautiful' syndrome and no form of government reflects such a philosophy better than local government. Out of the three tiers of government in Australia-local government, State government and Federal government-local government can claim to be an effective deliverer of service and an efficient and accountable form of administration. The elected members of local government, as the shadow Minister presently in the House knows better than anybody else, are the very people who have to live with their constituents, to meet them day by day in the front bar, in business, the supermarket or in the silo queue waiting for the grain to be unloaded. The members of local government are the people who know what the constituents feel and want most acutely. We on this side of the chamber say that the resource of local government is a public resource that will be efficiently used, othermember wise the people responsible for its use be most quickly called to account. It is local government that is the most likely courage the use of local contractors in electorates such as mine and that of the honourable member of O'Connor ( Mr statistics Tuckey), who is at the table. Frankly, what local government needs most, apart from tralia additional Federal government funding, is sort of policy that the coalition has put gether for industrial relations, a policy which would allow employers and employees to enter into contracts about the way a job to be done. If we are about making the taxpayers' dollar go further, we should be about seeing that additional taxpayers' doldollars lars find their way into local government. As has been mentioned by the honourable member for Gippsland and picked up by the honourable member for Denison, nowhere has this been more clearly illustrated than road funding and road construction. The honourable member for Gippsland was rightly critical of the low base of funding available point. for road construction out of the fuel excise. But all that is needed to address that is real political will. I have heard the honourby able member for O'Connor, in speeches in my electorate, make the point that any govrates ernment that is prepared to deliver services efficiently in the major government expendiroad ture areas such as defence, welfare, educaneeds tion and health will have available to it surplus funds ""to pour into local government so that local government can go about realgovernment istically reconstructing Australia's deterioratspend ing road network. For all that has been said about road expenditure and for all that may be said about the Bill currently being debated in this House, we ought to recognise at least the struction. figures provided in the debate earlier today by the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr MCArthur), who read into the record the answer he had received from the Minisin ter to a question on notice. The honourable members for Corangamite pointed out the Minister's own figures for Federal road assistance programs from 1980-81 until the present day pointed to a fall in road funding. If I could use the figures for 1987-88 and 1988-89 to take up the very point mischievously misrepresented by the honourable for Denison, I point out that in real will terms in 1987-88 the funding for Federal roads assistance programs was $1.325m and to enwill be $1.221m in 1988-89. It is too easy for the honourable member for Denison to come in here with a set of that merely suit his own purpose and fail to recognise what the rest of Ausis saying-that is, that money currently the being made available for roads is not only toinadequate for our road construction program but also inadequate to maintain existing Australian roads. The honourable member is for Lyne ( Mr Cowan), who is about to participate in this debate, has put together a graph which graphically illustrates the fall in available for road construction from 1925 to 1990. It is a graphic illustration of precisely what is happening to road construction in Australia. The honourable member for Denison has been anxious to claim that in the Opposition's case on road funding is baseless. The honourable member for Denison has selectively used statistics to make that I want to restate the case that is being a uttered not only by the Opposition but also motoring organisations around Australia and by electors in everyone of the electoaround Australia, including yours, Mr Deputy Speaker. The simple case is that funding is currently inadequate and to be addressed. The Bills before the House fail to recognise the needs of local government and the opportunity that local offers to any administration to effectively taxpayers' or ratepayers' dollars. We are not opposed to them, but we are disappointed that they fail to recognise the essential role local government can play in delivering services and providing road conMONICA",164
269,Mr JENKINS ,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"Scullin) (12.17 a.m. ) - It is of interest that in this debate about local government financial assistance much of the debate has centred on the question of road .funding. While I understand the reason why people have turned to. this emotive debate on road funding, it is sad that in this week when there was such an important local government conference in Canberra-the conference of the Institute of Municipal Management-that people might get the impression that here in Canberra, the seat of the Federal Government, we think the three Rs prevail in local government, the three Rs being rates, rubbish and roads. Local government Australia wide has matured. I can understand that roads-the construction and maintenance of roads and the construction of bridges-is still a fundamental and important aspect of the work of local government. We have to recognise that local government has a wider role, one that goes much beyond servicing properties. It is concerned about many aspects of human services and a whole host of other projects. . In talking to the debate on road funding we must get back to the point raised by my colleague the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Kerr) and ignored by those opposite. We must have this question answered, not only for road funding but for many other areas. What would the Opposition do? The honourable member for Denison indicated the attitude of the previous Leader of the Opposition, the honourable meiriber for Bennelong ( Mr Howard). When questioned; the former leader avoided answering specifically whether road funding would be improved. I think that all honourable members opposite know that if there were .a coalition led GoverI1m:c;\nt, savage spending cuts would be entered into and that in that scenario there would be no' vestige of the increases hinted at in the contributions of those opposite. I am pleased to be able to speak in this debate. I spoke on this matter back in 1986. The then Minister for Local Government, the honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren), indicated in his second reading speech that the Government would be seeking to distribute funds amongst local governments and to place greater emphasis on a need basis for funding. I always felt that success of this legislation could quite easily be proved by the way in which it was translated intoÂ· increased funding for municipalities in an electorate such as Scullin. For a number of reasons, the municipalities in the electorate of Scullin can be considered to be disadvantaged. If one looks at the increase in the untied grants to those municipalities one sees that what was intended by the legislation has occurred. That is because of the work of the Victorian Grants Commission, which has had a very difficult task in juggling this funding within the parameters set and within the phasing-in period of the original legislation. It has had ,to recognise that if the funding of some of the smaller municipalities dropped, they would be devastated and would have to be protected. The City of Broadmeadows and Whittlesea-the Shire of Whittlesea, back in 1986-87-have received dramatic increases in funding since 1986-8'7. In 1986-87 Broadmeadows received a little over $3m and in the two succeeding years, had increases of 20 per cent and 60 per cent. Whittlesea has had an increase from $1.89m to $2.78m in 1988-89-increases of 31 per cent and 11 per cent. They are not the sort of increase that we had under previous legislation. They are not the sort of increases that recognise the particular difficulties experienced by those municipalities. It is now recognised that the growth rate is placing a great strain on the finances of those councils. I know, by the way the provisions of the legislation have been used, that those two councils are pleased with the result. That is not to say that they do not grumble. I take the point made by the honourable member for Wakefield( Mr Andrew) that this, perhaps in the terms of overall funding, might not be considered as a good news story. I do ' not think that the Premiers thought that what they were told after they left Canberra after the Premiers' Conference was a good news story, but it is part of the reality in which those hard decisions have to been made. In fact, all three spheres of Govern-. ment have had to share the burden. This legislation is a recognition that by some form of artificial alteration of the system local government should not be untowardly disadvantaged. As was outlined earlier in the debate, recognition was given to the elements of change which would have disadvantaged local government. Whilst it is true-against the consumer price index increases and therefore in real terms-that there has been a decrease in funding to local government, by comparison with what the States received, there has been protection of local government's position. There must also be recognition that outside the grants that will be received under this legislation, due the change in policies for government business enterprises and the fact that they are now liable to rates, there is likely to be a flow-on to local government of $47m. The importance of mentioning that figure in this debate is that for several months there has been a great debate among local governments and a great deal of consultation between local governments and the Federal Government because of a flagged intent to put in place the .so-called c1awback. I, along with many of my. colleagues, put to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) a view that in practice the way that clawback was to be put in place would disadvantage to too great an extent too many local government authorities. in Australia. The Government is to be congratulated that after the consultation, after the due process and proper debate, it was decided not to go ahead with the c1awback provision. That indicated that, contrary to what has been suggested, this Government takes local government seriously. This is not justa patronising attitude that it has ha9 toward local government. I have heard in this debate the reference to tiers of government. I was a bit disappointed that I heard that reference . from both sides of the chamber. As somebody who was involved in local government as' a councillor, I always try to emphasise that in such circumstances we talk about spheres of government because that is a better term fot proper relationship between the three areas. If honourable members can imagine spheres, they can imagine interlocking and overlapping interests. Those overlapping interests can involve the three spheres or any combination of two. That is important. Local government can take advantage of the arrangements and the hostÂ· of programs that the Federal Government has on a tied basis. There are a host of options, depending on the policy area or the particular circumstance. There is great flexibility in the way that we can approach particular problems. But I think it is important that we recognise the role of local government and that we encourage it. I amÂ·Â· disappointed that there was some suggestion that we are not encouraging local government. That is a nonsense. In these hard times we have tried to impress to upon local governments that they are welcome. It was not through the fault of this Government that the proposal put to the Australian peopleÂ· to change the Australian Constitution to recognise local government failed. It is perhaps shameful that those on the opposite side of the chamber were involved in the campaign that ended in that proposal not being carried. Because of the early hour of the morning, it is probaply appropriate that. I conclude my remarks. There is much that I would like to say about local government. Criticisms can rightly be made. There needs to be a rec,ognition of the trust that is put in local government, whiCh represents its communities at the grassroots level. The guarantees that have been put in place by this type of local governmerit financial assistance legislation mean that by comparison with the State governments, local government can have some idea of the value of the funding. I commend the legislation to the House.",165
270,Mr COWAN ,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"Lyne) (12.30 a.m.)-The Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill focuses on roads within Australia. I am pleased that, as the member for Scullin ( Mr Jenkins) said, it also directs attention to local government in Australia in general and its importance to the nation. I have served in local government for quite a few terms and I appreciate the attention that aldermen and councillors give to their responsibilities in their 'areas. There is a saying that local government is the bread and butter of the governmental scene in Australia because it is close to the people, understands the problems and attends to its various responsibilities. The issues might appear to us to be minor but they are very important. Mr Nehl-They. do it very well, too.",167
271,Mr COWAN,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"I feel that they do it very well, too. When a constituent comes to me and seeks advice about the condition of a road or culvert I often feel that that matter may be of more concern to that person than some other more important issue that is facing the nation. We can understand that, because that issue may affect the livelihood of that person or the safety of his family. We must appreciate that many demands are placed on local government by both the Commonwealth and the States, and these include social security, health and other measures that are so important to local communities. Whilst we may assist financially, nevertheless we expect local authorities to dig deeply into their pockets to carry out their duties satisfactorily. As time goes by councils and shires throughout Australia are given added responsibility. We must appreciate that the bulk of the money that is spent on roads and other services in council areas is taken from council ratepayers. I can cite figures in that regard that appertain to New South Wales. Local government is responsible for 162,000 kilometres of roads, or 83 per cent of the roads in that State; the State Government is responsible for 32,000 kilometres, or 16.5 per cent; and the Federal Government is responsible for 1,345 kilometres, or 0.69 per cent. I emphasise those figures, because they show clearly,that local government has by far the , greatest responsibility for road maintenance and construction. I also refer to, the rural and urban local road system, which is terribly important not only in country areas, such as in the electorates of the honourable member for Hume ( Mr Fife) and the honourable member for Cowper ( Mr Nehl) and in my electorate, but also to metropolitan councils. I believe that today city councils emphasise that point. It is interesting to note from the figures that local councils are responsible for 85 per cent of the roads within Australia, the 'States are responsible for 13.2 per cent and the Commonwealth is responsible for 2 per cent. That gives some idea of where the responsibility basically lies. The member for Cowper ( Mr Nehl) spoke earlier about the Pacific Highway and other national arterial and ordinary arterial roads. Whilst they are terribly important, the roads that really matter to ordinary Australians are the ones on whicn their children go to school, on which they go to town to do their shopping, and on which they send their produce to market-the rural local roads 'and the urban 'local road. These are the roads in respect of which this legislation is terribly important. The available funds are being increased by only something like 2 per cent. The $18m about which we are speaking represents an increase of a little over 2 per cent. When one looks at the consumer price index one appreciates that, in real money terms, the councils are receiving less and less. II). the same way, as an honourable member said earlier, the States and local government are now getting 32 per cent less than they were getting five to six years ago. It is all very well for the Minister to say, 'Look, we are I spending $4 billion-odd a year on roads in Australia'. It is not the Commonwealth that is supplying all that money. The Commonwealth is supplying only $1,215.5m under the land transport scheme and that is not a lot of money in the context of total road expenditure. As I have pointed out to the House, responsibility for this rests with local government generally. There is no point in our trying to fool the Australian motorist. It would not be possible to find in any country today a more highly taxed person than the family car owner in Australia. He has to meet Commonwealth import duty, other Common-ealth taxes and registration fees. In addition, almost half the cost of the petrol that he puts in his tank goes to the Commonwealth. The average car in Australia holds $36 worth, of fuel. The Commonwealth collects 22.8c per litre-almost half the cost of a litre of fuel. Mr Nehl-It is far too much.",167
272,Mr COWAN,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"It is far too much. The average Australian would not mind that if the money were but back, into roads, to prevent loss of life and injury and the tremendous expense in hospitalisation and damage. Honourable members on both sides of this House have a great responsibility to recognise that roads are a very great problem. Like other members, I will always emphasise that we have a responsibility, when the opportunity arises, to address ourselves to this problem. The Australian motorist knows that he contributes $6.5 billion a year to Federal Government revenue, and that. only $1.2 billion is retl,lrned. This concerns people very deeply. We heard in this House just this week that substandard roads are estimated to add $160 a year to the family grocery bill because of high freight charges. ' Earlier this evening the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Kim) quoted statements that had been made by the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) when he was Leader of .the Opposition. This was some time ago, and I appreciate that the honourable member for Bennelong waS not in a position to commit the Opposition to a particular expenditure on roads, though we have said that we will maintain and increase funding in this area. I know what the honourable member for Bennelong had in mind at that time. Unfortunately, it is what I still have in mind. Maybe the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) also has it in mind. I refer to the fact that our economy is such that we just cannot afford any more Government expenditure. We know that if we go into government the Treasurer of the day and, I am sure, the Minister for Finance will say in Cabinet and in the party room-MONICA",168

House adjourned at 12.42 a.m. (Friday) NA The following notices were given: Mr Kerr to move That this House (I) accepts responsibility for its contribution to development of the existing social milieu within the Australian Public Service which has been variously described in Public Servi!-!e Cpmmission' reports as ""toxic, fear-based, pathological, repressive, reactive paternalistic and neurotic"" to the extent that some APS departments are seen as presenting the same manic depressive mental disorder symptoms which individuals present and . (2) acknowledges that the manner in which Parliament seeks to maintain principles of fairness, impartiality, probity and public accountability is too often characterised by the use of its powers to seek punishment of those who are seen to have made mistakes, regardless of any consideration of risks involved, rather than to acknowledge and reward success. (3) notes that this hyper-critical approach is at variance with contemporary personnel man. agement practices, and; (4) acknowledges the serious efforts currently being made to implement improved management practices in the public sector and resolves to follow that lead by hencewith adopting a co-operative and constructive approach to its management of the Australian Public Service.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Department of Defence: Homes (Question No. 1679) Mr Smith asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) How many Defence Department homes in each State or Territory have been unoccupied for more than three months during 1988-89. (2) How many of these homes will be occupied by Defence personnel in 1988-89. (3) How many Defence Department homes in each State or Territory are no longer needed. (4) What is the average market value of the homes that are no longer needed. (5) Will the titles to homes no longer needed be transferred to the States or Territories; if so, when. Mr Simmons-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The number of houses unoccupied for three months or more during the period 1 July 1988 to I March 1989 was: NSW Vic. Qld. WA SA . Tas. ACT NT. Total (2) 1,059 of the unoccupied houses have or will be reoccupied during 1988-89. These houses were unoccupied because the were awaiting maintenance, or awaiting occupancy by a new tenant.

Department of Employment, Education and Training: Security Checks of Staff (Question No. 1687) Mr John Scott asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) Does the Minister's Department and any authority responsible to the Minister have any requirement to conduct security checks of its staff; if so, are security checks carried out by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). (2) If security checks are required and are not undertaken by ASIO, (a) by whom are they carried out and (b) does a review procedure equivalent to that contained in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act apply to such checks; if not, why not. 436 Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honour523 able member's question is as follows: 339 140 (I) My Department does have a requirement to 121 conduct security checks of people selected for or 20 who occupy Designated Security Assessment Posi36 tions. ASIO are involved in the assessment process 95 in conjunction with the Department's Security Officer. There is no requirement for similar checks within 1,710 authorities of the Employment, Education and Training portfolio. (2) Not applicable. Sale of Weapons (Question No. 1720) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 5 April 1989: 166 (I) Is it a fact that the sale of surplus light 255 weapons currently being undertaken by the Depart41 ment of Administrative Services on behalf of his 74 Department involves types of weapons which previ96 ously have been listed as reserve stock. 3 (2) Are the weapons being sold coming from the 16 reserve stock; if so, is the reserve stock being re651 placed by more up-to-date weapons. (3) If the weapons being sold are coming from the reserve stock and are not being replaced, why are they being allowed to be sold overseas.",169
281,Mr BEAZLEY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 7; (I) The current sale of the family of .303 weapons involves those weapons that were removed from the Army inventory in the early 1960's and placed in reserve stock. Their age, condition, and military effectiveness, now render them unsuitable for military service. (2) The .303 weapons are being progressively replaced in the reserve stock by the more modern LI A 1-7.62mm family of weapons. In turn, the 7.62mm weapons are being progressively replaced by the AUG-Steyr 5.56mm weapon under the Small Arms Replacement Project. (3) The sale of the .303 weapons at this stage is necessary to ensure sufficient secure storage space is available to accommodate their replacement.",171
