54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"The facts are that the question of the re-appointment of Sir George Eeid was under discussion at the time of the elections, and for some time prior to that, but we deemed it to be our duty to make no re-appointment during the elections. We thought it fair to this House, and to the country, that that appointment, should be made by a Government who had established themselves in the confidence of the country by the vote of the people. In those circumstances we refrained from making the appointment.",7

Three days after the general elections, when the late Government received notice to quit, a minute was written with the apparent objecb of committing the present Government to the re-appointment of Sir George Reid.

That is the proper constibutional course bo in regard to all these high appointments. If we had been actuated by the motives suggested by the Assistant Minister o?

If we had had prompthonorable ing us the motives that came out in the bitter speech we have had from the sistant Minister today, we would have taken good care to make the appoint of ment secure, and put the matter out the reach of the present Minister or of those who are talking in the same way sorry to believe anything else. today ?",9

79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,O r before to tliem; because the matter arose close on the elections. Bub for following a proper constitutional course we are beset on every hand by the gibes and jeers of honthere orable members opposite. I suppose that we must never hope to have credit given to us for any worthy motives. Politics are falling to a contemptible level when we hear this sort of thing taking place. I call attention to a constant stream of interjections that have been coming from the honourable member for Brisbane reflecting on me ever since I have risen to,9
80,Mr SPEAKER,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,As the honourable and member has called attention to them. I ask honourable members to cease these conAustinuous interjections. An honourable matniember speaking on the motion for adjournment has only a limited time in which to say what he has to say. I ask the honourable members to refrain as far as possible from inberjecting.,9
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"I inbend to say very little, as I propose to leave it to I the Minister formerly in charge of The the Department to make a statethe ment to the House; but I do say during the whole of the connot sideration of this matter in Cabinet the name of no other person was suggested for the office of High Commissioner, nor was there any suggestion in regard to the filling of the position otherwise than by the re-appointment of Sir take George Reid. That genbleman possessed the fullest confidence of the late Government, as, I believe, he possesses the fullest confidence of the whole of the people the of Australia; notwithstanding some members' interjections, and notwithstanding some bitter speeches that Ashave been made, I would fain believe that he possesses the confidence generally honourable members on both sides of of this House. At any rate, that is my imany pression at the moment. I should be Sir George Reid has been a good and faithful to Australia, and has done his duty by this country as well as any public servant could do it , and he well deserves re-appointinenb for a substantial period at the hands of this present GoHowever, Minisbers have do. taken bheir course, and re-appointed him for twelve months, a course which is not calculated to inspire him with the desire do his best. I think that a man ought to feel secure in that position. If he is to do his duty properly by this country lie should feel secure in his tenure. If is any doubt about the matter, terminating the appointment would be better than keeping Sir George Reid on, not knowing what his fate is to be.",9
82,Mr FENTON,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,The whole of this debate will be published in the London papers on Monday.,10
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"Then I hope that what the Minister has said about the inatter will jireface the report, and the reason for the debate will then be understood. The Assistant Minister says that there was a minute put upon the file after the election. Does not the Assistant Minister know sufficient of these matters to know that it was the usual course to take? The proper thing is for the retiring Minister to leave minutes for the benefit of the incoming Minister concerning all big current questions being considered in the Department.",10
84,Mr MAHON,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,The suspicious thing is,10
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"That course is invariably taken, because if there is to be continuity in administration it is proper anc necessary that it should be done. 1",10
86,Mr MAHON,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,The curious thing about the matter is that it was the first mention of the three or five years that I could find in the papers.,10
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"What is there in that fact? It clearly proves, and always proves to any one but those with the suspicious minds of honourable members",10
88,Mr SPEAKER,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,The honourable member must withdraw that statement.,10
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,It was a phrase used by the Assistant Minister.,10
90,Mr SPEAKER,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"I heard the Assistant Minister use the word ""curious"": but if he did make use of the word "" suspicious "" he must withdraw it - A",10
91,Mr MAHON,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,Certainl y I withdraw the word if I did use it .,10
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"What the minute referred to clearly shows is that the last Cabinet had been considering whether the re-appointment of Sir George Reid, when it was made, should be for three years 'or five years. It shows nothing more. Ib was the proper thing to leave upon the papers of the Department a minute from the outgoing Minister, telling the incoming Minister what was in his mind regarding this high and responsible appointment, but the Assistant Minister sees in this action of his predecessor in extending this courtesy, and in following this constitutional propriety, some deep-laid political plot. By making these innuendoes and statements today the Assistant Minister is simply showing the suspicious character of his own mind. It would be very much better if he rid his mind of all such things. The outgoing Government did its duty by this counbry and by this House, and left to its successors, as it was entitled to do in the circumstances, the duty and privilege of making this high appointment for a further term. That is all there is in the matter. The Assistant Minister cannot make more of it , no matter how he rummages among the papers. With this statement. I leave the matter. I think that it is due to the House that we should hear the Minister in charge of the Department.",10
93,Mr FINLAYSON,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"The Leader of the Opposition made a special reference to me, complaining about my interjections. Am I in order in making a personal explanation ?",10
94,Mr SPEAKER,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"I cannot accept the honourable member's remarks as a personal explanation. The honourable member for Parramatta appealed for silence, and I asked the House to cease interjecting.",10
95,Mr FINLAYSON,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"Brisbane) [11.13]. ---The honourable member for Parramatta in his speech said that our political conduct was getting to a contemptible level, and I interjected that he should be the best judge of his own political level. If the honourable member was more careful in regard to suggestions of unfair or unworthy conduct on the part of others he would not lay himself open to charges of that character.",10
96,Dr MALONEY,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"Melbourne) [11.14]. s this debate has arisen upon a question submitted by me, it is only right that I should make some explanation. I met a dear friend of Sir George Reid, and a dear friend of mine, though he is opposed to me in politics, and he asked me, "" Have Sir George Reid's friends turned him down, seeing that they did not appoint him? "" I said that I could not say. Whereupon he said, "" I believe that they have done so. Will you ask the question ? "" It is for this reason I put the question. I yield to no man in my friendship to Sir George Reid. I dare say thab if our hearts could be opened and read, it would be found that I am a better friend of his than even some who were in the late Ministry. When the Leader of the Opposition was speaking I interjected that Sir George Reid had come out here last year. He returned to England early in March. I did not interject because of any desire to puzzle the Leader of the Opposition. I think the late Government treated Sir George Reid infamously. Mr SPEAKER,-The honourable member must withdraw that remark.",10
97,Dr MALONEY,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,I shall withdraw it and say that I think the late Government did not treat him properly. Mr JosErii COO.K - Why ; because we did not re-appoint him twelve months before his original appointment would expire ?,11
98,Dr MALONEY,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"It is all fudge for the right honourable member to suggest that the late Government did not reappoint Sir George Reid because they were on the verge of an election. Did they decline for the same reason to make appointments to the Inter-State Commission? Did they not appoint two ""beauties"" to that Oommission?",11
99,Mr SPEAKER,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,Order . To describe any act of the House or the Government in such language must tend to lower the dignity of the House. I ask honourable members to refrain from anything that will injure the reputation of the Parliament.,11
100,Dr MALONEY,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"If you, Mr Speaker, think that the use of such an expression is calculated to injure the reputation of the House, then I shall withdraw it, and say that it was most unwise for the Leader of the Opposition to advance the argument that he and his Attorney-General were busy preparing for the approaching election, and therefore did not take action to re-appoint Sir George Reid, seeing that they did not hesitate in like circumstances to appoint the Inter-State Commissioners.",11
101,Mr RODGERS,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,But that was just after an election had taken place.,11
102,Dr MALONEY,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"And Sir George Reid visited Australia last year, shortly ;ifter a general election.",11
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"But his term of office had not expired. It will not expire until, I think, January next.",11
104,Dr MALONEY,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"The right honourable member has been too long in politics not to know that, in connection with such important offices, it is usual to make a re-appointment, or, at any rate, to announce the decision of the Government some months before the date on which the original appointment would expire.",11
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,Quite so.,11
106,Dr MALONEY,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"I shall communicate with the High Commissioner on the subject, but my impression certainly is that the late Government turned him down on the occasion of his visit to Australia last year, and treated him very badly. "" Mr Glynn (Angas) [11.18] - It is with regret that I find it necessary to discuss this matter in the House, since I do not know to what extent communications which have passed between the High Commissioner and myself are confidential. I have received correspondence from him, and have also had conversations with him, for-1 think it is the duty of a Minister, quite independently of more official matters, to have many chats with the oflicers of his department. _ So far as my memory serves me, the position is that Sir George Reid visited Australia last - year, the Government which wo succeeded having given him permission to come. I confirmed that permission, and he came out on a trip which was originally suggested to him by family considerations. While he was here we discussed various matters. He thought that it would be well to renew his familiarity with some of the aspects of Australian life, and he therefore extended beyond the limits of his original intention his tour throughout Australia. Just before leaving for England he spoke to me about his re-appointmenfc, and I think it is due to the House that I should say something about the matter. Sir George Reid wrote me a letter, on 3rd February last, and as it is not marked "" private,"" I think I may quote from it. After he had mentioned that the result of his trip to the Continent had been absolutely satisfactory he referred to his tenure of office, and went on to sayAt the same time. I wish to assure the Government that my own mind is entirely in harmony with the spirit of the Act, and that I should only continue to hold the office so long as I could continue to do so with credit to myself and advantage to the Commonwealth. He was explaining to me, for guidance as to future arrangements, that he thought he ought to have an early intimation as to whether his re-appointment was probable. I think that I had an. informal chat - with one or two of my colleagues on the subject, and came to the conclusion that it would be rather premature at that time to make a re-appointment, and so to forestall any decision of the Ministry during the nine or ten months which would elapse before the original appointment expired. I told Sir George Reid that I thought I ought to mention the matter to the Cabinet, because I considered that he should receive au assurance as to his position four or months before his appointment expired. He was enjoying an income of over ยฃ4,000 a year when he took office as High Commissioner, so that he made a big sacrifice in accepting the appointment. He is now, 1 think, about sixty-seven or sixty-eight years of age, and if he came back to Australia it would be a very difficult matter for him to pick up again that practice which his abilities titled him to command at the time he left here. He bas occupied a position of distinction in England; he has been n big public man, and if he returned to the Bar here he could hardly hope to realise the income he enjoyed at the time of his departure. These are considerations which ought to weigh with us regarding Sir George Reid's re-appointment, and while I thought that we ought not, as a rule, to make a re-appointment of such duration as to give rise to sumption that there was only one man for the position, I considered that in his case the circumstances were very exceptional. I thought that Sir George Reid was eminently fitted for the office. He had discharged his duties excellently, and, in the circumstances, I considered that he should have a renewal of his appointment for some period to be determined by the Cabinet.",11

109,Mr JH CATTS,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,Shoul d not that letter be on the file?,12
110,Mr GLYNN,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"I think not. Everyany thing that is relevant, or official, is further question. on the file. This was a personal letter addressed to me. I assured Sir George Reid, after I had menperfectly tioned the matter informally to my coland leagues, that it was too soon to come to any settlement on the question of his reappointment. About the same time, in answer to a question put to me in the House by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie as to whether Sir George Reid had asked for an increase of salary, or for re-appointment, I said that the matter of re-appointment and of the adequacy of his allowance for expenses was under consideration, and that I believed the High Commissioner should five receive fair notice of what his position would be. I did not go beyond that. After an informal chat with my colleagues I assured Sir George Reid that my conviction was that he would be re-appointed. I could not say exactly for what term, but I said that my feeling was that the only inatter to be settled at a Cabinet meeting some months later was whether his re-appointment should be for three or enfive years. The dockets will show, I think, that Sir George Reid wrote to me recapitulating the fact that I had told him that the question to be determined, in my opinion, was what ought to be the duration of his re-appointment-whethe r it should be for three or for five years. There was a letter written by him to me in April last, which I can show the Minister, and I think there is a copy of it on the file, in which this statement is made. Circumstances octhe ascurred to prevent the re-appointment being made. I , personally, would sooner he had been re-appointed at once; but the dissolution took place, the war broke out, and it was difficult to get a full Cabinet meeting. I raised the matter in Cabinets, but there was not a full meeting, and soon after we went out of office. In order that Sir George Reid, pending the determination of the duration of his term, should not be prejudiced, I wrote to him, about June or July last, setting out what the facts were, and telling him that he might act on the assurance that he would be continued in office for at least a year, - pending the settlement of the other ques",12

We went out of office, I thought it was due to Sir George Reid, and to otlier omcers whose appointments had not been confirmed, that the intention of Ministers should be recorded. I therefore wrote out a statement of the position before 1 lef t office. not to forestall the decision of Ministers, but merely to record what I knew was only partly recorded on the files. I did this with regard to other appointments. There was, for instance, the question of the appointment of au Administrator of Norfolk Island, which had not been absolutely settled. The re-appointment of Mr Murphy had not been absolutely settled, and I took the same steps with regard to him. Instead of making these appointments ourselves, as we were going out of office we left them open, but placed on record what Ave sliould have done had we remained in office.",12

122,Mr HIGGFS,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"Capricornia) [11.34] There seems to be a good deal of makebelieve this morning about the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues. One would get the impression that they were engaged in a high-minded endeavour to do the best possible for Australia in regard to this appointment, bub it seems to me that they are exbremely anxious lest the Government should follow the example that has been set by Liberal parties at all times. Sir George Reid's appointment was, without doubt, a political appointment. I do not agree with the ex-Prime Minisber that it is impossible to find in Australia a man who can carry out the duties of the High Commissioner so well as does Sir George Reid, who, afber all, is only a very clever after-dinner speaker. I do nob think that the present High Commissioner fills the position as the business people of Australia would like it to be filled. Mr FOWLER,-He has made a very good impression at Home generally.",14
123,Mr SAMPSON,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,Is it a correcb thing to canvass the merits of the High Commissioner in this way ?,14
124,Mr HIGGS,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"The Leader of the Opposition is responsible for the discussion. He poinbed out the virtues of Sir George Reid, and thus raised the question, though he assumes a righteous indignation, asserting that we have forced him to take that course. The ex-Minister of External Affairs was evidently thoroughly well prepared ' to discuss the question at the earliest possible moment, because he produced quite a file of correspondence. How did he happen to have that correspondence ready in his pocket ?",14

126,Mr HIGGS,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"I suppose we may take it it was by accident; and, no doubt, most of us carry a lot of correspondence in our pockets. It is said that the contents of a man's pockets are a pretty good indication of the state of his brain, but I should not like my brain bo be gauged by the amount or the diversified character of the correspondence which I carry. Some explanation is certainly required of why the ex-Minisber of External Affairs, if he was "" caught on the hop,"" happened to have so many of Sir George Reid's letters witli liim. It seems to me that there has been a deliberate attempt on the part of the members of the Opposition to raise the question at the very earliest moment with a view to endeavouring to secure Sir George Reid in his position, because of the fact bhat they have been "" caught on the hop,"" as the previous Fisher Ministry was in regard to the Inter-State Commission.",14

128,Mr HIGGS,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"Au y one would think that honourable members opposite had been suddenly informed of something of which they were not previously aware, although they have themselves been saying the same thing for months past. The previous Fisher Government made a great mistake in not appointing the Inter-State Commission before they left office.

All the numerous questions from the Opposition are with the definite purpose of preventing the present Government appointing a High Commissioner in sympathy with their administration and policy.",14
135,Mr MASSYGREENE,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,Then it is intended to do that?,15
136,Mr HIGGS,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"I know nothing about the matter, but I hope so.",15
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,How is it that the honourable member is so ready and well informed ?,15
138,Mr HIGGS,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"I have observed, and it was not necessary for me to search through my files of correspondence in order to be able to discuss a matter that is one of common knowledge. What did honourable members do when in office in regard to the Inter-State Commission? Those high-minded gentlemen, who say that it is wrong to appoint a man of your own party to any position, did not give the present Attorney-General a seat on the Inter-State Commission, and thus accord to the great Labour party some representation on so important a body. There is no doubt that the present Attorney-General is a man perfectly well fitted for such a position, but the late Government ran to the Victorian Parliament, and selected a man of independent mind, who was a bit of a trouble to the honourable member for Balaclava. Here I may say that I think the honourable member for Flinders had a good deal to do with that appointment. The Argus and other Liberal newspapers, of course, had much to say about the qualifications of a certain gentleman for the position; and tainly no one would deny the business capacity and integrity of that gentleman. But, nevertheless, it was a political pointment.",15
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,I believe that up to the time of his appointment no mention of his name had been made publicly.,15

When the Leader of the Opposition was "" cornered "" he had to admit that Sir George Reid had written to the ex-Minister of External Affairs, and that the matter had been considered in Cabinet. I think members of the Opposition ought-to give up their endeavour to mislead the public in such a manner. However, I hope that the Government will not be deterred by any questions that may be raised by members of the Opposition, or any motions for adjournment, from doing what they consider to be their duty in this or any other matter.",15
145,Mr KELLY,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"Wentworth) [11.44] So far as I can gather from the remarks of my amusing and esteemed friend, the honourable member for Capricornia, the idea he seeks to place before the House is that it is a very proper thing for the Government to make party appointments; and he concluded his remarks by saying that he hoped the present Government would not be induced, by anything the Opposition might do, to make the re-appointment of Sir George Reid for a longer period than that on which they had determined. When the question of the appointcerment of a High Commissioner was first before Australia, the name of my distinguished and gifted friend, the honourable apmember for Capricornia, Avas one of those assiduously placed in front as a suitable competitor for the office.",15

If the honourable member still desires the position, we may, in the place of the prosaic and dull, and somewhat stupid, afterdinner speeches of Sir George Eeid, have all the w it and eloquence of the honourable member at the disposal of the Australian people. I urge on the Government that the High Commissioner will be valuable or not according to the confidence which those at the other end of the world have in him. It does not matter how gifted, how able, and how well fitted for his work he may be, if he is held by the Britisli people not to be persona grata to the Australian people, he cannot give his true value to the Commonwealth. ask honourable members, therefore, to see that Sir George Reid is supported in the very able services that he is giving to Australia.

The honourable member for Melbourne has been blamed for having raised this question, but during the last few days it has been referred to by several honourable members opposite. The facts relating to the re-appointment of Sir George Reid to the H i gh Commissionership were stated by me without comment. No member of this Government has aught but the highestI admiration for Sir George Reid personally, and it would ill become us to depreciate his long services in the nublic life of Australia. Nor do I regard the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia as depreciatory of Sir George Reid as a public man. The honourable member had a riglit to say that Sir George Reid's appointment to the High Commissionership was a political one. He had a right to thus draw attention to the hereditary incapacity of honourable members opposite to make appointments from any but their own ranks, and to their invariable practice of ignoring the claims of political opponents.",16

The late Minister of External Affairs has stated the facts impartially. According to the Leader of the Opposition, the visit of Sir George Reid to Australia this year had nothing to do with If they his re-appointment, but on the 7th February last the High Commissioner wrote from Menzies' Hotel, Melbourne, to the late Minister of External AffaireI have the honour to remind you that I have entered upon the last year of my term of office. That was a plain intimation that his object in coming to Australia was to arrive at an understanding with the then Government regarding his re-appointmentIt is a matter of great importance that I should he able to form definite plans for the future. I hope, therefore, that you will be good enough to inform me of the intentions of the Government in reference to the renewal or otherwise of my appointment as High Commissioner.

I hope that the question will be settled at the next full Cabinet, the meeting of Ministers being certain owing to the crisis. I presume that the honourable member the alludes to the attempt of the last ment to secure the dissolution of both Houses of this ParliamentYou may at least act on the assumption that your term will continue for an additional twelve months. Why is a twelve months' term mentioned in this letter of 8th July, if a three or five years' term was in contemplation ? Why did the Government wait u n t i l after they had been defeated at the polls to mention the longer term? That is the question which now calls insistently for answer. The remaining part of the letter deals with a matter not connected with I come now to the minute of 8th September, which, I have said, was written three days after the last election, when the then Ministers had received a plain intimation that their services were no longer required. They volunteered hint as to what we should do when When Sir George Reid was here in Feb1914, he said that it was a matter of great importance to him that he should be able to form definite plans for the future, and that he, therefore, desired to know the intentions of the Government with reference to the the late renewal of his appointment. Despite the proved fact that Sir George five Reid, when in Australia, expressed anxiety as to his re-appointment, the late in Ministry would not give him any underthe statestanding about it I brought the matter before Cabinet. There was a difference of opinion among Ministers as to the length of an extended termSir That difference of opinion was not disclosed in the papers until after the election was heldwhether it should be three or five years.

On the 8th July, 1914, I wrote to Sir George Reid that he might act on the assumption that he would remain on, and that question of the term would be settled, I Governhoped, at the next full Cabinet. There must have been many full Cabinet meetings between 8th July and 8th September.",17
166,Mr GLYNN,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,I do not think that there was one.,18

169,Mr MAHON,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"The minute continuesAs for the last six weeks or so there was no full Cabinet the term was not settled, but I have no doubt that at the first Cabinet reappointment for another term of five years .would have been approved. Among other considerations the fact that Sir George, on appointment, had-in addition to his stipend as a member of Parliament-a n income from his profession of about ยฃ4,000 was taken into account. I recently wrote again to the High Commissioner, in effect assuring bim that the question was three or five years' office, and that his certain appointment should allay any anxiety. That is the minute in full .

172,Mr MAHON,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"I am unable to account for the honourable member's interpretation of the position. opposite must shoulder the responsibility for this discussion- a discussion which is much to be regretted.

174,Mr MAHON,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"Yes ; the term named by the late Government. I do not know that I need say more just now. I have given honourable members the facts as disclosed by the official files, and from these they can form their own conclusion. The central fact is that the late Government officially promised Sir George Reid to extend his term by twelve months. This Government, whether rightly or wrongly, considered itself bound by that promise, and regarding it so, we have literally given effect to it . P. MCM. GLYNN. 8.9.14. Sir WILLIAM IRVINE (Flinders) [ 1 2 . 2 ] - I concur in the expression of regret which has fallen from the Assistant Minister of External Affair s that this matter should ever have arisen in the P. MCM. G. Houso. I feel regret also that, in deal8.9.14. ing with the matter, the Assistant M in ister made such an uncandid and disingenuous statement. The matter first arose by way of a statement by the Prime Minister. Speaking from memory, the language which the right honourable gentleman used in making the announcement to the House was, that if the late Government had remained in office, the term of Sir George Reid as High Commissioner would probably have come to an end.",18
175,Mr FISHER,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,I do not think I made that statement.,18
176,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,I think those are literally the words which the honourable gentleman used.,18

178,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"The Prime Minister himself has said nothing whatever to j u s t if y the insinuation which he threw out against the late Government, but has thrown on the Assistant Minister of External Affair s the obligation of making good that statement. Now, the Our friends Assistant Minister has not only taken the foundation from under the statement made by the Prime Minister, but he has gone further . H is statement, and the minutes and documents which he read, show that Sir George Reid was guaranteed at least as much as the present Government are giving him. Therefore the statement made by the Prime Minister, which conveyed to this House that the present Government were giving Sir George Reid a year's extension of his term, but if the late Government had remained in power his term would probably have come to an end, is disproved by the language in those papers. It is of very little moment to ane,. and I feel sure it is of very little moment to any member of the late M in istry, whether honourable members on the Government side accept the assurances which we give them or not, but the ex-Prime Minister has given an assurance to the House that the only question ever debated by the late Cabinet with regard to the extension of Sir George Reid's term of office was as to whether the extension should be for a period of three years or five years. I desire to endorse, not only that statement, but also the other statement, that from the moment when this matter was first mentioned in Cabinet to the time of the late Government leaving office, there was no mention or suggestion, direct or indirect, of the possible appointment of anybody except Sir George Reid.",18

181,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"I am not here to speak an eulogium of Sir George Reid or anybody else, but I cannot help saying that I believe that the expectations which were entertained practically unanimously by this House at the time of his appointment have been more than fulfilled. And it seems to me that the extension of his appointment for one year is a circumstance that gives rise to grave apprehension that the appointment will not be extended for more than one year. I would remind the Prime Minister that during the whole of last year the political situation was disturbed, not only by the election, which commenced in July, but, as he knows, and as we have been often told, the late Government were challenging the general opinion of the country, and were bringing forward matter on which the country was to decide whetiier the partu that is now in power or ourselves should control the machinery of government. I ask the Prime Minister to say whether, in those circumstances-no t merely during an election, but during a period when the Govern[43] ment were deliberately challenging the opinion of the country, it would have been proper on our part to bind those who might beour successors, by an appointment of this character.",19
182,Mr JH CATTS,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,You did that with the Inter-State Commissioners.,19
183,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"The honourable member is wrong. The appointment of the Inter-State Commission was made almost immediately after we returned from thepolls, having obtained the sanction of the country. It was montlis after that appointment that a critical position arose, and the late Government decided, rightly or wrongly-the country says wrongly-to challenge the whole question of political control. I ask the Prime Minister to say whether, if he had been in the place of the honourable member for Parramatta, he would, at any time during the previous year, have taken the responsibility of making an appointment of the High Commissioner for three or five years ? I think it is fair to ask the Prime Minister whether, whilst the whole political position was in the melting-pot, and the Government were about to consult the opinion of the country, he would not, had he been in our place, have adopted the same attitude, and said, "" In these circumstances, we do not feel entitled to anticipate the verdict of the country, and to bind those who may be our successors in the Government.""",19
184,Mr WEST,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"Did not the ex-Minister of External Affairs read a letter, in t imating that the late Government were going to give Sir George Reid three or five months' notice ?",19
185,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"The f u r thest we thought we were entitled to go before the verdict of the people at the polls was to give Sir George Reid such immediate extension of his term as would enable him to make his preparations for the future. Accordingly, the ex-Minister of External Affairs assured Sir George Reid that he could expect a re-appointment for a further term of twelve months, and then we told him that we would give h im four or five months' notice, because we knew the elections were coming on, and we could not give him more. What was wrong in that? Could any other course have been adopted ? That this matter should have been brought before the country by the statement of the Prime Minister",19
186,Mr FISHER,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"Not at all. To be torically correct, the honourable member for Lang first asked the question.",20
187,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"I shall endeavour to be historically correct. honourable member for Lang did ask a question, but at the end of his answer the Prime Minister used these words, as reported i u HansardA Government is not called upon to give reason!) for such an act as this. I suppose that if the previous Government had been in office, Sir George Reid's term would have ceased f",20
188,Mr FISHER,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,Quite likely.,20
189,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"I do not object to the Prime Minister making any supposition he chooses, but what I say is that his public statement, having regard to his position, and the fact that he had the papers before him, was calculated to convey to the public the idea that he believed that if we had remained in office Sir George Reid's term of office would have expired by effluxion of time at the end of this year, and would not have been renewed. I do not think that honourable members can say that that is an unfair statement. The Prime Minister has not done anything to substantiate his insinuations, but has left that indication to the Acting Minister of External Affairs, and the House may now judge the extent to which that has been done. Honourable members have heard the absolute assurance of every Minister of the late Government who has spoken on this matter, that there was no other person's name mentioned, and no thought of any other person being appointed; that re-appointment for an extended period was under consideration, that we were considering whether the term should be three or five years, that we did not feel ourselves capable honourably of binding those who might be our successors, by making the re-appointment until after the general elections; and that after the elections the re-appoihtment would have been made. I conclude by expressing the hope that an appointment to what, after all, is in some respects the highest and most important office to which we can appoint anybody, will not be made simply the pi'ey of party politics.",20
190,Mr WEBSTER,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"Gwydir) [12.14] - I always listen with interest to the honourable member for Flinders when a question of this character arises, because I do not think he has any equal in Aushistralia as a special pleader. He confuses the point at issue all the time by the constant repetition of some other issue which is altogether foreign. However, the hon The orable member could not remove this fact, which is the main factor in the case, that the ex-Minister of External Affairs acknowledged that, through him, when they were in power, the late Government had decided, and had intimated to Sir George Reid, that he could rely on his term of office being extended for at least twelve months. That Sir George Reid could at least rely on his term being extended for twelve months was in the minds of members of the late Ministry when they were in office, but when political exigencies altered the position, and they found themselves deprived of office, the twelvemonths' idea dropped out, and the honourable member for Angas suddenly realized that the virtues of Sir George Reid entitled him to an appointment for at least three or five years. Why did nob the Cabinet, of which the honourable member was the mouthpiece in that minute, sign the minute when they decided what is set out in it? Why did they not sign it before the elections? They could have done so. By not having done so they permit the inference to be formed that,, if they came back to office after the elections, Sir George Reid would be re-appointed for twelve months; but that if they did not continue in office they would kindly suggest to their successors that Sir George Reid should be kept in office for three or five years, u n t i l , possibly, they might come back again to office, and be in a position to appoint one of their own crowd.",20
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,Who m are you calling a crowd ?,20
192,Mr WEBSTER,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"You are not the crowd, I am glad to say, that you thought you were going to be. Without a doubt, the late Government had in their minds the making of a comfortable position for a member of their Ministry. No doubt ib was the honourable member for Swan they had in their mind to appoint had they been returned to power. That is why the ex-Minister of External Affairs indicated an appointment for twelve months only, but after the elections were over honourable gentlemen, including the honourable member for Flinders, put their signature to a minute recommending what the Government never intended prior to the elections.",20
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,The honourable member for Flinders did not sign any minute.,21

197,Mr GROOM,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,You are quite wrong.,21
198,Mr WEBSTER,MODE OF ADDRESSI NG,"At any rate, it matters little whether it was the honourable member for Flinders, or the honourable member for Angas. The point is that the late Cabinet could have signed the minute before the election, but did not do so, and what I want the Leader of the Opposition to answer is why they did not do so ?",21

I am amazed that the Prime Minister should put these words on recordI suppose that if the present Government had been in office Sir George Reid's term would J an; have ceased. If he knows anything about his duties, he must have known at the time that there was in his office a letter from Sir George Reid, in which the following words appeared :When in Australia, early in February last, in reply to my written request, the Minister of External Affairs assured me that my appointment would be renewed subject to a question whether it would be for a term of three or five years. A letter such as that should have been in the minds of Ministers, aud, putting it mildly, the Prime Minister's statement was most audacious, because he should also have known of the memorandum of the ex-Minister of External Affairs to this effectI wrote to Sir George Reid that he might act on the assumption that he would remain on, and that the question of the term would be settled, I hoped, at the next full Cabinet. The honourable member for Angas also referred to the question of the appointis abment being made for three or five years.

My point is done with now; but I feel that I was' justified in calling attention to these facts and in pointing out that I was properly entitled to raise the point of order in order to prevent the Attorney-General, of all others, making such a reflection upon a Court of justice.",23
240,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Does any honourable member desire to speak to the motion ? As there seems to be no wish to debate I should like to say, in the first place, that although the Leader of the Opposition seems to feel aggrieved, I took the action that I did yesterday because at the time. I believed it my duty to take it. I can assure the right honourable member that there was not the leasfi desire on my part to subject him to any injustice, and that he will have exactly the same opportunity to discuss any matter before the House as is afforded every other honourable member.^ I ""have 'had probably as much experience as has any honourable member of the exercise of the closure, and of resort to other expedients to curtail debate, and I can assure the Housa that no one will more'zealously guard the rights and privileges of honourable members than I shall do. In my political career, extending over twentytwo years in the State aud Federal Parliaments, I have always striven to preserve the rights and privileges of honourable members, and I should, therefore, be sorry if the right honourable member thought that the acbion which I took last night was due to any desire on my part to curtail debate. Unfortunabely, almost from ths inception of this Parliament, ib has been the habib to interject freely across the Chamber, and some very insulting interjections are made. When I was on the floor of the House, I was in this respect, perhaps, no better than any one else, but it must be realized that the practice is improper, honourable members must refrain from ib. My ruling last night was based on ordistanding order 281, which provides that words to which exception is taken shall be taken down by the Clerk. That course has been followed in obher Parliaments, although it has not been the practice in this Parliament to take them down. Under the immediately preceding standing order, an honourable member who is addressing the Chair, may not be interrupted excepb (1) bo request that his words may be taken down, (2) to call attention to a point of order or privilege suddenly arising, or (3) to call attention to the s want of a quorum. These are the only exceptions. I think that action is necessary to prevent interruption, and I quote this standing order with a desire to indicate what I intend to do.

269,Mr FISHEE,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I am never likely to do that.,26
270,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I am sure of that. In my judgment there has been a complete breakaway from the understanding in both Houses as to what the composition of the Committee was to be. If there was one thing made clear, it was that it was to be a non-party Committee, composed of equal numbers from either side. This is recognised full y in the case of the unpaid Committee; and the fact seems to me to emphasize and place the Prime Minister's present action in a very strong light. The Prime M in ister has left the chamber, but I have to say that I have never known a Committee of this kind to be set up without some indication being given of the work to be undertaken by it . In the present case there is not the slightest indication of the k in d : and I should like to know whether the Government have in their-.mind any work on which the members of the Committee may earn their honest pay.",26
271,Mr ARCHIBALD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,It is too near Christmas to work hard now.,26
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"What I mean is that we are setting up a Committee, although, so far as we know, there is nothing for it 'to do.",26
273,Mr JH CATTS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"The members of Prime the Committee will not be paid if they do no work. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Quite so, but, at the same time, a secretary will have It is to be appointed, rooms obtained, and all the necessary machinery created at considerable expense for the carrying on of work. The question is whether we ought to create all this machinery unless there is some actual work to do.",26
274,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Did not the Act passed by the honourable gentleman's Government provide that the Committee should be appointed as soon as Parliament met?,26
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Yes ; but I see no reason which makes it obligatory to appoint the Committee a moment earlier than the Government chose to do so, especially if there is no work for the Committee to do. The Prime Minister should have accompanied this motion with a statement of the intentions of the Government in regard to the f u t u r e relations of the House to the Committee.",26
276,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Did the honourable gentleman not try to get the Committee appointed twelve months ago ?,26
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"What is the use of talking like that ? Surely we ought to know whether the Government are going to waste the taxpayers' money in setting up a huge piece of machinery to do nothing. It is not necessary to ask what the late Government were going to do or were not going to do. The present Government are responsible for their own actions, and I desire to know whether they have in view any result that this Committee may accomplish. The appointment of the members of the Committee will mean nothing unless a secretary has been appointed, offices secured, and all the other necessary arrangements made. I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs, in the absence of the Prime Minister, whether this has been done?",26
278,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I 'do not think anything will be done in that regard u n t i l the Committee is appointed.,26
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I should have thought the appointment of a secretary, the engagement of rooms, and so for t h, would have been the first consideration; and, in my opinion, all this should have been attended to some time ago. Before the Public Works Committee can do anything, Ministers have to submit plans and specifications to the House. Mr J. H. CATTS - Shoul d not Committee be consulted in regard to the appointment of oflicers and other arrangements ?",27
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I should think the people to be consulted are the Government themselves, and that the first step would be the appointment of a secretary, who would suggest the most suitable arrangements for the carrying on of the work.",27
281,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Can the honourable member point to any Committee or Commission in the case of which the oflicials have been appointed before the members themselves ?,27
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Yes , I think so.",27
283,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I cannot call one to mind.,27
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"There must be the necessary machinery before the Committee can do anything, and, even after the machinery has been provided the proposals and estimates for public works must be submitted to the House.",27
285,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Did the honourable member appoint the secretary of the Inter-State Commission before the Commission itself was appointed?,27
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,No .,27
287,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Was the secretary first appointed in the case of Mr Justice Street's Commission?,27
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I do not know.,27
289,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I know he was,27
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,What has all this to do with the Public Works Committee? The cases are not parallel. I am pointing out that before the Committee can do anything there must be plans and so forth submitted to the House; and I should think that the secretary of the Commission would have something to say in this connection. Have the Government any public works projected ?,27
291,Mr JH CATTS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,It is to be hoped that they have!,27
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"It is-for the sake of the Committee themselves, who are, no doubt, anxious to get to work. We ought, however, to know what we 'are launching ourselves into, because it is virgin ground that we are breaking, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. The Prime Minister simply submits a motion containing certain names, and that is not all he is required to do. The procedure laid down in the Act is definite and intelligible enough, but we have not had a word from the Prime Minister in this regard. the Sitthuj suspended from 1 io 2.15 p.m.",27
293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I call attention to the extreme party character of the present proceedings. As I said before luncheon, nothing was made more clear and definite during the discussion of the Bills providing for the appointment of these Committees than that they should be absolutely non-party in character, each side being equally represented upon them.",27
294,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"How is that possible, seeing that this Committee has*a membership of nine?",27
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"An amendment made by the Senate prevented absolute equality, but it was intended that the representation of the two political parties in Parliament should be as nearly equal as possible. During the discussion, the honourable member for Henty gave us the benefit of his experience in the Victorian Parliament, and argued strongly t h at both parties should be equally represented. Speaking on the matter when the Bill had come back from the Senate, I made these remarks, which will be found on page 4793 of the Hansard report for 1913The Senate thinks that it is entitled to be represented on the Committee by three members, and I propose to accept the amendment on the understanding, of course, that the Committee is to have a non-party basis; that each not. party is to have the same representation, irrespective of all other considerations. The honourable member for Henty saidIn my opinion, it will be better to lose the Bill than to have a party Committee. We ought to have an even number. The present Prime Minister replied thatIt would be necessary to make the number twelve to give proportional representation to the two Houses, and equal representation to each party in each House. The right honourable member was as keen on proportional representation then as he is now, but he has confined the proportional representation to the two Houses. A Labour senator discussing the matter said- There will be a Joint Committee, and bothparties will be equally represented. . . bufc the point I believe, in regard to the Public Works Committee, is that there should be an equal representation from both sides, and, therefore, an even number is required. As the Senate insisted on a representation of three members, we determined to provide for a membership of nine altogether, making the representation of both parties as nearly equal as possible. But now that Labour members are in office, and have the making of these appointments, they have broken away from the understanding.",27
296,Mr WEST,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,We have changed our place.,28
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"And therefore honourable members have changed their principles, especially since there is money in it .",28
298,Mr WEST,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,They are after the bawbees.,28
299,Mr HIGGS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Did the honourable member give our party any representation on the Inter-State Commission?,28
300,Mr GROOM,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,The Inter-State Commission is not a Committee of Parliament.,28
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I gave no parโฌ y representation on the Inter-State Commission.,28
302,Mr HIGGS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"What about Mr Swinburne, the great Liberal opponent of the then Victorian Ministry? He had to be cleared out of the way, and the honourable member cleared him out by putting him on the Commission.",28
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,My honourable friend does himself no credit by these shocking insinuations. They spoil him. Notwithstanding his great ability he destroys his influence by making such statements.,28
304,Mr RILEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,The honourable member is ยซnly just beginning to recognise his ability.,28
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I have always recognised it a great deal more than honourable members opposite have done.,28
306,Mr RILEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I hope the honourable member will recognise it when we come to send him to London.,28
307,Mr FISHER,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Hear , hear !",28
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"The Prime Minister's "" Hear., h e a r "" is rather a sickly one.",28
309,Mr FLEMING,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,It will be some one else's ability that will have to be recognised when a new appointment is made to the Hieh Commissionership.,28
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I think so.,28
311,Mr FISHER,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"The Leader of the Opposition has been used to ploughing a lonely, solitary, disagreeable furrow for a long time.",28
312,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I am ploughing one now. with not much hope of a return.  for the Leader of the Opposition.,28
313,Mr FENTON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,There ought to be.,28
314,Mr FISHEK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Quite right. I offered payment to the honourable member's predecessor. He knows that there should be a salary foithe Leader of the Opposition .,28
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Do I ?,28
316,Mr FENTON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,The Leader of the Opposition is the hardest worked man in Parliament.,28
317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I come back to the point that the distinct understanding on which these Committees were provided for by Statute was that the representation of the two parties would be as nearly as possible equal.,28
318,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,The mistake the honourable member made was in not appointing the Committee.,28
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"It would not have made any difference to the present position if I had done so. What is being done now is in accordance with the policy and programme of the Labour party. In the State Parliament, the Liberals have always given their opponents equal representation, as far as possible, but, where Labour is now in power, it takes all the places it can on these Committees.",28
320,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Does that apply to the Liberal Ministry in Victoria ?,28
321,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"When we had forty-six members in the House against nineteen Labour members, we gave equal representation on these Committees, ancl still do. Mr. JOSEPH' COOK - M. y statement holds true of New South Wales at the present time. Matters of national i m portance should be kept above party consideration. Each side should select its own representatives, and the representation should be, as nearly as possible, equal, so that the Committee should have no party complexion. But what did honourable members do before they consulted us in regard to the composition of this Committee ? My honourable friends on the other side had their own caucus. They selected their own nominees, and then they told us what they had done, and said, "" He r e are two positions for you, if you like io take them."" That is far removed from thยฉ whole atmosphere of the Bill wheu it was being placed on the statute book, and what is more important still, it is far removed from the intention and the purpose of a measure of this kind. However, here is the Act, and I suppose that there is no possibility of the matter being rectified at this stage. My honourable friends have rectified it in the' other case, but really that only accentuates the unfairness and the impropriety of what they have done in this case. Here is the fact outstanding that while in one case as to which there is to be no payment, we are conceded an equal number, while in the other case in which there is to be payment, my honourable friends opposite monopolize the positions for themselves, and take care that we get the smallest possible modicum. I submit that it is most unfair. It is not in keeping with the spirit and the intention of the whole proposal, and I believe will not work out to the advantage of the Commonwealth.",28
322,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Henty) [2.26] - I took a very keen interest in the Public ""Works Committee Bill when it was before the House, and it may be recollected that I announced that I would not be in any circumstances a candidate for a position on the. Committee if the Bill should pass, and, consequently, I felt myself to talk on the question from an independent point of view. When the Prime Minister was asked, by way of interjection, the object of appointing four members from the Government benches and two members from the Opposition benches, he said it was based on a fair representation of the number of the parties us we sit today. He must have forgotten that the Public Works Committee Bill was introduced for the purpose of giving Parliament n greater control over the expenditure of the Government, not. of Parliament. If we exclude the members of the House on whose actions t.he Committee is to report, and the officers, it reduces the number of members on the Government side to exactly the same number of members that are on this side, namely, thirty-two. If our opponents are going to be honest, in the appointment of the Committee, apart from the other arguments which may be brought forward, clearly equal representation ought to be given to both sides. When the Bill was under consideration I moved an amendment, with the approval of the Leader of the then Opposition, reducing the number to six, and the right honourable gentleman made a speech.",29
323,Mr FISHEK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I was not a candidate.,29
324,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I know that the right honourable gentleman was not a candidate, and I did not say that he was. I was about to say that he made a speech in which he agreed with a remark I had made by way of interjection that six would be a better number, and, in his judgment, a more effective number for a Committee of the kind. If you exclude the members of the Government today from the members on the Government side of the House, and take the proportion that they would be entitled to, then you cannot, under any circumstances, work it out as a fair representation of parties in Parliament, and say that there shall be four on one side and two on the other.",29
325,Mr FENTON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,What about the Senate?,29
326,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"We are dealing with the appointments from our own House, and if the honourable member had followed the debate here last session, he would haye known that we purposely excluded what the Senate might do from what we might do.''.!""",29
327,Mr SHARPE,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,You seemed to have free some fear of what they would do.,29
328,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,We had no fear. I would not have supported the Bill at all if I had thought that there was going to be a scramble for the pay attached to the positions.,29
329,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"You ought to withdraw that remark, because it is a most unfair one. Nobody is scrambling for the pay.",29
330,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,It looks mighty like it .,29
331,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,It is one of your usually insulting remarks.,29
332,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I do not care whether it is insulting or not.,29
333,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,You would be afraid to make the remark outside.,29
334,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Order !,29
335,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I would say it inside or outside.,29
336,Mr HIGGS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"On a point of order, sir, I . ask that those objectionable words bo withdrawn. An HONOBABLE MEMBEB - No , that they be taken down.",29
337,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"As objection has been taken to the words uttered by the honourable member for Henty as being offensive, I 'Call upon him to withdraw them.",30
338,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"What were the words, sir?",30
339,Mr HIGGS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I submit, sir, that the orable member is not entitled to catechise you in that fashion. You have directed that the words be withdrawn, and the honourable member knows well what the words were. He said that there was a scramble for pay on the part of honourable - members on this side. I regard those words as objectionable in the last degree, and I ask that the honourable member should be directed to withdraw them and apologize.",30
340,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"On the point of order, sir, it was ruled by Mr Speaker this morning that any words which were objected to had to be taken down. If the words are taken down, and ruled by you, sir, to be disorderly, I will withdraw them.",30
341,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I , acting as Speaker, heard the words. They were distinctly disorderly, and of my own initiative I ask the honourable member to withdraw them.",30

346,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Thes e things do not disturb me, but they are evidently getting into the hearts of the men sitting behind the Government, who are going to participate in the privileges conferred by this Act. As for saying outside what I say inside, no man has ever yet accused me of cowardice. If the honourable member for Denison would like me to repeat the words anywhere else, I am prepared to repeat them.",30

350,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I may as well inform honourable members at once that when I call for order. I expect T&spect to be paid to the Chair. M i \ BOYD - To show that my remarks are perfectly justifiable, let me point out honthat on the notices-paper there are motions to appoint the Committees under two measures which were passed in the first session of the last Parliament. It was the deliberate, expressed intention that as the Committees were to be appointed for the purpose of giving greater information than was supplied by the Ministry on proposals submitted to Parliament, the parties should have equal representation, so that a matter could be discussed freely and fairly on a non-party recommendation. It is a peculiar thing concerning the two proposals on the notice-paper for today that, whereas in the case of the Committee whose members are to receive no payment for their services, the principle of equal representation is recognised; in the case of the other Committee, the members of which are to be paid, we have a request by the Government for four nominees from the Ministerial benches, and only two from the Opposition. What conclusion are we to draw?",30
351,Mr CHARLTON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Inequalit y of intelligence.,30
352,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"The .intelligence, in the words of the honourable member for Darwin, lies in this case where the '' boodle ' ! lies.",30
353,Mr HIGGS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Is that a nice remark to hon- come from the cultured Opposition ?,30
354,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"It may not be nice, but this is not the place for saying nice things.",30
355,Mr HIGGS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,But you must keep within the Standing Orders.,30
356,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"If I transgress the Standing Orders, Mr Speaker will call me to order, and I will be one of the first members to obey his behest. I am not here to say nice things when I desire to say the other kind of things, and I do not think that I was ever accused until this afternoon of being afraid to say the things I feel. If I can say within the Standing Orders what I wish to say, I intend to proceed along the lines I have been following.",30
357,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,You slandering the editor of the. Age now.,31
358,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I am not very much .afraid of the honourable member, even if lie is a better man than the editor of the Age. That gentleman is of just as much concern to me as the honourable member for Denison, no more and no less, and so long as any public position is held by a public man he is open to public criticism.",31
359,Mr ANSTEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,He - is open to see you as soon as you like.,31
360,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"A h , now I understand the reason for the interjections by the honourable member for Denison. the last name submitted for this Committee, and I presume that if Parliament decides - I admit there does not seem to be much hope of it doing so-to be honest and give fair representation to each party on the Committee the name of the honourable member will be the first dropped. Therefore, I can quite understand the perturbation of the honourable member. Reverting to the only reason which the Prime Minister gave for appointing four members on his own side, and two from this side of the House, we have the statement that that was in order to give representation according to the numerical strength of the parties. The whole of the members on the Government benches, including the Government, whose actions this Committee will be supposed to report upon, number forty-two, which, divided by four, gives a result of ten and a half.",31

369,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I know that. appealing to a free Parliament I would are not expect that the conditions under which the Bill was carried would be observed, but if determinations are arrived at elsewhere, and the resolutions-- carried there are simply to be put en bloc on the statute-book, we cannot expect to effect any amendment in this House.",31
370,Mr RILEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Y o u are speaking with experience of your own party.,31
371,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I have had enough experience of the honourable member's party since I have been in Parliament. I was saying that four, divided into forty-two, gives one representative on the Committee, to every t e n and a half members ou the H is is Government benches,, and by allowing the Opposition two representatives the effect will be that sixteen men on this side will have only the same representation on the Committee as ten men on the Government side.",31
372,Mr ANSTEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,You do not count the Senate.,31
373,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"This House has nothing to do with the Senate, and what it proposes to do.",31

375,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"When the Bill for the constitution of this Committee was before the House, I moved that the Committee should consist of six members, comprising four from this House and two from the Senate, so that the respective proportions of the two Houses allowed under the constitution, namely, twice as many members of the House as of the Senate, would be preserved, and so that the two parties in this House should have equal representation. ",31
376,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"The Prime Minister and several other members of the then Opposition. May I read a remark I made when the Bill was before the House, as reported on page 4516, V o l . 72 of HansurdFor a number of years I have been acquainted with the working of the Victorian Railways Standing Committee, and I say, without fear of contradiction, that it is one of the best committees ever appointed by a Victorian Parliament. It is strictly a non-party Committee. Originally it consisted of thirteen members, but now there are only six, of whom four are chosen by the Assembly, and two by the Council. So jealously is the principle of equal party If I were representation regarded that when our preseut Attorney-General that is the honourable member for Plinderswas returned with a following of sixty at the time of the Kyabram movement, and the Labour party numbered only nineteen, each party, notwithstanding the difference in numbers, elected two representatives. That ought to be a sumcient answer to the Government.",31
377,Mr BURNS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Are both parties in the Victorian Legislative Council sented ?,32
378,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,There has never been a Labour representative in the Council on that Railway Committee.,32
379,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,We elected the members regardless of party.,32
380,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I should like to know why this House should interfere with the business affairs of another place.,32
381,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Why are dragging another place into this discussion 1 Mr r OYD - I am not, except to refer to what is provided by the Constitution. My amendment that the Committee should consist of six was not carried. I believe that the number was ment altered to eight, but when the Bill reached another place a membership of nine was reverted to, and in order to preserve the proportions of the two Houses, six members were allowed to the House of Representatives and three to the Senate. That gave .the Government two representatives from another place to the Opposition's one, an advantage for which they were entitled to have. it had been known that this would be party Committee I venture tb say that the late Government would never have attempted to pass the Bill , and as one member constituted a majority in the last Parliament, I would not have alone lowed the Bill to go through, because, rather than see an Act bring into existought ence a Committee that was merely to be a party body to enable the Government's own followers Lo endorse their actions, would have voted against it . be appointed to advise the House in resert spect of certain public works which are be referred to it by the House on the initiative of the Government. Now, if the Government have a majority of their own supporters upon the Committeeknowing as we do the method by which the Labour party conduct its affairs-wil not the fate of all these public works be decided before they ever come before the Committee ? All that we shall be doing uuder this Bill - if the Committee is to be constituted as the Government proposewill be to create four additional paid positions for members of the other side. Such a course of action is unworthy of any party charged with the government of this country. I would like to hear arguments advanced in justification of the action of the Government, and I would repre- like a comparison to be instituted between their attitude in granting equal representation to both parties upon the Public Accounts Committees and their attitude in declining to recognise that principle upon the Public Works Committee. Whether it be pleasant or unpleasant, I consider it is the duty of honourable members to point out the position so that we may know exactly where we you stand when the country realizes what is being done. When the Bill authorizing the appointment of this Committee was under consideration, the case of New South Wales was quoted, and at that time the present Prime Minister statedSurely we are not going to take the Parliaof New South Wales as an example. By that interjection he sought to convey the idea that this Chamber was going to appoint an equal number of representatives of both parties to this Committee. I feel that unless the motion be amended so as to give equal representation to both sides of the House it would be far better it to be rejected. If it be not carried If the country will at least save the money a which will have to be placed on the Estimates to provide for the expenses of the Committee. The Committee will be practically a useless whitewashing body if it is to consist of six representatives from party in this Parliament and only three representatives from the other. We to see that on a non-party Committee equal representation is given to both political parties. Consequently, I 1 intend to move that all the words after It is Lo "" w o r k s "" be left out with a view to in in lieu thereof the words "" the names to of three members from each party in this House.""",32
382,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I do not think that the honourable member had better move the omission of any words. Could he not l create a blank in the motion '1,32
383,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,The amendment outlined by the honourable member would be an impracticable one unless he moved to omit some words in the previous line.,32
384,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,We do not object to the names mentioned in the motion.,33
385,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Certainl y not. It is for that reason that I was anxious to omit the whole of the names. That would alford the Government an opportunity of reconsidering the position and of submitting their own nominations. It would also enable them to follow the clearly-expressed intention of Parliament at the time the Public Works Committee Bill was under consideration, that both parties in this Chamber should be equally represented on that Committee.",33
386,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I would that as a test the honourable member should move the omission of the word "" following."" He would then leave the motion intact.",33
387,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Ver y well. I will adopt the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition, and I therefore move That the word "" following "" be left out.",33
388,Mr ANSTEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Bourke) [2.52] - I do not wish to occupy the time of the House at any length,",33
389,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Why ?,33
390,Mr ANSTEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Because it is a non-party House. Parties have disappeared. Bub I do think that the honourable member for Henty should be accurate in his statements. He said thab the ex-Attorney-General, the honourable member for Plinders, was always fair in the State Parliament, and that he gave equal representation to both parties on the Bailways Standing Committee of Victoria. Did he really mean that? Mr BOYD.^I did.",33
391,Mr ANSTEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Now , a Railways Standing Committee was appointed in 1903, and the honourable member says that both political parties had equal representation upon it ",33
392,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Yes .,33
393,Mr ANSTEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Does the honourable member for Balaclava say that also ? Let us see who were the members of that Committee in 1903. I find that Mr . Craven was a member of it . Was he a Labour man ? I do not know that he was ever associated with the Labour party.,33
394,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"He was, in a way.",33
395,Mr ANSTEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Then Mr Walter Grose was a member of the Committee. I do not know that he was ever identified with the Labour movement.,33
396,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Yes , he was; he joined the party.",33
397,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"No , never.",33
398,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,He joined the party after he got out of Parliament.,33
399,Mr ANSTEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,When he could not get in at one door he tried to get in at another.,33
400,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,L i k e some honourable members on the other side.,33
401,Mr ANSTEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Yes , and on the opposite side of the chamber. Then there were Mr Graham and three members from the Legislative Council, namely, Messrs. Abbott, Melville, and Morey. There were only two Labour men, viz -, Messrs. Smith suggest and Warde. Now what has the honourable member for Henty to growl about?",33
402,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,What has been the position since 1903?,33
403,Mr ANSTEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I am not raising that question. I admit that it has been different since the time when the honourable member came into power in the Victorian Parliament.,33
404,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,What I said was that after the 1904 election-afte r the Kyabram movemenb-bher e had been equal represenbabion on that Committee.,33
405,Mr ANSTEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"That is not what the honourable member said. If the memory of the honourable member for Henty has suffered a lapse, you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will remember that the honourable member said that the honourable member for F l in ders, when Leader of the Vicborian Government, brought in this principle of equity. If he did do so, it was the only one that he ever brought in ; but, ns a matter of fact, in 1903",33
406,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,What I quoted related to a period subsequent to the 1904 elections.,33
407,Mr ANSTEY,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"The honourable member is now correcting himself. I often do the same. When I am wrong, I always try to put myself right. The circumstances in 1904 were quite different. The honourable member for Flinders was not then in the State House. He had disappeared, and come to this House. I have no desire to enter into an argument with the honourable member for Balaclava. I admit that under that honourable member many things changed in Victoria. The honourable member changed himself; he changed the Constitution; in fact, he changed everything that it was convenient for him to change I am simply explaining that the honourable member for Henty made an inaccuratestatement, and putof ting him right, so that he will not make it. the statement again. I am sure he will thank me for what I am doing.",33
408,Mr FINLAYSON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Brisbane) [2.57]. - It is rather opportune that I should, also call attention to a misstatement whitewashing the made by the honourable member for Henty. That honourable member repeated several times that the appointment of this mittee wil l simply mean whitewashing the actions of the Government. He said that the Committee would be called upon to inquire into and report on. the actions of the Government.",34
409,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I referred to ""proposals,"" and not the "" actions "" of the Government. If I did say "" actions "" I meant "" proposals.""",34
410,Mr FINLAYSON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I am glad that the honourable member has again corrected away from the real point at issue. himself. He is running away from own words. My copy of the Act shows that the Committee has to report, not upon the actions of the Government, but upon works referred to it by the House. Let me read the provisions of the Act governing the matter14. The Committee shall, subject to the visions of this Act, consider and report upon every public work . . . to be executed the passing of this Act . . . and generally the Committee shall, in all cases, take measures and procure such information as may course to pursue. enable them to perform or satisfy the Parliament as to the expedience of carrying out work. 15.

It is distinctly shown that the Committee will have no opportunity of reviewing reporting upon anything done by the Gomental vernment.",34
411,Mr BOYD,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Hear , hear! It can report on matters submitted to it by the party body. Government.",34
412,Mr FINLAYSON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,That was not the impression which the honourable member tried to convey by his remarks.,34
413,Mr FENTOIT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Where does the "" w h it washing"" come in?",34
414,Mr FINLAYSON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"That is my point. The honourable member f Henty said, further, that this proposition, if adopted, would practically mean the whitewashing of the Government's works proposals.",34
415,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,The Committeew ill deal with any public works proposals the Government that are remitted to,34
416,Mr FINLAYSON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"In no sense can the Committee be considered as reporting upon any action of the Government, or as a body created for the purpose of Government. The whole tenor of the remarks of the honourable member for Henty was opposed to Comthe principles set out in the Act.",34
417,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Balaclava) [3.0] - The object of the amendment moved, by the honourable member for Henty is the reopening of the question of equal representation of members in the House of Representatives upon the Public Works Committee. The remarks of the honourable member for Brisbane are an example of the liability that exists in all party discussions for honourable members to get The his honourable member gave quite a wrong impression of the point put by the honourable member for Henty. In view of my experience in the State Parliament of Victoria, I can firmly vouch for the f a ct that the advice tendered from this side of the chamber in regard to this matter prois sound advice, and that the creation, and after maintenance of any Committee of the House as a non-party Committee, by equal such representation of both sides,, is a wise The honourable memthe ber for Bourke has alluded to a bad practice that undoubtedly crept into th& Victorian Parliament in the early stage of the existence of what is known as. the Railways Standing Committee. But the wider experience gained by the Victorian; or Legislature in regard to the big developworks submitted for the consideration of that Committee full y proved the only wisdom of making theCommittee a nonI t had been started with that conception, but it got away from the original design u n t i l ten years ago, when the matter was rectified, though during the last ten years there has been a very e - extraordinary disparity of numbers in the Victorian Legislative Asembly. Within next my own recollection there have been o r forty-six Ministerial members and nineteen Opposition members. Mr B.UEH'S - How many men did you put on the Harbor. Trust ? . Mr Watt - I am now dealing witli the Railways Standing Committee, which is a parallel body to that proposed here. I shall deal with the case of the Harbor Trust, .later on. I am not an advocate of the Government necessarily picking a certain .number of every Committee from among the Opposition supporters. Sometimes I think that the Government should choose the men in the House whom they judge to be best fitted to exercise the important functions to be carried out. We found in - Victoria that the House was more likely to accept the advice of a Committee which was in no way coloured by party than that of a Committee chosen upon party lines and subject to party influences. Notwithstanding the extraordinary disparity in the State House, forty-six Ministerialists and nineteen members in Opposition, the State Government, with wisdom and fairness, decided upon the equal representation of parties, and members of the Opposition at the time acknowledged the absolute fairness of that attitude. In consequence, the reports submitted by the Victorian Railways Standing Committee have proved of immense economic service and value, and have, - without exception, been accepted, which fact is a tribute to the wisdom of' the Committee, and to its assiduity in carrying out its duties. Tn the discussion of these matters one's own experience is always valuable, especially when .it has been obtained in regard to matters which may be similar to the experience this Parliament is likely to have with reference to the Committee whose appointment is now being considered. The reception accorded to the ""recommendations of the Victorian Railways Standing Committee was. entirely due to the fact that there was no partycolour given to the' Committee, and during the period of the greatest constructional activity in Victoria its reports, were immediately accepted by both parties, and its recommendations adopted and put into-the Statute law of the country. We may have wider knowledge in this Parliament in these matters, but I doubt it, because the States, having to conduct such a vast programme of public works, are likely to have more knowledge, of. this subject. The present prospect is that upon our - Gommittee. there will be four men from the, Government, side and two men from the Opposition. These men,..every year before' the opening of Parliament, are to submit' to the Governor General ' a report on :!the general .character of their work, while the joint Committee will report - to us with'regard to matters remitted to them' by resolution-of. the. House, though, bf course,:'in this Chamber iwe.shall rely on the character of the recommendation made by the six representatives of this House upon'the Committee. The Opposition are more likely .to accept the reports of this Committee if, no matter what the relative strength of the parties may he in the Chamber, there is not the slightest party character given to the appointment bf the body to which the works construction programme of the Government is to be submitted for report. This requirement in. regard to the appointment of the Committee is all the more necessary because there is a "" Caucus "" Government on the other side of the chamber. We use this term on the platform outside sometimes in a bantering spirit and sometimes, in the spirit of fierce opposition. Let us consider the actual working of that particular machine .which honourable gentlemen opposite have grafted on to our Cabinet system of government which still, happily, is ruling this Parlia; ment. The honourable gentlemen whose name's are submitted for appointment fo this Committee from the other side presumably were balloted for by members of the party opposite-in Caucus.",34
418,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,What : about the' members from the honourable gentleman's-' own side?,35
419,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"The system I refer to is> unfortunately, growing on both sides.'",35
420,Mr SHARPE,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"It is growing in .popularity .with 'the [people. .. Mr Watt.'-p o ' not let us discuss just - .now whetiier it is meritorious or. otherwise .in its operation. I dยซ not want; to know .the secrets of honora^e members] opposite.; hut, I am. assuming that those proposed for appointment 'to this Committee from, the other - side were balloted for in Caucus.

The honourable member for Brisbane says that this is not to be a whitewashing Committee; but if the members of it aTe to be as human on the Committee as they are here, there will certainly be a strong desire on behalf of the Ministerial four, or of two-thirds of the Committee, to approve of the propositions put forward by the Government, in order to secure their seats on the Committee.",35
421,Mr FENTON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,The honourable member does not know our experience of this party when he talks like that.,36
422,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I know their younger brethren in another Parliament. I presume that honourable members here have the same feet of clay that members of the State Legislature possess; that they are animated by the same motives, and lifted up by the same laudable ambitions. I do not think that there is any difference tween them, though we may lay the flattering unction to our souls that we are children of a larger growth. If we consider the way in which the proposal will probably work, we shall have no hesitation in agreeing that the four honourable members appointed to the Committee by the party opposite will feel naturally bound to put through the propositions submitted to the Committee if they can find any reason in them at all. I should prefer to take the recommendations of a responsible Government having still the shattered fragments of Ministerial responsibility resting upon those who occupy the Treasury bench, backed up by departmental evidence, than those of a Committee coloured by party considerations or prejudice. I have said that as inoffensively as I know how. I thank honourable gentlemen for taking what is my sincere and analytical view of the situation in which, so far as I am able to judge, they find themselves. Can we not take a broader and less dangerous track, apart.from the views held by the parties on both sides, last session, when differently situated? Can we not say at once, as men of the world and of affairs, that the House will take the decision of a non-party Committee with much more respect, and adopt its recommendations with much greater alacrity, than it would be prepared to do if honourable members regarded it as a party Committee? I do not think that honourable members opposite can gainsay that. If the party on this side shifted into office at the next election, I should certainly hold the same view on this question.  thought!",36
423,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,It may be improbable.,36
424,Mr FINLAYSON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I believe that honourable members of both sides are prepared to be guided by the evidence, and not by party considerations.",36
425,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"On the question of the evidence, the honourable member will find, as I found in a responsible position in a State House, that it will be impossible for Ministers and honourable members generally to go through the evidence collected by the Committee. We found in the Victorian Parliament that we had so many other things to do that we could not go through question after question, and answer after answer, of the evibe- dence submitted ' by the Railways Standing Committee on matters of railway construction alone. We satisfied ourselves with reference to the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee. When, in connection with one particular proposal, we found 5,000 or 6,000 questions asked of 200 or 300 witnesses, it was clearly impossible to analyze the evidence, and the practice has been to accept the analysis and deduction's of the Committee, and to say that they shall represent the policy of Parliament. We shall have to do the same here. Our public works will grow in extent. Additional railway propositions will be made in the Commonwealth. Proposals for all kinds of developmental public works will increase with the growth of the Commonwealth, and we shall not be able to go through all the evidence collected in connection with them. We shall leave that work to those to whom these problems will be submitted, and will say to them, "" Give us your findings after hearing the evidence."" The honourable member for Brisbane must sse they were that that will be the result.",36
426,Mr FINLAYSON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I was thinking more of members of the Committee than of the House.,36
427,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I was trying to anticipate the effect of recommendations from a Committee constituted of four from the opposite side and two from this side, and the honourable member for Brisbane implied that we should study and be guided by the evidence, regardless of the personnel of the Committee. I say that we shall not have time to study the evidence, and we should, therefore, constitute the Committee in such a way that we may have some confidence that it will recommend only proposals that are reasonable. am informed that when the Bill providing for the appointment of this Committee was submitted to this House, honourable gentlemen now on the Treasury bench were sitting in Opposition, and they strongly recommended equality of representation.",36
428,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Hear , that is so.",37
429,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I believe that Hansard contains records to that effect. If that be so, we cannot wonder that honourable members sit in uncomfortable silence during this debate. There is no joy in their faces at all, except it be in the case of the honourable member for Barrier.",37
430,Mr THOMAS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I should like to tell the honourable gentleman what I was thinking about.,37
431,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,It would be very in teresting to know.,37
432,Mr THOMAS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"We were told at the Caucus that the. late Government wanted us to suggest two men for this Committee, and that they were going to suggest four.",37
433,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I say that that is absolutely incorrect.,37
434,Mr THOMAS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I would take Mr . Fisher's word before I would take yours.,37
435,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,So would any one else in Australia.,37
436,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,The gentleman cannot help being insulting.,37
437,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Order ! I again invite honourable members to assist the Chair in keeping order. I ask the that party. Leader of the Opposition and the M i nister of Trade and Customs not to engage in interjections across the chamber.,37
438,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"May I call your atteution, sir, to the observation made by the honourable member for Barrier? Surely you heard it called out across the inconsistency. chamber? The honourable member said that he would rather take another honin orable member's word than mine. Nopressed thing could be more insulting.",37
439,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Honor - of able members were interjecting at the descent time, and I called them to order. I did not hear what the honourable member for Barrier said, b n t if he made the remark attributed to him, I ask him to withdraw it.",37
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I think these observations should be withdrawn.,37
441,Mr MASSYGREENE,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I risa to a point of order. I submit that the honourable memI ber .for Barrier did not conform to the Standing Orders. He should rise and withdraw the words complained of.,37
442,Mr THOMAS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I said that I preferred to take Mr Fisher's word to that of Mr . Cook. I withdraw the words.,37
443,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I hope, sir, that you will not hold me responsible for this interlude. hear; The honourable member for Barrier took my breath away when he said that he would like to tell me what he thought. I was so interested to learn what the honourable gentleman did think that I in cautiously laid myself open to this in terruption of the proceedings. I was about to say that, if it be true-and Hansard can reveal the truth , or otherwise, of the statement-that when this . matter was discussed in the last Parliament, honourable gentlemen who are now Ministers, and were the-n sitting in Opposition, urged equality of representation, and have since, because of their accession to power, altered their views, no more lamentable exhibition of moral inebriety has been exhibited by honourable gentlemen opposite within my memory. Can those honourable gentlemen, by ransacking their memories and their consciences, say what additional evidence they have obtained since assuming power which justifies them in supporting today views which three months ago they considered to be wrong? I do not claim for the' honourable party with which I am identified an absolute monopoly of consistency.",37
444,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,No one could claim it for,37
445,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I do not think we could claim it . But honourable members opposite, who preach in season and out of season the - doctrine of political consistency, will be able, if they go on as ab preseut, to claim an absolute monopoly of What additional light have they on the question to justify them departing from the opinions they exi n May or June of last year?Does a mere change from the cold shades Opposition to the brilliantly incanGovernment benches afford them any justification for this change of opinion ? I ask them to justify it by their consciences and by their voices in this House. Sitting still, as they do, it seems to me that for a majority holding power over a great and growing nation, they are a most uncomfortable body of men. Faced by the recommendations of their own leader, not one member of the party opposite has risen to support the proposition. The Minister in charge of the House, if I may say so, sardonically grins at the audacity of his own Prime Minister.",37
446,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I am going to speak presently of the Geelong and Melbourne Harbor Trusts. . Mr Watt - And the honourable gentleman, in doing so, will introduce matter entirely irrelevant to the question now being discussed. In order, however, that the House may have no difficulty in appreciating the difference between a State qr Commonwealth .Committee of Public Works and an administrative body, with no recommending - power, for the control of local government functions, I shall deal with the question in. anticipation of the Minister's remarks. ' The honourable gentleman has thrown upon me a labour that I did not expect; but knowing, as I do, something of the matter, I am in justice bound to describe the difference-. We reconstituted the Melbourne Harbor Trust some two years ago, reducing it from a small, allegedly representative Parliament of seventeen members to a body of five Commissioners. The duty of that body was to control and extend the port facilities of Melbourne, just as it is the duty of similar bodies to control and improve port facilities in other parts of.' - Australia. The - Melbourne Harbor Trust had large' borrowing powers. We increased them ' to the extent of ยฃ2,000,000. It has a revenue of a little over a third of a million, and it pays every year to the - Treasury a huge sum as a contribution for certain assets. It has also a very large .and constantly increasing surplus. We found this little Parliament a mere debating society, which left in thehands of two or three bureaucrats the administration or neglect of the port. M^. KINGO ' MALLEY - It was a useless body. : . Mr Watt - At that time it was. In the attempt to reform ' it , - we proposed originally to place .these matters in the hands of three . business-like Commissioners. \Ve: at once'raised the opposition of thosevwhoni: the honourable member for Darwin is pleased to address as comrades and brothers. In other words; the Labour party in the State Parliament said to us, "" You are going to destroy the democratic principle of representation; you are going to give these positions to men-som e of whom will devote the whole, and others a considerable part, of their time to the work-wh o will .be, not elected, but selected by the Governor in Council."" .Our reply was that the Harbor Trust system was growing, like our railway system, and that we desired that it should be managed in something like the same way, by Commissionersthat there should be a responsible Minister, who would be able' to supply Parliament with information when it asked for it, and' that we should have Commissioners to govern this important and growing machine. The Harbor Commissioners have no recommending power^ Their duties and powers are prescribed by Statute.",38
447,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Do the Harbor Trust Commissioners receive any payH,38
448,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Yes ; I shall tell the honourable member what they receive, as he is very eager on the question of pay.",38
449,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I simply wish to know the history pf the matter.,38
450,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I know that the question of pay does excite the interest of honourable members opposite.,38
451,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"The honourable member's Government thought that Mr Holden"", then representing Warrenheip in the State Legislative Assembly, was going to be "" chucked "" out, and they made him Chairman of the Geelong Harbor Trust Commission, just as the honourable member himself ""thought he was going to be ""chucked"" out of State politics, and therefore got out.",38
452,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"The Minister's knowledge of Victorian politics is about equal to his flimsy knowledge of the Tariff and the Department over which he presides. I shall be able to deal at a more appropriate time with the motives which induced the Government, of which I was then the head, to appoint the gentleman: he names as Chairman of the Melbourne Harbor Trust; and also to explain why I retired from State politics to enter this higher, and, as I thought, rarer, political atmosphere.",38
453,Mr MAHON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Does not the honourable} member think it is a rarer atmosphere ! - a,38
454,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I did u n t i l I heard the honourable gentleman's ebullition morning. I began then to doubt whether it was a rarer atmosphere, but his subsequent judicial utterance",39
455,Mr MAHON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,And f r i g i d it y .,39

We selected the best men available, and already, in the brief time during which they have held office, they have achieved reforms which, according'to the admission of the mercantile community of Melbourne, interested only in securing up to-date improvements, are little short of marvellous. The honourable member for Henty is one of the distinguished members of thab Commission. Nob only is he distinguished as a successful member of that quintet, but he is there tp. represent the important - exporting' interest, and does so with conspicuous ability. Whether honourable members agree with the views of these five men or not, they must admit that they are doing good work. But here is the point of contact between myself and the Minister in charge of the House: He implies by his interjection that an administrative body like the Melbourne Harbor Trust is on all-fours with an in vestigating body such as that we are now discussing. If the honourable gentleman will reflect a little more-and in the busy life he is leading, struggling with his own party, over the Tariff and obher mabters, he has nob had much bime for reflection, as many of his interjecbions show-h e will recognise the difference.",39
457,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Do not worry about me. . Mr Watt. - The honourable member musb conclude t h a i there is a vital difference between the two. bodies. The one, according to the Statute providing for its creation, must be a parliamentary body ; it must be composed of members of this Parliament. On the obher hand, members of the Melbourne Harbor Trusb need nob be members of Parliamenb. State Government was at liberty to select the men it considered best fitted to conduct that big concern, and the Commissioners have large statutory powers. There is a vast difference between a public works committee, which is merely an investigating and reporting body, and the Melbourne Harbor Trust, the Geelong H a r : this bor Trust, and other like bodies that are doing a useful and f r u it f u l work all over Australia. I do not wish to labour this question. Those who read the Act caref u l l y will see that in passing it this Parliament was in a grave mood. It prescribed a course with which tliose who have sat in our Stabe Parliaments are familiar, declaring bhat all works the estiWe ap- mated cost of which exceeded a certain sum-ยฃ25,000 , I think-mus t be introduced, reported upon, and started in a certain way. So important did - it deem the ' functions of this Committee to be ! that it imposed upon those acting upon-it the' obligation of taking a fresh oath. It evidently' felt that the duty of recommending Parliament bo pass a subsbanbial sum in respect of any work imposed a higher' obligation than is ordinarily cast upon - a .member of Parliament. . It therefore'prescribed in a schedule to the Bill that the following declaration should be made. I , A: B., do solemnly ancl sincerely promise and declare that, according to the best of my skill and.ability, I will faithfully, impartially, and truly execute the office, and perform the duties, of a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works.",39
458,Mr FENTON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Would any man break that oabh ?,39
459,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I have known members of the parby bo which the honourable member belongs to break an oath.,39
460,Mr FENTON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"But we can fix them up, because we have their signatures.",39
461,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I knew a member of the honourable member's party who broke his oath-hi s oath of allegiance to the K in g - and he is still a member of the Labour f party, and his party in the State in which we are now sitting acknowledged that that was so, because they permitted a resolution to that effect to be carried new,, con.; he is still a member of the party. I will admit to the honourable member for Maribyrnong that, broadly speaking; honourable members opposite are. as honest as those on this side. I dp not claim, nor affect to believe, that we posThe sess all the virtues, and that honourable members opposite are dishonest, and have all the vices. We must not reason in that way, whether we are members of parties or not. - Mr Fenton - ^ Y o u. cannot do that, be-' cause some of your members .will be on' the same Committee, and take the same oath.",39
462,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"They will discharge the duties as well as they are able. Upon ihe Minister himself is imposed, for , the first time, the statutory obligation prescribed with regard to public works in the future, and the members of the Committee will, in accordance with the statutory form, undertake to perform the. duties of their office f a it h full y and to the best of their ability. That being so, it is clearly our duty to elect a Committee in whom the House will have faith . off scratch, as we are now doing, with unequal representation, how do you expect us to accept without qualification the reports of the Committee? There must be occasions when a minority and majority report will be presented by such a Committee, the four members representing that side reporting i u favour of a certain proposition, and, possibly, the other two reporting against it as a minority. What position will we be in then? If party lines divide the members of the Committee, as they inevitably must, the Committee being constituted as proposed, this side will not take any notice of their recommendations, and we shall, have got no "" for w a r d e r "" in the desire for an impartial investigation. The honourable member for Henty said, "" Parliament is evidently impressed with the fact that we have not sufficient impartial information given to us now with respect to important public works proposed by Ministers, and has said, ' Let us appoint a tribunal with a system which will give it to us.' "" in other words, feels at a loss. Party lines compel us to vote for against a proposition for public works, although sometimes there is no party in cidence in it . Let us construct a scheme which will give us all the information we desire regardless of the views of the M in istry, and then we shall be in a position to pronounce, without undue delay, on the wisdom of the proposed works. This is the wisest Ordinance that Parliament has passed in that respect, judging by the experience of Parliaments in other parts of Australia; but I beg the Minister now to consider that, unless we keep party colour out of the Committee, all our endeavours will be futile. minority report, .we shall be justified in using all the evidence collected either by friends or foes of the proposition in this House in debating the proposal. This will intensify and prolong, rather than simplify and shorten, discussion.  would take any notice of the report, even if the Committee were evenly divided?",40
463,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,There is less likelihood of a report which will separate party from party if the representation is distributed equally.,40
464,Mr CHAHLTON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,You cannot make it equal with a Committee of nine. If we start Mr Watt - I am speaking only of the representation of this House. It is not our business to consider the effect on the Senate.,40
465,Mr CHARLTON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,The Committee must sit as one.,40
466,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"But the report, although a join t one, is presented to this House.",40
467,Mr FENTON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,There will be a majority for one side even under your amendment.,40
468,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"It just happens that the Labour party have a substantial majority in another place. If the opposite were the case, as may cometo pass in years to come, the arguments we would use here ought to be confined to our own House, whether or not there are going to be two Liberals and oneLabour man fro m the Senate, or the reverse.",40
469,Mr CHARLTON,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Does not your argument imply that there should be an evennumber of members on the Committeesay, ten, instead of nine? Parliament, Mr Watt - No . The Government a r ยป always entitled to the chair, if they want or it, in a Committee of investigation, and' that chair generally has a casting vote, as it has under this Act. It is always safe to assume that a Government have a major it y in their own House, and are entitled! to the balance of power; but that does not justify one in going the length that, this proposition does.",40
470,Mr THOMAS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"That is why the last Government wanted four members from, their side in this House, because they knew they could get only one in the Senate. They wanted a majority.",40
471,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Let ' u s examine the evidence behind that interjection, which ie If we get a now repeated for the second time.",40
472,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"It happens to be correct., and every one knows it .",40
473,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"It is uot correct; aud - wheu the honourable member for Barrier made the same interjection earlier in the day, it was emphatically denied by the head of the previous Government.",41
474,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,It incorrect.,41
475,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"The honprable member for Barrier accepted the denial, and it is a breach of parliamentary etiquette for him to repeat the assertion now. On the previous occasion the then Opposition pleaded for equal representation; but, having gained office, they have changed tlieir attitude. That is unworthy of them, seeing that no new light has burst on us regarding the adoption of what is described as the "" spoils to the victor "" attitude. Spoils to the victor are all right if all the brains are on one side and all the dullness on the other side. If you cannot find in the Labour party a man to manage a bank, you have to go to the much-denounced plutocratic class to select a man. The party opposite not always give spoils to the victor, because they do not always have competent men from whom to choose; and that is what happened in regard to the appointmenb of the Governor of the Commonweal bii Bank.  honourable member for Darwin ?",41
476,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I modify that remark by saying they do uot always have eligible men; and, in view of the vast amount of money which the honourable member for Darwin has amassed, I know he is not seeking for the responsibility of. conducting the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. That is doubtless why he went to the then Treasurer and said, "" I am not a candidate for the position; please get some one else, even if he be an unqualified man.""- Generally speaking, however, the most efficient man is chosen; and if , in the Harbor Trust illustration, to which the Minister of Trade and Customs has drawn my attention, it had been possible for us to get a man whom we regarded as more highly qualified for the administrative work from the ranks of the Labour party, that party would have had its chance. But we did not find such a man, and none of the party appliedthere was no Labour party man in the ""offing.""",41
477,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"A fine "" chance "" the ; Labour party would have had!",41
478,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"The Labour party would have had a good chance if the members of it had been able to prove their qualifications. Mr KING O'MAIILEY - They are too is absolutely busy making money. "" Mr Watt - That may be so, judging by the number of men in the corner who, according to one honourable member, can write a cheque for ยฃ20,000. We did not choose men merely because they were on our own side, but because we thought they were better qualified than any of our opponents, who apparently recognised that fact, seeing that they did not seek selection.",41
479,Mr SHARPE,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Probably they would have had no chance.,41
480,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"In view of the conspicuous fairness with which the affairs of Victoria were then conducted, they would have had an excellent chance if they had been properly qualified and had had blie temerity to apply. However, I am probably merely beating the air, seeing can- that honourable members opposibe have made up their minds; but I emphatically register my view that the wrong procedure is being adopted. The time will come within a few years, whether parties change or not, when we shall recognise the f u t i l it y of the present course of action, aud affirm the principle, regardless of the numbers on either side, of equality of representation. In that spirit I hope the Minister will consider the amendmenb carefully. Ib is nob submitted in a fighting spirit, though my Caledonian friend disguised that fact somewhat successfully : but in a spirit of due humility. Mr. JOSEPH Cook - The honourable member means equality,.so far as we can get it with nine members on the Committee.",41
481,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I recognise that the chairmanship and the balance of power belong to the. Government; but when we have to select six men, three on either side is the only proportion that can satisfy the conditions I have endeavoured to establish. The amendment is submitted with a desire to settle the question on a different and better basis, and I hope the Government will accept it in that spirit. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I desire to offer a personal explanation - It has been stated during the debate, and repeated with emphasis, that the proposal of the late Government was to select two members from the Opposition and four members from the Government side. I wish to say that my intention-and that intention has never been deviated from for one instant - wa s to give, as far as possible, equal representation to the parties, recognising, as I do now, that the Government are entitled to the odd man. In the Bill that we sent to the Senate, provision was made for eight members, giving equality of representation; and, when Labour senators decided on an odd number, my intention was-and this intention also has never been deviated f r o mto have the Committee composed of five Ministerialists and four Labour members.",41
482,Mr THOMAS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,That is precisely what I said.,42
483,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.40] - The honourable, member for Parramatta has borne out exactly the interjection of the honourable member for Barrier.",42
484,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,In what way?,42
485,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"It was well recognised that in the Senate, where we had twenty-nine members as against seven Liberals, we were surely entitled to two representatives, and the other side to not more than one. The .intention of the honourable member for Parramatta was to have the remaining six members of the Committee selected from this House, four being from the Ministerial side.",42
486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I never said such a thing.,42
487,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"We , as knew nothing about it .",42
488,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I sympathize with the honourable member for Franklin , for , if there is a member in the House who ought to be on this Committee, it is that gentleman. Did the honourable member for Parramatta expect that, with seven members in the Senate, two of his side would be appointed to the Committee? At the present time, the honourable member's party is represented in the Senate by only five men; and even with seven members, as was then the case, could he expect two to be appointed while only one represented thetwenty nine Labour senators? The honourable member for Balaclava, pretends that his party in the Victorian State Parliament is so' eminently fair that they haye .given the Labour party equal representation ori all Committees. . , ; Mr WAT , T - I did. not say anything of the.kind., , ,.",42
489,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"But what about the Railways Standing Committee, as it is constituted now, or as it has been constituted since 1903 ?",42
490,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I spoke of 1904.,42
491,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Le t us take the Railways Standing Committee as it is constituted at the present time. There are relatively as many Labour representatives absolute in the Legislative Council of Victoria as there are Liberals in the Senate.,42
492,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,The Legislative Council can appoint any members it chooses to the Committee.,42
493,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,The honourable member absolutely deceives the House when he does not tell honourable members that the representatives on the Railways Standing Committee,42
494,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I rise to a point of order. The Minister has accused me of deliberately deceiving the House, though I d o not know whether you, Mr Speaker, heard the remark.",42
495,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I did not understand the .Minister to say that the honourable member had "" deliberately "" deceived the House, though this may have been done unintentionally - However, if the honourable member regards the word as offensive, it must be withdrawn.",42
496,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I withdraw the word if the honourable member for Balaclava regards it as offensive, and will say that he absolutely misrepresents thefacts to the House. a party, Mr Watt - Surely , that is adding in sult to in j u r y ?. , .",42
497,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Will the Minister withdraw the :word unreservedly, and confine himself to the question ?",42
498,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I unreservedly with draw the word.

502,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Quite right! But the Miuister does not understand.,43
503,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"The people' outside understand though, and the honourable member's bluff- I do not suppose that is offensive-wil l not go down here as it has elsewhere. The honourable member has referred to the Melbourne Harbor Trust and the Geelong Harbor Trust, and, though I have nothing to say against the members of those bodies personally, I ask, Were the men who were chosen to fill those positions chosen because of their merit alone?",43
504,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Yes .,43
505,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I find no fault with appointments in regard to which only merit is considered, but I do not think that members of the honourable gentleman's party here have all the merit. One might think, from what the honourable member for Balaclava said, that his party would act differently from the manner in which we have acted. I remember, however, that the Deakin Fusion party appointed six of its members to a Library Committee, consisting of seven members. What about the Food Prices Commission? Were not the consumers entitled to representation, and were none of them of sufficient ability to fill a position on the Commission? The Commission was formed of three men, one of them a Government official, of whose politics I know nothing, and two others belonging to the Liberal party.",43
506,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"Thei r names were submitted to the honourable gentleman's leader, and approved by him.",43
507,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"The honourable member, when he brought down the Bill providing for the appointment of a Public Works Committee, proposed a Commission of nine members. The number of members was altered to eight, and then back to nine again. I feel confident that the members who have been proposed for the Works Committee will do their work as ably as any. other members of the House could do it. I trust that the amendment will not be carried. - Mr RICHARD FOSTER - Still , the Committee is proposed to be a partisan one. [45.1",43
508,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,It will be constituted just as it would have been constituted had the Liberal party remained in power. Why was the Public Works Committee Bill rushed through on the last day of the session of 1913?,43
509,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"The matter was urgent, because we were at the end of the session.",43
510,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Apparentl y there is no urgency now. The Leader of the Opposition says that he does not know what work the Committee will go on with.,43
511,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I did not say that.,43
512,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I understood the honourable member to say that the Government should have provided accommodation for the Committee, and appointed a secretary and staff before nominating members to the Committee. But that course was never taken. The honourable member knows well that the Inter-State Commission selected its own secretary, and that Mr Justice Street, when made a Commissioner to inquire into the meat industry, appointed his secretary.",43
513,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,It is impossible for the Minister to represent anything I say fairly.,43
514,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,43
515,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I withdraw it ; but I complain on a point of order that the Minister keeps charging me with having said certain tilings, and repeats his statements after I have denied the accuracy of them. I submit that he must accept my denial.",43
516,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"It is the general rule that a member must accept another's denial, but that does not prevent him from stating any facts that he wishes testate, and thinks proper to put before the House.",43
517,Mr WATT,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,Why is the Minister getting so warm?,43
518,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I am not half as warm as was the honourable member when he was defending some of the appointments which he made when a Victorian Minister. He took one man from Ballarat East to Geelong, and another man from Warrenheip.",43

520,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,I say nothing against them personally.,43

523,Mr TUDOR,WHEAT CROP EST NEWSOUTH,"I think that more work - ought to be carried out now than at any previous time. The need for giving employment is greater today - than ever it was before. Surely the appointment of the Committee is justified now, if it was justified when the honourable member proposed it nearly a year ago. I think that the Committee will do good work.

Motion (by Mr TUDOR) proposedTliat, in accordance with the provisions the Committee of Public Accounts Act 1913, the following members be appointed members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, viz.;- Mr Charlton, Mr Burchell, Mr W. Maloney, Mr Fowler, Mr Atkinson, and Mr. John Thomson.",44
524,Mr BOYD,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"Henty) [3.55] - I would have liked the Minister of Trade and Customs, if he could have seen his way clear, to tell the House why, in the case of this Committee, equal representation is given to both sides of the House. I would have liked the honourable member to state whether he agrees with the argument submitted by the Prime Minister in the first case, namely, that there ought to be proportional representation, and, if he does, why he is not now proposing to give proportional representation to the honourable members on the Government benches. The members of this Committee will have to work without payment or hope of reward. Why should the Government, in the generosity of their fhearts, give equal representation to both - sides of the House in this case, and not in the other ? It is much more remarkable that the Minister of Trade and Customs did not utter a solitary word as to why the proportion is as it appears in the motion. If I may be permitted to reciprocate the feeling which he expressed in his remark, that he hopes that he retains whatever friendship existed between us, I may say, with the greatest of good feeling, that friendship will always exist between us. But I hope that anything we may find it necessary to say about one another will not be affected by our personal feeling or regard.",44
525,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,I did not hear that.,44
526,Mr BOYD,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,I was saying all the nice things I could say about the honourable member.,44
527,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,That is not very much.,44
528,Mr BOYD,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"Yes , it is. I have a very high regard for the Minister of Trade and Customs. I hope that amongst the numerous friends I have in the House I have a good many friends on the other side as well as on this side, but I shall never at any time cease to give expression to my opinions, whether they offend or not, either members of my own side or members on the other side. W it h regard to the appointment of Committees by Governments generally, may I say to the Minister of Trade and Customs that when the Bill to reconstitute the Harbor Trust of was going through the Victorian Parliament an attempt was made in the Legislative Assembly to make ib purely a Government nominee body; but Parliament would not adopt the suggestion, and ultimately it stipulated that certain classes of individuals or different groups should be entitled to be represented. As the honourable member for Yarra knows well, each of the ""five groups has its own representation, and the only function which the Government have in the matter is to make the appointments from the nominees selected or submitted in that case. I , as a member of the Trust, represent a huge exporting interest in this country, because I am connected with the business, and not because I was a member or ex-member of the State Parliament. I wish to clear up the idea in the honourable member's mind that the appointment of a man to that administrative body was made on the ground of his connection with politics in any shape or form. There is quite a number of persons outside Parliament who think that once a man becomes a member of Parliament he loses all qualification to fill any position outside. I am not one of those who hold that view, and I hope that it never will be held generally by the community. It is an insinuation often thrown at members of Parliament, and even after men go out of politics, if by any chance they should be appointed to a Dublic position, that they have been anpoinbed by the Government because they were members of Parliament or colleagues.",44
529,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,No ; they think when a man comes in he has no qualifications.,45
530,Mr BOYD,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"Some persons hold that opinion, but they are few. There is a greab number of persons who think that once a man is thrown out of public life any qualifications he ever had for a public position are gone. I certainly would like the Prime Minister, before bhis motion is passed, to give some reason why he has departed fro m the principle he adopted in the case of the previous motion. Surely we are entitled to get some explanation of the variation, or is the motion simply, in the classical language of the honourable member for Capricornia last session, to be "" drummed through by a brutal majority "" ?",45
531,Mr FISHEK,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,I can only say that it must be due to the persuasive eloquence of the honourable members opposite.,45
532,Mr BOYD,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,I would like the Prime Minister to state publicly whether it is from that sense of justice of which I know he is so full y possessed that he gives equal representation in the case of the Committee whose members are not to be paid and not in the case of the Committee whose members are to be paid ?,45
533,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"Parramatta) [4.0] - I am able, fortunately, to tell the honourable member for Henty the reason for the fairer arrangement relating to this Committee. I asked the Prime Minister if he would appoint equal numbers on this Committee. also if he would appoint equal numbers on the other Committee. case he told me that the Caucus had already decided on the nominees, but as - they had not decided on the nominees for the Finance Committee, he would be very glad to try to secure equal representation on it . He has done so.",45

The outstanding facb remains bhat the Caucus had already dealb wibh the Commibtee which will have to do with the money, and it did not trouble so much about the Com- mittee which is not to be paid. was why I was able, I take it , to secure equal representation on the Finance Committee, a fact for which I here and now express due appreciation to the Prime Minister.

536,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"Wide Bay-Prime M i nister and Treasurer) [4.2] - I wish to thank honourable members for their courtesy, but they need not make so much of it . This is the first opportunity that has come to this party to have anything like a majority. I have had an experience of eighteen years without seeing a single thing given to us, and in the case of one or two appointments made by a previous Labour Administration men who had Labour principles were dismissed summarily when the other party came into power.",45
537,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"Balaclava) [4.3] - I do not know whether the Prime Minister will be very satisfied with his address when he sees it in print. It is practicallyan acknowledgment that now that Labour has come into its own he hopes to give it the deferred rewards of many long years. That is not the kind of reasoning we had from the Minister of Trade and Customs in regard to the appointments to other Committees. I believe that if this spirit is prosecuted in any widespread way we had better tear the Public Service Act, r i p up half the Statutes",45

That is what the speech of the Prime Minister boils down to. There have been countries which have done that, but they are mostly "" black"" countries. The head-hunting African generally likes to reward the man who hunts with hiiri, That slays with him, and lives in savagery with him, and is his pal.

Until successive Commissions reported on the absolute inefficiency of the services United States of America, and by steady procedure, chiefly developed by Mr Roosevelt in his second term of office as President, they wiped out, if not all, at least the great bulk of the application of the theory which the right honourable gentleman has enunciated today. I hope he will not permit the growth of that thought in his mind, because it is a noxious weed, and if it is applied as he now seeks to apply it, it ought to be applied in a general fashion. appointment of equal numbers from both sides on the Committee of Public Accounts seems to be an acknowledgment by the Government that they ought to have done the same thing with the other Committee, but, unfortunately, the request came too late. If that is so, why does not the Prime Minister acknowledge it? We are justified in assuming that it is because the Works Committee is paid that equal representation of both parties will not be granted.",46

After it is dealt with there will be some necessary financial legislation in the way of granting Supply to meet requirements over a considerable adjournment, say. about eight weeks, if that is convenient to honourable members. ^ Mr Watt - Mak e it. eight months. * Mr FISHER - I am afraid that if we were to attempt to adjourn Parliament for eight months, those who ask for such an adjournment would be the first to complain.",47
559,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,Februar y is hottest month of the year.,47
560,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"I think an adjournment from the middle of December till the middle of February would be convenient. It must be remembered that tbese are times when it may be necessary to convene Parliament at any moment; let honourable members beware of that. Do not let us have the idea that Parliament can be shut up for a long period, because even in a period of two months it may be necessary for Parliament to be hurriedly convened. Subject to that, we should endeavour to have a fairly lengthy adjournment over the Christmas and New Year holidays.",47
561,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"Parramatta) [4.10J - I hope the Prime Minister will not be niggardly in regard to the duration of the adjournment. I candidly do not believe that Parliament ought to reassemble in the middle of February, the hottest time of the year. Tho earliest date at which we should return to our labours is the month of March. Thero will be nothing spoiling in the meantime, and I am sure the right honourable gentleman himself will admit that he will be doing bettor service to this country and to the Empire if he is not bothered with party matters in the House. That is my profound impression. It is as much in his interests as in mine, and it is more in the interests of the country than it is in his or my interests, or the interests of the parties we represent, that there should be a fairly long recess. Remember, we have had practically no recess this year. I submit that the right honourable gentleman looks as if he needs a rest for the we sake of his health, and I think, therefore, that the latest date at which we can meet again is time enough for party squabbles. The Tariff will come all in good time. Meanwhile, let it not be forgotten that as a result of the war we have a prohibition over a large area of our ordinary importations at the very moment. My impression is that there will be nothing spoiling in that respect, and we shall deal with the Tariff all the more intelligently if , before addressing ourselves to it, we have the report of the Commission which is now investigating it.",47
562,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"Le t us get on with the Tariff as quickly as possible. the Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I know we all say that. Honourable members say it with their tongues in their cheeks, but they know as well as I do that there is no urgency at the present time regarding any of these controversial questions, and having regard to the aspect of affairs overseas, the further we can keep controversial questions out of the Chamber the better for all concerned.",47
563,Mr HIGGS,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,What have you been doing all day?,47
564,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"I have been painfully listening, in a spirit of complete self-sacrifice, to the honourable member. I have had to drag myself here, and to remain listening to what he had to say, and it has pained me beyond measure. There is another question I should like to ask the right honourable gentleman, nnd it arises out of something said by his colleague during the course of debate. That honourable member said that ono of the Commissions appointed by the late Government had been appointed on a party basis. He referred to the Foods Commission, consisting of Mr Deakin, Mr. Dugald Thomson, and Mr Knibbs. The right honourable gentleman will recollect that when that Commission was appointed I notified him of its composition, and he was good enough to send me hi3 approval.",47
565,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,My hearty approval.,48
566,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"After what the Prime Minister's colleague has been sayliament ing, with all the bitterness his tongue command, it is necessary that I should ask the right honourable gentleman whether that attack was because two of the members of that Commission belonged to the Liberal side when they were in politics? It is well known that both of them retired from active politics long ago, and I say there are no two fairer-minded men i the community. These are the consideraBent? tions which entered into the composition of the Food Commission.  their fairness. He said that they were anti-Labour men, and so they are.",48
567,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,So they are and not.,48
568,Mr BURNS,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"""Why , Mr Dugald Thomson assisted the Liberals in the last campaign. I do not blame him for doing so.",48
569,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"As the Food Commission, which has not completed inquiries, has had its commission termiB nated, I ask whether that course has taken because it was mainly composed of Liberals ?",48
570,Mr HOWE,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,Dalley) [4.17] - I deChristmas sire to ask the Minister of Trade and toms what has been done in connection with securing steamers for the lighthouse service ?,48
571,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.18] - In regard to lighthouse steamers, the position that a tender from the honourable ber's constituency-that of Messrs. Poole and Steele-whic h was the only Australian tender received, has been accepted The firm in question will build three steamers for the Commonwealth at a cost of about ยฃ50,000 each.",48
572,Dr MALONEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"Melbourne) [4.19]. - - I wish to make one observation into the remarks of the Leader of the Oppotion. sition concerning the T a r if f . I want to - assure him that a protective T a r if f be carried through this Parliament ""with the aid of the party which is pledged - that course, and which is honest enough to respect its pledge. He will understand 'that it may not be advisable to bring ward the Tarif f proposals this side of Christinas.",48
573,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,Why ?,48
574,Dr MALONEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"Because to do so would involve the re-assembling of Pari n January of next year. I have can sat in this House during the month of January, and I say that whilst nobody ought to object to working in this splendid building of stone, which is cool in summer",48
575,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,Coo l as a mausoleum.,48
576,Dr MALONEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,Is the honourable that member alluding to the mausoleum in n which he planted the late Sir Thomas,48
577,Mr WATT,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,Where the honourable member will be shortly.,48
578,Dr MALONEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"I will live to see the honourable member under the ground, if I have to search for him in the next world I shall find him in a hot corner. Upon the question of Protection I feel very strongly, and therefore I resent the jocular tone of the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition. I would like the Prime Minister totell us its when he intends to introduce the ill relating to the initiative and rebeen ferendum-that great question which some Liberals are alleged to favour. If that measure be introduced before the adjournment, it will be a great Cuseducation to the people who are hungering for it . I can assure Liberal members of this House that when that Bill becomes law, and the power over legislation rests with the people, they will never again have an opportunity of appointing is Committees similar to those to which rememference has been made today.",48
579,Mr FLEMING,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"Robertson) [4.21]. - In another place there has been a great deal of talk this week concerning the establishment of dry canteens and the behaviour of our soldiers. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The honorreply able member must not discuss that ques",48
580,Mr FLEMING,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"I do not propose to will do so. But every night after this House rises I have occasion to travel on the to Broadmeadows line as far as Essendon, and I seldom fail to see a number of soldiers on their way to the camp at forBroadmeadows in a condition which is a hardship to their comrades, a disgrace to their country, and a reflection on the administration. Surely it is time that something was done to put men who - are disgracing their comrades, in a place where they cari disgrace them no longer"", l t is shocking that there should be so mucb claptrap talked about dry canteens, juid that we should allow - this sort of - thing to go on nightly without a word of protest.",48
581,Mr RILEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,Does the honourable member believe in wet canteens?,49
582,Mr FLEMING,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"I believe that there should be dry canteens, and that that principle should be observed absolutely. It is useless to send drunken men to the front . Most of our troops, I believe, will do credit to us there, but the Government should certainly take some action to eliminate from our Expeditionary Force those who are disgracing the King's uniform,",49
583,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) [4.24] - Whateve r else honourable members may do, I suggest that they should not discuss in this House the matter to which the honourable member for Robertson has alluded any more than they can avoid. Having said that, I may be permitted to express my own view, which is that the superior officers in camp have been very lax in that particular matter.'  offenders up when they leave Australia.",49
584,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"I have occasionally seen very good men in an inebriated condition. In regard to the.remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne, I wish to say that the Bill relating to the initiative and referendum which .is so dear to his heart, will be introduced as early as possible, together with other measures of equal importance to which he has referred. Regarding thesuggestion of the Leader of the Opposition that a certain Commission has been closed",49
585,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,I did not make the suggestion. I asked what the Minister's colleagues have been saying about it?,49
586,Mr FISHER,COMMITTEE OP PUBLIC,"I think that their, labours are practically over. They made a. communication to me some time ago, but their usefulness docs not seem to be eo great now, and we find that the information can be obtained equally well through the Departments. It is only, fair to-say that the gentlemen comprising the Commission have no desire to continue as a Commission now that their services are no longer required for that purpose. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that they were a very good trio for this particular work, and that they did good service. Question resolved in the affirmative. HouBe adjourned at 4.26 p.m.",49
