1,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I wish to know from the almost any time.

I wish, too, to know the Minister will take into consideration advisability of remitting all the fines bave been imposed on cadets for not tending drills?",14
2,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"In conformity with the provisions of the Bill, the Minister been making recommendations the fining of cadets, and has asked for the remission of fines in all cases in whichcadets agree to make up the time that has been lost.",14
3,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Is it a fact that the brigade majors, or area officers, have been instructed to. apply to the magistrates for the, suspension of fines pending action being taken by the Government?",14
4,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"That is so. The request has been sent through the proper channel for the suspension of action, in view of the recommendation that the Minister is making, and of the introduction of legislation which will probably meet with the approval of Parliament.",14
5,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"Will the Minister, in framing new rules, consider the advisability of instructing the area officers to send a notice each quarter to the parents of cadets who have not attended drills, in order to give them an opportunity to compel their sons to make up lost time during the remainder of the year?",14
6,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I shall have much! pleasure in bringing the suggestion under the immediate notice of the Minister.,14
7,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,I wish to know from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence if he can now inform me as to the reasons why the Western Australian Cadets were not represented at the recent Inter-State contests in Meboume? I asked for the information some weeks ago.,14

9,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Can the Minister of Home Affairs inform the House when he expects to know the boundaries of the new electorates of New South Wales? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I cannot sayexactly. We have sent over the quota, and expect a report from the Commissioners DAY LABOUR.",14
10,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"In view of the distinct issue which has been raised between if the honourable gentleman and the Argus as the to t.he alleged widespread insubordinathat tion amongst certain workers under his atDepartment, will the Minister of Home Affairs refer the point at issue to an impartial individual to determine? At the has present time each party is denying what in respect to the other affirms. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am not responsible for what the Argus says or does. It is in a state of spiritual lunacy at present. I can only be responsible for my Department. The charges are absolutely f 3.1 S6 ",14
11,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Has the Minister called for a report from any of the leading officials of his Department in reference to the statements which appeared an the Argus? If he has a report which - enables him to say that the statements are false, will he lay it on the table, so that the public interest in the matter may be satisfied? If he has not such a report, will he have one made? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I did speak to my officers, but there is no such report. I called their attention to the charges of the Argus, and, though they did not say it, I could see that they thought the Argus is suffering from Chinese leprosy. OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",15
12,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I wish to know whether the Prime Minister will consider, in connection with an amendment of the old-age pensions law, the desirableness of affording persons who are not naturalized another opportunity to qualify for pensions without waiting for three years?",15
13,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"This is an evergreen question. When the last amendment of the law was made, we gave special facilities to aliens to become naturalized, in order that they might take advantage of it, but, unfortunately, quite a number of <them did not avail themselves of the opportunity.",15
14,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,They did not know of it.,15
15,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I admit the reasonableness of extending to those who, although not citizens of the Empire, have rendered good service to the country, some consideration.

No Maltese, so far as I am aware, have been brought to Australia under contract.; If they have, the contracts are void, because I have not given approval to any applications to introduce Maltese labourers under contract.

ELECTORAL DIVISIONS: WESTERN AUSTRALIA --'",16
26,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"the Attorney-General, upon notice I. If he will consider the following resolution passed by the Senate on 31st July, 1912 :"" That, in accordance with section 22 of the Electoral Act, the distribution be disapproved of and referred back to the. Commissioners with an intimation that due consideration does not appear to have been given to the diversity of interest and the absence of means of communication between the districts of Mount Magnet and Cue and the other portions of the proposed Division "" D "" and that the Commissioners be re. quested to make the distribution on the basis of exising enrolment and not by way of anticipation, so as to give each division as nearly as is practicable an equal number of electors"" ? 2. Whether this resolution, intimating as it does, that the distribution of electorates made by the Commissioners, was not in accord with the views of the Senate in certain particulars, is not a direction to the Commissioners as to the manner in which they should carry out their duties, and consequently is an infringement of (prior section 22 of the Electoral Act? 3. Whether in asking the Commissioners to make a fresh distribution, the Government will omit all reference as to the manner in which they shall carry out their statutory duties in making a fresh distribution? ,",16
27,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The matter to which the honourable member's questions refer is within the province of the Minister of Home Affairs, who has asked for my advice in relation to it, and to whom my opinion has been foi^varded today. From this the upon following extract is taken :The Minister for Home Affairs forwards for advice the following minute by the Chief Electoral Officer :"" I desire to bring under the Minister'* notice the terms of the amendment moved by Senator Henderson and carried by the Senate, in relation to the proposals of the Electoral Commissioners for Western Australia ; and to suggest that, in view of the provisions of Part III . of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902-11, the Attorney General's advice be obtained as to the correct legal procedure. It is presumed that the motion for the adoption of. the report may be taken to have been rejected; but there would appear to be some doubt whether the Act contemplates that the Commissioners should when called upon to prepare a fresh distribution, receive or act upon directions."" The resolution as carried by the Senate was "" That in accordance with section 22 of the Electoral Act, the distribution be disapproved of and referred back to the Commissioners with an intimation that due consideration does not appear to have been given to the diversity of interest and the absence of means of communication between the districts of Mount Magnet and Cue and the other portions of the proposed Division "" D , "" and that the Commissioners be requested to make the distribution on the basis of existing enrolment and not by way of anticipation, so as to give each division as nearly as is practicable an equal number of electors."" Section 22 of the Electoral Act is as f o l lows :""22 -(1. ) If either House of Parliament passes a resolution disapproving of any proposed distribution, or negatives a motion for the approval of any proposed distribution, the Minister may direct the Commissioners to propose a fresh distribution State into divisions. "" The Commissioners shall thereupon reconsider the matter, and forthwith propose a fresh distribution, but for that purpose it shall not be necessary to cause the action provided by section 17 of this Act to be taken."" The Senate's resolution is clearly a resolution disapproving of the distribution proposed 'by the Commissioners, and enables the Minister io direct the Commissioners to prepare a fresh - distribution. The Senate, in its resolution, has stated reasons for the disapproval, and has requested the Commissioners to alter the distribution in a certain way. The Commissioners are not bound to comply - with any such request. It is obviously convenient, however, that the Commissioners should be aware, not merely of the bare fact of the disapproval, but of the particular matters disapproved of and the reasons; and the Senate's .resolution appears to be designed to that end. Tn my opinion, the only direction which the Minister should give to the Commissioners is a - direction to propose a fresh distribution. But he should send them, for their information, a copy of the resolution of the Senate, and the debate thereon. AUSTRALIAN ACTORS* UNION.",16
28,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"the Attorney-General, .upon notice I. Are there any means of redress for the .'technical error availed of by the employers in .the supposed registration of the Australian Actors' Union, such error being made in the Registrar's Department. The application for the cancellation of the registration of the Australian Actors' Union was heard by Mr Justice Higgins in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration on ist August, 1912. The applicants were J. C. Williamson L t d . , George Marlow L t d ., William Anderson, Frederick Aydon (on behalf of Rickards' trustees), and Brennan's Amphitheatres Ltd.? 2. W i ll the Attorney-General read the decision - of Mr Justice Higgins and state the best course 'to pursue and prevent any further error of such a character?",17
29,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The answers to the .honourable member's questions are :1. No means are at the disposal of the Department to redress the error. As to the means at the disposal of the parties, I am not in a -..position to advise. 2. I have read a report of the decision. The error was one of inadvertence, and it is not likely to be repeated. The question of amending the law is receiving consideration. COMMONWEALTH BANK.",17
30,Mr MCDOUGALL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether his attention has been drawn to the statement which appeared in the press to the effect "" That the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank had been asked by the Prime Minister to recommend some one for the position of Deputy-Governor of the Bank?"" 2. Did the Prime Minister agree that the of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, as a condition to his acceptance of the position, should be considered in the appointment of a DeputyGovernor ? 3. Have the Government delegated their powers to the Governor of the Bank in the matter of selecting and appointing a DeputyGovernor ?",17
31,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The answer to all the honourable member's questions is "" No."" HEYWOOD-DARTMOO R TELEPHONE.",17
32,Mr MCDOUGALL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. What was the estimated cost of the telephone line between Heywood and Dartmoor? 2. What were the revenue estimates? 3. What is the distance between Heywood and Dartmoor ? 4. What is the estimated cost of erecting a telephone line between Dartmoor and Mumbannar ? 5. What are the revenue estimates? 6. What is the distance between Dartmoor and Mumbannar? 7. Is there a difference in the estimated cost per mile of erecting the lines mentioned ? 8. If there is a difference, what is the explanation ?",17
33,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The following information has been furnished by the Deputy Postmaster-General, Melbourne:1. The estimated cost of erecting the telephone line between Heywood and Dartmoor was ^413 4s. 1 i d . 2. The estimated annual revenue from the telephone line between Heywood and Dartmoor was £,41 12s. 6d. 3. The distance between Heywood and Dartmoor is 265 miles. 4. The estimated cost of erecting a telephone line between Dartmoor and Mumbannar is ^198 ios. gd. 5. The estimated annual revenue in connection with the line between Dartmoor'and Mumbannar is £1 0 gs. 5d. 6. The distance between Dartmoor and Mumbannar is 5 miles 43 chains. . 7. The estimated cost of the erection of the Dartmoor-Mumbannar line is higher than the estimated cost for the Dartmoor-Heywood telephone line. 8. The reason for the higher estimated cost in the case of the Dartmoor-Mumbannar line is as follows:-The Dartmoor-Heywood line is constructed for J of a mile on existing poles, for 7 miles on new poles, for 14! miles on trees, and for 4 miles on fences. The estimate for the Dartmoor-Mumbannar line provides for the line to be erected on new poles for the whole distance, viz., 5 miles 43 chains. It will thus be seen that the Dartmoor-Heywood line is a part cheaply constructed line, and the DartmoorMumbannar line is a standard all-pole line. ADDITIONS , NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS , ETC.

34,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.15] - Honourable members who came into this Parliament in the early days of Federation, will remember that, in order to enable works to be carried out in the Commonwealth, it has always been the practice to take up the consideration 'of the Works and Buildings Estimates immediately after the Budget statement.",18
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Are you quite sure about that? Do you mean after the delivery of the Budget, or after the debate on the Budget?",18
36,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It has been the practice, almost, I think, without exception, to take these Estimates immediately after the Budget; but, of course, if the question is going to be contested, I think the Opposition must be heard on the matter. would, however, be a very great convenience if we could discuss and deal with these Estimates even before the debate on the Budget takes place. In recent years, as I pointed out when making the Budget' statement, it has become more urgent than ever that an early opportunity should be given to honourable members to consider and pass the Works and Buildings Estimates, so that the works may be proceeded with. Honourable members have only to look at the aggregate amount set down for these purposes to see that, if we are to make headway as the country desires, we must get an early expression of opinion from this Committee, and from Parliament as a whole, authorizing the various Ministers to proceed with the works outlined in these pages. It is for this reason that the Government have taken the course of bringing these Estimates immediately before the Committee in order to'expedite their passage. Although there is no desire on the part of the Government to restrict the consideration or discussion of any item whatever, it is WORKS hoped that all the items will be passed WORKS COM- within a reasonable time. I shall ask the AND co-operation and concurrence of as many honourable members as may view the matter in the same light as I do, in a suggestion POST OFFICE, that they should restrict their criticism to within as short a space of time as possible. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON.^-You ask us to do that on. every measure, now.",18
37,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am sure the honourable member for Lang will not object to my making a request. That is all I am doing. I am not here to complain of the Opposition discussing, or criticising, or voting on, these items; but I am sure there is no intention on the part of any honourable member to delay the passage of the Estimates which are necessary to enable the works of the Commonwealth to be carried out. Ministers will be'ready at all times to give all the information they have in their possession regarding the items as they come before the Committee. I move That item No. 1, ^8,500, be agreed to.",18
38,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The course which I propose to follow is this: I shall allow a general debate on the first item. We shall then deal with the items in the Estimates individually.,18
39,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ballarat) [3.20]-The first question before us is raised by the suggestion of the Prime Minister, that the Works Estimates should be taken at this stage of our proceedings. It That course is contrary to the usual practice, and to precedents followed elsewhere. But it is a course which has been followed, with good reason I must admit, on more than one occasion, even during the present Parliament. Ther.e are a number of works' which .can be proceeded with more .expeditiously if ' parliamentary sanction can be ' obtained for them at an early date. But, while that is true, it must also be remembered, on the other hand, that these works are subsidiary - and closely related to some of the most important, if not all the important, propositions which the Government are submitting to Parliament. They are, in many cases, intimately connected with the policy of the Government. The questions which are at issue in this general de'-bate necessarily include the whole of the particular propositions which the Works Estimates are intended to authorize. As a consequence, a debate on the first item of these Estimates, commences the discussion in this House of the whole of the financial proposals of the Government, embraces within it the whole sphere covered by these Works Estimates, most of - them subsidiary, in many cases, to what - may be termed the general policy of the - country. In the remaining instances, they - are subsidiary to, and in harmony with, the particular policy which a Government may 'be seeking to introduce, or to continue. Consequently, upon the first item, the House has free scope in regard to all 'the items which appear in the Estimates. The whole of this volume is open to criti-cism. It must be admitted that on many grounds such questions are capable of being more satisfactorily dealt with when the - enormous expenditure which is entailed by the carrying out of these proposals is - taken into account, together with the discussion of principles. Otherwise, it must be at once apparent that no matter what practical advantages there are in getting the Works Estimates, so to speak, - out of the way-gettin g them authorized - havin g the Departments instructed to - proceed with them; whatever practical advantages may accrue from the adoption of that course, there are, notwithstanding, grave disabilities, owing to the fact that by this method of procedure discussion tends to become more speculative than practical. The House will have authorized the execution of the works giving effect to the Budget, which is afterwards to be - debated.  - orable member's Government.",18
40,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have said'that this - course has been followed on several occasions, and have acknowledged the practical advantage arising from it. B.ut I ; am .also pointing out the crippling .effect - of a debate on the' works schedules before the questions of principle and of policy to which they relate have been discussed. In several respects we are putting the cart before the horse. In other respects the horse is being put first, and is doing a great deal of useful service. One very important condition as to this debate is the order of procedure which the Prime Minister proposes to follow in regard to the Budget itself. If the Budget is to be postponed until the closing days-and almost the closing hours-of the session, as it was, I think, the year before last, debate upon it must become perfectly superfluous.",19
41,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I undertake to bring on the Budget debate within a reasonable time.,19
42,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then it is the intention of the Prime Minister to proceed with the Budget debate at once?,19
43,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , early.",19
44,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Subjec t to the necessary introduction of other measures, in order that Parliament may not come to a gap at the close of the Budget debate, I presume that the Prime Minister will postpone the chief items of business until that debate has been disposed of?",19
45,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"After these Estimates go through, the Budget will be the first, and the continuous business of the House-un less, of course, it has to be interrupted for the transaction of some other necessary business.",19
46,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That assurance removes an objection that would naturally be taken if the practice which was allowed in very exceptional circumstances were permitted to encroach upon the ordinary procedure of Parliament, to the very grave injury of some of the most important interests of this country. That practice would enable the principles upon which the policy of the Government was founded to be discussed only after the works intended to give effect to those principles had been authorized. The Prime Minister's statement does, as far as possible, remove that objection as far as is consistent with the immediate taking in hand of the practical proposals before us. hon- Mr FISHER - I pledge myself to do what I have stated.",19
47,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course, I accept the Prime Minister's word without any question and without a pledge. The particular proposals before us in regard to Works will give the Minister of Home Affairs an opportunity-whic h I hope he will take-of answering certain questions recently put to him, most of which are based upon newspaper statements.

48,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I understood that the complaints were general, and covered the employment of day labour in any Departments.  in the trenches for undergrounding work, and that is under the Post and Telegraph Department.",20
49,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course, it is, in one sense.",20
50,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The same applies in all the Departments.  member's motion says, but these works are under the Post and Telegraph Department.",20
51,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have not noticed even that, but have noticed that by letter and otherwise-includin g some verbal statements - complaint s have been made. I am far from saying that these statements are to be accepted without question. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Hear , hear !",20
52,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not insinuating that. But a reply is certainly called for. The Minister of Home Affairs will admitand I speak merely on account of his replies to previous questions-that in his Department at present there are being employed a larger number of persons than at any previous period in the history of the Commonwealth. He will admit that the terms of payment for services rendered are higher than they have ever previously been.' He will admit that there is a great eagerness to obtain Commonwealth employment. When, therefore, a number of private citizensmen of business, men of observation-agre e in stating, from what they Have personally observed, that the officers in charge are not obtaining from the men employed the work which they have been accustomed to give under other conditions, a reply is called for. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They have not made such a charge. There has been no charge made. People have been saying that we are doing too much work.",20
53,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Minister is relying upon the word ""charge."" I am not even putting the matter as strongly as that. These are statements which have been made, authoritatively, and by responsible people. What I am asking is simply that there shall be a reasonable reply to these inquiries, a statement that the Minister is satisfied that he is obtaining for this Commonwealth, which employs him, proper service from the men whom he employs, and his assurance that every safeguard is taken to insure; that a fair return is given.",20
54,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What does the honourable"" member assert that the charge is?",20
55,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is that owing either to laxity or indifference or want of vigilance, on the part of inspectors, men are seem idling their time away when they ought to* be employed, and when they have nothing visibly to excuse their idling. These are the: statements, which I see repeated on every hand. We are at the very outset of thedebate on the Works Estimates, and the Minister should take advantage of the proper opportunity thus afforded him to put himself and his Department right.",20
56,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.31] -<r A statement like that just made by the Leader of the Opposition-base d on assertions made in-, the-public press, or on private information! that he may have at his disposal-that Ministers are not exercising due care in theexpenditure of public money, and that meni employed by the Government are not giving in labour the equivalent of the wagesreceived by them, certainly calls for an reply. Let me say at once that this Government does not knowingly employ anyone from whom it is believed an equivalentin the way of labour is not being obtained-'! for wages paid. That has been, and will-i continue to be, the policy of this Government. As to our sheltering any one in the Service, either because of his political/opinions or 'because of the fear of something happening to this Government if his>services be not retained, such a consideration has never been taken into account, and never shall be, so far as the present Administration are concerned. I wish the Committee and the country to know that the* Government intend to continue the policyt of day labour just so long as it is commensurate with the public welfare, and as- long as they can by that means do betterthan is possible by any other reasonable- system of carrying out public works. The Government, however, are not called upon-, to reply to any mere tittle-tattle, or any attack made upon them by way of innuendo* or otherwise, regarding the manner in which, they are carrying out public works. Our record is before the country, and I repeat that we shall not employ, or retain, in the Public. Service any person who is not giving in labour the equivalent of the Commonwealth money paid to him.",20
57,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But how do the Goalways singled out? vernment know whether they are getting the equivalent of their money?,21
58,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That can be deterin mined only by our responsible omcers. The Minister in charge of each Department is Department. responsible to this House, and if any Minister fails in his duty-if he fails conserve the public interest and the public money-the n we, as a Government, f a i It is far better that the Government should phone wires? fai l as a whole than that any discredit should be brought upon the Commonwealth generally. The charge to which reference has been made has to be proved, but our out that work. policy is that we must receive in labour the equivalent of all wages paid to every ploy6, and that policy applies not casual labour, but to the permanent service.",21
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parramatta) the [3.34] - The Prime Minister's maxims, far as they go, are excellent, and his clear and explicit statement as to the principles which guide him and his colleagues in conthis ducting all these great public works, is gain to the controversy now proceeding on this question. It was due to the country that the Government should enunciate a doctrine so clear and business-like as to which the right honourable gentleman has just given expression. Here we are to vote ,£3,000,000 of public moneys for the carrying out of public works, and just he gives his inspectors. as the people outside have to work hard for their money and to spend it economicnothing ally, so every man in the Government emhave ploy has a right to earn the money which he receives. If that principle is observed then the pay should at least be generous and adequate for the work performed. That is a ""sound doctrine, with which no one will quarrel, but I venture to suggest to the Prime Minister that he still leaves quite untouched the whole field of cononly troversy. He has not dealt with the whole question as put in a nutshell by the honorto able member for Herbert, when he asked, "" How do the Government know that they are receiving the equivalent of the paid?"" We have no proof that everyAffairs. thing is proceeding satisfactorily. We have, on the one side, statements made all seriousness, and nothing in reply, save statements that for the credit of the vernment had better not be made by the Minister of Home Affairs. He does himwas readily agreed to. self no credit by the way he answers these queries from time to time.",21
60,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why is his Department,21
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,For the same reason that the Public Works Department each State is always singled out for criticism of this kind. It is the spending,21
62,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,H is Department to does not carry out postal work.,21
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does it not l. carry out the undergrounding of the tele - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Then all I have to say is that it ought to be carrying  emthat the honourable member has confidence only to in the Minister of Home Affairs.,21
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; but the fact that such work is not carried out by Department of Home Affairs seems to so me to show that there is something wrong in the relationships of these Departments. In normal circumstances- I do not say that principle should apply to every detail a of construction work-the Department of Home Affairs should carry out all the large construction works of the Commonwealth. I suggest to the Minister of Home Affairs that that he should explain to the Committee all the details regarding the carrying out about of these works. He should tell us how they are being carried out, and what power Everything depends on the powers possessed by them,, for so demoralizes men as to cease to any respect for those who are placed over them. If the statements are true that men engaged in certain occupations go over the heads of their inspectors and make application to the Minister to be heard from time to time, then such a want of discipline is calculated to bring into contempt the whole system of day labour. There is one way in which work can be carried out by day labour. I have had something do with the day-labour system in my time, and have had to deal with public criticism of the character now being direcwages ted against the Department of Home In connection with the undergrounding of the telephone and telegraph in wires in New South Wales many years ago, the honourable member for Hume, then Goa member of the State Parliament, asked for a Select Committee, and his request The Government granted a Select Committee, taking care, of course, that its composition was fair, and an exhaustive inquiry was made into all the details of that work.",21
65,Mr THOMAS BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And that inquiry converted the honourable member for Hume to the day-labour principle.,22
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes ; the honourable member for Hume has often said that that inquiry converted him to the day labour principle. We granted him the inquiry with the greatest cordiality, and helped him with it from first to last. If this kind of criticism is going to continue concerning the public works of the Commonwealth, the sooner we have an inquiry the better for all concerned, and especially for the Minister. If day labour can stand oh its own against the contract system, the sooner he demonstrates that to the public the better. That was the issue decided by the Select Committee in New South Wales to which I ' have referred, so far as that work; went. I do not say that it ought to be the issue here; but 1 do say that the Minister is entitled to tell the Committee the precise methods of business that are applied to the construction of these great works.",22
67,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He will do that.,22
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I mean in regard to the employment of day labour in their construction. We require to know whether inspectors, for instance, are given sole control over the men employed under them, and are instructed to see that they their work. We should be told, also, whether it is a fact that men may leave their work at any time they think fit to consult the Prime Minister, or to ask that they might do so. ",22
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The statement made is that the right honourable gentleman's secretary directed them to the Postmaster-General. That was a very proper proceeding, if he did so; but the question is how did they come to be at the door of the right honourable gentleman's Department ?",22
70,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I cannot say anything about that.,22
71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is the very thing we require to know. It is as much in the interests of the Government as in the interests of the public that discipline in the carrying out of public works should be put upon a proper footing if we are to continue the construction of public works by day labour. I admit that there are reasons why the undergrounding of telephone and telegraph wires should be carried out by day labour. It is obvious that work like that under the footpaths of a city is carried on under great difficulties. The foundations of buildings have to be considered, and great care must be taken in connection with all sorts of pipes for gas, water, and sewage. There are, in consequence, a great many risks attending work of this kind, and where it is undertaken by contractors they must make provision to guard against such risks. In the circumstances, it may ' be better- I do not say it is-and more economical for the Departments concerned to take the risks and carry out such work themselves. The fullest inquiry should be made into all these matters, and the most complete statements made to the House respecting them. We should not have the Minister of Home Affairs burlesquing the matter by making statements which reflect no credit upon him. After all, the spending of hundreds of thousands of pounds of the people's money is a serious matter, and should be treated seriously, and a full and complete statement of what is taking place should be made to the House.",22
72,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"East Sydney) [3.43] - I have had no personal charge of work carried out by day labour for a Government, but I have been a keen observer of the way in which such work has been carried out., I believe that the Government Departments receive good value for money exdo pended in that way. No better illustration of the difficulties involved in carrying out some Government works could be given than that mentioned by the honourable member for Parramatta. When it is necessary to make excavations in the streets of a city, no one can estimate what the requirements of the work will be. It is impossible,"" in such cases, for complete specifications to be drawn up before the work is undertaken. The only way in which such work can be carried out effectively and economically is by day labour under the supervision of departmental officers. With respect to the charges which have appeared in the press, honourable members opposite can quite understand that the Contractors' Association make it their business, through the people they have employed, and the journal they run, to condemn the day labour system on every occasion. From the establishment of the system in New South Wales, twenty-five years ago, up to the present time, we have had the same condemnation of it from the same people. The reason is obvious; because it interferes with their business. The honourable member for Illawarra recently quoted from a publication called Building, which is edited by a Mr Taylor. We can quite understand that this gentleman must run the publication in the interests of . the Contractors Association. From the front to the last page of it he must do all he possibly can to make the day-labour system appear as bad as possible in the eyes of the public. 'When the conductor of such a publication can stoop so low as to publish an illustration of the residence recently purchased by the Prime Minister and describe in the next issue the house occupied by the Attorney-General, intimating his intention, if possible, to cover what kind of houses are occupied by the other members of the Government, it is not difficult to believe that he will pubPost-office, lish anything which may belittle the day labour system. From my experience and knowledge of contracts, I am satisfied that it would be unadvisable to abandon the day labour system in the carrying out of Government works. In view of the extensive works which require to be carried out for the Commonwealth, I think it would be wise to appoint a Works Committee of some kind to report upon some of the big undertakings which confront us. A great deal of information might be obtained as the result of inquiries by honourable members who have a knowledge of such matters. Their reports would give members ' generally greater confidence that the money voted for the Works Department would be expended advantageously. I wish to make a short reference to the condition of affairs in Sydney Post-office. I see that on these Estimates a vote of .£500 is put down for works in connection with that building. We might just as well put the money in the gutter, because that amount is ridiculously inadequate to carry out the improvements which require to be made there. The Sydney newspapers have for some time past been directing the attention of the'authoriis ties and the public to the fact that it is impossible, under existing conditions, for people to be properly served in that post office. 'A boy sent to purchase J £ I worth of stamps has to wait for over an hour before he can be served. Owing to lack of space, the same thing may be said of other branches of the office. I hope that something will shortly be done to relieve the existing congestion. I do not know whether I shall be in order, on these Estimates, in referring to another matter connected with the post-office. I allude to the facilities afforded for the sale of stamps. I have said that a person requiring to purchase £,1 worth of stamps at the Sydney Post-office has to wait for about an hour before he can be served, because of the crowd at the counter. This difficulty might be obviated if more licences were issued for the sale of stamps. There appears to be a desire to save the 2J per oent. commission paid to persons who are given a licence to sell stamps; but if I were Postmaster-General, 1 should issue a great many more of these licences. I believe that the damage to and loss of stamps by persons authorized to sell them would cover the commission, and the Department would disgain, rather than lose, by extending these facilities for the purchase of stamps by the public. Referring again to the Sydney I repeat my hope that something will be done to remedy the congestion existing there. The building was commenced! about forty years ago, when it was impossible to foresee the growth of Sydney. It isstrange that the Government do not provide much better facilities for the transaction of post and telegraph business than exist at present in the Sydney Post-office. I hope that my remarks will have the effect of causing the Government to make some movement, because the longer the delay, the greater the cost, and an opportunity is presented now which, as is known to the Government officials, may not again occur.",22
73,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Swan) [3.51] I am glad that the consideration of these Estimates is being undertaken at once, be the cause, under our financial system, we cannot afford to wait until the main Appropriation Bill is passed, half of the year having then elapsed. Although the course now pursued is not quite so regular as we should like if the conditions were different, the Government are, I think, acting wisely in submitting these Estimates at the first opportunity. Doubtless some interest taken away from the general Estimates, and we are not able to give very much time to these Works Estimates, inasmuch as we are all anxious to see these public works put in hand immediately. The difficulty that presents itself to my mind, as it has doubtless presented itself to others, in considering the Estimates, is that of ascertaining what money there really is in the hands of the Government, how much is being spent, and what balance is likely to remain at the end of the year. This difficulty, as I shall show, is real, and in no sense imaginary. We desire more light from the Treasurer.",23
74,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I shall give it to the right honourable member.,24
75,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The omcers at the Treasury are, I know, experienced, capable, and reliable, and we are fortunate in having such men to look after our financial affairs.",24
76,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Le t me know what is wanted, and I shall endeavour to give the information.",24
77,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It would be of great advantage if there were a balance sheet prepared showing the ordinary revenue and expenditure-money s in hand from all sources, including loan and trust - funds-and our liabilities for the year on account of all services, in addition to the amount we propose to expend in the ordinary way.",24
78,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What liabilities, may ask?",24
79,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The expenditure from loan funds, trust funds, and such like.",24
80,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What for?,24
81,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In order that we may know how much money the Government have in hand, how much they are going to spend, how they intend to spend it, and what balance they expect at the end of the year. I do not make these suggestions in any unfriendly spirit, but in order that we may have as much information as possible. The estimated expenditure on "" Additions, New Works, and Buildings"" is .£3,985,921. On the construction of the Fleet it is proposed to expend .£1,196,829; but this amount, although it is shown as a charge against revenue, is money already in hand. This is a balance from the Trust Account, and has already been charged as expenditure; it is shown as expenditure again, but, as honourable members will see, it is put right by being included with other moneys in the deduction of ,£2,261,541 from funds accumulated in previous years. The annual votes amount to .£2,789,092, which, together with the special appropriation .for the construction of the Fleet, brings the total to .£3,985,921. The annual vote under the control of the Department of Home Affairs amounts to .£991,647 ; and of the Postmaster-General, to ,£830,000; and here I may point out that this is not the real amount of money that the Postmaster General is provided with for the year to spend. He has £[429,460 in the Trust Fund as a sort of nest-egg; so that he will be able to expend .£1,259,460. Unless honourable members look closely into these accounts, they will not observe that ,£429,460 is already appropriated and available for the Postmaster-General in the Trust Fund.",24
82,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I made that very clear in my Budget-speech.,24
83,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The annual vote under the control of the Treasury is ,£4,400; the Defence Department, £[900,925; and the Department of External Affairs, £[62,120; making a total for the annual votes, as I said before, of £[2,789,092. We all listened with much attention to the Budget-speech, but it is not possible to keep in our minds everything that is said, although, of course, we can refer to the official report; and the accounts on their face show clearly that this I £[429,460 is in a Trust Fund, and available, as well as the £[830,000. I am sorry to say that during the past year a good many sums voted have not been expended. Perhaps this is not easy to avoid, but every effort should be made to expend money on the purposes for which it is voted. There is nothing more unsatisfactory to the people generally than to find money voted for, say, a post-office or a drill-hall, and the work not to be carried out. Post-office buildings are, of course, very necessary, but we find lhat we are asked to re-vote £[74,607 under this head; while, on Defence, the re-votes amount to £[142,792; on Trade and Customs account, £[1,678 ; and on lighthouses, £[2,500. In regard to the lighthouses, not a penny of the money voted last year was spent. In connection with quarantine, ,£18,000 has to be re-voted; while in connection with the Federal Capital and the stores on Darling Island, we have to re-vcte £[39,409. Altogether, last year there was £[278,466 voted, and not spent, although the works are those in which the people generally take great interest. There is another direction in which I desire to see an improvement. I allude to the practice which exists of securing parliamentary votes, and nof spending them at all. My former reference was to the practice of inducing Parliament to authorize votes, and not spending the whole of them. Last year thirty-eight distinct separate votes were obtained for public buildings, not including post-offices-vote s amounting to £[51,291, in addition to forty-nine distinct separate votes for post-offices aggregating £[37,046, making a total of .£88,337, not a single penny of which was spent.",24
84,Mr SCULLIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I thought the complaint was that the Government had spent too much ?,25
85,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have not said a word in reference to the Ministry having expended too much. We might spend a hundred times as much as is being spent, and still be doing good. 1 make that statement without at all assenting to the proposition that we should extract a lot of money from the people that we can do without. But in reclaiming the wilderness and building up Australia and filling it with desirable people, I do not know how much could not be profitably expended. However, the fact remains that £[88,337 was voted last year upon eighty-seven distinct separate works, not one single penny of which was expended. The Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill was assented to on the 17th November, 1911, seven and a half months before the end of the financial year.",25
86,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course, some of the contracts were outrageously high.",25
87,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But none of these eighty-seven works was commenced. I do not wish to be too hard on the Department of Home Affairs, because I appreciate the troubles which are experienced by the Minister. I know that sometimes it is difficult to get plans out, to select a site, and to get a work put in hand quickly. But when I hear so much boasting about his Department being a "" business Department,"" and when I am told that a new rtgime has been instituted, so that things are done very differently now from what they used to be, I am justified in calling attention to these matters.",25
88,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A new broom.,25
89,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the Minister of Home Affairs did not boast so much about his "" business capacity"" I would not, perhaps, taunt him with the fact that last year votes were obtained for eightyseven works, including forty-nine post offices, and yet not a single penny was spent upon them. If I may be pardoned for being parochial for a moment, I may refer to my own State in this connection. It seems to me that there is room for great - dissatisfaction there, inasmuch as last year ,£28,888 was voted for nine works, including some post-offices, of which only £[8,596 was expended. In addition £[15,200 was voted for four Defence buildings and ten post-offices, but not a single penny was spent. Honourable members vvill realise that when the residents in sparselypopulated districts are told that a vote has been agreed to by Parliament for the erection of a post-office or other building in their locality, and when the whole year passes without anything being done, great dissatisfaction is caused. In Western Australia £[37,136 was voted last year for post-offices, but only £[18,254 was spent. Similarly upon defence works £[49,328 was voted, but only £[18,780 was expended. In other words, £[86,464 was voted for these two important services, and o n t y ^37i°34 expended. Roughly speaking, therefore, no less a sum than £[50,000 was unexpended. I hope that the Minister of Home Affairs will take a note of this matter, and insist that when Parliament votes money for specific works they shall be proceeded with as quickly as possible. In olden times we were not in a hurry to put public works in hand, because we used to be short of money; but that is not the case now. There is now plenty of money available.. Every endeavour should be made to have works authorized by Parliament commenced at the earliest possible date. It is proposed to vote several amounts which are to be paid into the Trust Fund: That fund was brought into existence with the best of intentions, and principally to provide for trading accounts. For instance, in the matter of rifles, clothing, &c, a Department receives certain moneys for the goods which it sells. It is quite reasonable that a Department which runs trading accounts should desire that it should be debited with its ordinary expenditure and credited with its ordinary revenue, and that it should be paid for anything which it may manufacture or sell. Notwithstanding this, I think the time has arrived when Parliament and the Treasurer should devote serious attention to this Trust Fund. It is assuming altogether too big dimensions. Although we have the good fortune to possess officers of very great ability in the Treasury, the fund is now getting into a complicated condition. I have had to consult the Treasury several _ times to ascertain what this item or that item means.",25
90,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And the right honourable gentleman got an answer every time.,25
91,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , I received a full explanation every time, but it was not quite satisfactory to me. When I tell honourable members that the Trust Fund amounted to £[i5,44 >5 OH-the 30th June last, they will see that the figures are getting very large. On the 30th June, 1911, there was £[11,530,306 to the credit of the Trust Fund, and during the year there were receipts to the amount of £[14,103,260. During the year, therefore, there was in the Trust Fund £[25,633,566, while the expenditure was £[10,190,998, leaving as a credit balance on the 30th June last the enormous sum of £ [ i 5 , 4 4 , 5 majority of these heads on which the Trust Fund is based should be abolished. If they are not, the time will soon come when they will be abolished by the House, and a better system adopted, so that the Parliament will know what the amount in the Treasury is, how much the Government need to spend, and what balance they will have at the end of the year. Take, for instance, the expenditures on old-age pensions and Fleet construction. I cannot see any reason why these items should be included in the Trust Fund. They could just as well be managed without being in the fund. All that the Treasurer wants is a vote for the year, the same as he takes for anything else._ He should let the House know what he is doing, as he does with regard to railways and other works of construction. That plan would work better and avoid having these large amounts in the Trust Fund.",25
92,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is a very subtle argument.,26
93,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There is nothing subtle about the matter. I am speaking from knowledge. I am making these remarks as much in the interests of the Government as I am in the interests of the country.,26
94,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It looks to me as if the right honourable gentleman wanted the surplus to go to the States.,26
95,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; I may have something to say about that matter. There is no necessity for the Treasurer to pursue this system. I think that it keeps back information which should be clearly before Parliament. I hope that the honourable gentleman will see whether he cannot largely adopt my suggestion. ing telegraphs and telephones, this year there is available for expenditure £[830,000-bu t there is £[429,460 in the Trust Fund, making a total of £[1,259,460, instead of what I thought at first on looking at the Estimates, £[830,000. This, I think, shows the difficulty of ascertaining the amount which is really available. 2 68 It is hidden away in the Trust Fund. One can find the figures by searching the Budget-papers, and I have found them. At the same time. I found the Loan Account; but if I had not made this search I would not have come across it. I was not aware that in the Loan Account there was a credit balance of £[39,525. Take the Small Arms Ammunition Fund. This is a trading account, in which purchases and sales 2 68 The continually take place. There was an item °f £[ 77>73 on the last Estimates, and 1 I there was a balance of £[28,863 m the Trust Fund, making a total amount of £[206,594 available for last year. I find an item of £[12,600 on these Estimates, an item of £[152,210 on the General Estimates, and, hidden away in the Trust Fund-no t mentioned anywhere in these figures-a balance of £[89,767, so that there is a total amount of £[254,577 available to the Government for smaU arms ammunition. No honourable member could see the position by a mere inspection of the papers-h e would have to ferret out the information. The amount of money which is available is not, I think, shown as clearly as it should be shown. Then, in regard to the Loan Account, unless one searches the Budget figures, he will not find anything about the Loan Account in the Estimates. Seven hundred thousand, pounds have been borrowed, and of that sum £[660,475 have been spent. That is stated at page 65 of the Budget-papers. It is nowhere shown in the Estimates that there was a balance of £[39,525 in the Loan Fund, and that the Treasurer had s P t £[400,000 in the purchase of en land and the erection of a building in London, £[226,000 on the redemption of South Australian Treasury bills in connection with the Northern Territory, and £[34,476 on the South Australian railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. There is an Act which authorizes the Government to borrow £[2,460,476, namely, £[600,000 for the purchase of land in the Federal Capital Territory, and doing work there ; £[1,000,000 for the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway; Regard- £[600,000 for the purchase of land and erection of buildings in London, and £[226,000 for payments to South Australia. We only get this information by looking to the Act. We do not find it stated unless we examine the Budget-papers that only £[700,000 of that sum has been borrowed yet. There is a balance of £[39,525 to the credit of the Loan Fund. Nowhere is that shown as an asset.",26
96,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We do not show £LSS6tS Sir' JOHN FORREST - It is shown - in some of these Budget-papers.,27
97,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We do not show liabilities and assets.,27
98,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Treasurer ought to show when he has cash. This sum of .£39,525 is, not mentioned in the Trust Fund. It is included amongst - the balances, so I am informed, at the top of page 3 of the Budgetpapers, and is included in the. cash' item of £[1,694,035. Does the House realise that the expenditure of £[3,000,000 or £[4,000,000 on the trans-Australian railwav is being left absolutely in the hands of the Minister of Home Affairs? No estimates of expenditure in connection with the work have been placed before Parliament, and we know nothing as to the salaries to be paid, the number of men to be employed, what it is proposed to do, or what methods it is proposed to follow. The Treasury apparently has no knowledge of what is to be - done by the Department of Home Affairs. In the States the day has long since passed when loan expenditure was allowed to pass without being scrutinized most carefully.",27
99,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That will be done here.,27
100,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not know why the. Prime Minister permits the present arrangement to continue for a day. There should have been a statement regarding the expenditure on the Trans-Australian railway and all other works to be constructed out of loans. Such a statement should be put before Parliament immediately.,27
101,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That will be done.,27
102,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The right honourable member's time has expired.,27
103,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"South Sydney) [4.23] - I draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that of the amount voted last year for expenditure on the Federal Capital, £[31,000 was not spent. I ask the - right honourable gentleman if the Government has any definite works policy in regard, to the Federal Capital, or is it content to - proceed in a slip-shod fashion, without formulating a policy ? - This is not the way in which a great national undertaking should 'be dealt with. We have spent an enormous sum onresuming land in the Federal ""Territory, and have spent money on constructing roads and providing accommodation for those connected with the Military College. But the more settlement increases any in the Territory, the more the value of the land there will increase.",27
104,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We have got value for our money in the land that we have resumed.,27
105,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes ; but that land is not being put to its proper use. The honourable member for Swan mentioned a number of works for which money was voted and not spent, and in so doing put his finger upon the weak spot of the administration of the Home Affairs Department. Apparently the staff of the Department is not large enough to enable it to carry out all the works for which Parliament votes money. But the Government should see that money rated by Parliament is spent. The time has arrived when we should have a Works Committee and a works policy. What is the use of voting money if it is not to be spent? Last year there was a flourish of trumpets about the proposal to establish a timber-storing shed, and money was voted for the project, but nothing was spent, and this year we are asked to make another vote. We should have some explanation as to why the work is not carried out. Is not the Department capable of acquiring the necessary land, and constructing buildings for this project? If timber had been bought 'and stored, it would now be seasoning in anticipation of its use. I wish to know what the Department intends to do in regard to the Federal Capital. Competitive designs have been received and dealt with, but, apparently, nothing has been done towards planning the city. The Minister told me that plans could not be drawn until sites had been selected. That is moonshine. Plans could be drawn for the accommodation above the basement line of the various buildings. The Minister knows what buildings are needed, and what their capacity must be. Such buildings should be planned above the basement line, and when their sites have been chosen, basements can be built up to suit the plans. A large number of immigrants are now coming to the country, and we should give employment to all that can be employed to push on with necessary works. In Victoria of late a great many artisans have been out of work, and yet the Home Affairs Department has money which it cannot spend. Apparently there are not enough architects and' overseers. I hope that the Minister will enlarge his staff. Another matter to which I direct attention is the congestion, at: the Sydney General Post. 1692 Additions, New Works, Office. In the stamp-selling room, persons stand at the counters five and six deep; the telegraph despatch room is always full , and the telephone cabinets are always occupied, while many persons wait outside to get connexions. It is a scandal that the Government does not give greater conveniences to the public there. What is necessary is to resume land for the enlargement of the building. The alterations that have been made have bettered things a little, but there is still not enough room. I hope that we shall have a statement as to what is to be done. The Minister of Home Affairs told us last year about the brickworks he is going to provide for, but no preparation for the making of bricks has yet taken place. He was also going to provide lime works, cement works, sewerage works, and underground tunnels for telephone wires; but nothing has been done. Indeed, grass is now growing on streets that have been formed. No doubt the Department's inaction is due to the desire to please the Victorian representatives in Parliament. I again appeal to the Prime Minister to say whether, in his opinion, the time has not arrived, seeing that we are spending so much money on buildings and works generally, to form a Public Works Committee in , this House, the Committee to go through the plans, and see that the works are car^ ried out properly. Its appointment, will be no reflection upon the Departments.",27
106,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"All Public Works Committees are drag-anchors; they are delay associations. If we had a Public Works Committee in this House, we should not be able to carry out one-tenth of the work that we do.",28
107,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That does not apply to New South Wales.,28
108,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It does; ask honourable members who know.,28
109,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"- I will compare the public works policy of New South Wales with that of this Government, as shown by the list of works read today by the honourable member for Swan as having been passed by this Parliament, and not even started yet. The Public Works Committee of New South Wales keep ahead of the work of the Parliament.",28
110,Mr SCULLIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member mean a Public Works Department?,28

112,Mr SCULLIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think it is absurd.,28
113,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Perhaps the honourable member has had no experience. It has saved the New South Wales Government millions of pounds.,28
114,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We are dependent upon the Public Works officers to get the plans prepared. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Public Works officers of the States.,28
115,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am aware of it , and yet the Prime Minister says the public works policy of the States is not up to ours.",28
116,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Nobod y did anything until we came into power.,28
117,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Government have not done very much in the last' year, seeing that so much money .has been voted and that in some cases nothing whatever has been done.",28
118,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member has not looked at the Estimates.,28
119,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am accepting the statements of the honourable member for Swan. He has been through these Estimates more than I have, and I take his word for it. Is it not better to have a Committee of this House to go through any large work that is to be undertaken, and recommend it to this House, than to depend upon the omcers of a certain Department, and on a certain Minister ?",28
120,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We have to depend on them afterwards to carry the work out.,28
121,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"An y system will be preferable to the present one, which has hung up so many public works. I appeal to the Treasurer to give some consideration to the congested state of the Sydney Post office. Something will have to be donethere to cope with the business. When the question of establishing the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong comes before the Committee, I shall be only too pleased to utter a few well-chosen words upon it .",28
122,Mr RICHARDFOST ER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wakefield) [4-35]-- I do not share the anxiety of the honourable member for South Sydney about the slow progress of the Federal Capital. In my opinion, nearly every public work in the Commonwealth ought to have precedence over the work at that spot. This applies particularly to the work of extending, postal and telephonic facilities to outlying districts. I agree with the honourable member that the creation of a Public WorksCommittee in this House, on the lines of the Committee that has been in existence inNew South Wales for many years, wouldr be a distinct improvement on present methods. Individual members know very little indeed about the details of public penditure, for which every member of the House ought to feel an individual responsibility. The public expenditure of the Commonwealth does not merely concern the Ministry of the day and the particular Minister controlling the Department in which the expenditure is incurred, but each individual member of the House ought to feel a distinct responsibility regarding it. I was glad to hear the Prime Minister say that the policy of the Government was to continue the day-labour system so long as they were satisfied that they obtained a return for the expenditure involved. We must all agree that that is a proper policy, but we want to be assured that it is carried out. I am not at all satisfied that it Reference was made today to the allegations made recently by the Argus, and the Minister of Home Affairs characterized them as a tissue of lies. We want more than the word of the Minister in this matter. We require, a stronger refutation to the statements that have been made, not only in the Argus, but repeatedly in the public press in different parts of the Commonwealth. I shall be dissatisfied, and I hope that a majority of the members of this House will refuse to be satisfied, until statements are refuted by a complete inquiry into the work, and an examination of the omcers who are responsible for it. I am not opposed to day labour, but I am very strongly opposed to day labour as it is conducted today, because we have no check on it at all.",28
123,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I hope that is not true.,29
124,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Unfortunately, it is absolutely true. Some honourable members on the other side referred to experiences in New South Wales, but that was a very unfortunate reference, because public inquiry into the question in that State a few years ago established beyond the shadow of a doubt that political interference had come into play, and that works conducted on the day-labour principle were costing 50, 60, and even 100 per cent, more than they ought to cost. The matter as it stands today is a public scandal.",29
125,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member is referring, I suppose, to uncongenial manual labour that he never does himself.",29
126,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am referring to manual labour and the inefficiency of oversight and control, which is responsible in respect of some of the public works today in the Commonwealth for a ex- cost of anything up to 50 per cent., and in some cases 100 per cent., more than the works ought to cost. Mr Charlton*-In the Commonwealth?",29
127,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes .,29

130,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am glad that honourable members opposite have fair brought me to that point, because I wanted to come to it. These allegations are made. I cannot prove them, but honourable members opposite, by their conduct, are showis. ing the weakness and rottenness of existing conditions. They cannot prove whether these allegations are right or wrong. 1 challenge them to say if they can prove that the published statements are not correct",29
131,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We are not making them.,29
132,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"This is a serious matter, and I want to probe it to the bone. I am qualifying my charge by saying that I am not in a position to prove the allegations or to disprove them; but I the ought to be. As a member of this House, I want to be in a position of proving their truth or otherwise.",29
133,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Le t the honourable member go and have a look at the men at work.,29
134,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have seen this sort of thing with my own eyes. From observation I can say that what is; alleged is absolutely true.,29
135,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member is making the charge, then?",29
136,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , and I say that it is absolutely true; but I want to know to what extent it is true.",29
137,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will the honourable member tell us what he saw?,29

157,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I believe that this loose way of doing business is costing this country tens of thousands a year- I might say hundreds of thousands. will give one illustration from my own State. A little while ago Parliament authorized the construction of a railway to Brown's Well. Tenders were called for.,30
158,Mr CANN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Was that a Commonwealth,30
159,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , but it was a work undertaken under Labour administration. In South Australia the Legislative Council always insists on the insertion of a clause in a Railway Bill providing for construction after public explatenders have been called for. The Government Department tendered for to have the work at £155,000. A contractor tendered for £[105,000, and another contractor for £[89,000. The day after the contract was let the contractor who was the work advertised in the Adelaide newspapers for men to build the railway. He announced that he was ready to pay is. a day more than the highest wage paid by the Labour Government in South Australia on its own works.",30
160,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Some of the contractors in South Australia urged the labourers to induce the Labour Government to raise wages.,31
161,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No one is complaining about the increase of wages. They have been increased again and again, and very properly so. But the complaint is that, although wages are increased, men are giving a lesser return for a higher wage. That is the explanation of the financial position in regard to Commonwealth works. It is due to the added cost which the people have to meet in consequence of the existing bad administration and control.",31
162,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is that railway finished yet? O,31
163,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The work is proceeding very rapidly, and will be finished a great deal sooner than the Government could have finished it. The men will be paid higher wages also, but there will not have been any loafing. That is the explanation of the whole business. Moreover, the contractor will not endure any political interference. Mr Laird SMiTH -^Will the honourable member say how much work will have to be done after the railway is supposed to be completed?",31
164,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The man who is building that line is just as efficient as the best Government officers in the whole Commonwealth, State or Federal. I know that from the work which he has done previously. I am well aware that there are some kinds of work that it is inadvisable to have done by public tender. Undergrounding work such as that which has been referred to this afternoon is of that character, because the conditions are such that no officer can possibly estimate what work of the kind is likely to be worth. Consequently, if it were to be let by public tender, the departmental officers in making an arrangement with a contractor would have to allow a very wide margin to cover contingencies. But there are other workspossibly the greater proportion of public works undertaken by the Commonwealththat could be let by public tender. Why not do, as has, been done by South Australia for many years-cal l for tenders for these works, and allow the Department to tender with outside contractors?",31
165,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is fair. Mr RICHARD. FOSTER - It is, and until such a test is instituted, it is impossible for us to know what sort of deal we are getting.",31
166,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Tlj e question is whether 9s. a day is a munificent wage to pay a man for working in the trenches?,31
167,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The question is how. much work the Government get for their 9s. a day ? It would be better to pay ios. or 12s. a day for good men than to employ wasters at 8s. a day.,31
168,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Wit h that wage you would probably get good men.,31
169,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is, in that respect, that a private contractor has an advantage over the Government. He will pay higher wages, and employ only good men. Very often, however, in connection with Government works, when you have obtained all the good men that you can secure, you have to take on the duffers and the wasters. Is it true, as is alleged, that these wasters are put on because some member of Parliamentinterferes-becaus e of political influence?  honourable member interfered in that way?",31
170,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have never done so, and never shall do so; but I know of many cases where members of Parliament, and even Ministers of the Crown, have interfered.  wealth works?",31
171,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; I have known such a thing to occur in more than one State, but I do not know what is the position in connection with Commonwealth works, and I cannot get to know.",31
172,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why should not a member of Parliament recommend a man for employment if he knows him to be a good worker?,31
173,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have no objection to that, but I do object to a member of Parliament, when a man has been sacked because he is a waster, going to the responsible Minister and asking him to reinstate that man.",31
174,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We all object to that.,31
175,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is done. Mr KING O'MALLEY"" - Where ?",31
176,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I want the Minister of Home Affairs to give us a chance to prove where it is done. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Well , I shall say that it is an absolute falsehood.",31
177,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I will not take the honourable member's statement. Mr KING O'MALLEY - And I will not take the honourable member's statement.,31
178,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I will not take the Minister's statement, and have no right to be expected to do so. The CHAIRMAN.T-It is the practice of the House for an honourable member to accept the statement of another honourable member.",31
179,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then I will accept the Minister's statement, but I shall ask the Prime Minister to give us an opportunity to prove its correctness or wise. This is a very serious matter, affect' ing not only members of Parliament, but the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. It is one of the burning questions of the day.",32
180,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I wish the honourable member would make a direct charge.,32
181,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If I were in a position to know as much of what the Ministry is doing as the honourable member and the rest of the Caucus are, I would make some very definite charges.",32
182,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I can assure the honourable member I know nothing.  Wakefield is making statements in regard to Government works. Let him give us a direct charge, and I will vote with him for the appointment of a Select Committee.",32
183,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,So will I .,32
184,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I invite honourable members opposite to read the - statements made by the Minister of Public Works in the Labour Administration of New South Wales. While in New South Wales a few days ago, I inspected some public works in course of construction there, because they were of a character that I desired to see carried out in South Australia. I wished to ascertain what they cost, because 1I have been advocating similar work in South Australia for the last fifteen years. The man in charge told me what the estimated cost was, but, he added, "" We have not finished yet, but they have cost double what they were estimated to cost.""",32
185,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What works are they?,32
186,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They relate to the railways, and consist chiefly of facilities for handling produce. I make these statements today with the reservation that I , and honourable members generally, cannot prove their trutli or otherwise. We desire to be able to do so, and I , therefore, wish to know whether the Prime Minister, who stated today a policy - with which every one will agree, will - give us an opportunity to ascertain whether or not that policy is put into practice. The statement made oy the Minister of Home Affairs is not good enough. I ask honourable members opposite if they agree with - two statements made today by the Minister of Home Affairs in answer to questions put to him, and whether they think they indicate an administration of public affairs that should commend itself to them?",32
187,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the honourable member believe in "" speeding up ""?",32
188,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I fancy other- that the honourable member would be one of the weary ones; I do not think he would be a man to "" speed up."" The time allotted to me under the Standing Orders has now almost expired. I have only to say that I feel very strongly regarding this question, and that I have had to speak very plainly to the Minister of Home Affairs- a great deal more plainly than it is pleasant for me to haVe to do; but I tell the Minister straight out that he will get no peace from me until we have a public inquiry, and establish the truth or otherwise of these charges.",32
189,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Adelaide-Honorar y Minister) [4.57] - The extravagant and irresponsible utterances of the honourable member who has seen fit anonymously to slander both officers and manual workers in the Commonwealth service .,32
190,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not officers. I did not speak of the workers either. I referred only to loafers.,32
191,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The extravagant and irresponsible utterances of the honourable member, in which, l'nder cover of parliamentary privilege, - he deliberately slandered officers and workmen in the Government service, might well be allowed to go but for the fact that they will appear in print, and may be read by some persons who do not know him. We have had from the honourable member certain statements, to the effect that persons employed in the Government service are not giving a reasonable return for the wage paid them'.",32
192,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is right.,32
193,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member at first made these statements as a reference to something, which actually existed. Called to question, he said, "" J. am giving my statement of alleged facts,"" indicating very clearly that he had nothing whatever to support the assertions. he was making, except that some one had alleged something. He proceeded to say that he was unacquainted with the position, and that it was impossible for him either to assert or to refute anything until he had obtained some more information. An honourable member, however , ought not to 1 make assertions in this House until he has something to support them. He ought not to proceed on idle allegations, and make assertions which slander the inspectors and the official staff generally of the Department of Home Affairs. He ought not, in such circumstances, under cover of parliamentary privilege, to assert that practically all the men working for the Department of Home Affairs are loafers and wasters.",32
194,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He neither asserted nor inferred anything of the kind, and the honourable member knows it.",33
195,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The time, perhaps, has arrived when honourable members on the opposite side may be given to understand that, while it is their bounden duty to criticise, and while it is their duty to call the attention of the House and the public generally to anything that is being done of a character that ought not to be done, or to any errors on the part of the Ministry, it is not their duty, under cover of parliamentary privilege, to assert that all the persons working in the Department of Home Affairs are loafers and wasters.",33
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I rise to order. The honourable gentleman has just made a statement which includes the whole of the members of the Opposition. Referring to the Opposition, he said that they had made statements which slandered officers and men of the Works Department. It is a most offensive statement, and I ask that it shall be withdrawn unless some substantial proof of it is forthcoming.",33
197,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable gentleman made such a statement, he will withdraw it ; but I understood him to be referring to a speech made by the honourable member for Wakefield.",33
198,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,In addition to the statements made by the honourable member for Wakefield,33
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I rise to order. I require the words of which I have complained to be withdrawn. I am a member of the Opposition.,33
200,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have already, ruled that if the honourable member for Adelaide referred to members of the Opposition generally he must withdraw the statethat ment.",33
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Certainl y he did, or I should not be standing where I am. I am a member of the Opposition.

It was most offensive of the honourable member to make a charge of that kind.",33
202,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"On the point of order, I wish to say",33
203,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Order ! I have asked the honourable member for Adelaide to withdraw the statement objected to, if he made it.",33
204,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I made no such charge as is alleged by the honourable member for Parramatta.,33
205,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I heard it.,33
206,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The whole difficulty is that the reply I am endeavouring to make to the extravagant utterances of the honorabe member for Wakefield is of a character to rile the honourable member for Parramatta, and with the acuteness characteristic of him, the honourable member seeks to create an impression in another direction in order to lessen the severity of the castigation which he knows the honourable member for Wakefield is deserving of. I come now to another feature of the remarks made by the honourable member for Wakefield, to the effect that supervision, in so far as public works are concerned in the Home ""Affairs Department, and under the Government generally, is of such a character that men are not giving an adequate return for the wages paid to them. The honourable member must know that he is making charges against inspectors, foremen, supervising engineers, and, in fact, against men in official positions throughout the Public Service. So far as I understand the situation, every officer in the Government service knows well the policy of the Ministry, and that they are expected to get a fair return from all under them in the execution of their duty. If , as alleged by the honourable member for Wakefield, there are public officers who are not properly supervising the work intrusted to them; if there are officers whose supervision ib insufficient to prevent those under them neglecting their work, it is the bounden duty of the honourable member to tell us who those officers are. It is not the duty of any honourable member to rise in his place in this House and make a general charge to the effect the supervision of Government works is of such a character that loafers and wasters are. continued in the employment of the Government. If there are loafers and wasters employed, responsible officers have neglected their duty. The honourable memwas ber for Wakefield has never specified any We have nothing but reckless charges, and it is unfortunate that, in such circumstances, any honourable member, under cover of the privileges of Parliament, should attempt malign public officers or those under them. If ' the r e are any manual workers in vernment employ who, as allegedby the honourable member, are loafers or wasters, which Department is concerned. it is his duty, and the duty of newspapers every other honourable member knows of such a thing, to bring the it is in the Post and Telegraph matter before Parliament. If there be ment. one such case, or the matter be somewhat trivial, it is at least the duty of any orable member who knows it to bring i before the Minister concerned. I venture strength of allegations to suggest that no Minister at present ocwhere? cupying the Treasury bench, and no hon the orable gentleman who previously occupied it, would neglect to have such a matter vestigated at once, and, if the charge proved, to have the offender summarily dismissed from the Public Service. I can appeal, despite the little differences we have occasionally, to honourable members the Sydney opposite to say whether it is a fair thing Worker t for any member of this House to come here in a fine, large, general way, with ledged inability, and without data, to specify a single instance of what is complained of, and assert that the inspectorial staff not doing their duty, and are conniving, and winking the eye, at the employment loafers and wasters. It is distinctly unfair in the circumstances. If I knew of an instance of such a thing, it would be my duty to call attention to it. If it were an isolated case, or there were one or two instances of the kind, I should feel it my duty to go to the Minister concerned. The honourable member for Wakefield, who tells course. us that he knows of these things from own personal observation, has deliberately neglected his duty. If he is personally aware of instances of the employment loafers and wasters in the Public Service, he should have called the attention of the Minister concerned to the fact. He should have specified the particular instances, the Minister might be in a position to make inquiries on the spot. But, as a matter fact, now that the honourable member has cooled down, he knows that he has been the making wild, reckless, and extravagant this charges.",33

208,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable memtion, ber says that he does not, and that he will make these charges again.; but he knows most that he has been making reckless charges. There is no evidence to substantiate his statement, which, so far as I can see, was to made only on the strength of a statement published in the press to the effect that Gosomething is wrong in the Government Service. There has been some confusion as to Some have asserted that it is in the who Home Affairs Department, and others that DepartThe honourable member for Wakefield, with his usual carelessness, has seized honhold of these allegations and proceeded to t make still more reckless charges, on the that appeared, In the newspapers. Let me put position plainly to the honourable member. Suppose there were certain persons inin Australia who were about to have some were dealings with the honourable member, and desired some proof of his bona fides. Would he send them to the Daily 'Herald, of South Australia, for a character, or. to Worker, or the Brisbane",34

211,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The . newspapers referred to would give the honourable member a bad character, I suppose?",34
212,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Thos e that know the honourable member. This is all political, of Because some statement appears his in a newspaper, which every one knows does its best to injure this side of the House, the honourable member seizes the opof portunity to make a charge which he must now very much regret. I respect very highly the utterances by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy'Leader of the that Opposition, both of whom dealt with the matter in such a manner as to meet with the of approval of every honourable member. They spoke, as they ought to do, as members of Opposition, whose duty it is to criticise side with a full appreciation of the responsibility attaching to their position. Neither honourable gentleman so far forgot himself as to make wild, extravagant, reckless charges without a shadow of foundaand then seek, because of statements appearing in a newspaper called the Argus, to have appointed a Select Committee to inquire into the allegations made. ing that by some awful catastrophe honourable members opposite were in power, and the Daily Herald, of Adelaide, or the Worker, of New South Wales or Queensland, or the Labour Call, of Victoria, made some statements respecting their administration, would they immediately ask the House to appoint a Select Committee?",34

Something has been said about some railway tender in South Australia, in regard to which misrepresentations may be made to the public. It was desired to construct a few miles of railway from Tailem Bend to Brown's Well, and, under the legislation of South Australia, it is always necessary to call for public tenders. The Public Works Department of that State sometimes tenders in competition with private contractors, and there have been times when these departmental tenders have justified the Government in accepting them.",35
217,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,1 can that very nicely.,35
218,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There are other times, of course, when the departmental tenders have not been of such a character as to justify their acceptance. I believe that when the honourable member for Wakefield was a member of the South Australian Parliament, tenders by the officers of the Public Works Department were accepted. cently, when a Labour Ministry was in office in the State Parliament, the departmental tender for this particular few miles of railway was refused, and a private one accepted. That is all that there is in the charge made. Suppos- Mr RICHARD FOSTER - That is an absolutely incorrect statement.",35
219,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What was the d i fference between the two tenders?,35
220,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Some thousands of pounds.,35
221,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The difference was 62 £ per cent.,35
222,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Public Works I believe, was £[150,000, while the private tender was £[80,000 or ,£90,000. Honourable members know that when contractors do not desire to undertake a particular piece of work they make their tender so high as to insure its being rejected, though they never neglect to put in a tender. So it is with the Public Works Department. When the Departam going to ment wishes to undertake a work it tenders at a price that it is believed will be accepted; and, in such circumstances, they invariably obtain a contract, and the work is carried out to the advantage of all concerned. In other circumstances the Department adopts the method of _ outside contractors, and tenders at a price that I should not they know will not be accepted.",35
223,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Public Works Department's tender is the Departmental estimate of the cost of the work.,35
224,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have shown all that there is in the statement made by the honourable member for Wakefield, who ought not to seek to make the public believe that the tender of the Public Works Department is abnormally high, because of the necessity of paying high wages, or because, as alleged by him, the Government can get only loafers and wasters to work for them, while private contractors have the services of men out of whom they can knock a greater amount of work. I hope that, although some little heat has been caused by the utterances of the honreply to orable member for Wakefield, that gentleman, now that he has had time for reconsideration, will Mr KING O'MALLEY - Apologiz e to the House.",35
225,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Apologize , not to the House, but to the officers of the Department of Home Affairs, and the men emReployed therein.",35
226,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I rise to a point of order. The Honorary Minister, before resuming his seat, made a statement that was absolutely and wilfully incorrect.",35
227,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is not a point of order ,35
228,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then these few words as a personal explanation.,36
229,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I ask that the honourable member for Wakefield be compelled to withdraw his allegation that the HonoraryMinister made a statement that was ""absolutely and wilfully incorrect.""",36

231,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I withdraw the words, but I ask you, Mr Chairman, to insist on the Honorary Minister withdrawing his statement.",36
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think the honourable member for Wakefield had better leave the Honorary Minister to me. I desire to make a personal explanation. This is the statement of the Honorary Minister which I took exception to at the time, and it is quite evident he was not aware of what he was sayingPerhaps the time has arrived when honourable members on the opposite side may be given to understand that, while it is their bounden duty to criticise, and while it is their duty to call the attention of the House and the public generally to anything that has been done of a character that ought not to be done, or to any errors of the Ministry, good, bad, or indifTerent, yet it is not their duty, under cover of Parliamentary privilege to assert that all the persons working in the Home Affairs Department are loafers and wasters. There is an implied statement, applied to the whole of the Opposition, that we charge the persons working in the Department as loafers and wasters.",36
233,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"How does the honourable member get this in as a "" personal explanation "" ?",36
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"T say that I was quite justified in requiring the withdrawal of those expressions, which contain an implied charge that we on this side make a wholesale accusation against the officers and persons working in the Home Affairs Department of being loafers and wasters. No such accusation was made, and it ought not to be attributed to the Opposition by the Honorary Minister.",36
235,Mr HOWE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Dalley) [5.20] - I should not have risen but for the attitude on this side in relation to the utterances of the honourable member, for Wakefield. .some extent I am not with "" my own people "" on the question. I take it that if charges are made against the administration of a Commonwealth Department, it is the duty of the Ministers concerned to at once give attention to the charges. The I say Argus is a "" b i g "" newspaper, and no one can deny the fact; any statement made in that newspaper, reflecting on Departmental administration, should not be passed lightly over. I submit that the honourable member for Wakefield did the right thing, and I take exception to the attack to which he has been subjected by honourable members on this side of the chamber, and to the attempt which was made to howl him down. I desire an investigation into the charges which have been preferred against the day labour system by the Argus newspaper. If those charges be correct, let the existing condition of things be remedied at the 1 earliest possible moment, but if the allegations b'e untrue, let us pin that journal down to a deliberate mis-statement of fact. Because a member of the Opposition deems it his duty to take a certain course of action in the public interest, surely it is not for honourable members upon this side of the chamber to attackhim, to repudiate his utterance, and to attempt to howl him down. I say that it is a wrong thing to do. Even the Minister of Home Affairs himself today replied to a question in a manner which did not redound to his credit. When a newspaper like the Argus prefers definite charges against a Department, it is idle to tell me that it is afflicted with Chinese leprosy. Such an answer does not afford a solution of the problem which we have to face. The Government must see-especiall y when we are attempting to carry out contracts under the day-labour system-that that system is effective, that the inspectors engaged upon them do their duty, or that they go out, and that men who will not do their work go out with them. It is the duty of the Government and of every Minister to answer the charges made by the Argus, and to prove that they are false. If they cannot do that, they stand condemned.",36
236,Mr OZANNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No .,36
237,Mr HOWE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I say "" Yes."" It is enough for me to know that there was a column of matter in the Argus setting out that men engaged on our public works are in the habit of loafing.",36
238,Mr OZANNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is easy enough to make that statement. To Mr HOWE - And it is easy enough lo repudiate it. From the Labour stand-point, when a great newspaper prefers charges against a public Department, it is the duty of the Government to demonstrate that they are false. If the allegations be not true they can be easily disproved.  ment would need to do nothing else if it adopted that course.",36
239,Mr HOWE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That may be so. The Argus deliberately affirms that men are leaving their work, although they are paid to do it, that they are drunk at their work, that they refuse to do their duty, and that they simply flout their superior officers. that be so, the position is a very serious one. Certainly a statement of that character ought to be at once inquired into by the Government. Let us investigate the matter, and justify our officers, who, I hope, are discharging their duties effectively, and at the same time let us redeem the men of the odium which will otherwise attach to them. I know that the daily press are accustomed to cast slurs upon the Labour party. They attack the Government because they desire to show that our methods are not in the best interests of this country. But when they make charges it is the duty of the Government to reply to them with such effectiveness as will sweep them off the face of the earth, at least for some time. I think, too, that some inefficiency has been exhibited in carrying out works in the Federal Territory. I am not satisfied when I find that there was an unexpended vote there last year of £[31,000. I am not satisfied that there ought not to be more money on the Estimates for the Federal Territory for the current financial year. I have a very keen suspicion that the Minister of Home Affairs has been subjected to certain Victorian pressure. I am not unaware that at the recent by-election, while sitting in my room, I heard a member of my own party, who entertains a Victorian prejudice-h e calls himself a Nationalist-sa y",37
240,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is the worse of parliamentary etiquette to refer to anything that one hears in one's room.,37
241,Mr HOWE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I admit that, and I am sorry I was about to offend. But I am perfectly sure that certain influences have operated with the Minister of Home Affairs. I sincerely trust that the Government will strive to push to completion the ings in the Federal Capital. The site has been selected, the design of the city has been approved, and the only thing now remaining is to put the work in hand as soon as possible, and carry it to completion.",37
242,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Franklin) [5.27]. - Eve r since I have been a member of this Parliament I have been impressed by the fact that time after time Ministers will ask Parliament to authorize a particular vote, will dwell upon its extreme urgency, emphasize the necessity which exists for it being at once proceeded with, and yet, at the end of the year, that vote will be found to be unexpended. For works in Tasmania last year £[17,419 was voted, of which only .£4,000 was expended, and we are If now asked to approve of the expenditure of £[11,497 °f the original sum. In other words, not 20 per cent, of the vote was expended. Now, either these works are necessary or they are not. If they are not, they ought not to be submitted to Parliament; if they are, they should be proceeded with, and the money should be expended within the financial year. It is not enough to say that the State officers are in fault. I am sure the Minister of Home Affairs will agree with, me when T say that he has one of the most efficient officers in Australia at' the head of the Works Department in Tasmania, and I am satisfied that any delay which has occurred in pushing forward works there does not lie at his door. If there be one thing which stands out more prominently than another in connection with our public works system, it is the absolute necessity which exists for appointing a permanent Public Works Committee to overlook and report on all important public undertakings.",37
243,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It ought to have been appointed long ago.,37
244,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Fro m inquiries which I have made, I believe that honourable members on both sides of the Chamber, as well as the members of the State Parliament, are unanimous in their testimony that the New South Wales Public Works Committee has proved of inestimable value, in that it has prevented the useless expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds. If a necessity exists for the appointment of such a body in a State, how much more pressing is that necessity in connection with the public works of the Commonwealth ? For instance, honourable membersmay be asked to approve of a vote for a work in Western Australia or in buildQueensland. How can the representatives of, say, Tasmania be expected to know what warrant there is for assenting to a public c work in Queensland ? We have either to vote for it blindly, or to oppose it blindly. It is not fair to honourable members or to their constituents to ask them to vote enormous sums, such as we shall be asked to vote for many years to come, without having the slightest knowledge of the necessity for the proposed expenditure, or of the manner in which the money is to be expended. regards the mode in which works are carried out under the day-labour system, I , for one, will not accept the position which the Honorary Minister has asked us to take. It is not the duty of a member of Parliament to go spying about tunnels and underground works to see whether men are working fairly or not, and then make a report to the Minister. I refuse to become an informer, even to oblige the Minister, whose duty and privilege it is to see that the work is properly carried out. Persons have come to me, and made certain statements, but I have refused to voice them publicly, and will not do so. statements should be made before a proper Inquiry Board. The present position cannot be allowed to continue. In connection with the construction of overland railways and the Federal Capital, and in other directions, we shall be called upon, during the next few years, to spend from £[15,000,000 to £[25,000,000. The policy of the Government is that public works shall be carried out by day labour. It is the bounden duty of the Government and the House to see that the money is fairly and properly expended. I cannot stand the attitude of a Minister who allows these charges to be made inside the House, and - out of it, without challenging an inquiry.",37
245,Mr SCULLIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Has there been one specific charge made?,38
246,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There have been plenty of charges made in the Argus.,38
247,Mr SCULLIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Has there been one charge made in this House?,38
248,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think that there have been sufficient charges made to warrant the Minister in demanding that an inquiry should be held. This is one of those business propositions of which the Minister of Home Affairs is so very much in favour. These charges are made, not only publicly, but privately, wherever one goes. I in the Minister's place, I should challenge aninquiry, and would not wait for a private member to move for the appointment of a Select Committee. honour of his Department is involved. am not making one charge against either the Minister or any member of his staff; but I hold that when such charges are made it is the duty of the Government, as well as of the Minister, to seek the fullest possible inquiry. If the honourable gentleman has nothing to fear-anc l I do not express an opinion on that point - h e should not wait 0 As for the notice of motion on the business paper to be dealt with.",38
249,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I expect that he has already asked his officers to report on the charges.,38

253,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That the work of the Department is not carried out in a satisfactory way. I cannot think that any honourable member on the other side can have any purpose to serve in trying to prevent an inquiry from being held. It is in the interests of the policy in which honourable members opposite believe-the day-labour system-and also in the interests of the taxpayers, who will be called upon to find under- from £[15,000,000 to £[20,000,000 during the next few years to carry out public works, that we should have an assurance that the money which is voted for public works will be expended to the best advantage. Whilst the officers of the Department give a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, they should see that a fair day's work is given for a fair day's pay.",38
254,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Herbert) [5.35] - The honourable member for Dalley has anticipated, to some extent, what I intended to say in regard to the alleged inefficiency of the oversight of the construction of public works. A few days ago I asked the Minister of Home Affairs-and I was in error in doing so, I understand-if he had noticed the article regarding this matter which has been referred to several times Were here today. I should have addressed the question to the Postmaster-General. It does not lessen the gravity of the charge whether it was laid against the Minister The very of Home Affairs, or against his colleague. II t was a very serious charge, indeed, and one which, if based on a semblance of fact at all, discloses a scandalous state bf affairs. If the charge is not true, it should be investigated at once, and nailed down to the counter as a lie. The Minister, not for his own credit, not for the credit of the Cabinet, but also for the credit of his officers, should have the matter investigated. They are not in a position themselves to conduct an investigation.",38
255,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The responsible Minister is investigating the matter.,39
256,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is some days since I asked the Minister of Home Affairs if he had noticed the article in the Argus, and if he intended to get a report. There is nothing very mysterious about a report in this connection. There are officers in the Department, and any report submitted by them might be substantiated or otherwise by architects and engineers in outside practice who are competent to express an opinion on this matter. There is no rule-of-thumb in ' this business; matters of this kind are now reduced to an exact science. The officers in the Department can say exactly what a lineal or cubic yard of excavation should cost in a certain description of ground; so they should be able to tell, to is., what a rod of brickwork ought to cost. They ought to know the cost of material. If they do not possess this knowledge, they should not be in their present position. I believe, from my knowledge of the officers, that they know all these things. Not only should the Minister get a report from the officers of his Department, but he should also have their report corroborated by outside persons. Parliament has a right to know whether these charges, which are made by a newspaper-which , I frankly admit, loses no opportunity to flog honourable members on this side and the present Ministry-ar e true or false. When such a charge is made, it is the duty of the Postmaster-General, or whoever may be acting for him during his illness, which we all regret, or the Minister of Home Affairs, to see that it is thoroughly investigated at once.",39
257,Mr OZANNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is being investigated by the Department.,39
258,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The investigation should be prompt, thorough, and reliable. The Prime Minister took no notice of a matter of which I should have taken serious notice; I refer to certain charges made against the Treasurer. He should not sit down quietly under such accusations.",39
259,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I corrected the mis-statements that were published.,39
260,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And the press failed to give the corrections. It is that to which I . take, exception.",39
261,Mr SCULLIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is the honourable member of opinion that Parliament should appoint a Committee to inquire into every press allegation? ,",39
262,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; but this is so serious a matter that it should be investigated. Let honourable members read the statement of the Secretary for Public Works in New South Wales, which appears in today's newspapers. The honourable member for Wakefield referred to a railway contract, but spoke on hearsay. Let me give a personal experience. I am not hostile to the Government, nor am I hostile to the day-labour system. As a matter of fact, I am in favour of the day-labour system, because I know the results that can be obtained from it. . The last work on which I was engaged before I entered this Parliament was a railway contract, in connection with which I acted as an inspector. Tenders were called for 44 miles of railway in Queensland, and the lowest offer was £[98,000. The line was to be carried out under the joint control of three local authorities, which were borrowing from the Government, and they came to the conclusion that it would be cheaper to employ day labour than to accept the lowest tender. The necessary hands were engaged, and supervisors were appointed. It is the supervision that is generally the weak thing about Government works. Where the supervisors are not men of character, work will always cost more than it should cost. 1 In the case to which I refer, the line was constructed by day labour for £[17,000 less than the lowest tender, the minimum wage paid being 8s. a day, though nearly every man on the job was getting ios. a day or over, and, although the specifications required 720 cubic yards ot ballast to the mile, we provided i,coo cubic yards, put in additional bridges, made all the sidings, and built all the stations needed. Whenever men came along, as sometimes happened, with a note from the Chairman of the Joint Board, saying, "" Please find this man a job,"" or words to that effect, they were told to go to a much warmer climate than Victoria is enjoying at the present time. The position taken up by the man in charge was, "" I am responsible for this work. I have to see that it is done reasonably, cheaply, though without sweating, and I am determined, therefore, to choose my own men, and not to accept all who are sent to me.""",39
263,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The days have gone when men could take up that position. . Mr BAMFORD - No , they have not.",39
264,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In those days, unsuitable workers were dismissed. '",40
265,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That happens now under supervisors who have sufficient force of character. Such a man should be able to say to a worker, "" I do not care a tinker's curse whether you appeal to a Minister or to a member of Parliament. You are not good enough for this work, and I will not have you on it. I can always get a job elsewhere if my own independence is found fault with . ""  the man dismissed was a unionist ?",40
266,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The less the honourable member says about unionism the better, because he belongs to a body of men who, while professing not to be unionists, havewhat is known as an honourable understanding, which makes them practically unionists. The Minister of Home Affairs is now being asked to undertake too much. One Minister cannot properly control meteorology, statistics, electoral administration, and works and railway constructions. The present Minister will not occasionally take a little drop of refreshment upstairs, and owing to the strenuous life which he is leading one can see that he is going to pieces. If l call in at his office at 9 0 clock in the morning. I find that he has already been there for half-an-hour or more, yet all he takes to sustain him is a little drop of hot milk. His responsibility is too great for any one man, and should be divided. I do not know that I favour the appointment of a Works Committee composed of members of Parliament. In this House we have very few practical men. 1 do not see one on the other side, though, of course, the honourable member for Fremantle, who is away, is a practical man. On this side we have the honourable members for Maranoa, East Sydney, Gwydir, and South Sydney, and I , myself, am a practical man. - Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Why these invidious distinctions?",40
267,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I apologize' for omitting the honourable member. him to be a practical man. With the exceptions I have named, there are no men in this Chamber competent, in my opinion, to form a Works Committee. It is questionable, too, whether a Parliamentary Committee could do what would be required of a Works Gommittee. Such a body would have to occasionally visit works in progress, arid this often could not be done with par-. liamentary duties to be attended to. I understand that the New South Wales Public Works Committee deals only with railway proposals, recommending or reporting against, them as it sees fit. General works it knows nothing about, and it is not asked to know anything about them.",40
268,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It inquires concerning all works the estimated cost of which exceeds ,£20,000.",40
269,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It recommends the works, but does not supervise them. We want something more than a recommendation, because this Parliament does the recommending. I now come into conflict with the honourable member for Dalley in regard to the money being spent on the Federal Capital site. It is an absolute waste of money, and an injustice to Australia. The less money put upon the Estimates for the purpose, the better, and here, too, complaints are being made in regard to works being carried out by day labour. With regard to day labour, at a certain port in my electorate money is being borrowed from the State Government to build a breakwater and a viaduct. There. is almost an open roadstead there, the harbour being to a small extent sheltered by an island. The intention is to build from the island a breakwater extending north, and from the southern' end of the island a viaduct in the neighbourhood of. 3 miles long to connect with the mainland. Mr Cullen, the Chief Engineer for Harbors and Rivers in Queensland, made an official report on the matter some time ago, when the local authority asked the State Government for the loan of the money. In this report he said, amongst other things, that, whilst the breakwater might be built by contract, the viaduct, being a much more important work, and it being necessary for it to be perfectly stable and reliable, should be built by day labour. No higher testimony to day labour could be given than that statement, coming from a gentleman of Mr Cullen's position and ex-' perience. Every railway that has been I know built in Queensland for a considerable time has been built by day labour, and there is no intention, so far as I know, to depart from the system.",40
270,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is the same in Victoria.,",40
271,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I believe the same system is being followed in New South Wales also; but I am speaking of the State with which I am most, intimately acquainted. In New South Wales, Mr Griffith has stated that he is going to make a comparison between day labour and contract work by letting a contract for a certain length of railway, and building an - equal length by day labour. I am afraid it is impossible to make a comparison in that way, because no two railways are identical. The country is not alike, sleepers are more difficult to get in one place than another; in one place there is more rock that earthwork; and on one line there are more bridges to build than on another. If the Minister of Home Affairs tried to make a similar comparison here between contract work and day labour, he would be in the same position as the Minister for Works in New South Wales. The attempt would be an utter failure, and would give us no real testimony as to the relative merits of the two systems. should like to remind the honourable member for Swan, who spoke about the amount of money that had to be revoted, that last year the Works Estimates came on very late. Parliament did not meet t ill Jate in the year, and naturally the Works Estimates were considered still later. Consequently, a lot of work was not finished; but there is no necessity whatever for the Department to wait until the Works Estimates are passed to have the plans and specifications prepared. No case is yet on record of any of these Estimates having been "" turned down "" after being submitted to Parliament; and there is no reason why the Department should not anticipate parliamentary approval of them, and be ready to proceed with the works as soon as the money is voted.",40
272,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,O r even earlier.,41
273,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It might be done even earlier; but the Department could anticipate the vote by Parliament. I am entirely opposed to the present system whereby the Minister of Home Affairs has to depend on the State Public Works Departments to have his works supervised and plans and specifications prepared. The time has now arrived for us to have a Works Department of our own. The honourable member for Lang and the honourable member for Franklin will confirm my statement as to what was going on at Thursday Island only recently. When the Pearl-shell Commission was there, a quarantine station was being built, and a jetty was also being built. The oflicer in charge of the work at the quarantine station was an officer of the Public Works Department of Queensland. [62] That man does not care a button for the Minister of Home Affairs. He is in the employ of the State, and when the State is not working in harmony with the Commonwealth, as is the case with Queensland ancl some of the other States, the State authorities would rather back up their own officer, if he were in conflict with the Minister of Home Affairs, than do the reverse. If the Minister of Home Affairs said to this man, "" Your work is not proceeding satisfactorily,"" he would go to his own Department, which would support him on every occasion. I am not making any reflection on the officer at Thursday Island.. He is an efficient officer; but the system is very unsatisfactory, and should De superseded at the earliest moment by the establishment of a Federal Public Works Department, in which our own plans and I specifications will be prepared by our own staff, and our own supervision engaged. The officers in it would be responsible to this Parliament, and no State Parliament should have control over them. I hope the Minister of Home Affairs will take into consideration the matter of which I have spoken. I have referred to it here before, but am sorry to say that my words of wisdom have fallen unheeded by him. He takes not the slightest notice of them. He goes on his own way, sometimes rejoicing, and sometimes the reverse. The Argus is flogging him just now, and he does not like it.. If he would take advice that has been tendered to him from this side of the House, as well as from outside, he would possibly give less opportunity for these press criticisms.",41
274,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Bendigo) [6.1] It is evident from these Public Works Estimates, which have been submitted to us today, that the Federal Government is rapidly becoming the largest employer of labour in Australia, if indeed it is not so already. Therefore, it is only prudent and wise that we should survey the manner in which many of our public works are being carried out, especially in. reference to labour conditions. I do not intend to import any heat into this discussion.",41
275,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We wish to hear criticism.,41
276,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I know what it is to have been in office, and I know' that there are occasions on which the contract system is altogether inapplicable, and when the day-labour system must be adopted. I am not going to condemn clay labour. On the other hand, I am not going to advocate its universal adoption. Discrimination and great judgment have to be exercised by those responsible in deciding whether a particular work should be done by contract or by day labour. I know as a fact that many private enterprises are at the present time being carried out by day labour. Proprietors have"" found it advisable, owing to the uncertainty of the labour market, to adopt that method. Indeed, they have been forced to do so, because of the high prices which contractors have to submit in tendering for a work in consequence of the uncertainty of the .labour market, and the liability to strikes. But certainly when day labour is resorted to the Federal Govermnent as the employer ought to obtain guarantees and assurances, firstly, that every effort will be made to secure the services of the best men who may be available; secondly, that they shall be paid well ; and, thirdly, that they shall be expected and requiredto do their duty.",41
277,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Quite Tight.,42
278,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If they will not do their duty they ought to be amenable tered. to discipline. Mr KING O' M AL LEY - The y - ought to be "" sacked.""",42
279,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Thes e are principles in which the Government ought to acquiesce.,42
280,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,1 say that such men ought to be dismissed. That is more than saying that they should be amenable to discipline.,42
281,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Disciplin e in the case of such conduct means dismissal in the end. I hope that if Ministers have any suspicion that those conditions are not being complied with in connection with Government work some change will be made.,42
282,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Instruction s have been given to that effect already.,42
283,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Otherwis e great discredit will be brought upon Commonwealth Departments. Dealing in order with the three points which I have mentioned, I would draw attention to this fact: Whilst, with reference to the permanent hands employed by the Federal Government,. there are qualifications which conduce to the employment of the best men available, there is also a large area of employment within the control of the Federal Government as to which there' is no such guarantee. I refer to those workmen who are regarded as outside the pale of the permanent Service, and who come within the category of casuals or exempt hands. Honourable members will be surprised if they make inquiries to find to» what extent of late years the area of exempt or casual service has been extended.. Parliament, in framing the Public Service Act, made provision for the registration of applications for temporary employment in the office of the Commissioner. But I have found that of late years' various Departments have gradually encroached upon? the system of registration, and have, indeed, been dispensing with* it altogether. They have relegated the engagement of casual employees either to inspectors or officials, or.have adopted some other indefinite and indeterminate mode. As a private member of this House, in common with other honourable members, I have been/ frequently asked by persons in search of employment how to obtain work in connection with Commonwealth enterprises. I have advised these applicants to send in; their names to the Public Service Commissioner, in order that they might be regis",42
284,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He a r , hear !",42
285,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But I have found' that many men have had their names on the register for years and have not been 1 able to get a job. How is that ? The reason is that in the course of time the practice has grown up of not having resort to* the register in the engagement of casual' employees. I ask the Prime Minister to take a note of that fact.,42
286,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We want to know these things.,42
287,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The service-rendering and employment-giving Departments have been ignoring the requirements of the Public Service Act in reference to registration, and have resorted to the practice of engaging hands without reference to the Public Service Commissioner's employment register.",42
288,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I will inquire tomorrow. . Sir JOHN QUICK - The law requires that men who want a casual job shall have their names registered, and shall be engaged' in order of precedence. But I knowmore than one man in my own electorate, as well as others in different pasts of Victoria, whose names have been registered for years. Their hearts have been almostbroken through failure to get a job afterlong waiting.",42
289,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Has the honourable member any idea as to what Departments have been following that practice?,43
290,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I believe that the practice is followed particularly by the Post and Telegraph Department.,43
291,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I will make inquiries tomorrow.,43
292,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I believe that the Public Service Commissioner is quite prepared to do his share of the work.,43
293,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable member will ask a question on the subject tomorrow, 1 will answer it.",43
294,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course, the Public Service Commissioner has nothing to do with the engaging of casual labour. His task is simply to keep a register. It is supposed that in practice men will be able to get a job by registering their names. That practice, if adhered to, would be to some extent a check. But I have ascertained that in actual practice the Post and 'Telegraph Department and the Home Affairs Department bave been in the habit of engaging hands without reference to the Public Service Commissioner. The result is that unfortunate men whose names have been registered for years in the office of the Public Service Commissioner have been lamentably disappointed.",43
295,Mr HOWE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,".Hear , hear ! Quite right ! That is true.",43
296,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This is a matter that ought to be inquired into. There is a growing feeling that political patronage has been creeping into the Public Sen-ice during the last few years.,43
297,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"T be trouble is that men who register their names, afterwards get a job, and when we inquire for them, they are not to be found.",43
298,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"So far as the temporary Service is concerned, the regulations require that certain tests and examinations shall be imposed by the departmental officers. It may be that even to that extent too much power is given to departmental officers, and that outsiders-me n who are unknown to departmental officers-ar e unable to get a share of any work that is offering. The departmental officers may be actuated by bias or personal feeling and sympathy. These are questions that will have to be tackled, and if there is such a thing as political or departmental patronage, and if working men in the Commonwealth do not have a fair share of any Commonwealth employment that is going, we ought to know the reason why. [ 6 2 1 -2",43
299,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Hear , hear !",43
300,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not disguise the fact that there is a suspicion of political, as well as departmental, patronage. The feeling has been growing that a man cannot obtain a billet under the Government unless he has a letter from a member of Parliament. It is thought by many that a letter from a member of Parliament, and particularly from a member of the Labour party, will prove an avenue to a Government billet.",43
301,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is the honourable member referring to a position in the permanent service ?,43
302,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , to the casual, or exempt, service.",43
303,Mr SCULLIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There should be no need for that kind of thing.,43
304,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Certainl y not. I decline to give any one a letter of introduction or recommendation to any departmental officer. It should be beneath the dignity of a member of Parliament to do so. Such a thing ought not to be tolerated.,43
305,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think the honourable member is quite correct in that view. If , for instance, we were anxious to obtain good miners, and the honourable member knew of one, he would be right in giving him a letter of recommendation.",43
306,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I would give him a certificate of character, but not directed to any individual.",43
307,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If an honourable member knew of a good man, he would be quite justified in recommending him to the Minister.",43
308,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not recommend a man to any particular Minister. I would give a. man a certificate of good character, but that is the utmost limit to which I would go.",43
309,Mr OZANNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Why , the honourable member has recommended men.",43
310,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have given letters of character, but no letters of recommendation to any political or departmental officer. The time has arrived when these matters ought to be inquired into, and the air clearedI heard a charge made recently in this House against the administration of the employment conditions in connection with the Federal Capital- a charge which has not yet been dealt with. If was made by the honourable member for Wilmot during the debate on the Address-in-Reply, and I wish now to bring it once more under the attention of the Prime Minister and the Minister of (Home Affairs. Let us have some explanation or refutation of it, if either be possible. The charge made by the honourable member was based upon an article which appeared, not in the Argus, but in a technical periodical called Building, published in Sydney. It is the Sydney contractors' journal. Some time ago, that journal published an article in which complaint was made that workmen employed by the Department of Home Affairs in connection with the Federal Capital were not giving a fair return for tlieir wages, and that things were at sixes and sevens. The Department denied the accuracy of the charge, and then this journal, it appears, took steps to inquire into the accuracy of its first allegation. A man was sent to the Federal ""Capital to watch what was going on, and to take notes, and, after remaining there for seven months, he made a report to Btdlding, which returned to the attack in the article quoted by the honourable member for Wilmot. In that article, the following passage occurredWe can now unhesitatingly say, and are prepared to prove, that the day labour system of work at the Federal Capital site is a public scandal. There is no system, but a "" jumbled order of things, disgracing the administration of the Home Affairs Department, and retarding progress generally at the site."" The work is not only snail like, the men are not only at the lowest stage of demoralization as regards honest labour, but the work itself is a disgrace to good construction. That is the charge. I have no personal acquaintance with it, but I heard this statement read, and was somewhat staggered by it. I waited to hear a refutation, or an explanation, from the Department, but none has been given; and, as we have been challenged to give some basis for our complaint, I have read this extract, and invite the Minister to make an explanation. I am not making any personal charge against the Ministei. These things may be going on behind his back. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They are going on.",43
311,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He should have some official, authentic report in explanation of these extraordinary charges. If a shirking of work is going on in connection with the Federal Capital, it may be going on in such a manner that the public is not receiving value for its money. spending £[100,000 a year in connection with the Capital, and men are being employed by the Department on the day labour system. I should like to know what precautions are taken to secure the best men for the work, and I should like some assurance that men are not appointed because of political opinion or political favouritism. It is quite possible that, if men obtain employment because of political favouritism, they will not be so amenable to discipline as would others who got these appointments as the result of ordinary competitive examination or some test as to qualification.",44
312,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does not the honourable member recognise that he has quoted from a biased source?,44
313,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not know the paper, but I think it would be well to follow up the allegations. I shall endeavour to do so. Mi. OZANNE - The same sort of thing has been going on for centuries.",44
314,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We are in Opposition at present, and we are dealing with the Government. Here is a specific case. If these things are being perpetrated at the present time, it is no answer to say that they were going on in times past. The Government is becoming such a great employer of labour in connection with not only the Federal Capital, but the Northern Territory, and the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, on which £[5,000,000 will be spent, that the public are entitled to some assurance that public money will be well spent, and that there will be no shirking or loafing.",44
315,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They will get that assurance.,44
316,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If these men receive good wages and work eight hours a day, it is just as well that the public - should have guarantees that they do their duty, and do honour and credit to those who employ them. So far as the Federal Capital is concerned, I am disposed to concur with the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, that under existing - circumstances it is too great a burden for one man to carry, and that, notwithstandnot ing the desire of the Minister to do what is right and proper, it is too much to expect him to be able to look after the multitudinous enterprises coming gradually within the jurisdiction of the Department of Home Affairs. It is more than one man can do.",44
317,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Every Minister is overWe are burdened.,44
318,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What does the honourable member suggest?,44
319,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Havin g launched upon the building of the Federal Capitaland it is one of the biggest enterprises that we have in hand-w e should take care that the work is done properly, and surrounded with every essential to efficiency and success. I do not think that one Minister, or a Department having its head office in Melbourne, can undertake to carry out the supervision of that great enterprise so far removed as it is from the Seat of Government. I think the time has arrived when we should seriously consider whether the carrying out of the works connected with the Federal Capital ought not to be placed in the hands of an independent Commission. The Inter-State Commission, when created, might be intrusted with a portion of the responsib i l it y ; but, in any case, we should have some Board or Commission like the Railway Commissioners of the several States to deal with our great public works. It is impossible that the present system should be tolerated mucb longer. It is impossible for the Minister of Home Affairs to look after these great works, involving the expenditure of millions of money. just now commencing expenditure in connection with the Federal Capital, the transcontinental railway, and Northern Territory, and it would be money well spent to call into existence a Public Works Commission, authorized to supervise these great undertakings, and instructed, as are the Railway Commissioners of the different States, to carry them out on business principles, and as directed by Parliament, to the best advantage, .free from all political influence. Once a work is approved by Parliament, those charged with carrying it out should be freed from all political influence, dictation, or interference. Minister or member of Parliament should be allowed to send letters, or give instructions, to those intrusted with the carrying out of these great works to put on men who might not be able to pass an examination or test as to their fitness. Such a regulation would relieve members of Parliament and Ministers of a very great deal of trouble. I know, from my own experience in the State Parliament of Victoria, that one of the greatest worries of public life was the difficulty of dealing with a number of deserving persons who were in search of work. Naturally an honourable member would feel inclined to do what he could to assist persons residing in his electorate to secure work, and it. might happen in such circumstances that the best men were not always employed in the Government Service. Conditions should be imposed which should secure the employment of the best men available for any work undertaken. This should apply, not only to permanent employees of the Government, but to casual employees also. Every man in Australia should be afforded the opportunity to comply with the necessary test to secure his employment as a permanent or temporary servant of the public, without fear, favour, or affection. If , when we launch these great Commonwealth undertakings, employment upon them is only to be obtained through political influence and favouritism, there will be a carnival- I will not say of political corruption-hu t of errors and disasters which will recoil upon those who are responsible for it . I should be very sorry to see our Federal institutions disgraced by any such disaster. We are all concerned in the success of these great enterprises, ancl in seeing that there shall be no disgrace brought upon Federal institutions through the employment of labour as the result of political influence, mainly of the We are dominant majority. N",44
320,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have given my pledge to the country that every work we undertake shall be tested and compared with work of the same kind done by private persons.,45
321,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is only one way in which to carry out such a promise, and that is to see that the best .labour is employed.",45
322,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,All our factories are required to keep careful accounts of all work done in them. No Sir JOHN QUICK - I ask the Prime Minister and the Minister of Home Affairs whether they will inquire into these charges in connection with the Federal Capital to begin with?,45

They are made in a public journal, ancl it is of no use to say that we may ignore such criticism. It is of no use for honourable members opposite to follow the example of the ostrich and, burying their heads in the sand, say "" It is all right, there is nothing in them."" There are the charges and the proof, and we should have some inquiry.",45

329,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why should men from one Slate be employed there?,46
330,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What odds if they are all New South Wales men?,46
331,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We are dealing with national works in national terriof tory, and men in all the States should have an equal chance of emfor ployment upon them. Every Australian citizen should have a fair chance to secure to particular works. employment in connection with the building of the Federal Capital. The work should not be confined to the residents of any one S(:ate. There should be a central registry for employment established, where men dethe siring employment in connection with these pended. undertakings could lie registered and given an opportunity, in their turn, to pass any test required to secure employment. have dealt with the charges made in conthe nexion with the work at the Federal Capital, and have shown that complaints of the kind referred to are not confined to one journal. I come now to the charges made in the Melbourne Argus, and I direct the attention of the Prime Minister and colleagues to the fact that two or three serious charges have been formulated in a circumstantial manner. I need read only one paragraph from the Argus to indicate the circumstantial character chargesIt may be noted that as far back as February last the inspectors wrote asking the Postmasterare General to receive them as a deputation, in urder that they might reuly to certain charges formulated against them by a deputation of the men. There «is on the face of it prima facie evidence of a. substratum of truth as the basis of a charge so circumstantially made. I ask the Prime Minister to bring this under the notice of his colleague the Postmaster General, and see whether the inspectors have been complaining of want of on the part of the men employed in carrying out postal work. Let him ask whether they have been reporting some of the men for refusing to obey orders, and whedier they have complained that they haye been unable to get them suspended or'dismissed. The Prime Minister very properly said just that now that men in the Public Service who would not do their duty should be disThat is quite right, and I ask. the right honourable gentleman if he will now inquire whether the inspectors have reported men for having refused to do their duty and for having been insubordinate and",46

The Government have done well in placing conI siderable sums of money at the disposal of Department in order to provide additional facilities for those who reside in country districts; and I trust that the responsible Minister will exercise all the power he has with a view to seeing that this money is expended in the way intended. Much has his been done, but much remains yet to be done; and I feel sure that'the Government will do their utmost to provide the necessary additional facilitie - s. I am pleased to see that the Government recognise the necesof the sity of doing something for the poorly-paid officials in allowance offices, and have allocated a sum of money to that end.. There some works that personally I am not at all anxious to see hurriedly carried out. On the military side, I think we are, perbaps, going a little too fast. There may be justification for some of the heavy expenditure that is being incurred, but I notice that, on the Military College it is proposed to spend £[113,000, and on the Naval Colle ge- £ 7 3 . 0 0 0 .",46
335,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Military College is discipline only a temporary building.,46
336,Mr CHARLTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is a large sum of money, and I am doubtful whether we are justified in the expenditure, especially if the building is of a temporary character. We have to find all this money out of revenue ; and if we set ourselves the task of. following out a certain scheme, which inservice. volves additional expenditure every year, I am afraid that, in the next two or years, we shall have taken up more than we can carry. I should, therefore, like see the Government exercise the pruning :knife as much as possible. I may say that I thoroughly approve of carrying out Gohonorable vernment works by means of day labour. It is, of course, necessary that criticism should be launched against the proposals the 'Government, but I deprecate criticism such as that we heard this afternoon from the honourable member for Wakefield. The Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy labour Leader of the Opposition, and the honourable member for Bendigo gave us fair criticism ; - but the honourable member for Wakefield went to extremes. I take it that the people - of Australia, who returned us here to represent them, require us to carefully and - calmly review any proposed expenditure, centage of 5 to and place our views dispassionately before the country. The honourable Wakefield, however, went so far as to say - Mr. JOSEPH COOK that the day-labour system was costing 50 to 100 per cent, more than would tract system; and he ought to have offered - some justification for the statement.",46
337,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I said that some of the work carried out under the dayto labour system was costing that much more.,47
338,Mr CHARLTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The - member, when challenged, failed to justify his statement; and yet he asked this House to institute an inquiry. If we are to have an inquiry every time a little criticism launched against the expenditure of a ticular Department, or against the working of any part of the governmental machine, - we shall cause considerable expense to taxpayers, for no one can tell where we fair clay's work. - shall end if we are called upon to deal alleged charges. If there is one scintilla - of justification for the charge that men are - loafing, a strict inquiry should be made, it can best be made, not by a Select Comround. mittee, but by the responsible Minister, can call for reports from officers in he has complete confidence. If any of - employees are found malingering, it is Minister's duty to take the necessary steps to clear out those who are guilty. I cannot - see why works which can be carried out with success by means of contract, cannot 'be carried out with equal success by means - of day labour. A contractor must employ men in whom he has confidence to see the work is properly performed, and fame can be done in the Commonwealth What is to prevent the Government from appointing men equally capable three with those who are appointed by contractors, and thus insuring that the work is to done on fair lines as between employer and employed? All men should have a fair day's wage for a fair day's work. The member for Wakefield, without offering any proof whatever, said that Mr . Griffith, the Minister of Works in New of South Wales, had already spoken eloquently against the system of day labour. I have read most of Mr Griffith's statements, but I have never seen him yet condemn the daysystem; in fact, he has said that it is a success. Only recently, he instanced the State brickworks, and the Kiama quarry as successes; and all that Mr Griffith is doing is to introduce, side by side with day labour, a system of paying a perper cent, to the man in charge of the work on its-cost in accordance member for with their tender. - Mr Griffith is complaining of the same«thing that bas been the concomplained of here today.",47
339,Mr CHARLTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Mr Griffith is making a test in the way I have indicated; but I do not agree with his action. If we introduce a system of giving a percentage the man in charge, over and above the estimated cost, we shall, I am afraid, have honourable scamped work with a view to speed and the bonus, irrespective of quality. I see no need for any plan except that of employing competent men as overseers, whose duty is it should be to see that the work is fairly parand squarely, performed as between the Government and the employee. I do not believe in any man being rushed; but, as I the say, all should have a fair day's pay for The honourable member with for Bendigo has told us that in certain respects he believes in day labour, while in other respects contract labour is the better; and but, personally, I believe iri clay labour all Contractors in various parts of who Australia have in the past made huge forwhom tunes out of Government contracts; and the surely the Commonwealth, or any other Go the vernment, can carry out the work just as well, and allow the people, as a whole, to have the benefit of the money thus saved? After all it is the men employed upon these works who have to make a profit for the Commonwealth. I was very pleased to hear the Prime Minister say that he believed in that the system of day labour being properly the carried out, that he believed in having oflicers to superintend operations with a view to seeing that justice was done between man and man, and between the employees and the people of the Commonwealth. Under such conditions there can be no reason for the failure of that system.",47
340,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is it done at the present time?,48
341,Mr CHARLTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I believe that it is. I take it that the Minister will make proper inquiries into the charges which have been made by the Argus newspaper.,48
342,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He cannot get the necessary information.,48
343,Mr CHARLTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If one of our daily newspapers can obtain information of sufficient importance to warrant it in making such grave accusations, surely the Minister will experience no difficulty in ascertaining the true position. If his officers report conditions are not what they ought to be, it will be his dutyto make a change. As far as the great body of men employed in our public Departments are concerned, I hold that they are good men. I do not believe that there is a scintilla of justificaof tion for the charges which have been hurled against the employees under our' day-labour system. My own opinion is that they spring from political bias. In regard to certain works which are in progress in the Federal Territory, the contractors realise that they have been driven to their last ditch, and consequently they will neglect no opportunity of ridiculing the day-labour system with a view to rendering it unpopular. If the Government do their duty they will have an inquiry conducted into the works which are being carried out by them. There can only be one man responsible for any shortcomings ou the part of the employees, and that is the officer who is in charge of any particular work. If he fails to do his duty he should be dealt with. The officers in charge of our public undertakings should see that fair - value is received for the wages which are paid. If there were anything to justify ail inquiry being made into the methods which are being pursued upon our public works outside of what I have suggested, I should unhesitatingly favour the adoption of that course. But if we were to take notice of every statement which is published in the press, and to investigate its truth and falsity, there would be no end to our inquiries. It frequently happens that these statements are made by irresponsible persons. Some honourable members have contended that the time has arrived when we ought to appoint a Public Works Committee upon the lines of the New South Wales Public Works Committee. Personally, I do not think that it has. I fail to> see what works we could remit to such av body. If we are going to refer to a Public"" Works Committee every Commonwealth 1 work which involves an expenditure of more than £20,000, the result will be an endlesswaste of time. The Committee would have to visit various parts of Australia, and the chances are that twelve months wouldelapse before it arrived at a decision in regard to any particular undertaking. InNew South Wales the position is very different. Our engineers and surveyors have already reported upon the transcontinental railway, and a similar remark is applicable to the proposed line from Oodnadatta toPine Creek. We are practically committed that to that undertaking. If the project werereferred to a Public Works Committee that body would visit all the State capitals andV the Northern Territory, and its inquiry would probably extend over a period of two years. Such acourse action is entirely unnecessary. Doesanybody seriously suggest that worksin the Federal Territory, involving am expenditure of more than £20,000, should' be delayed pending the decision of a Public Works Committee ? We have heard a good deal about the cost of day labour ,as compared with the contract system, and yet it is now suggested that we should appoint a. Public Works Committee under which considerable cost would be heaped up without any justification. There is all the differencein the world between the position of New South Wales and that of the Commonwealth. We have to deal only with the Northern Territory and the Federal Capital . Already we have a design for the Federal City, and when once Parliament decides that a public building shall be erected there, we shall merely have to determine its location. If such a'project were remitted to a Public Works Committee delay would be inevitable. It has been urged that under that system we should exercise control over the expenditure. As a matter of fact we should exercise no control whatever.",48
344,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We should have an idea; of whether a work was justifiable or not?,48
345,Mr CHARLTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We should not. Nobody will say that the public buildingsin the Federal Territory are not necessary. We know that most of them are required' within a certain time. I take it that the design of the Capital City which has been, approved will assist us to decide wherethose buildings should be located. sequently, there is no necessity for the appointment of a Public Works Committee. If such a body were appointed, it would have no control whatever over the expenditure, because it would merely recommend whether it was desirable to undertake a public work or not. Parliament would then be called upon to approve or disapprove that work, and if it were approved, the Minister of Home Affairs would have control of it just as he has today. I believe that the day-labour system has come to stay, and that any comparison between it and the contract system will work out in its favour. In New South Wales the Railway Commissioner has been carrying out a lot of work by day labour, and up t ill twelve months ago- I have not the later figures- it was conclusively proved that that system was cheaper than was the contract system. The result has been that almost the whole of the railways constructed there have been carried out by means of day labour.",48
346,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Plent y of private firms are using the day-labour system on their own buildings.,49
347,Mr CHARLTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Exactly . proper supervision better work is obtained under that system than under the contract system, and without any additional expenditure. The Minister can make the necessary inquiries, and, if he finds any grounds for the statements made from time to time in regard to the system, he should take proper means to have any mistakes or abuses rectified, ancl see that the system is given, a fair and square trial. If he does that, I shall feel quite satisfied as to the result.",49
348,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Perth) [8.6] - The honourable member for Hunter has assumed, I think quite in error, that the discussion initiated by the honourable member for Dalley hinges upon the question of contract versus day labour, but he has introduced quite a new phase, I tliink. able member for Dalley, in commencing this interesting debate",49
349,Mr SCULLIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He did not commence it .,49
350,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think that he struck the note which sounded throughout this chamber in a very wholesome fashion indeed, and I have to compliment him upon the courage with which he rose to speak in the way he did.",49
351,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"You have to compliment the honourable member for Herbert, as well.",49
352,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have had some experience of what it is to stand up in a party, most of them ""hostile in regard to a partiCon- cular point, and to speak one's opinion freely on a question before the House. The honourable member for Dalley pointed out that this was not an ordinary charge, not a mere casual criticism that appears day by day ancl week by week in an ordinary newspaper, but a much more serious matter. Any honourable member with a sense of proportion must realise that the 'charge which was made in the Argus, and indicated by the honourable member for Dalley, is of a kind which no Government with any regard for its own credit can afford to ignore. It is all very well for the Minister of Home Affairs, in the belief that he has an unbreakable phalanx behind him, to pooh-pooh any inquiries in connection with matters of which he has charge,- or to refuse to give information which honourable members are perfectly entitled to get, but it is quite another thing for the Minister to say, "" We are going to take no notice of such charges, and we refuse to see anything in them."" The cliarge indicated here by the honourable member for Dalley is a definite one. We all know-and I think that many honourable members on the other side have an uneasy feeling in this connection-that public Under work under this Government is not' being carried on in the way in which it ought to be. No one can go about with his eyes and ears open without being made aware of the fact that there is a good deal of manipulation of work which is not altogether in the interests of the country. The honourable member for Herbert spoke of the necessity for supervision in carrying out public works. There is no doubt that with day labour effective supervision is required; but something more is wanted. The honourable member pointed out that when he was supervising certain works he was able to say, "" I do not care anything for the Minister or for the Government. I am here in a position which requires me to perform certain duties, and those duties I The honor- intend to perform."" Is that the po'sition with regard to the supervision of Commonwealth work at present? Is it not a fact that at least the Minister of Home Affairs goes over the heads of the responsible officers of his Department, and does things without consideration for them, and without consulting them? Is not that a state of affairs likely to bring about a good deal of demoralization? Is it likely that supervisors or inspectors will assert themselves as they should do when they know that perhaps the men can go past them and get the ear of the Minister in a way which they cannot hope to do, and that they will not get thanked even for the pains which they take in the interests of the public? I have information that that state of affairs is going on in connection with public works.",49
353,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why do you not let the Minister know of it?,50
354,Mr FOWDER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I ihave already instanced one case, and I think that the honourable member knows what the attitude of the Minister is towards that.",50
355,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Chinn case?,50
356,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think there are more cases than one which could be brought forward if we had a proper inquiry. honourable member for Wakefield is accused of making charges which he refuses to prove in the House. I do not think it is reasonable to expect him to do that here.,50
357,Mr SCULLIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He was asked to make a specific charge.,50
358,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What the honourable member for Wakefield asked for, and what I asked for, is a Committee of Inquiry, composed of men with expert knowledge, who would be independent of any political influences, and have power to go into all ters thoroughly. There is a good deal of evidence which could be laid before such a body, but which we cannot give utterance to - even in this chamber.",50
359,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"You ought to make out a prima facie case, though.",50
360,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wit h all respect to the honourable member, I think that a primd facie case has been made out. We have had certain statements made, which are alleged to be statements of fact, and it is for the Government either to refute them or to give an opportunity for them to be probed.",50
361,Mr SCULLIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There has not been one - specific charge made in the chamber today.,50
362,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I , for one, do not propose to make any specific charges in this connection; but I know that there is room for a great deal of inquiry. That is what we demand, and what the Government. I think, in all reason, ought to concede. In their own interests, they should make an inquiry, because, if they stand up in the attitude of the Minister of Home Affairs, jeering and sneering at any suggestion of - this kind, they may rest assured that a strong suspicion will be created in the public mind that there is something which makes them afraid to grant an inquiry. The best thing they can do, I think, is to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Dalley in the spirit in which it was made, and satisfy the country as to whether these charges are groundless or wellfounded. Almost every year I have had a grumble at a matter to which nearly every honourable member has referred in connection with the Works Estimates, and that is the re-voting of sums. I clo not want to accuse the Government in this respect, because re-voting has been chronic since the inception of Federation. It is rather a defect of the system under which we are working than a thing which could be laid to the charge of any Government. I notice, however, that there is a greater tendency towards re-voting with some of the States The than with others. Apparently in some States the works are carried out much more thoroughly and much more expeditiously than in other States. Western Australia seems to be one of the worse off of the States in this respect.",50
363,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,--It is a very slow place.,50
364,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is not a very slow place, as the honourable member will find if he takes the trouble to pay us a visit. I can assure him that we shall be able to satisfy, him that it is one of the most mat- up-to-date and most live States in the Commonwealth. There is something wrong with the system of carrying out works in Western Australia for which moneys are voted. I want the Government to ascertain if there is a defect which operates to the disadvantage of Western Australia even more than it appears to do in regard to some of the otlier States.",50
365,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Perhaps the State might have better members.,50
366,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Some of the States have a greater number of members. I do not know that quantity means .quality, but, no doubt, in politics there is great virtue in numbers. Although we have been told that a grand up-to-date post-office is to be erected in Perth, the sum made available for the work this year is only £5,000. A much larger sum might reasonably have been provided for the year's expenditure. I noticed a short time ago that some of those who have properties on the site of this building were making improvements of a somewhat permanent character. That does not indicate a desire on the part of the Government to hurry on the work. In view of the character of the building, £5,000 is a ridiculously small amount to provide for expenditure upon it in twelve months, ancl I should like some explanation from the Minister as to whether this is all that will be spent during the current financialyear. If so, and the annual expenditure is to continue at this rate, it will be a good many years before the post-office is an accomplished fact. There is a good deal to recommend the establishment of a Public Works Committee as suggested by some honourable members. Such a Committee would have to be a modification of the body existing in New South Wales. It would have to take over some of the responsibility of the Minister of Home Affairs, who is at present overburdened with the multitude of details that have to be'attended to.",50
367,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Such a Committee would give Parliament opportunities for knowing what is going on.,51
368,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It would be the medium through which Parliament would be kept informed of the work of the Department.,51
369,Mr CHARLTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It would practically mean having six Ministers instead of one.,51
370,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"A Committee could do much of the work for which the Minister has not time. To my mind, it is not the duty of the Minister to attend personally to the numerous details connected with such a work as the construction of the transcontinental railway, for instance. A Public Works Committee would attend to a vast amount of detail, and would give to the Parliament more information than is at present obtainable. A great deal of the work of the Imperial Parliament is done by Committees, which supplement the work of Ministers, and enable the Houses to keep in better touch with the multifarious details what I may call sub-administration than is possible under our system. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is the same in the United States of America.",51
371,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That may be so. Here we boggle along very much in the dark regarding public works under construction. The Minister has introduced an innovation of some value in a circular that he issues to members monthly. That enables us to keep in touch, in some degree, with what is taking place in his Department, but even he will admit that we get only a vague and general idea from it of the work that is being done. I do not suggest that there should be a great amount of printing, but a Committee would always be in a position to throw a flood of light on any question of construction or expenditure.",51
372,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,O r material used.,51
373,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes . The Prime Minister has given us to understand that he has antroduced a system by which we can know exactly how much is spent on every public work. I hope that that method of bookkeeping will be generally followed.,51
374,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It has been made the rule in regard to all our factories. Absolute debit and credit accounts must be kept. Mr FOWiLER - The same thing should be done in regard to all public works, such as the undergrounding of telephone wires, for example.",51
375,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is done in regard to the construction of the building now being erected at the back of the Treasury.,51
376,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There should be an estimate made of the value of every work proposed. It is surprising how near an expert can get to the actual cost of a work by estimating it in advance. Given definite rates of wages-whic h should be possible under this Government-h e can tell within a small fraction what a work will cost. Such an estimate ought to be made in connection with every public work.,51
377,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is done.,51
378,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The, estimates ought to be put on record, and with them statements ' of the actual cost incurred, so that honourable members may know whether the cost of a work has exceeded the estimate.",51
379,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is done now.,51
380,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am glad to hear it. I suggest that the information should be made available to honourable members who desire it.,51
381,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why not allow of a Committee to examine the records ?,51
382,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Honourable members can obtain any information they desire from the Treasury.,51
383,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"A Works Committee that would supervise expenditure would be a good innovation. Although the Prime Minister tells us that we can get from the Treasury all the information we require, I have found it difficult to obtain anything like detailed information regarding many Government works, and, no doubt, other honourable members have been in the same position. I hope that the result of the debate will be improved methods of dealing with public works, and thus a better, more efficient and economical service, together with a system which will enable honourable members to know exactly what is being done",51
384,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Maribyrnong) [8.25] I have been greatly surprised at times at the tone of this debate. A comparatively new member myself, I have heard old parliamentarians complaining about not being able to get information which I have great ease in obtaining on making inquiries at the Departments. Whenever my request for information has been legitimate and reasonable, it has never been denied or refused by a Minister or by officers. I take it that if other honourable members are prepared to show the same energy, they will be placed in exactly the same position as I am. The day-labour question is not a new matter. It is an old friend, and is often brought up simply for party purposes. It has been raised in connection with nearly every Department that has been run by the State of Victoria. If any State has been subject to criticism on account of it, Victoria, has been, especially in regard to the Newport Workshops. The statement was made over and over again, that, owing to Government supervision and the Government stroke, the action of the Government in taking full charge of the construction of locomotives for the Victorian railways was costing the taxpayers a considerable sum: but investigations made by an independent tribunal 'proved that the locomotives and other machinery were being turned out at the Government workshops at a far cheaper rate than any private individual could possibly do the work for. I regret to have to stale that trie Government of Victoria have been, in recent years, so short-sighted as to permit to sumcient. be sent out of the country a large amount of work which should have teen carried out in our own workshops. The Victorian taxpayers are losing today no less than £150,000 through the action of the Government in sending for engines outside of Australia. That amount of money could have been saved if the engines had been made in the Government workshops.",51
385,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The money could be kept in the country.,52
386,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And the money could be kept in the country as well. The whole thing is a scandal. It arose simply because certain officials have a tendency to discover, all of a sudden, that they require certain things constructed, allow too limited a time for local people to put in a tender, and then make that an excuse for going beyond the bounds of the Commonwealth in.order to get what is wanted. I hope and trust that the present Government will not be guilty of sending out of Australia for machinery and materials that could be made in Australia by our own workmen. gather that some dredges are to be obtained by the Defence Department, I presume, to deepen the approaches to naval bases. I understand-and I hope that the Minister who represents the Minister of Defence in this Chamber will take note of this matter - that in connection with those dredges the officials of the Defence Department- I presume the information refers to them-ar e allowing too limited a time for Australian manufacturers to tender for the work of making the dredges in Australia. I believe I am only one of many members on both sides of the House who will resent the sending out of Australia of work which can be done here; and I sincerely hope that those dredges, and anything else that we can make for any Government Department, will be made in Australia.",52
387,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Prime Minister promised that the Government would have the dredges made in Australia.,52
388,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At any rate, the complaint has already been made tomeand it was mentioned to me again asrecently as last night-that Australiantenderers are being allowed too short a time to draw up specifications, and put in their tenders for the dredges.",52
389,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That seems a strange position. If tenderers in other parts of the world are given sufficient time to tender, surely those in Australia are being allowed",52
390,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Honorary Minister knows that' when questions have been, put in the House on the subject, the invariable reply has been that the ""articles wererequired in a hurry, and that local tendererscould not comply - with the conditions. Surely, when we know what is required, we ought to give local makers ample opportunity to put in tenders for the work, and,, what is more, to secure it, and have it done by Australian workmen. I take it that the Government are pledged to that principle, and, so far as I am concerned, if I find 1 that the work of constructing many more things is sent out of the Commonwealth, I shall feel that it is time for some one to move the adjournment of the House, and have a full-dress debate on the matter. I resent work being sent out of the Commonwealth that ought to be done here.",52
391,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Chee r up !,52
392,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am a little vigorous on this point, because I feel strongly about it. I do riot care in what State the work is done, so'long as it is done in Australia. I by Australian workmen. We can do the work here, ancl why should it be sent out of Australia, and our men be allowed to walk the streets?",52
393,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We purpose sharing work all round the States.,53
394,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That will be a good thing. So far as day labour is concerned, whenever I have found that complaints have been going round, and whenever I have had an idea that the correct thing not being done towards the Government any man or set of men, I have at once made inquiries at the Department which has charge of the work in question. I have also made very full inquiries with regard somely and willingly. to the relative merits of contract work and day labour, as ascertained by the experified ence of the officers of the Home Affairs Department. I am in a position to state that many of our rifle butts are being structed at half the cost that used to incurred under the contract system. I also know that work which has been done at the forts in Victoria and the other States has been better and more cheaply done by day labour than under the old contract tem.",53
395,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,My trouble is that 1 every year. cannot find any rifle ranges being constructed at all.,53
396,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Any requests by counfind try members for necessary works, especially for increased telephonic, telegraphic, postal facilities, will always have my hearty support. If we are to have people settled in the country, we shall have make country life more attractive than it at present. I believe it will be found, the splendid work that is being put into year. the new Treasury Buildings for the Commonwealth is completed, that the .daythis session. labour system has paid the Commonwealth better than if the work had been let contract. With day labour tliere is no in the Postmaster-General. ducement to ''' scamp "" the work. Every man is supposed to put in the best that in him. I do not think any member either side of the House is prepared vocate that the waster, or the man who sires to loaf on his job-o r on his fellowone, worker on any work-shoul d be engaged on Government or any other work. I know that the officials in the Home Affairs partment have said that they will not have men whom tliey do not consider competent to carry out the work intrusted to them. believe that, as the result of the conditions that prevail, and the wages that are paid, we now have engaged on the various monwealth works men who are among the very best to be found in the States. Of ment. course, mistakes will occur, and every man cannot be made to do exactly what we wish the him to do. So far as I am concerned, I favour a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. I do not believe in a nigger-driving system. No Britisher ever responds willingly to treatment of that kind. But if you treat a man properly, he will respond was in the proper spirit. I have had some exby perience of the employment of labournot much, I admit-and I always found that the result of treating men as they ought to be treated was that they responded handEmployers of labour of considerable experience have testito the same thing in my presence. Complaint has been made about the necessity for re-voting money for public works conpurposes, and that works, authorized last be year have not been carried out within the specified time. The honourable member for Herbert referred to the fact that on the present occasion a considerable amount of money is being re-voted which ought to have sysbeen spent during the past financial year.",53
397,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That kind of thing occurs,53
398,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It does; but if honourable members turn up the records they will that the estimates for new public works were not introduced last year until 26th and October. That means that the officers responsible for the expenditure of this money had less than nine months, instead of to twelve, for the carrying out of the works. is The same state of affairs ought not to prewhen vail at the end of the current financial",53
399,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We are doing our best,53
400,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I remember the proby mise made at the close of last session by As large sums were voted for the purpose of new and is ordinary services, the honourable gentleman on promised that extra hands should be emto adployed, in order that the works might be deexecuted within the financial year. I , for must join in the complaint that has been made that some of these works have not been carried out. Again, we are called Deupon to re-vote sums of money which were voted last year. I hope that the same thing will not occur again, and that when the next. I Estimates for works and buildings are under consideration, those of us who are here will be able to congratulate the GoComvernment on having carried out well and faithfully the works authorized by Parlia",53
401,Mr FAIRBAIRN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable membei is getting a fine lot done in his constituency.,53
402,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If it were not for the works of a naval ancl military character that are to be executed in my electorate, not much would be done there. It appears to me that the naval and military officers can get almost anything they ask for.",54
403,Mr HOWE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Wors e luck.,54
404,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We may be going a little too fast in that direction. It is true that we must have defence as an insurance against aggression, and for the protection of the lives and property of the citizens of the Commonwealth. But I should lie inclined to lessen the votes for naval and military purposes, if by so doing we could increase the amounts voted for post-offices, the construction of telephone lines, and other services useful to the comniunity.",54
405,Mr CANN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member include rifle ranges?,54
406,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , it is very desirable that rifle ranges should be constructed.",54
407,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,O r manoeuvre areas ?,54
408,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am rather against the acquisition of land for that purpose. It appears to me that the Commonwealth Government are purchasing an enormous amount of property. They are purchasing manoeuvre areas in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania. What with the Northern Territory, the Federal Capital, and the purchases being made in this and other directions, the Commonwealth Government will soon be the owner of an immense amount of land in this country. Another topic that has been introduced in the course of the debate has reference to the appointment of a Public Works Committee. We have a Railways Standing Committee in Victoria, and a Public Works Committee in New South Wales. I am under the impression that like Committees have been appointed by other State Parliaments. But I am in agreement with the honourable member for Hunter in opposing this idea as far as the Commonwealth is concerned. Having regard to the great extent of Australia, and the fact that the Commonwealth has to carry out works in every part, it appears to me that if we appointed a Committee to look after the 0 public works that are required north, south, east, and west, we should have to give leave of absence for a session or two to its members. They would seldom be here at all. Undoubtedly we have arrived at a difficulty in regard to public works. It is impossible for one Minister properly to supervise all the branches of the Service which are under the control of the Department of Home Affairs. In my opinion, the functions of the Department will have to be divided. The work of the Minister should be shared by some other member of the Government-probabl y by an Honorary Minister. But to appoint a Public Works Committee would be to establish an excrescence on this Parliament. There are too many excrescences in connection with the State Parliaments, and I do not think that we require anything of the kind here.",54
409,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member think that the Victorian Standing Committee on Railways has been a success?,54
410,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , but Victoria is a very small patch of Australia. What might be advisable in Victoria, or New South Wales is not even possible in regard to the whole Commonwealth of Australia.",54
411,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Victori a is a very rich patch all the same.,54
412,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is the richest patch in Australia. But a Public Works Committee would be found entirely unworkable when it was sought"" to' apply it to the Commonwealth. At present we are overloading the Minister of Home Affairs. He has practically four Departments under his control. It is absolutely impossible for any one man to look after all these concerns with credit to himself and satisfaction to the country.",54
413,Mr CANN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Minister has a good staff.,54
414,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am glad that he has, and his staff can, of course, help him considerably. But, nevertheless, the work is too much for one Minister to do. I am a. stickler for having everything, manufactured in Australia that can possibly be done here. I observe that a number of boats are to be built for the Defence and Customs Departments. I hope that these vessels will be built in Australia. There are docks and ship-builders in Sydney and Melbourne who can carry out such works as well as they can be done in any part of the world. I trust, therefore, that the Government will not send the work out of the Commonwealth. I must compliment the Minister of Home Affairs on this as on other matters - that , notwithstanding that at times the strongest of pressure has been brought tobear upon him to give orders to foreign firms, he has resisted them, and insisted upon locally-made articles being used. The Government may have had to wait a little bit longer, and to pay a little more money for the things required, but it is a good policy. The Defence authorities ought to be compelled to do the same. Let them wait a little longer for what they require, and, if necessary, pay a little more, in order that.work may be done within the Commonwealth. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [8.42] - Whil e I sympathize cordially with the Minister of Home Affairs in having to bear the brunt of the attacks in connection with a great deal of the expenditure proposed in the Works Estimates, I would remind him that he is singled out for this distinction because he happens to be the Minister in charge of the Department responsible for the spending of the money on public works. Criticism of the manner in which work is carried on must necessarily lie brought under his notice. But it does not necessarily mean that the attacks are levelled against himself. That will be determined by his own attitude. The object of these*criticisms is to bring matters under the notice of the Government in the hope that works will be carried out in a proper manner in the future. It is also hoped that if a certain section of workers have not been honestly doing a fair day's work, and that as a result of their slackness discredit has been brought upon the administration of the Department, steps will be taken to put an end to that state of affairs. I must compliment the honourable member Hunter and the honourable member for Dalley on the speeches they have made in this connection. It is a pleasure to the Opposition to hear such a healthy note being sounded occasionally from the Ministerial side of the House, and it inspires us with the belief that the ultimate regeneration of honourable members opposite may not be regarded as absolutely hopeless. discussion from the Ministerial side seems to have centered largely round the question of day versus contract labour, I may say at once that I have not heard any honourable member on this side of the House championing contract as against day labour, nor do I know that any member of the Opposition has a prejudice against day labour. All that we contend is that in connection with public works that are carried out by day labour, the interests of the' public should be safeguarded by seeing that a fair day's work is given for the pay received out of .the public funds. I am glad that at least some honourable members opposite are in agreement with us in this regard. It is a pleasure to listen to the honourable member for Hunter, because, when he rises to speak, he has generally something sensible to say to the House. As to the charges that have been made by the Argus. I would remind the Committee that it is not the business of the Opposition to try to prove them; it is their duty only to bring them under the notice of the Minister, and to ask that he shall look into them if he has not already done so. The suggestion made by the honourable member for Hunter, that the Minister should send his own officers to make a personal investigation of these works and to see that everything is proceeding satisfactorily, ought certainly to be adopted. It is all very well for the Minister to say that the charges are false; but we have to remember that they are not made by an irresponsible journal. The instances cited are so specific in character and so circumstantial in their nature as to suggest that information has been obtained from inside departmental sources, and that they have not been put forward merely as kites flown for the purpose of eliciting information, and on the off chance that something may be wrong. We see in the newspapers day after day letters drawing attention to the same sort of thing, and inviting Ministers to inspect specific works detailed in those letters. In view of all these circumstances there is reasonable ground for an investigation byfor an unbiased non-political committee if the Minister himself is not prepared to make a personal inquiry. Such an investigation should be made in the interests of honest workmen employed by the Commonwealth. I am not one of those who oppose day labour, nor am I prepared to believe all that contractors are prepared to say about day labourers. We know that As the there is a certain element of self-interest behind a great deal that may be said on that side, but making due allowance for exaggerations that may be prompted by self interest, it seems to me that these statements, made by one of the most responsible newspapers in Australia, are of such a. serious character that they cannot be made light of. Coming from such a source, the least the Government can do to clear the atmosphere, and also to remove any stigma that may rest upon honest workmen, is to appoint a Committee to investigate the charges. If it is found that there are employed in connection with Commonwealth - works men who are not giving a fair return for the money they receive, they should be weeded out, and men who will be more honest in their service-an y number of whom, I am sure, may be obtained in this country-shoul d take their places. It is not fair to the great body of good men employed that they should have to suffer in repute through the few whose conduct has been made the subject of such strong press condemnation. That unsatisfactory workmen are employed, if not on Commonwealth works, at least in' connection with State employment, is shown by certain action which has been taken by the Minister of Public Works for New South Wales, and what is happening in connection with State employment may very reasonably be expected to occur in connection with Commonwealth employment, unless proper supervision is enforced by the Minister standing behind his overseers. It is alleged, at all events by a responsible newspaper, that a certain measure of malingering, a certain amount of loafing, of drunkenness, and what is known as the ca'-canny system of working is going on, and it is reasonable to believe that there may be something in these charges. It is worthwhile quoting the following extract from an official letter which has been sent by Mr W. J. Hannan, Under-Secretary of Works in New South Wales, on behalf of Mr Griffith., Minister of Public Works, to the executive of different unions in that StateIn a service such as the Public Service Stateand "" Commonwealth"" might very well be substituted for the word "" State""-carrying out large public woiks over an immense area, ancl employing large ancl increasing numbers of men, it must happen in the ordinary course of business that a considerable proportion of these will be found, from some cause or another, unsatisfactory, and be removed from the service. In almost every case the workman so dismissed considers that he has a grievance, which he very properly brings before his union. Up to the present some of the unions have made it a practice, as a matter of course, to support the claim of their member so dismissed without serious investigation. quently happens that a workman is dismissed for carelessness or incompetency, and such workman's cause is championed by his union because he happens to be a good fellow and a good unionist, whereas the Minister requires that he should be a good workman. The following facts are illustrative of the methods to which, in this regard, Mr Griffith takes exception :-The secretarv of a union telephoned to the Department, alleging that two of its members had been paid at a shilling per day below the proper rate. Inquiries were instituted, and papers hunted up. A long correspondence with the officer in charge of the work ensued, with the final result that Ur. W. Elliot Johnson. it was ascertained that one of the two men was never employed on the works and the other had been paid the full rate. It is probable that, counting lengthy interviews between officers of the union and high-salaried officers of this Department, the time involved in making investigations and conducting correspondence, looking up documents and receipts, together with the amount paid for telegrams, the cost to the. State might have been anything up to ^50 for the investigation of what was, after all , a "" mare's nest."" That is a fairly strong indictment.",54
415,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does it not show that the Minister of Public Works in New South Wales is anxious that public works shall be carried out effectively? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Certainly it does; but it shows something more, too. It shows that all is not as it should be in connection with State day-labour work, and there is need for Ministerial firmness. That is what is wanted here also. The point is that we have in this official letter the important admission by the Minister that the unions themselves are intervening for the purpose of securing the reinstatement of men who have been dismissed without taking the trouble to investigate such cases. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They have never done it with me. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - This is a statement made, not by a newspaper or any irresponsible party outside, but by the New South Wales Minister of Works. As a further example of what we may come to if this kind of thing is not checked in the of this early stages of development, I may refer honourable members to the notorious Fitzroy dock scandal ancl to the Prince Alfred hospital scandal in New South Wales. As honourable members are no doubt aware, Royal Commissions had to be appointed to investigate some of these things. I. have before me the evidence taken by a Royal Commission that inquired into the Fitzroy dock scandal, and I warn the Minister of Home Affairs that what happened in that case may occur ih connection with Commonwealth public works if he is not very careful in the administration It fre- of his Department. We may yet be faced with scandals which may require investigations of a similar character. I quote the followingThe evidence taken before the Royal Commission shows that 011 occasions when it has been necessary to reduce hands political influence has been used upon the Superintendents to reinstate men. "" The office of Superintendent,"" says the official report, "" is thus deprived of the dignity and respect which it should command from the workmen, and the Superintendent himself disheartened so that he ceases to urge necessary economies lest he should suffer further the humiliation of seeing his recommendations ignored."" Here is a reference to a special caseA man named Sexton was sent away, and the Minister sent him back again. I think I sent him away twice, and the Minister sent him back.",56
416,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What report is the honourable member quoting from? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON The report of the Royal Commission that inquired into the Fitzroy dock scandal. I do not say that we have reached such a state of affairs yet, but I am pointing out what may happen unless we are careful to nip this kind of thing in the bud if it is going on nexion with Commonwealth works. I do not say that it is, but we hear references to it on the trams and in the trains, and, in addition, we have had a specific declaration on the subject on the authority of a reputable newspaper, which would not, I think, permit the use of its columns to lightly make unfounded charges of such a serious nature as those contained under the heading of "" The Man on the Job."" To continue the quotationThe last time he came back he said, "" Are you going to put me on again?"" I said, "" I cannot, in the face of the foreman's objection to you."" He said, "" Y o u ought to; take that,"" handing me the Minister's order to put him on again. What the man handed to the superintendent was a lettei from the Minister authorizing his reinstatement.",57
417,Mr HOWE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"How long ago was this? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Speak ing from, memory, and subject to correction, I think it was when Mr. O'Sullivan was Minister of Public Works in New South Wales. However, honourable members can look up the Commission's report for themselves. The evidence taken by the Commission shows what is possible under the day-labour system if it is not properly supervised. I do not say anything against the system. As a matter of fact, I am a firm believer in it, but with it there should be effective supervision. I realise that inspectors, foremen, and gangers may easily become unpopular by insisting upon men doing a fair day's work. Where there is even a small percentage of the men engaged upon a job who want to loaf, and an inspector, foreman, or ganger insists that they shall do as other men, a fair day's work, for the wages paid them, the malcontents are likely to get such [63] a man "" set,"" to use a popular expression, and to give him a very uncomfortable time by processes which are very well known to my honourable friends opposite.",57
418,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Can the honourable member tell us, approximately, how many decades old his last quotation was ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It is only of comparatively recent date. Honourable members opposite have only to get a copy of the report of the Commission on the Fitzroy dock scandal to see for themselves what happened. I believe that the condition of things then existing has since been set right, but we do not want to develop that kind of thing in connection with Commonwealth work, and in order to prevent it in con- we should deal with it firmly at its very inception. We should let it be understood that while the Commonwealth Government are prepared to pay the highest wages for the work they require to be done, they will insist that a fair return shall be given for the money, which has. to come out of the taxpayers' pockets, and largely out of the pockets of the wage-earners themselvesThat must not be forgotten. Any loafing upon a Commonwealth work means a fraud upon fellow-workers, who have to find about 75 per cent, of the taxation out of which this money has to be paid. I pass now to the question of the building which is being erected for the Treasury Department in Melbourne. I have raised my voice before against what I consider wholly unwarrantable expenditure on buildings of a permanent character in Melbourne. We are spending huge sums of money, chiefly in Melbourne, which should be spent on permanent buildings of the same character in the Federal Territory. I say that the time is coming when it will be necessary for representatives of New South Wales, no matter on which side they sit, to band themselves together and stand up for the rights of the State under the Federal compact. I believe we shall have the support of some honourable members from the other States if we do so. Far too much money is being spent by the Commonwealth in Victoria, and particularly in Melbourne. I attribute this largely to the fact that the Federal Parliament meets in Melbourne, and the sooner we get away from the influence of Melbourne, its press, and politicians, and get into the Federal Capital, the better it will be for everybody cpncerned. We are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds here 011' the erection of buildings on enormously valuable sites, and every penny of the money should be spent on permanent buildings of a similar character in the Federal Capital. Why is it not done? Here we have a Minister of Home Affairs who says that he is no "" rubber-stamp Minister."" Let him show that he is not by insisting upon this money being spent where honourable members on both sides have declared over and over again it ought to be spent.  is the honourable member referring to? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The buildings for the Treasury Department and for other Departments, Woollen Mills, Clothing Factories, and others. I find that a further sum of £ 2 2 , 7 5 0 is to be voted in connection with the building for the Commonwealth Treasurer in Melbourne.",57
419,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We must have these buildings in Melbourne, even after Seat of Government is removed to the cords Federal Capital. Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNSON - I do not see that we shall need these' permanent buildings which are now being erected the Commonwealth. We might do with buildings of a very much less pretentious character. We might hire, or even purchase, one large building, which I might mention if it were not for the fact that values go up suddenly if I did, in which all branch Federal offices might be established in Melbourne when the Seat of Governpushed ment is removed to the Federal Capital. If the Minister is riot going to spend money on the erection in the Federal Capital buildings for the Federal Parliament and administrative offices, it is evident that Parliament will continue for a prolonged period to meet in Melbourne, and that not a desirable thing for the Federation. I cannot see how we are going to move at all, at the present rate of progress. notice that for the Clothing Factory i proposed to vote £ 7 , 0 0 0 . Last year were asked to vote £ 6 , 7 0 0 under this and a sum of £ 1 , 1 2 1 in excess of that already been spent. Where are the honourable members and Ministers who endorsed the principle that these permanent instituBay. tions should, as far as practicable, be located in the Federal Territory? I ther see that a sum of £ 8 , 0 0 0 is set down towards the acquisition of a site for the woollen mills.",58
420,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The sum is £ 1 5 , 0 0 0. Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNSON - I am speaking of the preliminary sums for works immediately proposed in these Estimates. The location of the mills is not mentioned specifically, but a search through the Estimates reveals the item buried under a generalizing heading. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether this means the Geelong site? It is a crying shame that all this expenditure should be centered in Victoria, while, as soon as there is a mention of a vote f a . New South Wales, even if it be only for the construction of a dredge, the parish-pump type of Victorian politician is up in arms and talking about "" the broad national view."" We do not ask that money should be unfairly spent in New South Wales, but only that there should be a fair deal. The mills to which I have referred ought to be established in the Federal Territory, though, of course, not necessarily at Yass Canberra. It has been said that the water the supply there is not sufficient; but the reof the gauges at the rivers are a sufficient contradiction. There is water in abundance over and above any claims that have been made in favour of the Federal for Capital area. Then the Naval College has to be established at Geelong. Why this concentration of expenditure at Geelong? What has Geelong done that all these Commonwealth works should be concentrated might there? We used to hear of Geelong as a the very pleasant seaside village in which to spend a few hours; but lately it has been into prominence in a way that necessarily attracts our attention and criticism, and there is every reason to believe of that this lavish expenditure of public funds in the neighbourhood of Geelong is the more political than otherwise. It is a remarkable fact, but whenever expenditure is is proposed in New South Wales, we hear objections raised by Victorians, mostly in the Labour corner, but also in the OpposiI tion corner. There is an awful outcry, and t is we are urged to take a "" broad national we view."" Right! Let us do so; but we inhead, variably find that this "" broad national has v i e w"" is bounded by Victoria.

In view of this fact, it does seem to me that we are asked to sanction the expenditure of a very large amount, not on works which may be regarded as necessary for developmental purposes, but on works which are more or less of a fanciful nature, such as the following items, the first of which is, perhaps, the least objectionable of the lot:-Addition s to Darwin Hospital. £ 1 , 6 5 0 ; houses for Government employees, ^21,000; railway and construction survey from Pine Creek to Katherine, , £ 4 , 2 0 0; erection and equipment steam laundry, £ 1 , 0 0 0 ; new court-house and warden's office, Pine Creek, £ 6 , 0 0 0 ; public works store, £ 4 , 0 0 0 ; and additional c office accommodation, £ 4 , 0 0 0 . 1 might go through the rest of the items, but shall content myself with calling the attention of the Committee to the meagre population of the Territory.

The first need is a policy which will induce people to go to the Northern Territory. When there is population, it will be time enough to provide the necessaries and comforts required. To precede settlement by works of this character is to put on the people of Australia, ancl in particular on those in the eastern States, an unfair and unreasonable The heavy expenditure on public works to which we are already committed should make us pause in regard to the Federal Capital. In this matter I am hopelessly out of touch with the honourable member for Lang. In my view, there is no justification for expenditure on the Federal Capital at present.

The following definite statement is made by the Argus of what the present system is costing the public in these worksMeanwhile the public are paying a weekly bill on this work of .£1,700. There are those among the officials who declare that as much as 30 per cent, of the money is being wasted. That is a definite charge. Will the documents and records in the Department refute it and other charges? if the Government make no attempt to refute them, they must stand, and we are justified in telling our constituents that these things exist, and that under the cegis of the Labour Government 30 per cent, of the public money is being wasted and squandered because the party in power represent those who are employed J in these works.

I simply accept a charge that not the has been made, and am justified in holding it to be true unless those who are interested choose to refute it. Under the state of things that has been disclosed, there can be no discipline. If the Government are going to enter upon the great public undertakings of this country by a system of day labour, under which there can be no discipline, they are going to pay anything from 15 to 30 or 50 per cent, more than they ought to pay. That is a serious position for the taxpayers to face. The Argus goes on to assertThe fact is that there is enough evidence in the files of the Department to convict the Administration of the wanton use of public funds. Any ""waster"" with a plaintive tale can secure a place on a job, and remain there in defiance of inspectors and responsible permanent officers. Nothing more damaging has ever come under my notice. That statement is made, not by a nondescript journal, but by a journal of known reputation in Victoria. It deliberately levels a charge against the administration of the Public Departments of the Commonwealth. The position will undoubtedly be grasped by the public of Australia where they see charges of this nature levelled against those in whom they have had confidence and whom they returned to power on 13th April two years ago. They will now say, "" This is a serious thing that has come to pass. The cry of the Labour party at the last election was, ' Give us a trial.' They have had their trial, and this is the way they have justified it . """,62
446,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Gwydir) [9.50] - I have listened with some degree of pleasure to the honourable member for Echuca, because I never thought he had so much of the pugilistic element in his composition as he has shown to-night. He has told the Committee that he disapproves of the expenditure of money in the Northern Territory, but he bases his disagreement on the smallness of the population there, and not on the necessities of the Territory or the danger to Australia of its emptiness. This ' large Australian "" bases his opposition upon something that he cannot remedy, and refuses to encourage the Government to spend money in order to make the Territory fit for occupation by white men, and so help to remove the danger that is alleged to exist in that part of the continent. I cannot see the logic of his contention. I take it that if there were a large population there, he would be prepared to spend millions, but he knows, as well as I do, that we cannot get a large population into the Northern Territory without spending money. We shall have to watch what is done there in order to see whether the money is spent wisely or not. 1 desire to compliment the Government ori the progressive policy embodied in these' Estimates with regard to the expansion of the telegraphic and telephonic systems, and with regard also to improvements that are to be made to a very large degree in the post-offices of the Commonwealth. I have, never since I have been a member of Parliament, seen Estimates presented which have shown so markedly that the Government had the courage to do the right thing in a proper way. The Postal Department has been starved from the beginning of Federation, and even before, and I am pleased that at last a solid attempt is being made to remove the disabilities that have grown out of an imperfect system. I hope the Minister of Home Affairs will see, not only that the money is spent, but that it is spent well, and that the post offices that are to be built are constructed with a due regard to the exigencies of a growing population, and hygienic conditions, while seeing that the internal arrangements are such as to enable economies to be effected in management, and supervision improved. By these means, both the public and the men who serve the public will be made more contented. Any man can spend money, but to spend money wisely requires keen supervision and a keen determination to get the best value for it. Those of us who represent country districts will be delighted to know that, so far as concerns telegraphic and telephonic facilities, although all the money available last year was not spent, largely, I believe, on account of the scarcity of labour, and partly on account of the scarcity of material owing to labour disruptions in other lands, the money is nevertheless there to spend this year, and that we are likely to have sufficient labour in Australia to enable us to fulfil our obligations in that regard. I am proud to see that money has been placed on the Estimates, so that it cannot 1 be said that Parliament has not been liberal in respect to giving the Government money to provide facilities in country districts. The telephone is the greatest civilizer at our command. It brings people together who would otherwise be far apart. It is an economizer of time. By its means the man in the back-blocks is brought into close juxtaposition with the man in the city. It is the means of saving money. It is often the means of saving lives. It helps to preserve health. The extension of these facilities in the country is the most useful work which the Government can take in hand, as every telephone line that we construct adds to the comfort, the welfare, and the happiness of the community. I am in the happy position o* being able to acknowledge that this Goveianient are doing things more rapidly than they have ever before been done by any Government in Australia-Stat e or Federal. Probably our friends opposite will reply, "" Yes, but you have the money."" The answer is that we have had to devise ways and means for obtaining the money. We had the courage to initiate a policy that would bring in money, and when we got it, we had the courage to spend it for the benefit of the people. regard to the expenditure of the money, is inevitable that, in organizing system in connection with the various fications of Government work throughout the country, difficulties should be experithe enced. During the last two years the oblithe gation has been laid upon this Government., not only to lay the foundation of a new system, hut to introduce very rapidly-perhaps too rapidly-the day-labour system carrying on public works. I wish the bers of the Opposition would be reasonable and recognise that a change of system necessarily brings us face to face with ficulties. You meet with men who not "" fill the bill."" You meet with men who are unsympathetic towards the policy you have in view. You meet with men who are not competent for the work they are appointed to perform. That is root of the complaint with regard to labour in our Public Service. We have, first of all, to get the right men, to allot them to the employment for which the they are fitted. The same difficulties are that being experienced by the Government as the worker are experienced by private employers. Do honourable members opposite mean to me that every private employer-every who has men working for him-is getting full satisfaction out of all of them? I venture to say that under the labour ditions that exist in Australia there is one employer of any note, who is the employing any considerable number men, who has not to put up with turned off. many whom he would rather be without, because he cannot get better at present. The same thing must happen to the vernment. I do say-and I say this finitely-that I regard much that is hapwill pening in connection with the day-labour system with sorrow. I wish well to the system. I know that it is capable of good results. I regard with keen regret the fact those engaged on Government work. that a section of the men who are being, employed are not giving that return tb country that is due from them on account of the money which they receive. It is of no use to mince matters. Any man who knows anything about work, who knows the value of work, and who knows what, should be done for a fair day's wage, not, if he goes along and watches many men at work, say that he is wholly satisSomething fied with existing conditions. We are getting the results that we should have connection with our public works, whether in the Federal or State arena. There are Mr Webster. In men who get into the Service, just as there it are men who get into private employment, a who will not do the fair thing. In a priramivate employer's service there is a way of dealing with them. The same ought to be case in the Public Service. The sooner Minister recognises that, and the sooner he gets rid of an element which, if continued, is going to disintegrate the system and undermine the interests of the better of class of workmen, the better it will be for memhis own comfort and for the welfare of the Department which he controls. The Minister ought to have the courage to say, "" We difdo not want you, if you are not prepared do to give the Government a fair return for many the money we pay you."" If it were known that such was the attitude of the Minister, and that he was prepared to enforce it, I venture to say that the trouble would disthe appear within a reasonable time. I rememday ber when, in New South Wales, the Hon. E. W. O'Sullivan, as Minister of Public and then Works, introduced a new system for benefit of the worker. His object was to cut out the contractor, so as to secure his profit should be divided between and the Government. His intentions were of the best, but his heart was tell too big. When a man came to O'Sullivan man and made an appeal to him, he could noi resist it. I tell the Minister that he will will never succeed while he allows men to touch conthe sympathetic side of his nature, and not make it control the reasoning side, with consequence of inducing him to put on of again undeserving men who have been The result in New South Wales was that the new system fell into disrepute, and was banished from the arena Goof politics. The same will happen here, deunless we have in charge a Minister who have the courage to do the right thing. Men should not be allowed to override just discipline; because it must be remembered that no employees are treated so well as are No man is asked to do more than a reasonable the thing, and when men are properly treated and well paid, there is every reason why fair results should be expected from them. I say, with very great regret, that there is a section-no t a large one, perhaps, but sufficiently large to injure the others can- - wh o are not doing the right thing to the Government that are employing them. has been said in the course of not this debate about the appointment of a in Public Works Committee. I feel that there is a necessity for something of the kind to be done. I do not tliink it is necessary to have such an elaborate system, such as exists in New South Wales, because we have not the same sort of work to do. But we certainly do need some kind of supervisory body or Committee of inquiry. If we had had such a Committee, many of the things which have been done in the Commonwealth would have been avoided, and money would have been saved. Take the money that was spent in the alteration of the Mail Branch at the Sydney General Post Office. That money would never have been expended if evidence had been taken beforehand as to the wisdom of the proposed alteration. The discomfort that has been caused to the men employed would have been avoided, and the disorganization that has resulted would not have happened.",63
447,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The present system cannot go on, it seems to me.",65
448,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; as I say, there is a lack of originality on the part of our permanent officers that is injurious to the Commonwealth. They have been brought up in a groove; they have been running in grooves for a number of years. They cannot get out of their grooves. Their environment is too restricted. They are unable to comply with the conditions which the people require today.",65
449,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Officer s are not supposed to initiate a policy.,65
450,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But they are supposed to know how to improve existing conditions, and unless they are competent to meet the requirements of the country they are not fit for their positions. There is a lamentable lack of foresight on the part of the average public servant in Australia. No matter whether it lae in the Public Works Department, the Postal Department, or even the Defence Department, we find a lack of originality all along the line. Men move in the performance of their duties as though they were mere automata, instead of reasoning beings.",65
451,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not the junior officers.,65
452,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The junior officers are kept down. The trouble is that men have risen more because of seniority than by merit. The system of seniority which undoubtedly prevails has resulted in the putting of round pegs into square holes until we have practically everything filled with that which does not fit. There is in vogue a system under which, just as a man has obtained a thorough hold of the work of his Department, and is able to give to it some of his own individuality, his seniority entitles him to be appointed to a vacancy in another branch, of which he [<54] knows nothing. He goes from a branch of the Service for which he is most fitted to another branch of whose work he knows nothing. There he has again to learn his work from juniors; and so the system goes on. Under it, men are placed, not where they will give the best service, but in positions mapped out for them under the principle of promotion by seniority which is largely controlling our Service, and controlling it in the most injudicious and injurious manner. This has prevented progress throughout the Service. Under such a system we have men who are constantly learning their business instead of teaching others. The standard of the highest man is below what it ought to be, and as every man under him has to keep below it, the whole standard of the Service is reduced. I am pleased to be able to compliment the Government on having made a start in New South Wales, at all events, to take Federal works out of the hands of State officers, and to establish an independent Commonwealth Works Department in that State. That is a step in the right direction. Whether it should extend throughout the States, I am not in a position to say, but I certainly think it is a proper course to follow, seeing that the Public Works Department of New South Wales has proved, in a general sense, that it has no sympathy with the work that it has had to perform for the Federation. Federal works are with it a secondary consideration. If the State requires the services of the officers of the Department, Federal works must be set aside.",65
453,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We could hardly expect otherwise.,65
454,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But see what it means' for the Commonwealth-se e what delay it involves - Then, again, for want of time, proper thought cannot always be given by State officers to Federal works, and plans that are ill-digested and inappropriate are often thrown down to the Commonwealth Government as the best that can be done for them.",65
455,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That means that the works cost more money.,65
456,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It also means the erection of buildings that are ill-adapted for the purposes for_ which they are required. In the days gone by, the last thing that was thought of in respect of plans for postal buildings, prepared by the Public Works Department of New South Wales, was then suitability for the services to be performed in them. Honourable members will find among our public offices buildings constructed without any regard for the needs of the people a decade ahead, when the population of the district will have inpurposes. creased, and the staff may have to be doubled. Then, again, in many cases little consideration has been given to hygienic requirements. I could point out in my own electorate ill-lighted, ill-ventilated, and insanitary public buildings, no thought ing been given to the necessity for providrecommendation. ing for good ventilation, ample lighting, and economy in management. During the last twelve months I have examined plans from which most of these essentials new to the welfare of the Public Service and the contentment of the people to be served were missing. facts show that State omcers in the past have not had a due comprehension bought. of what is necessary in regard to our public buildings. The same state of affairs exists with regard to our public schools. Until two or three years ago our public school buildings throughout New South Wales were a disgrace to us. There was no attempt observe modern conditions in any sense form. There is some argument to support the appointment of a Public Works Commitpared, tee, or a body of inquiry to guide the Government, or to endorse the suggestions that may be made from time to time. Such a body might prevent a great deal of unthe remainder of the financial year. wise expenditure, and would probably serve as a check upon those who were not too careful as to the cost of the proposed works.",65

459,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is a question, of re-voting the money, but of expending money already voted.",66
460,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The failure to spend money voted for various works was due two or three conditions, for which there a satisfactory explanation. The honourable member for Perth complained that a of only £5,000 had been placed on Estimates for the erection of a new post office at Perth. T am rather pleased know that the Postmaster-General cided to erect a new postal building in city before a catastrophe occurs in the ramshackle building now being used for postal One of the strongest features of the attack made by the Postmaster-General upon the report of the Postal Commissio» was that it recommended that the new post office at Perth should be built near the raileven way station. It was incredible, he said, havthat any body of men should make such a It is pleasing to me, as a member of that Commission, to know that the same honourable member now endorses that recommendation, and that the building is to be erected in the locality recommended by the Commission.

With regard to public works generally, I believe that the Minister of Home Affairs will be well advised if he were to appoint some competent person to the posiof perambulating Inspector of Works. the We should have an officer whose duty it would be to go from one place to another on these where men are employed on Commonof wealtli public works, to supervise the works generally, and see that the than men emploved upon them are doing That their duty to the Government by whom about they are employed.
