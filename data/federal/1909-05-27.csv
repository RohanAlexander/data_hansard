25,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Order ! I did not understand the honourable member for Hume to withdraw-the expression. Sir "" WILLIAM LYNE - I shall always found obeying your rulings, Mr Speaker. I withdraw. Mr DEAKIN , - I have the honour inform you, Mr Speaker, that honourable members on this side of the House have tatives. been good enough to accept me as their leader, and to add that when, but a few months ago, from the opposite side, I had the pleasure of congratulating the honour the able member for Parramatta upon his accession to this office, I certainly did anticipate that, in effect, on the motion that honourable member I should now oceffect. cupy it , and be indebted to him for the opportunity to continue this debate.",16
26,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member for Ballarat ought to be sad !,16
27,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"If I may notice, in passing, the disorderly interjection of epithet which has previously been made, I have to admit that it does not f all any particular novelty on my ears. have heard it applied to from four time. to six members of our party by the same interjector in the last few days, but until now did not know that I should also receive the compliment. The species indicated, whatever it may be",16
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The honourable memnarrowest ber for Ballarat will realise that it is not be extremely fortunate if , when Christmas customary to refer to an interjection which has been withdrawn.",16
29,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I did not understand the interjection had been withdrawn.,16
30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable memlong before Christmas! ber for Hume certainly withdrew it .,16
31,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The Governor General's speech before us is certainly one of SPEECH: the longest on record. I take no objection to it on that score, except as the discussion invited and the unwarrantable amount of our timethat discussion would consume. This Parliament has no time to spare. Some of those proposals are obviously intended not to pass, and most of them are not intended to be submitted to this Parliament. As a whole, the programme is intended morefor the hustings than for Parliament, and perhaps may be profitably discussed there. certainly would be unfruitfu l to attempt to discuss it here. This, I need scarcely to remind the House, is the last sessiom We are practically in the last month of the financial year; and the finances of the ensuing year will require close and prolonged attention. Whatever else is dealt with, or omitted to be dealt with, the finances, at least, requirebe to be placed on a satisfactory footing before our proceedings can close. In addition, we have almost immediately a Confo ference called in the Mother Country to which Australia is invited to send represenAt that Conference proposals of the highest moment relating to the naval defence of the Empire are to be discussed in private; and it is highly desirable that representation upon that Conferencefrom the Commonwealth should be in acnot cordance with the view of the majority in of this House in order that it may be givenWe have already, without taking a single item of new business, more before usthan we can possibly hope to dispose of. Some necessary-som e very necessary-mea sures must be, I fear, postponed; and, under the circumstances, the discussion of' an propositions which, practical, perhaps,under other conditions, are purely theoretiwith cal now becomes not a work of necessity, I but a waste and misuse of parliamentary But, at least, the business before uswhich we have to discharge-whic h cannot wait, and which will tax our efforts and our patience-ough t to be brought forward with the least possible delay. If its discussion beconfined within thelimits we shall, I venture to say, : comes, this House has sufficiently paved the way to admit of that appeal to the country which must follow in due course. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I hope it will come",16
32,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Possibl y it may.,16
33,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"They are not "" game "" C",16
34,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Now, I have so far dealt with the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General. - well aware, however, that the particular - emphasis to be laid on parts of that Speech, the portions to be selected for actual treatment, and the special views which the Government entertain in regard to them, will probably require, and should receive, further exposition from the Prime Minister himself. When the honourable member addresses us, he will probably be able to - separate the wheat from what I do not wish to dismiss by the name of chaff, though for the purposes of this session the discussion is as foreign as if it were chaff. I hope that the Prime Minister will point us to those measures which he has some reasonable hope of passing, and which require to be passed, and that he will favour us with that exposition of .the views of the Government in regard to them which may enable us to understand why some of them appear in this particular programme. But I venture to submit that - debate on those issues must be futilewould lead us nowhere. Members cannot - expect their election platform to occupy the time of this session of Parliament. The time can be much better spent, and should be spent, in coming to the point at once-in "" cutting it short,"" as I think I hear an interjector say-comin g to the issue. should be told what we are to be asked to deal with out of this long programme, and why, and when. There is another argument that leaps to the eye, even more than any of those I have employed, and it is conveyed by the state of this House. Ministers cannot fail to recognise what prospects any measures they may submit must have. They - cannot fail to understand how the situation must necessarily resolve itself. They cannot fai l to see that under the circumstances detailed discussion on their proposals is, or should be, out of court. Let me venture to appeal to honourable * members on all - sides",17
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,""" On all sides""?",17
36,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"On all sides, to close a profitless debate as early as possible-to - confine it within the narrowest limits. I intend myself to set a goad example in this regard; and to add, if I may, a special appeal to honourable members on this side of the House, with whom I feel sure the necessities of the case must weigh most heavily, and who realise that, if the business of the - country is to be transacted this year, it must be commenced without any further postponement. I am Mr WATKINS.'-Is the honourable member referring to measures advocated in the Opposition corner?",17
37,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I am inviting honourable members to exercise self-restraint, in order that the business of this Parliament may be advanced at once to some important stage.",17
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Look at the "" wreckage "" behind the honourable member.",17
39,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The r e will be more wreckage presently.,17
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Yes ; on the other side of the House; and, by Heavens, there should .be!",17
41,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The situation of the wreckage is made visible by the cries of the would be wreckers.,17
42,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,What did the honourable member say about the Opposition only three months ago?,17
43,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"M a n y wise words that the honourable member would have done well to remember. It is worse than idle to ask this Parliament to continue to beat the air in relation to proposals for measures that cannot be passed while the urgency of the . situation is pressing upon us. The Governor General's Speech was intended to serve only one purpose, and it can serve that purWe pose without making any undue demand upon our time. It was intended that, after it had been read, the archives of Parliament should be opened and that it should be filed there for future reference.",17
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member will meet his Waterloo before long.,17
45,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Order . Making all due allowance for the occasion, and for any excitement that may exist in the House, I must ask the honourable member for Hume to refrain from interjecting so freely. In terjections seriously hinder the honourable member in possession of the floor, whoever 1 he may be, from addressing himself to the Chair.",17
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Ma v I be permitted, Mr Speaker, to say that I shall do exactly that which you may direct me to do, and to point out that the occasion is unprecedented in the political history of Australia.",17
47,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Wide Bay-Treasurer } [ - 5 3 ] - - y I offer to the honourable mem2 Ma ber for Ballarat the usual congratulations on his assuming the leadership of the Opposition- a position in which I hope he will long acquit himself. During his brief, trenchant, and somewhat unfair criticism of the proposals of the Govern* ment I watched the faces of many of those behind him, and could not fail to observe how they enjoyed his discomfiture. They were secretly chuckling at the situation in which this Parliament finds itself. The honourable member, who has behind him a record of which any man might well be proud, stated that the policy we have submitted to the House was drafted for the country and not for this Parliament. In reply, I would tell him that, whatever may be his view of the position I occupy, the policy submitted by us in His Excellency's Speech was drafted as the work of the session, and that it was the intention of the Government that it should be carried out. We have no occasion to claim the indulgence of Parliament in order that our policy may be put before the country. We have met every party both in the Parliaments of the States and in the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and on every occasion have been successful. It is true that the members of my party do not represent a majority in this House,"" but it is also true that until a few minutes ago we represented the largest organised section in the Parliament, and by far the largest voting strength in this Chamber. It is likewise true that the honourable member has sitting behind him to-dav representatives of constituencies who have 'pledged themselves to a policy other than that which he has submitted to us. In view of that fact, I should like to ask the honourable member whether in the circumstances it would not be better, not merely to take Parliament into our confidence, but to seek the views of the electors on this question. The honourable member nods assent to that proposal, and I am glad that he does. the greatest pleasure in saying that both the' Opposition and the Government are agreed that we should invite the electors to decide the issue before us. sire that there should be any misunderstanding. I ta*ke it that the honourable member nodded his head in assent to my proposal.",17
48,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Of course, we must to the people, and, of course, before we so we must also do the session's work.",18
49,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,There is prevailing this Parliament a state of affairs the of which I have never read of in nexion with any other Legislature. leader of the Opposition-the honourable his party. member for Ballarat-is reported to have stated more than once that coalitions are absolutely immoral.,18
50,Mr REID,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,It is only when there is a premature divorce that they become immoral.,18
51,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"If I were in any doubt on the point, I should quote the authority of the late Lord Beaconsfield, who declared that coalitions were exceedingly immoral, and could be justified only on the ground of national emergency or danger. On that ground I am prepared to accept the challenge.' But there is no nationaj danger at the present time. There is, however, a political danger-the danger of a number of honourable members who do not represent their constituents being, deprived of the positions they now occupy.",18
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I wish the honourable member would not speak of that subject.,18
53,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I quite believe it . I can well understand that the honourable member for Parramatta may not care to speak with the honourable member for Ballarat from the same platform, and that the honourable member for Maribyrnong, too, might not care to speak from the same platform with the honourable member for Parkes. No reflection could be cast upon those who indulged in such a procedure,, provided that an intimation of their intentions were first given to their constituents, and proceedings taken in a proper constitutional manner to ascertain their views. May I remind the honourable member for Ballarat that, although he was at pains to point out the state of parties ir* this House, the reflection lies, not upore this Government, but upon himself. I shall have",18
54,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I put it as a reflection' on the possibilities of the Government doing business, and not as a reflection on the I do not de- Ministry.",18
55,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I well remember an experience which befel my late leader, the honourable member for South Sydney, when he took office as Prime Minister. Notwithstanding the strong and active service go which that honourable member had rendered,, do not only the country, but his predecessors-, in office, the honourable member for Balin larat, immediately the honourable member like met the House as Prime Minister, took theconwhole of his party into opposition. The Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Not the whole of ",18
56,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Not the whole them, I admit, but the great majority, of leader of an Opposition in this Parliament them, went into opposition. We met House, and went on with business. were able to carry on business for a .conable siderable time, but what happened? A though the honourable member for South Sydney had grounds for believing honourable member for Ballarat would give him reasonable support, we found very early in his career as Prime Minister the honourable member for Ballarat voted against him, and voted against a clause a Eill that was practically his own. The state of the House upon this side at that time was practically the same as it is now, and yet the honourable member for Balcult larat has the audacity to ?jgue now that the present state of the House is an indication to determine the fate of this Government. Let me tell the honourable ber that the fate of this Government not concern the members of it one iota. I have not been deceived place, and the honourable member knows well that no act of courtesy has been wantsame thing. ing on my part, and no insidious attempt to undermine him in any way has been , couraged by me. On the contrary, I have done everything that is fair as between man and man, according to my lights, to the best of my ability, to keep friendship as green as it ought to between members representing different but the same ideals. That has been my course of action all through, and I make to say that? no complaint at all about the action that the honourable member has taken; I do complain about his statement the programme put forward by the Governfidence. ment was drawn up because of circumstances and statements that had ibeen appearing the public press. Nothing of the kind taken place. The Government intended put forward a. policy or fal l in the House and in the country.",19
57,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I did not say anything the contrary.,19
58,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The honourable member - I took down his words-sai d that the measures in the Governor General's speech were never intended to be submitted, were intended more for the hustings for this House.",19
59,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I said that, taken as a whole, they were more intended hustings than the House.",19
60,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"That statement is a gratuitous insult to the Government, of studiously intended to be so. No other the has suggested anything of the kind. We Mr DEAKIN - No other but the honormember would take exception to it. I l - did not take exception to the honourable member's design, but do not let us waste that the time in discussing it.",19
61,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"T i m e seems to be a very that important element in the situation. Why this sudden desire to save time? Can the of honourable member remember a period not very long ago when time was not the essence of the contract? Can he remember a time when this party stood by him in many diffisituations, with danger to themselves, in order to see that he or his party should not be, as we thought, unjustly or'unfairly dealt with? We suffered under reflections memfrom our own people rather than seem to do docs an injustice, while the honourable member was occupying the Responsible position of in what has taken Prime Minister.",19
62,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Exactly , and we did the",19
63,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"-Was time then the enessence of the contract? No. Any time that the honourable member required for himself or his Government was cheerfully and granted by the party that I had the honour our to lead. Whatever heat or feeling may be beimported into this debate, not a single conviews, fidential statement will pass my lips.",19
64,Mr CKOUCH,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Surely it is not necessary,19
65,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"It is necessary to say it but when we find others making use of statethat ments that have been made in ' conI t makes no difference to me what statements they make regarding these matin ters, but everything that has been spoken has in confidence will be regarded as sacred by to me, irrespective of anything that may take by which it will stand place here.",19
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,There are some confidences that I am not going to keep. I to shall not submit to be trampled upon.,19
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I had occasion just now to ask the honourable member for Hume to discontinue his frequent interjections. I am sorrv to say that although he intimated but his willingness to obey the direction of the than Chair, he has not done so. I hope he will do so now.",19
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I am quite prefor the pared to carry out your wishes, Mr. Speaker.",19
69,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I should! like to ask the and is honourable member for Ballarat to state more distinctly what he meant when he said that an important Imperial Conference was about to meet which would discuss issues of reaching importance to the Dominions beyond the seas, and to the whole Empire, chosen. and that it was desirable that this Parliament should be represented by delegates whose views were in accord with those of the majority of the House. Will the honourable member be good enough to say whether he objects to the present Minister of Defence being a representative at the Conference ?",19
70,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Not as a representative of the honourable member's Government. He himself challenged in a public reference to his going to the Imperial Conference.,20
71,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Will the honourable ber make a statement in plain language as to whether he"" or his party object to the nomination of the present Minister of Delenge us upon that ground? fence as a representative of Australia that Conference?",20
72,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I object to a Government in a minority filling any office or any sentative position while under challenge. That is general, and not personal to the office? Minister of Defence.",20
73,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"At the time this apbefore pointment was made there was no *such party on that side. The country had knowledge of any such party, and as the Minister of External Affairs reminds this Government has not been challenged.",20
74,Mr REID,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Surely if the honourable ber knew that his Government were about to be challenged he would not send a Minthat ister to represent them at a Conference ?,20
75,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I quite agree with the right honourable member. I may be young, and uninformed in these matters, but I did not understand, nor do I understand that that Conference has been convened party purposes. I never understood the Imperial Government, acting on the suggestion not only of this Government, on the suggestion of the Government of Canada and other oversea Dominions, invited the Parliaments to send party presentatives. I had no idea that the advisers of His Majesty in the United Kingdom had it in their minds that various parties in this Parliament would readjust themselves in order to select special representatives to be sent to the Conference. I am quite sure that the King and his advisers never thought that such things were possible, and they will learn with that in this Parliament, after a representative has been chosen in the high official farcapacity of the Minister of Defence",20
76,Mr TILLEY BROWN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Improperly,20
77,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Does the honourable member say he was improperly chosen?,20
78,Mr JOHNSON,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Has Parliament approved of a naval policy yet?,20
79,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Yes . . Did not Parliament approve of a naval policy when it put aside a specific amount of ,£250,000 for harbour and coastal defence? If there is a difference of view on that point, that furnishes a proper ground upon which to speech a challenge the Government.",20
80,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The Prime Minister knows memmy opinion on that point.,20
81,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Why , then, do honourable members opposite hesitate to chalI f we have at done wrong, let the newly-formed Opposition formulate a charge against us.",20
82,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,What charge did the reprehonorable member bring against the last Administration when he put them out of,20
83,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"When , some months that event occurred, the honourable member for Gwydir moved for the apno pointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the administration of the Deme, partment of the Postmaster-General, the honourable - member for Ballarat, who was memthen Prime Minister, said that, if it were carried, he would resign office, but withdrew statement on pressure being put upon him by his supporters, and because of what appeared in the press as to the trouble that would arise if a change of Government occurred before the Tariff, which was then under consideration, had been finally disnow, posed of. The members of my own party for know that I did my utmost to prevent the that defeat of the Government on that occasion. I said that a large and compact party such but as ours should not attack in sections. The party is too big, too important, and too compact; our ideas are too concrete, and reour future too well assured, to permit of chief action of that kind. The leader of the Opposition knows that I told him, without the having consulted one member of my own party, that I would do my utmost to. get the party to remain behind his Government until the completion of the Tariff.",20
84,Mr FRAZER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,It was a great trial to surprise many of us to have to do it .,20
85,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member cannot say that that promise was not performed to the letter.,21
86,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The honourable member is now giving die reason why his party kept the late Administration in office, not why it put us out.",21
87,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I am recounting what happened, in its, historical sequence, and shall presently read from Hansard exactly what I said when informing the House that we had decided to no longer support the Deakin Administration. That statement, was full, ample, and complete in every detail.",21
88,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The point is that, although the honourable member now asks from me specific reasons for taking action against the Administration, he did not give such reasons when in a position similar to that which I now occupy.",21
89,Mr JOHNSON,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Le t the honourable member give us the inward history of what took place.,21
90,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I am willing to give the fullest statement j but the best thing to be done is to allow the electors an opportunity to ask candidates for seats in this House whether they intend, if chosen, to stand by their pledges, or to coalesce with others whose principles they have denounced as destructive of the best interests of the country. My pledges to my constituents have been binding on my conscience and on my actions, and if honourable members opposite had been similarly bound we should not have the present state of affairs. The statement which I am about to read was made long after the honourable member for Ballarat had intimated that he intended to resign the position of Prime Minister. I felt it difficult to hold the Labour Party together, and to give to the Government of the day that full support which I thought necessary in accordance with views previously expressed. _ What I said is reported in Hansard in these wordsI desire to intimate to the House, and to the country, that which I have already privately intimated to the Prime Minister : that the Labour Party can no longer support the Government. I can only say that our relations with the Ministry, personally, have been of the most friendly character. Although from time to time embarrassing circumstances have arisen, we have always endeavoured to co-operate in every possible way with the Government in regard to matters that we thought concerned the welfare of the Commonwealth. There have been situations of embarrassment in which I have always sought, to the best of my ability, to safeguard the interests of the Parliament, and the well-being of the country. Whilst I freely admit that we have frequently felt the restraint that a large party such as ours must feel in difficult circumstances, I , personally, have always held that, occupying the position that we do, we musttreat any Government situated as this Ministry is in a perfectly straightforward manner. We are taking this course now,, because it is, to our minds, one of decency, and of order. The time might come when one party or the other might take such action as would create a crisis, in circumstances that would render it impossible for the country to learn exactly how the situation, arose. I have endeavoured, whilst safeguarding the interests of the Commonwealth, to restrain, within, reasonable bounds any adverse criticism, and now that I can no longer do that, I think that I am performing what is more a public than, a party duty in telling the House and the country the determination at which we have arrived. I have stated our position as plainly as I can,, and have only to add that in taking the course which I did during a previous crisis, I had the-support of my party, the members of which felt that until at least the Tariff was dealt with there rested upon us the public duty of giving the Government a reasonable support in every situation that a party placed as they were and are might find themselves in. I ask whether reasons are not given in that full statement?",21
91,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I did not find fault with it.,21
92,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Then what is all the trouble about now ?,21
93,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member demands an entirely different statement from me. He is not satisfied with a general explanation of the situation.,21
94,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Does the honourable member pretend to'say that the circumstances are similar ? He, before the occasion to which I am referring, had stated that he would remain in office only until a certain measure had been carried into law. The measure having been passed, and his Government being still in disfavour and embarrassed, I intimated that the Labour Party would not continue to stand compactly behind it. The present - Government has been in office for six months,, and now comes forward with a programme. Does the honourable member says that Ministers are incapable of properly transacting 'the affairs of the 'Commonwealth, and that their programme is underserving of consideration? It will be the action of cowards not to face the proposals which we have put forward. I deny that theseproposals are mere placards. ' The honourable member for Ballarat, who has socharacterized them, and every other honourable member, knows well that they are not..",21
95,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member has not yet got to the point.,22
96,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Surely I am not to be charged with not wishing to face a difficulty . What is the point ?  what authority did the Government spend the £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 to which reference has been made?",22
97,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I expected a reply from the front bench, but it has come from the back.",22
98,Mr BATCHELOR,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Why are we not-challenged in respect to that matter, if honourable members opposite disapprove of our action in regard to it?",22
99,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Ye s ; why is there not a. specific charge brought against us? It seems to be the desire of the new leader"" of the Opposition to prevent the discussion of the Government's programme.",22
100,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,What is the honourable member doing now but discussing it?,22
101,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I am exercising my right to reply to the remarks of the honourable member. Had I not possessed such a right, I should not have hesitated to appeal to the courtesy of the House for per-, mission to do so. Have Ministers, or have I , done anything that should debar us from the opportunity to place our views before the country ?",22
102,Mr KELLY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,What are the doing now ?,22
103,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"We are doing exactly what all other persons in our position would do. I may be in error, and I hope I am, but I understand there is a desire not to allow a free and full discussion a matter that is of vital importance to people of the Commonwealth and to Parliament. Of course, there are no friends like new friends; and when we - find the. honourable member for and the honourable member for Ballarat agreeing on a question of this kind, may surmise that new circumstances have arisen which necessitate silence. behind silence much may be hidden. But, as the honourable member fbr Flinders would say, this is no place for things be done in silence, but one where all that can be said against the Government should be stated in such a way that not only honence. orable members,- but the people of the country may comprehend what has been done to justify a change of Administration.",22
104,Mr ARCHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Did the Prime Minister set out all matters very clearly a short time ago when he removed the late Government ?,22
105,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I have just read a full and complete history of the .whole circumstances. I do not wish to revert to the position of the Minister of Defence, but I may say that I expressed to that gentleman my opinion that the Conference in England is not a party conference.",22
106,Mr REID,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Does not Senator Pearce go . Home as Minister of Defence ? Is he not appointed to represent the Government as one of the members of the Government, and does he not go in his official capacitv ?",22
107,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Yes .,22
108,Mr REID,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Then he ought not to be submitted to the indignity of being recalled when half way to England. I should not like to expose a man so worthy of respect as he is to such an indignity.,22
109,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I am glad to hear the pertinent remark of the right honourable member, but may I remind him that his associate and late leader, the honourable member for Parramatta, is reported as publicly challenging this Government for appointing two of .its own number, and declaring that this is not a party matter and ought not to be considered as such.",22
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I said that the Prime Minister had many times declared that it was not a party matter, but that, while so regarding it, he had appointed Government two of his own number.",22
111,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I am glad the honor, able member confirms the opinion I have always held that these are not party matters. I am now merely challenging the statement of the honourable member for on Ballarat when he holds that the reprethe sentatives at the Conference must speak this for honourable members opposite.",22
112,Dr WILSON,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"They must speak for Parliament, was what the honourable memWentworth ber for Ballarat said. Mr FISH j ER - No ; he said they must we speak for honourable members opposite. The feeling is that this large and growing Besides, party called the Labour Party, must not send its representatives to the centre of the Empire, because of the prejudice to of past parties in this House.",22
113,Mr BOWDEN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,A member of the Labour Party was sent to the Navigation Confer,22
114,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"W it h all due respect, that was a subsidiary conference.",22
115,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,So is this.,22
116,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,But it is a subsidiaryConference to deal with matters of the first importance.,23
117,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,So was the Navigation Conference.,23
118,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The Attorney-General would be quite able to take part in any conference j but we know that a mere Navigation Conference is not to be compared with one called to discuss, though not finally to determine, the whole question ot defence of every part of the Empire. Surely the honourable member for Ballarat will not try to cloud the issue in this way.",23
119,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The Prime Minister made the assertion himself.,23
120,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The only object of the statement of the honourable member for Ballarat is to prevent our sending Home to this Conference an honourable colleague, who is an Australian native, and a man who, as Minister of Defence, has done more in his time to endeavour to reform and put the defences of the country on a satisfactory basis than any previous Minister.",23
121,Mr JOHNSON,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Does the Prime Minister claim that the Minister of Defence represents all sides of the House?,23
122,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,No .,23
123,Mr JOHNSON,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member said just now that it was necessary that any one sent should do so.,23
124,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"If the Minister of Defence does not represent all sides of the House, he, at any rate, is a fit representative of a very large section of the House. Though, from appearances, he may not be regarded as representing all honourable members, I venture to say that he represents the largest body of electors of Australia. The honourable member for Ballarat said that there were large questions of finance that ought to be discussed by this Parliament. May I ask whether he thinks that he and. his party-thos e new allies of his-posses s all the knowledge of finance in this House? May I remind him that again and again, years ago, I suggested that there ought to be a discussion on the important subject of the finances. What opportunity was given for such a discussion during his term as Prime Minister?",23
125,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,My Government brought forward two elaborate schemes.,23
126,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"But what opportunity for discussion was there, except on the Address-in-Reply ?",23
127,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Nonsens e ! There were the Budgets.,23
128,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Year s ago I desired that there should be a specific motion submitted and discussed.,23
129,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,And so there were on our Budgets.,23
130,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"In my Gympie speech I outlined, much more clearly, I think, than any other Treasurer, a finance scheme of far-reaching importance; and I ask whether the honourable member for Ballarat considers it beneath his dignity to make any reference to that scheme?",23
131,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I have been criticising it for weeks.,23
132,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"If the honourable member refers to his Sydney speech, which I chatted over.with him in a friendly way, he will admit that it ought not to be the basis of a discussion here.",23
133,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Not as its finance was reported.,23
134,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I can only go by what is reported; and so ""sure was I that the honourable member never intentionally nut the matter in the wav published that I declined to make any reference to the speech on the platform.",23
135,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I afterwards put all the financial points more elaborately, and they were properly reported.",23
136,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I have not seen the elaborated statement published. The fact remains that I set out financial proposals, which may be good or bad, just as they are viewed; and, at any rate, they embody a financial scheme that we ought to he?.r something about in the near future. It was with the greatest reluctance that I took what I regard as a very bold step in declaring for .a lesser amount to be returned to the States than had been suggested by any previous Minister. I did not do that to curry favour with the States ; and the honourable member for Mernda, who takes a great interest in this matter, must know' that, had that been my obiect for political purposes, I should have offered the States more. I felt it my duty, however, to this young party, and to the Commonwealth and the Parliament, to tell the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and, therefore, I suggested that £5.000.000 , or not less than that sum, should be returned to the States for all time, with £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 to be distributed over a term of years on a sliding scale to Western Australia. That was the amount which, so far as I could see. the Commonwealth could afford. This, it will be noted, is less than any sum proposed 'by any previous Minister, and yet it is suggested that the offer is made to curry lic ""favour. Had that been the aim, should have paltered and peddled the finances of the Commonwealth, as other Governments have done. This Government took office in a vear when the whole of the Commonwealth's one-fourth of the revenue had been appropriated; and I may remind honourable members that the revenue from Customs all. and Excise and the Post Office has failed to reach the estimate.",23
137,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I pointed that out every occasion.,24
138,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I am not complaining on that score, but merely desire to point out that the estimates of expenditure must of necessity be cut down to venue. Notwithstanding all the difficulties that had to be contended with, we - exercised the greatest care in administrapointed tion, and cut down, the services possible way consistent with reasonable efficiency; and the Government, so far seeking to popularize themselves, tually placed their supporters at a disadvantage, for the sake of carrying out a sound financial policy during this year. We been able to put to the Trust Fund for the payment of old-age pensions a sum - exceeding the estimate by ,£90,000, leaving now in that fund an amount, approximately, ,£700,000. I think the total sum approThe priated last year amounts to ,£193,000 and then later came an addition of by £500,000, giving a reserve, as I say, nearly £700,000.",24
139,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,We have in view the public works in regard to which the expenwork diture was cut down.,24
140,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The honourable member for Moreton gives me exactly the interjecto tion I want, though he seems to think - contains a great joke.",24
141,Mr BOWDEN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The Government did not spend the money that was voted.,24
142,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"B y rigid and necessary - economies, we have been able to do what we said we would do, namely, find money to pay old-age pensions. I should to know from the honourable member for Ballarat whether he is correctly reported as saying that the payment of old-age penpaper - sions was in danger?",24
143,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Yes .,24
144,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Then I say that that remark is not worthy of the honourable imember.,24
145,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,What I contended was pubthat there was need for making further we provision for old-age pensions; and that with the Prime Minister admits.,24
146,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Yes . The honourable member for Ballarat claims that his Government was the author and finisher of the old-age pension scheme.,24
147,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I did not say that at,24
148,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"They may make that claim, and have all the honour and glory on of the scheme if they like. Honourable # members opposite may claim as much glory as they please; our sole claim is that we performed a public duty. The payment of old-age pensions, will not be endangered by meet the reour remaining in office.",24
149,Mr IDEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member have has since explained his proposition. I out at the time that I could not in every understand it. He knows why.,24
150,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I have not that point in from mind at present. The question is a have acvery important one. We have about ,£700,000 to the credit of the Trust Fund to provide for the payment of old-age penhave sions. During the year we have accumulated, £500,000 for that purpose, and surely we shall be able during the first year in which we shall be called upon to pay old age pensions to set apart a like amount? first year's payments may not exceed odd; £1,500,000, and surely we should be able our taxation proposals to collect another of £300,000 making the necessary total available for this purpose? If the Commonwealth coined its own silver, or had the carried out in England until we had a mint established in the Federal Capital, we should in that way secure a profit of £100,000 per annum. Indeed, I venture say that in the first year of the new it system we should make a profit of £200,000, since the people would demand a very considerable amount of the new coinage. Such a profit, to my mind, would not be extraordinary. Then, again, as I have pointed out, by taking over the paper currency we should be able to make a profit like of £100,000 per annum on the capital that would be invested. The honourable member for Oxley smiles. Is he not aware that the currency system in force in the State of which he is a representative is that which we propose for the Commonwealth? We find that those who ought to know something about these matters know nothing about them. Does the honourable member for Oxley object to a Commonwealth note issue on the basis of the Queensland State note issue?",24
151,Mr EDWARDS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I have not said a word.,25
152,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The State note issue of Queensland was inaugurated in 1893, and in my Gympie speech I outlined in detail our proposal in regard to a Commonwealth currency.; As I showed then, silver is merely a legal tender to the extent of £ 2 , so that it may be said that, like paper, it is only a token. The note issue, backed by gold, ought to be in the hands of the Commonwealth: While there is a Government in existence, no private company should be allowed to issue paper payable on demand. For sixteen years the system that we propose has worked satisfactorily in Queensland, and although the bankers in the State Parliament when the Act was passed in 1893 declared that its effect would be to reduce the paper currency in the hands of the people of that State",25
153,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,So it has.,25
154,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Let me tell the honourable member that, per capita, 50 per cent, more paper is being used in Queensland than in any other State. Although the State Parliament set aside gold reserves, amounting to 25 per cent, of the note issue, to meet any sudden demand for exchange, in no instance has the demand exceeded i 2 per cent. I am assured by the officer in charge in Queensland that 12J per cent, would cover all the exchange demands made at - any time in Queensland. That fact illustrates the absolute confidence of the people in a State as opposed to a private note issue.",25
155,Mr GLYNN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,A note has never been dishonoured in Australia.  been dishonoured.,25
156,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I would refer the honourable member for Angas to an Act passed in Queensland providing for the issue of Treasury notes to redeem the bank notes of a private company. Would the honourable member assert that those private notes were not dishonoured ?,25
157,Mr GLYNN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I say that they have all been paid up.,25
158,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Does the honourable member as a lawyer mean to say that, if a bank is not prepared to redeem one of its notes until twenty or thirty years after its issue, that note is not to all intents and purposes dishonoured ? ' What is the value of a note if it be not payable on demand? I could have brought before the House, had I thought it necessary, many advertisements by business men offering fifteen shillings' worth of goods for every £ 1 note issued by a certain banking institution.",25
159,Mr GLYNN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The point is that the public did not know that the note issue was a first charge or. the assets of the bank, and that there was consequently a temporary depreciation..",25
160,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,We have made an important financial proposal; and it is well that its chief aim should be understood. When certain banks closed their doors some years ago their note issue in many instances depreciated.,25
161,Mr GLYNN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,But there was no question of solvency. The notes were a first charge on the assets of the bank.,25
162,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"That is admitted, and they ought to be a first charge on the assets of the bank issuing them. But does not the honourable member admit that, although the paper currency of a private institution may be payable on demand, and is a first charge on the assets, including the uncalled capital, of a bank, it depreciates in value with the closing of the doors of that institution ? At the time' of the financial crisis working men who were paid innotes in some cases could obtain only fifteen shillings in the £ 1 for them. L",25
163,Mr GLYNN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Any man might be a fool for a week.,25
164,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Will die honourable member admit that in. Australia a number of banks have for a time closed their door!,, and that others have shut down altogether ?",25
165,Mr GLYNN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I know what I am talking about, since I was a member of a Commission appointed in South Australia to deal with the whole question. Is the honoiable gentleman aware that the total noteissue is only about 3 per cent, of the currency in Australia?",25
166,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"That being so, will not the honourable member, as one who has studied this question, admit that there must be greater security attaching to a Commonwealth note issue than there can be in connection with the issue of notes by small proprietary companies ?",25
167,Mr GLYNN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Not as the statute law onnote issue rests. There may be in imagination, but not in reality.",25
168,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I beg to differ from the honourable member. There must be absolute safety in a note issue that is redeemable whenever a person desires to exchange it for gold. There is absolute security in> the Government control of all currency. To those who talk about making paper the platform. money I have nothing to say. ignorance protects them. They thing about the matter, and it is useless, therefore, to discuss it with them. in my opinion none of our currency should have passed from the hands of the State. The subsidiary authothis rities who issue our currency do so only by leave of Parliament, and in ' that Labour platform. way secure opportunities of trading and I assisting their own shareholders without the due protection of the people. I have gone into this question at some length, order that our position in regard to i not be misrepresented by honest men. hope that we shall in future hear less of gross misrepresentations. There is more that I should like to say, and which it might be advisable to put people; but I propose to close mv remarks with a reference to a statement reported to have been made by the leader and again. of the Opposition in a speech delivered recently by him in the Melbourne Hlall. .He then challenged our party, declaring that the members of bound to do the bidding of certain outside organizations.",25

173,Mr ARCHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Is it not a fact that a Premier of Queensland desired to enter into a coalition with the Labour Party the State Parliament, the Labour Party there had to forward his letter to the local political labour organization-the Trades H all Council-the Junta, or whatever mav be called ? , Mr FISHER - No .",26
174,Mr HALL,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,That is like most yarns that the honourable member tells.,26
175,Mr ARCHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The letter was read from Their Mr FISHER - I cannot say what has know nohappened in that regard in Queensland during the last two or three years; but, But after all, these statements are really pitiable, and, it seems, are likely to be repeated in connection with the history of Parliament. I attended the first conference held in Queensland to draw up a That was in 1892. am familiar with the whole of that platform, and can say that I have never been asked to do anything that in did not appear on the platform on t may which I stood before my constituents.

180,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"That is not the point I , made. I said that the selection of candidates Was controlled by small bodiesvery small bodies in some constituencies - whos e proceedings had been complained an imabout again and again. Then there was",26
181,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"If the issue is now narrowed down to whether the labour organizations adopt the best methods of selecting candidates or not, it is a very small one but honourable members behind the honourable member for Ballarat had a very different idea. The idea that has been put forward by a number of honourable memwhen l>ers, either from ignorance or malice against their opponents, is that the memin bers of this party when elected are controlled and directed from session to session by an outside organization. That is a wilf u l and malicious misstatement of facts. It it has been absolutely and repeatedly denied. I want to ask. my honourable friends opposite why it is that anathemas are always of the hurled at this party; why there is always an allegation of some great defect in us; why, accusations of immorality, political or otherwise, are invariably cast at us? Is it because we have stood up for those people who need champions in Parliament ?",26
182,Mr ARCHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Are the Labour Party the only men who have done so?,27
183,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"May I remind the honourable member that twenty years ago-lon g before he came to Australia-hi s political friends said to us, "" If you have grievances, why do you not go to Parliament and remedy them?"" We came to Parliament. We have come in such numbers that we have revolutionized Parliament; so much so, that today we find every vested interest, every party of conservative thought, gathering into one group with a view to meeting the advancing storm. May I remind honourable membersand it is a delightful reminder to methat the working men and women of Australia desire to be emancipated from their present dire struggle for subsistence ? May I remind them of the anomalous condition of ' affairs when the Port Pirie unionists asked to be relieved of work on one day in the week, but could not get the relief ?",27
184,Mr CROUCH,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,T2s . 6d. a week is the maximum wage the honourable member's Government offer to a working man.,27
185,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member has a mania on that subject.,27
186,Mr ROBERTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Tak e no notice of the honourable member. He volunteered to go solute control? to South Africa and hid himself when the selection was being made.,27
187,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Whil e interjections from the Opposition are very undesirable, still there may be some excuse for them; but I can see no excuse for honourable members sitting behind the Prime Minister supplementing his speech.",27
188,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"May I remind honourable members that the men at Port Pirie wished to have one day a week with their families, but could not get it ? We were sent to this Parliament by the people enable us at least to do justice to them. Surely if there is one thing we can agree about it is this. People have sometimes suggested that I cast a reflection on the High Court when they differed from award of the Judge of the Arbitration Court, but I did noFhing of the kind. Judges of the High Court are carrying the law, and I cast no reflection upon them; but if the law is against progress and humanity, we are here to alter the law, and I made reference to the matter so that we might e_ducate the public mind, and get ihe law altered. Surely' honourable members opposite will agree with me that this Parliamentought to have power to pass a law that will enable the workmen to have one day off in seven, if they so desire it. That has been denied to them. They are compelled by the terms of their engagement to work seven days a week. It has been said that the work could not be so arranged that it could be done in six days, but I am of opinion that by adding one-seventh to the number of men employed, each of the men could get a Sunday, or at least one day, off a week. That is my idea of arithmetic. I trust that the electors of Australia will soon have an opportunity to empower this Parliament to deal with industrial questions in that broad, general, and equitable way which would be justified from a humanitarian point of view-fro m the point of view of every honest-minded man who desires to see some meed of justice done to the toilers of this country.",27
189,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Does the honourable member mean an absolute control of industrial legislation ?,27
190,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I do not claim that absolute control should be in the hands of the Federal Parliament, but I do say that this Parliament should have power to do justice to every toiler in die Commonwealth.",27
191,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Can that be, without ab",27
192,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I think so, although it may not be desirable to undertake all the subsidiary duties of protecting the health or wages or labour conditions of the workers. It is strange that, in the first session of the Federal Parliament, a conservative-minded man like Sir William MCMillan stated on the floor of this House, as recorded in Hansard-and , I think, the honourable member for Laanecoorie expressed the same view-that if they had known at the time of the Conto vention what the powers of the Federal Parliament would be, they would have given to it industrial powers also. Four or five other honourable members supported that view, and, indeed, the Parliament at the that time was almost unanimous on the matter. Yet now, when we desire to give The larger industrial powers to the Commonout wealth, certain honourable members accuse us of trying to undermine and destroy the powers of the States, and going in for unification. We are doing nothing of the kind. The National Parliament ought to have power to protect the worker equally with the manufacturer. Having the power to impose Customs and Excise duties, we can protect the capitalist, the man who has plenty of money to protect himself and his wife and family for a year without working, but we have not the power to protect the man who may not have capital enough to keep his wife and family for one week from the verge of starvation. Are we to be content with those limited powers because of the cry of unification ? This party will not be afraid to face that question. We think that larger industrial powers are necessary, and that they ought to be direct. We should have the constitutional power to authorize a Judge, after investigating the circumstances, to do justice to the toilers of the Commonwealth. Whatever be the result of the motion to be proposed, this Government will cheerfully accept the verdict, and I am glad to have the concurrence of the leader of the Opposition in the view that, as Parliament has come to a state of uncertainty, the best thing possible is for us to consult the people of the Commonwealth regarding the legislation which is to take place.

196,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [4.15] - In movingThat this House do now adjourn, I wish to say that I regard the vote which has just been taken as one of want of confidence in the Government, though I cannot think that by it the honourable member for Ballarat and his followers desired to prevent other honourable members from making a few remarks upon the situation. I wish to point out to him that when he left office, it was only after days of consideration and debate. The procedure of this afternoon has been introduced into this Parliament for the first time, so that the circumstances are exceptional.",28
197,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,What has been done is most contemptible.,28
198,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"There has been a change of front on the part of some honorAYES. able members which, to my knowledge, has astounded and disgusted many of the citizens of the Commonwealth. Seemingly there is to be an interregnum, to allow tracks to be covered up; but it was inconceivable to me that what has been done by some honourable members could have taken place. I ask that the debate on this motion may be regarded as a debate on a motion of want of confidence, so - that the representatives of the people may have art opportunity to make public their views of the situation.",28
199,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The honourable member does not, I presume, wish me to answer the question with which he concluded his remarks.",28
200,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Hume) [4-17] The present occasion is unprecedented --the political history of Australia, and .almost in that of the Engpish-speaking world. If I speak strongly on motion, it is because an opportunity - speak on a previous motion was denied me by the attitude of the young member f .Wentworth, who needs a little more sense. I wish to speak as calmly as it is possible about what I regard as the diabolical posiwas tion in which we have been placed by",29
201,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable memport ber must not use language like that.,29
202,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I apologize for the words. Knowing the arrangelarat ments under which support was given' - by the Labour Party to the late A d ministration, of which the honourable member for Ballarat was leader, am astounded at what has taken place. My political life has been, probably, long as that of any other honourable memable member with having done what is a ber, and during the whole of it I have Striven to be consistent. I have never a colleague, and I have never - ciples. I would rather cut out my tongue, or cut off my hand, or lose my seat fifty times, and keep my honour, than remain in politics, even as a private member, the price of personal dishonour. 'been treated as, perhaps, no man treated by a colleague.",29
203,Mr BOWDEN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The Labour Party seems to have treated the honourable member - well.,29
204,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"If the Labour Party fights me, I cannot help it I am not going to renounce principles. The people believe who will fight for their principles, - even though the support of those Parliament. principles may cause them to f all . Last session, I was the humble instrument passing of the Tariff, which is weaker than some honourable members, I intended it to be. The members of iOppositioh corner party, to their disgrace be it said, spoilt that Tariff, and every one of them would lose his seat in it should be, will Parliament did he not creep into little den for protection. But some of will disappear at the next election, as some of the members of the direct Oppophases sition. I was able to pass the Tariff, the promise, given as an honourable man the leader of the Labour Party, that would support to the utmost the New P10tection, and that the Tariff should not be completed until that was passed. I have my honour to uphold, and no one shall take in it from me. I know the arrangements between the leader of the late Administration and the leader of the Labour Party and the two or three others, and I know that they to have been ruthlessly broken. The supporters of the late Government, being in a o r minority, it was arranged that the Labour Party should stand behind them to enable certain work to be transacted before action taken to remove it , and the promise a was given that we would then go out of office and give the Labour Party our supso long as its proposals were reasonable. We see now the ""reasonable support"" that the honourable member for Baland his followers are giving. What has been done is a cowardly thing.",29
205,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The'honorabl e member is evidently speaking under very strong I emotion, but even that will not permit me to ignore any breach of the Standing Orders. as He has no right to charge another honorcowardly thing, and I ask him to withdraw sold the remark, and to-proceed without using sold my prinsuch strong language.",29
206,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I withdraw the remark, because I have the greatest respect for you, sir, and so has the House. I canat not have respect for some other persons, to I have whom I do not wish to speak and has been with whom I do not wish to shake hands again. The Tariff would not be on the statute-book today had it not been for the assistance given to the late Government by the Labour Party. We were fought by the Opposition corner party in ; a manner which I had better not describe, my but which caused me to say to its in men members that all my influence would be used to put some of them out of I shall put them out, especially the honourable member for Flinders, if I can. in the The country owes a debt of gratitude to many, of the whom sank their principles in the interests of the country, and passed a nearly Tariff which, though not as good as be made better, this whether there be a combination of them confusionists or not. The present leader will of. the Opposition has assumed some funny in his life. I may say that no man on threw his heart-more into his work than I to did in helping that honourable gentleman I when he was Prime Minister, especially when he was absent through illness; and yet how has he treated me ? Honourable members know how I fought here night after night, credit for sticking to his principles. while, on the other hand, the right honorwould able member for Swan deserted the Governknowing ment when Mr Deakin was sick. that I was asked- I shall not say beggedby my then leader to give up a position in the Government that I greatly desired, .namely, that of Minister for Trade and Customs, in order to take up the position which had been occupied by the right orable member for Swan. I took that tion to help him, and I worked hard order, as it appears, to be treated as I being treated now.",29
207,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member never gave up a portfolio!,30
208,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I abandoned - now. the portfolio I desired to keep; and on many other occasions I sank my own wishes in order to meet those of the leader whom J to-night. trusted. But no more in my life, even if I live a long time! I call on the protectionists of the country to overwhelm such a man, who will sell them in the future as the last adjective was out or order. he is selling them now. It is all very to sav that Beale and company have the rirotectionist band behind them in Sydney. I shall teach them a lesson before I much older !",30
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member has a fine opportunity !,30
210,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I have; it is the best I ever had in my life. I am trammelled, and I shall never belong Joe Cook or his party. When our party were together, at the time of the Watson Administration, and we were strong, great differences amongst us were caused by right honourable member for Swan and Mr. Octavius Beale; and the leader of the Opa position, Mr Deakin, without the consent of his party, recommended three members of our party to join the right honorI able member for East Sydney. I fought mince that proposal, though not as strenuously as hostilely as I am going to fight What was the result? All these three are out of Parliament; and I hope to God a great manv more will be. For this right honourable member for Swan and Beale were responsible, through the supineness of Mr Deakin; and a similar thing is being done now by the right honortorpedo able member for Swan, Sir Robert Best, Mr Beale. What has a man in public life to live for if not honesty of purpose the good of his country ? As for the able member for Parkes, though his views and mine do not coincide, I give him every I rather coalesce with such a man, what to expect, than with things do not know their minds or what to do. I have known the honourable member for Parkes a great many years, and can, as I say, admire him for adhering to his views; and I do not like silver-tongued traitors, who act the part of the man to honwhom I have referred and whom we know posiof old. When the honourable member for in South Sydney, Mr Watson, a man we all am respect, got into power, who put him out ? ",30
211,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"- Yes; though ' they did not do it quite as they have acted The people of the country will not. tolerate such unfair, ungenerous, disloval, and untruthful action as has taken place",30
212,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Order .,30
213,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Well , perhaps We well shall have those honourable members before the country before long. If ever I fought io my life, and I have done some fighting am --thank God I have health and strengthI shall fight in the time that is coming. This is no occasion for mealy words; it is an occasion for strong men with strong principles to put, not only in the cold unshades of Opposition, but out of Parliato ment altogether, men who have no principles. .We wish to have an honest Parliament, and not a mixed medley of nobodies wlio are merely clamouring for office. I the am hurt beyond measure when I think of the treatment that has been meted out to party that, had it stood firm, had the key of every position. That party has been scattered to the winds by the leader whom once thought loyal. I am not going to matters here, but will tell a few truths. or Ever since we have been in recess, and after now. the Prime Minister made his speech at men Gympie, my late leader has been hunting round for some excuse for attacking the' the Government; and I desired to know on Mr what he could base an attack. As Treasurer of his' Government, I know that his proposal was to build, not twenty-three boats, but six, and yet the honour and able member for Ballarat finds an excuse for attacking the Government on the ground and that they propose to build twenty-three, honour and also, I hope, some submarines.",30
214,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member must not tell tales out of school !,30
215,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"This is a time unrivalled in history, and every tale should be told. Under ordinary circumstances, I should not state these facts, but, within the last ten days, the honourable member for Ballarat has deceived me to an extent I never was deceived in my life before, though I was told I was his principal adviser, and believed it. That is the sort of thing I am not going to stand. I am not a putty fool, if other people are of that substance, and can be moulded as others please. I absolutely disown, and never wish to speak to, a man who has behaved as the honourable nfember for Ballarat has behaved to the people of the country. I emphasize the statement, which will appear in Hansard, that, within the last week or ten days, I have to my face been deliberately misled.",31
216,Mr GROOM,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member* may,31
217,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I do not wish to talk to little boys like the honourable member. I do wish, however, that my dear old friend, his father, had been here, because he would have had nothing to do with that in which his son is now taking part.",31
218,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,That is not fair !,31
219,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"It is right; the honourable member's father was a fine old man, whom I respected and loved. I carefully read the speech delivered by the honourable member for Ballarat at the Melbourne Town Hall; and in it I could find no reason whatever for the action he has taken. The speech, as a matter of fact, really supports the Ministry, if principles are to be considered; and I do not see why we should be called upon to take part in such action as that suggested by the honourable member for Ballarat. if the policy of which we approve is being carried out. There is no reason whatever for the defeat of this Government, as there was no reason for the defeat of the Watson Government; indeed, the action on the present occasion is ten times more scandalous than on the former. I know that in New South Wales, af any rate, the present Prime Minister, during his visit there, raised himself and the Labour Party fifty per cent, in the estimation of the people, and that there are now joining the Labour Party, many as high in social position as some I see sitting in the Opposition. These men are joining the Labour Party because they have met a Prime Minister who is fearless, strong, courageous, and truthful. [Si .",31
220,Mr KELLY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The Labour Partv,31
221,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Will 'the honourable member be quiet? I hope sectarianism will not keep the sectarian member, Joe Cook, in.",31
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Leave me alone; I cannot stand this !,31
223,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I cannot let the honourable member alone, because he is the bete noire of the whole of Australia. I do not altogether agree with the financial proposals of the Government, but I should like to know how far the late leader of our party is going to turn himself inside out over those proposals? Is he going to do as he does in other matters? I am prepared for anything from him now, and, therefore, I shall not be deceived; and I am quite prepared to expect anything from two or three honourable members who are sitting with him, and who have ""turned dog"" as they have. It is all very well for honourable members opposite to smile, but I see no smiles on the faces of those who belonged to our party. Those honourable members are in the cauldron now, and boiling, and will very scon be eaten, and placed in that oblivion where they ought to have been some time ago. I desire that there should be no delay in regard to the financial proposals. It has been suggested in a smoothtongued sort of way that the whole matter should stand over for five years. But it shall not remain in abeyance with my consent for five vears. I shall fight hard to have it settled immediately. If it had been finallv dealt with seven or eight years ao-o, we should hg.ve avoided the present trouble. The Post and Telegraph Department would not have drifted into its present position, nor would the States have received the large amounts which, in my opinion, ought not to have been returned to them. If it is to be allowed to remain unsettled, we shall have a continuance of the disasters that followed the action taken again and again against my wishes. I am prepared to map out my own course, and have no hesitation in describing as cowardly, a Ministry that will allow this matter to stand over for five years. Their idea is to put it aside in order to permit of the fusion, of parties that has taken place, and which must end in confusion. Their object is to allow it to stand over until after the elections. That is a cowardly position to take up, and I hope that the House will not tolerate it. The majority against"" the Government on the division taken a few minutes ago was, I believe, only eight; and I think that that majority will be reduced before long. In the circumstances, if those in opposition to the coalition are prepared to work, as I hope and believe they are, we ought to be strong enough, not merely to stop the coalition, but to put it out.",31
224,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,It is not yet in office.,32
225,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"That is so; but I suppose that it soon will be. I can always fight an open enemy, but not a false and treacherous friend. I find it impossible to light a man who has been undermining me, without my knowledge, while he has been in the heart of my confidence. I can fight a man who is openly opposed to me, and can respect his opinions; but, I repeat, that I can never fight a false friend, and that I never can and never will forgive one. Sometimes it takes a long time to find out a man, and the longer it takes the stronger and the' longer one should fight him when one does. That is my position. I regret it very much; but I feel constrained to speak strongly. I care nothing for the little gibes and laughter of those who have won. They have won over the death-bed of our party and its principles; they have won owing to the presence of our leading traitor, and other traitors in our camp.",32
226,Mr CHANTER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,It is only a temporary victory.,32
227,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I acknowledge t that. ' I am confident that the people will stand by those who have stood to their guns and their principles. They did so in connection with the defeat of the Ministry led by the honourable member for South Sydney. They rejected the men who on that occasion played the part of traitors; but another, the honourable member for Ballarat, who had acted with them, lurked behind others, and did not meet his deserts. I do not wish to go into any minor matters that' have been touched on; but I wish fo refer briefly to the proposed Government note issue. An honourable gentleman who has joined my late leader, when Treasurer in a former Administration, sent to England, without the knowledge of his colleagues, a copy of a National Banking Bill. I knew nothing of the Bill until, through the instrumentality of the governor of the Bank of England, I saw a copy of it. When I saw it I was astounded.",32
228,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,That was always done.,32
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The right honourable member ordered the copies of the Bill to be burnt when I took over the office of Treasurer; but I was careful to see that they were not burnt. I have them now.,32
230,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I rise to a point of order. Is the honourable member for Hume justified in making a statement that is absolutely without foundation? I did not do what he alleges.,32
231,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"That is not a point of order. It is a matter which the right honourable member may explain, if he desires, later on.",32
232,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"- I can only say that I heard the right honourable member, in his own office, give an instruction that the copies in the office should be burnt. As soon as his back was turned I told the officers to keep them.",32
233,Sir TOHN FORREST,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,No one would believe the honourable member.,32
234,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,No one has ever found me out in a lie.,32
235,Mr TILLEY BROWN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member has been very lucky.,32
236,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Ha d I been in the honourable member's company I should have been debased long ago.,32
237,Mr TILLEY BROWN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member has been in my company many a time.,32
238,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"And the honourable member has sold me just as he has sold other people. I refer to this. question of a Commonwealth note issue, because I cannot understand why an honourable member should object to the Government proposal,, although when he was in office he was in favour of, and produced, a Banking Bill, which he told me later on he was going to submit to the Parliament. That Banking Bill contained a great deal more than is proposed by the present Government.",32
239,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I have not said a word about the Banking Bill or proposals of the Government in regard to it.,32
240,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The present situation recalls to mv mind a little story concerning a very old friend of mine in the Parliament of New South Wales, who, although an able financier, did-not often make a fighting speech. On one occasion there arose in the State Parliament a crisis which I do not mean to compare with that now before us, since, in my view, this is the greatest crisis that has occurred in the political history of Australia. In connection with the crisis to which I refer, my friend made a very able financial statement, and was followed by another old friend of mine, Mr Tom O'Mara, who was a brilliant speaker. "" Oh , "" said he, ""my dear old friend Jim has made an excellent financial statement, but this is a time for blood hair."" And he made it a time of "" blood and hair."" We are going to do the The late leader of the party to which long has taken the Government to task respect of their financial proposals. Treasurer in his Administration I know that he was aware of the condition o Treasury, and of what I was going to do. He knew that it was my intention for the last six months of the year to finance old-age pensions. He knew that I had not the necessary funds, and that that was the only course open to me. Yet he now attacks the Treasurer for not giving full particulars as to how he proposes to find the money that scheme. I think that a Prime Minisshould ter should also hold the office of Treasurer, and that in such circumstances as I have disclosed, it is the duty to direct his officers to curtail expenditure when the funds at his disposal are limited. In that way the present Treasurer has ceeded in placing the Treasury and the old-age pensions fund in a much better opponents. position than it occupied when my late leader left office.",32
241,Mr TILLEY BROWN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,And the votes of Parliament have been ignored.,33
242,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I am not dealsently ing with that point. My contention that we should be prepared to give credit where credit is due. The honourable memstatement ber for Indi is opposed to a land tax; objects to replenishing the Treasury in way except, perhaps, by dragging money from those who receive only a very small pittance. He wishes to leave free from taxation those who have means.",33
243,Mr TILLEY BROWN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"That is ""too the thin.""",33
244,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"That is what the honourable member desires to do. I just as strongly opposed as is any the imposition of taxation for the mere sake of taxation; but I hold that there should one uniform land tax applying to the whole Commonwealth. We ought not to have a nought. different land tax in each State. It is the duty of the States to repeal their land taxation laws in favour of a general tax to apply to the whole of Australia. We have uniform duties of Customs and Excise, and why should we not have a unidid. form land tax? We are relieving three the States of a very large payment in spect of old-age pensions, and that - being imagined. so, the States should be prepared to relieve the people of a State land tax. If that were done we should be able to have a and general land tax applying throughout the Commonwealth. I refer to this matter besame. cause some people endeavour to make it I beappear that the sole object of those who in propose a Federal land tax is to impose a As heavy class tax. I cannot speak as to the position in Victoria, but I know that in f the New South Wales the number of large estates is a crying disgrace. The honourable - member for Parramatta, who is now a colthe league of my late leader, belonged in New South Wales to a party that has kept back that State for twenty years. Drastic action ought to be taken to make available for settlement large areas suitable for wheatfor growing and like purposes. Those areas be made available for immigrants and others, and ought not to be locked up as the honourable member has helped to have of the Treasurer them locked up ",33
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"When we proposed in the State Parliament the imposition of a sucland tax of one penny in the £ 1 , the honourable member was one of its bitterest",33
246,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"That tax did no good, so far as the division of large estates is concerned. I hope that the honourable member for West Sydney will pretell the House of the topsy-turvyis dom of the honourable member for Parramatta. He has 'already published such a in the Sydney Morning Herald, he and no one has such a record of a revoluany tionary speech as has the honourable member for Parramatta. Let me say at this stage that 1 was one of those who did not shirk the responsibility of sending troops to South Africa. I was prepared to place responsibility on the shoulders of mv Ministry, and we sent more men to South Africa as a token of our loyalty to 'the am Throne than did any other State, or, I one to think, all the States combined.",33
247,Mr TILLEY BROWN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,And yet the honbe orable member is not in favour of presenting the British Government with a Dread,33
248,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I do not wish to give them a piece of old iron. I desire land to do something more practical. There are men, from whose speeches .1 could quote extracts, who opposed what I then and who afterwards turned round, and of have become, for party purposes, the regreatest loyalists that can possibly be The honourable member for Parramatta made a speech that I should be ashamed of, and that was quoted by the honourable member for West Sydney. It was one that I did not know anything about, and I was surprised at it . I did think the honourable member was a little bit loyal, and not a turnturtle all the time. But the honourable member has been a Socialist and an antiSocialist, a revolutionary and a loyalist, a protectionist and an anti-protectionist. He has been everything, and has boxed the compass. Now, if he could be trusted, he thinks he has turned round and become a protectionist again, but I never trust men who have led such a political life as the honourable member has done. t him, get hold of the Treasury bench, God help our Tariff if they find an opportunity to destroy it ; but I do not think they will, because I believe the public would guillotine the honourable member before they allowed him to do it. I admired the honourable member for Ballarat when he stood up in this House and told honourable members sitting on the Opposition side to stay where they were-whe n he said to the Opposition corner, who proposed to shelter themselves behind us, "" Stop where you are."" That is where they ought to stop now. What did he call the whole of the Opposition but the wreckage of all parties without any policy? He has become the wrecker, and has been .enveloped in the wreckage. He has no policy. He has gone to damnation and perdition with those to whom he referred. That is one of the things that makes my heart bleed. Honourable members know that I am speaking what I feel, and that I feel very strongly, because it is a wrench to sever so long a. political partnership and association. I feel it very keenly. I have had many rebuffs during 'that time, and have swallowed them all, yet a man who is a man, and not a mouse or a thing, must feel it keenly when he has to sever his association with, not only one or two, but a good many others with whom, he had thrown in his lot, and to whom he has tried to be, and has been, loyal, only to meet with the disloyalty that I have met with. Disloyal men, whoever they are, must expect to receive the contempt which the public' will always have for them.",33
249,Mr HUGHES,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"West Svdney-Attor ney-General) [4.59] - "" When we find men voting against proposals, the principles of which they say they approve, rather than allow opponents to get them on the statute book, I think we have yet to learn what public spirit is . "" Those are remarks uttered in a prophetic spirit by the honourable member for Ballarat on 31st October, 1906, and it is upon this very suitable basis that we may proceed briefly to consider the extraordinary situation in which we find ourselves today. The honourable member must excuse me if I pay him more attention than others, because he cannot deny that on this occasion he de1 serves it. The honourable member has always, in this State, and throughout the Commonwealth, enjoyed a reputation for politeness, generosity, gentlemanliness of demeanour, and fair play, which, I regret If he, and others with to say, an examination of his career will hardly justify. While one under the glamour of his affability was very willing to forget many things, he has so timed his actions that we were barely able to forget the one before he managed to perpetrate a fresh enormity which recalled them all. I may be permitted to congratulate some honourable members whom I see opposite, and who find themselves today where they always were. Those men have always opposed the Labour Party, and have every right to do everything they can to put the Labour Partv out of office. To them, who are personal friends of mine, I can only say that I congratulate them now that they are one step nearer office than they were before, because in taking it I do not think they have sacrificed any political principle. A political opponent is a man whom we very often regard, and rightly so, as a personal friend. But there are some political friends for whom I regret that the most copious language in the world does not permit us to select a fitting epithet. In the career of the honourable and learned leader of the Opposition, since he entered this House, has there been an hour that he has enjoyed office and power save by the grace and help and aid of our party? Has he achieved anything in this country since Federation was established but by the help of this party? Is there one solitary law of importance that has been placed upon the statute-book by him save by our aid ? Is there anything, in short, for which he takes credit which is not due to the support of the Labour Party? 'For years, both while he was second in command, and since he has been Prime Minister in various Administrations, the Labour Party has extended to him a support loyal and generous beyond the power and reach of criticism. What, then, is the honourable member's record with regard to ourselves ? A little while ago, the honourable member for Maribyrnong, in criticising the programme of the Fisher Government, declared it to be substantially that of the Liberal Party with a few extras. The programme now of the Fisher Government is, as the honourable member for Ballarat well knows, in substance that which the Labour Party has always put forward. It is a part of its platform, which I say most emphatically he has been content to carry out and to place upon the statute-book. If there is any law that has been passed since this Parliament was established to which the Labour Party has not given a cordial assent, and that he is proud of, let him state if. Has there been a difficulty in which he has been placed from which we have not extricated him? Has there been an occasion when he was in difficulties that he could find any other party to support him? That policy of the Labour Party, which one of his lieutenants declares-and he cannot deny it-is , or was, the policy of the Liberal Party, is the policy of the Fisher Government now - Yet a policy which he was content to support cheerfully for the nine years we have kept him in office he now declares himself unable to consider any longer. We now find him undertaking to carry out what he terms a national policy, and I look around to see the gentlemen who are associated with him in that great work. I see among them the men whom he has always unsparingly denounced. A national policyand Mr Irvine! A national policy-and Mr Fairbairn! A national policy, and every reactionary in the Commonwealth is massed behind it. There is not a vested interest in this country now that does not acclaim him as their champion. He stands today under the banner of the Employers' Federation, under the banner of every vested interest, of every powerful monopoly. What a career his has been! hands, at various times, have rested the banners of every party in this country. He has proclaimed them all, he has held them all, he has betrayed them all. Let me ask what has he done for us? What has he done for the right honourable member for East Sydney? It was my fortune to be associated with the right honourable member as a member of the New South Wales Labour Party in the State Parliament for five years. have often said things of each other which might perhaps with advantage have been left unsaid, but this I will say, that that r>ght. honourable member never gave us his word that he did not faithfully carry it out. Whenever he made a pledge to us, it was carried out to the letter and in the spirit, whether it extended to a small thing or encompassed a large one. We have differed, and we are now in separate camps. But tie has never pretended since we broke with him, or he with us, to regard us alternately with that fawning affection, or that intolerant antipathy, that the honourable member for Ballarat, at different intervals, has displayed. The honourable member for Ballarat has thought fit to criticise the policy of this Government. He has done so in a way of which, since he never was at a loss for words, it can only be said that there are no words even at his command, to explain his position and attitude. It is a thing beyond words. It is very fitting that a party which met in comers and hatched in darkness this monstrous combination, and which announced its existence to the world in a Town Hall, to which admission was by ticket, should treat with contemptuous silence the Government policy- a policy which they cannot criticise, and dare not denounce. This policy is substantially that of the honourable member himself, save that behind it this time are men desperately in earnest. And the honourable member has capped his action by the application of the gag at the instance of his newest colleague. His new policy, hatched and fathered by the new Joshua, who does not bid the sun stand still, but gathers into one camp the hostile factions that for years have been at each other's throats, the honourable member for Ballarat will find indeed a boomerang that will hit him when he least expects it. He sits there now and his new colleagues with him. There are no open signs of dissension in that camp yet. In his The spoils have not yet been allotted. There is an air of hopeful expectancy about these gentlemen. They conceive that the eternal laws of mathematics, which have governed numbers since the world began, can be set aside, and that eight portfolios will go into forty-three in the way that each desires. Their fond hopes are, in the majority of cases, not destined to be realized. But what power has dragged these various factions into one camp ? The We honourable member for Ballarat, in the speech which he delivered in the Town Hall on Tuesday night, put forward the "" national "" programme. I have perused that programme, and compared it with the Governor General's speech, and I find that, although he has referred to the list of measures in that speech as too long, covering legislation which is beyond the power of this Parliament, there are only two measures which were not in the programme which the late Government set on the business-paper. It is perfectly clear, then, that no measure has been put forward iby this Government which is not a proper one for discussion at this stage, more particularly since, if we are to believe these honourable gentlemen, events which have recently transpired render it a matter of vital urgency that the defence of Australia should at once be put on a proper basis. In the report of the honourable member's speech, I find those delightful xef erences to '' national and ever-pressing '' matters which have distinguished his programmes from the beginning. He begins with a ""national"" programme, and he thinks "" nationally."" He speaks of ""national character and trade,"" ""sound protection,"" the "" new protection,"" "" White Australia and Immigration."" And in support of White Australia and Immigration, and the new protection, he has summoned to his aid the life-long enemies of that policy. These men now sit with those who all through their lives have fiercely denounced them as the foes of what they regarded as Liberal principles. He has still behind him the honourable member for Maribyrnong, whose boast has been that he is as good as a ' Labour man. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat now finds nothing to say against the programme of the Labour Party, not even that it is visionary or impossible, except that it is too Jong; but he says that there must be no caucus domination. What malignant power has dragged into association such men as the honourable members for Maribyrnong and Bourke, and those whom they declared to be the friends .of a black Australia? Is there an epithet which they have not"" hurled against those with whom they now sit Cheek by jowl? Have they not denounced them times without number as the enemies of both the old protection and the new ? Was there ever such an immoral alliance as the present? Let me follow the history of its leader for a few moments. In doing so, I find myself embarrassed by the wealth of material, .when I dig for instances of inconsistency ' Mr Hughes. on his part. I shall not go back into the history of his connection with State politics; it will be sufficient to deal with his actions in this Parliament. Let us take his conduct towards the Watson Government. He, in a most public fashion, pledged himself to support that Administration. He shook me warmly by the hand, at the corner of Collins and Spring streets-anothe r kissed the man he was about to betray-and he assured me that he would extend to theWatson Government that support which it deserved, and which it had given him. Yet a little later, as he himself has declaredI heard him with my own ears in this Chamber-h e drafted the amendment moved by Mr MCCay, which brought about the downfall of that Ministry.",34
250,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,No ; Mr MCCay was the author of that amendment.,36
251,Mr HUGHES,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The honourable and learned member has stated that he did not know that the amendment was vital to the existence of the Watson Administration; but the right honourable member for East Sydney, when, last session, he referred to the statement that the honourable and learned member had been trapped into voting for it,, saidThe honourable gentleman spoke before he gave his vote, and after the statements I havequoted were made; and is it not within the recollection of every member of the House that, for days prior, it was known that the fate of the Government would depend upon the vote recorded? Days after the then Prime Minister had stated in the public press that he proposed to ask the House to go into Committee, and that if the House refused to remove the provision of the B i ll to which he objected, he would' make it a vital question. It was known all over the Metropolis, and all over Australia, that a fight for the l i fe of the Ministry was going on that night; and the present Prime Minister saidthen""We are not responsible for the fact that the Government choose to make it a vital question."" That is the gentleman who accused me last night, in the face of the House and the country, of entrapping him into a vote which he thought would not displace the Ministry, into a vote which he thought the then Government would not take as vital.. Here is that extraordinarily reckless Prime Minister",36
252,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Oh !,36
253,Mr REID,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Commo n manliness ought to show the Prime Minister that it is not right to accuse others of entrapping him when his own words show the precise position of affairs. Surely the malignity of political differences does not go so far as that. "" We are not responsible""who were "" We ? "" My affectionate political wife, Mr Deakin, and, myself.",36
254,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I never was a wife of the right honourable member. ' MT. REID - The Prime Minister is a political mormon. Even the ancient aborigine, to whom. ile referred, has no predilection for that promiscuous political intercourse which the Prime Minister enjoys. Upon what principle are honourable memon - bers opposite united? Why do they claim - to represent the opinions of a majority of the electors? At the last election the honourable and learned member for and the right honourable member for East shall Sydney were leading hostile parties. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat - declared the right honourable East Sydney to be the enemy of reform, dealt - and said that it was he whom he was fighttheir ing, and no other. In regard to the stateissue ment of the honourable and learned memthe ber that he could not support the Labour Party because of its political machine, the look Tight honourable member for East Sydney, on the occasion to which I have just - ferred, saidWhat has been his alliance for the past three years but one with what he then described as a political machine? Even a black fellow would not marry a machine. The Prime Minister on - that occasion also said"" I do not wish to fight machine with machine, but to fight machine politics with the f u l dom and independence of a representative of the .people."" The Prime Minister must allow me to point out - that whilst the Labor Party were supporting him from 1901 to 1904 there was a wealth of delightful amiability and affection displayed by him in his intercourse with the members of that party. The heads of the Reid-MCLean Ministry were, we were told, equal in all things, and 4hey suffered equally from the piratical sward of the honourable and learned Ballarat again-member for Ballarat. It was his hand that slew them, and he then came on the - again into power. Honourable members on will notice that he always comes into deavoured power after he has been entrapped danger of Socialism. into doing things of whose effect he had not the faintest notion. He frames »an .amendment, ignorant of the purpose for which which it is to be used. He does so, good - easy soul, to assist another over a difficulty in phraseology; but afterwards he invaricould ably comes into office. He put MCLean Government out of power and tion, formed an Administration of his own. choked But in March, of last year, something hapwe pened. What that was is worthy of note, which the Opposition wish to hide. because, although he declares that he has never had any particular quarrel with the Liberal-Protectionists policy of the Labour Party, he has always objected to our methods. I shall show unmistakably that, while he may have regarded our policy as a little idealistic, he ""was prepared to swallow it. And as to greatness (the machine, the infernal machine, to which Australia. he takes exception, he was prepared to swallow that, too. Let us take his attitude towards our programme first. For instance, the 31st October, 1906, he was askedI f Mr Watson is returned with a majority, will Mr Deakin sit behind him or in Opposition? Ballarat To that his reply wasI f Mr Watson is returned with a majority, I sit on the Independent benches. His remarks on the occasion were summember for marized as follow : J! T The features of the programme were lucidly with, and the audience were asked to note practical value. The so-called socialistic was a mock issue. It could not concern next Parliament, and he asked them as practical business men and Australian patriots to to the great work immediately before them, development of their beautiful land; the peopling of its far-reaching areas, and the establishrement of a naval and military defence system which would permit us, in any circumstances, to peacefully work out our own destiny. Anti-Socialism, as was shown by the statements of Mr Reid's paper, the Sydney Daily Telegraph, was only another way of spelling antiprotection. Anti-Socialism was the new label, but precisely the same old free-trade party was underneath it. The Reid opposition will do l freenothing for Australian development or worthy of Australia's opportunities. The honourable member for Bourke, the echo then, as always, of his rather difficult leader, is spoken of in this wayThe candidate besought his hearers to beware of anti-socialists, who were simply free-traders animated with a desire to do harm. The antisocialist candidate had not the remotest chance of winning the Bourke electorate. But let us hear the honourable member for We stand between the free-trade re-actionaries one hand and the socialistic extremists the other. The free-trade re-actionists ento deprive us of our moderate supporters by terrifying them with the imminent Mr Reid has talked more, and promised more and performed less, than any man in Australia. . . . . His record in 1904 was one Act, of he contributed four clauses. We have had not only the generous but - the general support of the Labour Party. No man have treated us better than the leader of the Reidthat party, Mr Watson. . . . The Bounties Bill was resisted by the Opposifought by them, and finally killed and by them in the Senate. This is the record have to show the country. This is the record , I shall look forward with the greatest anxiety to see the action of those who call themselves who are now associated with their absolute enemy, the free-trade reactionary, the leader of the Opposition. Who sinks Preference sinks closer commercial relations, sinks Commerce Acts-sink s all those things which go together to make industrial and create a great industrial future for In the clearest way he accepted our programme of practical reform. It was our caucus and methods to which he took exception. Now we come to his conversion on these points. The honourable member for Gwydir, by one of those flashes of genius which come across us all from time to time, was the instrument of Providence in this matter. Some time in March the honourable member submitted a motion that so disturbed the equilibrium of the Government that the honourable member for Ballarat positively thought of resigning. I ask the House to consider for a moment the kind of circumstances which would induce the honourable gentleman to do that. It must have been, indeed, a grave situation; it was, in fact, grave that the honourable gentleman could see no way out for some considerable time. He spoke in accents which any man not deaf to truth could hardly doubt conveyed that he really intended to resign. However, as time went on, he saw a better way; and in fortyeight hours or so proposals were made to the Labour Party for a coalition. I wish honourable members and the country to understand this particularly. The honourable gentleman, in March last, proposed a coalition with the Labour Party-no t a loose alliance, but a definite coalition. The honourable gentleman, in spite of his applying the gag, will have an opportunity of explaining later on, and, therefore, need hot interject.",36
255,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Of which Government I was not under any circumstances to be a member-that is all I desire to say.,38
256,Mr HUGHES,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The age of miracles apparently is not yet passed, and some portion of the spirit is on me, for I have made the dumb speak. As to the progress and nature of the negotiations the House and the country are no more concerned than to know one or two things. So far as the honourable gentleman was concerned, they went to the point that he was prepared to even stand down and allow the leader of the Labour Party to be Prime Ministeralthough on that no actual agreement was arrived at-bu t there were to be four portfolios for the Deakin Party and four for the Labour Party. There was a definite agreement proposed; and, if it was not consummated, the blame does not lie with the honourable gentleman and his friends. They were prepared to swallow not only our policy but our methods. They were prepared to contract an alliance with men whom we have lately been told practised the worse methods of Tammany. They were prepared to ally 'themselves with men whose methods are subversive of liberty, and which make democratic government in this country impossible. Even more, they were prepared to sacrifice four of their own men-to throw overboard anybody and everybody-so long as the honourable gentleman, who has led in turn all parties, might have an opportunity of leading one more. The tongue of the right honourable member for East Sydney is, unfortunately, tied, and we may not claim his assistance in this debate; but his genial soul is rejoicing, and so he is piously thanking God that, amongst other things, there are thorns even in the e most fragrant and attractive rosebud. That right honourable member called the honourable member for Ballarat a political Mormon ; and, truly, the honourable member has made advances to all parties, has in turn embraced them all, and has deserted them all. He has now dragged into this great combination some men whom nothing but a miracle can save from the vengeance of the people, and he knows it. There are men amongst them who, if they went before their constituencies as allies of the gentlemen who sit in the Opposition corner, would not receive twenty-four hours'"" quarter, and who know that the day Parliament is dissolved is the day before their death. The honourable member for Ballarat knows that; but so long as he is in office, what matters it ? What matters the policy or fate of those who follow him, since he has never attempted to carry out any that was not the policy of those who stood behind him? When they altered he altered; , when they halted he halted. When they ceased to be useful he deserted them. When their policy ceased to be popular he abandoned it. We p as s from this and come to the latest exhibition of the honourable member's versatility. The Fisher Government came in. Before that event, there was a vote of want of confidence moved, and, during the course of the debate, the honourable member for Ballarat spoke about the loyal support that had been given to him by the Labour Party. He said that when that party came in, if it elected to come into power, he should not complain; but I ask the House whether the honourable member has since done anything else but complain? What is the action today but the embodiment of complaint in deeds? What sin have we committed? Of what act of omission are we accused? Have we committed any act of maladministration, on which we can be pilloried ? If so, let us and the country know.",38
257,Mr FAIRBAIRN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,What about the telephones ?',39
258,Mr HUGHES,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I was not alluding to acts of administration which have placed m e of the most important Departments of the country on a sound, equitable, and business-like basis. I w ss speaking of acts of maladministration which would justify .such action as has been taken to-daysuch a combination as we now see before us. If we have been guilty of maladministration of the public affairs of the country, of corruption and rottenness such as has been hinted, but which none dare put in formal and precise terms, then, indeed, we deserve that every honest man shall range himself against us. We are told that the people are against us, and that majority rule is in danger because of the caucus. But the honourable member - for Ballarat slept securely alongside the caucus for years. It was the cradle in which he lay and was rocked asleep, and his complaints were never violent save at times when the - caucus threatened to turn him out. When 'he was rocked by the caucus it was good, 'but when he was ejected by the caucus it was bad. Now it is said that rule by majority is in danger. How? Rule by majority is in danger when we see a combination of parties, who at the last election were returned on diametrically opposite policies. The honourable member for Ballarat denounced the honourable member for - East Sydney, and said that anti-Socialism was not the cry, but was a mere bogy behind which the reactionary was trying to hide. He declared that Socialism was not the cry, because the Commonwealth Parliament could not indulge in any scheme - of Socialism, and, therefore, it was a mere beating of the air to say there was a Socialist Party here. The honourable member said that, and cannot deny it. Now we see him claim that majority rule can only 'be carried out when there are banded together men who, on every fundamental - principle, were violently opposed at the 'last election. There is only one way by - which men who, returned on one platform, abandon that platform, can persuade the country that they have any justification. ""They must be able to say that the men who - elected them on one set of principles are content that these shall be abjectly abandoned, without pretence, excuse, or reason. They must be able to show, by the most convincing proofs, that the people have released them from their pledges and approve of their apostasy. Or else they ought to stand, as they do, convicted of a shameless effort to get on to the Treasury benches-of a servile deference to some power, whose very nature we do not know, and can only conjecture. The honourable member for Maribyrnong who speaks about caucus methods, to what power does he submit? There was lately an organization formed in these States calling itself the Orange Political Organization. The honoror able member for Maribyrnong has lately declared that the Labour Party is a party which is not composed of free men-that freedom is not compatible with Labour Party methods. I say that the honourable member's very soul is not his own. I say that he no more dare move, or vote, or give an expression of opinion, against the opinion of the Orange Lodge than he dare* attempt, were he on the top of the highest tower in the city, to leap down. He speaks of freedom ! When a member of that body so far forgot himself as to exercise that freedom which he champions as to vote for candidate Crouch against candidate MCCay, he was summarily ejected from the lodge. It is from such a source as this we hear about freedom-fro m the lips of the honourable member for Maribyrnong, who, I say, is the very creature of this organization, and absolutely dare not do that which becomes a man, and express his opinion, if that opinion be against the opinion of his lodge. In the party to which I belong, every man is as good as every other man. We do not permit one member of our partu to say to another, "" You were elected on such and such a programme, but, since I have changed my opinions, you must either come over with me, or be marked off the ticket."" No power can compel one member of the Labour Party to abandon his principles or range himself behind the hosts of monopoly. Will the leader of the Opposition deny that if the honourable member for Maribyrnong, the honourable member for Bourke, the honourable member for Corio, and the honourable member for Batmanwho, with some show of justification, have declared themselves Democrats-ha d dared to vote against the proposed combination their names would have been struck off the Age ticket? At page 17 of the introduction to the life of the late David Syme, we have the following clear admission, in the words of the honourable member for Ballarat himself, of his exceedingly great power as proprietor of the AgeThe relations between its proprietor and men were intimate to a surprising degree. He enjoyed their confidence in and out of office, shaping their programmes from time to time, governing their selection of colleagues as incoming Premiers, and enjoying afterwards a knowledge of the inmost secrets of Cabinets often undisclosed to many of the Ministers within them. Here then is one of the methods by which the flag of freedom has been kept flying in this State. It is in a newspaper editor's sanctum that the policy of this country has been drawn up. It is at his bidding, and according to his view, that these honourable gentlemen have gone abroad to preach the doctrine of freedom. Free ! They do not know even the meaning of the word. Free! Does the hdnorable member for Maribyr. nong say that he is comfortable now ? Why does he not sit with his friends? Why does he not go among those honourable members whom he declared to be the champions of a black Australia? Why does he not sit beside the Chairman of the Employers' Federation? His place is there. It is under that cegis that these honourable members now come at the instigation of the Age-unde r the domination of the Orange Political Party, against which not one of them-no t even the honourable member for Ballarat, who voted for the Home Rule resolution passed by this House, dares to say a word. It is, T say, under this sinister patronage that the great National Liberal policy is to be carried out. These honourable members speak of freedom and caucus domination. I reply that they were willing to embrace us - caucus, platform, and everything else. They were - willing to share with us the portfolios of office. They were willing to do anything and everything so Jong as they might be permitted to hold office. What is still more interesting, they were willing to do this at intervals for years; they have been willing at any time between the beginning of the last recess and the present moment. What is the true reason for this unholy combination f Is it, as the honourable gentleman has clearly stated, that the Deakinite members of it feared for their seats? It is, then, not a matter of principle at all. These honourable members said that if we would give them a fair run, they would supMr Hughes. port us. They would have consummated an alliance with us, and have supported usup to the last moment, if by so doing they could have secured that. Whether it be right or wrong that we should oppose them, surely it is infamous that a man's principles,, public to which he is pledged to his electors, should be a matter for bargaining of that sort. If I believe that the policy of the Labour Party is right, am I to purchase an hour's occupation of office by supporting, some other party, merely because it declares that, if I do so, it will not opposeme? Could there be anything more contemptible and indefensible? Yet the position of the leader of the Opposition is this : That he was prepared, even at theeleventh hour, to*embrace the Labour Party ; but because the Labour Party opened up nonegotiations with him-too k no notice of him ; did not ask him what they were to do; but simply did that which they believed to be right, without consulting him, or any one else, he was irritated. Such methodsnaturallv infuriate and irritate a man of his type. He never ventured to do anything without consultation with those upon whose support he was dependent for every hour of hisoffice. To the eternal credit of the presentPrime Minister, be it said, however, that"" he never consulted any one except his colleagues ox his followers. He never went to any newspaper editor or to the Employers' Federation, or even to Joshua. It matters not to us what this man or thatr may think or say of us. That which well ave placed in the forefront of our programme we shall do, and shall ask no man, save the electors of this country, whether it is right or wrong. If , as honourable members opposite say, majority rule is in danger, how shall we ascertain whether or not that is so? There is one sure and certain way; but the passage to it is through cold, inhospitable and desert places. There is wailing and gnashing of teeth beyond. There will be many who go through the passage that will not emerge alive. Because of that, these honourable members, who talk of the rule of the majority, fear - as they fear the devil, I was going to say, but they do not fear him for they are his servants-fear , as they fear nothing else, an appeal to the people. And yet, if ever there was a-time when the people desired to have an opportunity to say what they think, it is now. Let those honourable members wholove liberty, and say that we are the foes of freedom and the people, put it to the issue of a struggle, and go before the people. Since they will not let us say here what is - to be said in defence of our policy, but cover up in a way that is shameless and unprecedented, their attempt to oust from clfice a party whose policy they have approved, - against whose administration they can say .nothing, whose policy they were prepared to adopt, whose methods they have criticised, but have been, for years, in the habit of - condoning, let them agree to go before the people. They admit that on two separate occasions, if not more, they were prepared to form a complete and workable alliance with us. They were prepared to form with - us a coalition as complete as was that which marked the Government of the right honourable member for East Sydney and the exhonorable member for Gippsland, Mr. MCLean. There was to be a sharing of portfolios. I wish to emphasize that point again, so that every man and woman in the Commonwealth may know that these honourable members were absolutely prepared to go 'bodily into the Labour camp, to work with us, to hear what w'e had to say, and to support a platform upon which we jointly - agreed. In the circumstances, the attitude of the leader of the Opposition, and of his party, is one which, in spite of - every effort they may make-and the effort now being made is defeating itself-wil l go forth to the people as an admission that - they have done now a deed of which they are heartily ashamed. I speak now of the generality of honourable members, and not - of any one individual. I know honourable members who now find themselves in company which they detest. In fact, they all detest each other. The honourable member for Maribyrnong does not regard - the political opinions of the honourable member for Fawkner with greater detestation -'than that with which the honourable member for Fawkner regards those of the honourable - member for Maribyrnong. And the honourable member for Flinders ! What are his political opinions? Since when have they - coincided with those of the honourable member for Bourke? Upon what particular principles are they agreed? What sanction 'have they for this agreement? Absolutely none. It were idle to attempt to say one word of the right honourable member for Swan, save that in him we have the piteous spectacle of a man grown old in the service of the country, who, in his insatiable lust for office, has made one more ignoble --twist. I shall not say that he has sacrificed any principle. Itwere as well to say that as to accuse a corpse of having sacrificed its life. But I do say that he has sacrificed what little dignity yet belonged to him. There these honourable members sit, and I do not wish to say one word more of them. What of the honourable member for Lang, whose touching appeal to the free-traders of New South Wales so lately appeared in the Sydney press? In that appeal he urged that the proposed concession to protection was indefensible. . I do not see him here in the body at the moment, but his soul must be torn with agony when he sees himself surrounded by honourable members whom he has vehemently denounced for many years, and who, so far as I know, he was prepared until yesterday to denounce. That honourable member, too, has condemned the caucus. What power has brought him into such a fol d ? To what do we owe the fact that he has signed an eternal truce in favour of protection? Whom should we congratulate in this combination? Who has secured the victory, and at What price? I hold that though no man has been victorious, since men at the mercy of such a leader live only from day to day, yet the reactionaries have the most right to triumph. The cause of Liberalism is hopelessly doomed when it depends upon the daily and hourly support of honourable members who have ever been its open and avowed enemies. If the honourable member for Ballarat be gifted with even ten times the eloquence of Demosthenes there are damning facts that will refute him and stop the ears of the public when he tries to explain these matters away. How will he explain that a party with which for nine years, with One break of eleven months, he was in close association, with which he was prepared to contract an actual alliance, upon which he had been dependent daily and hourly for office, has been treated as he has treated us? How will he explain his surrender of the citadel of Liberalism to the hosts of re-action? The people will see that he has basely and ungenerously paid us for support given through long years by conduct which no man yet even on his side has ventured to defend, and no man in this country, save the honourable gentleman himself, will endeavour to defend. They will ' say there could have been only one reason for this conduct and that it was perfectly plain. The vested interests of this country have been aroused and alarmed. I look over the Governor General's speech and see the cause. We propose to impose a tax on the unimproved value of land. Honourable members opposite say little about that proposal, - but it is the main reason for their action. The Labour Party will do this thing, and they know it, and, therefore, their so-called principles have been abandoned, their so called scruples have been swallowed, and they are now banded together. The great vested interests needed a leader to protect them; and they have found one ready to their hand. He has persuaded those who called themselves democrats to go over to the reactionaries. He has persuaded the reactionaries, for the time being, to cover their vulpine faces with the wool of the sheep. But the people, when they have an opportunity, will tear that cover off them, and disclose them as they are. And they will sweep into outer darkness, too, those who, professing democracy, have betrayed them. I leave it now to the House and the country to decide between us. I venture to say that in spite of everything that the honourable member and his allies can do, they will be compelled to face their masters before very long.",39
259,Mr CHANTER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Riverina) [5.56LImmediately I rose, I heard an interjection, "" Is this a 'stonewall? ' "" It is but it is an appeal to the members of this - House for freedom of speech, which the Opposition has attempted to deny to the representatives of the people. prepared to support the motion of the Prime Minister to get on with the legitimate business of which he had given notice, as embodied in' the Governor General's speech. I am one of those who were anxious to get at that business. I have lately been associated with a number of men for whom I had a feeling of personal respect, as well as of strong political affinity. One of itheir proud boasts, in which I joined, was that at all times they believed in fair play. But now that they have left the party to which I am proud to have belonged for so many vears-w e have not left it, but have stood by our principles, and it is they who have gone-on e of their very first acts has been to denv to others that freedom of speech and libertv of criticism which they have always claimed, by lending themselves""to an unprecedented and most shameless effort to gag the representatives of the people, and deny them the opportunity of saying in the only effective manner possible- "" I am in favour of the Liberal policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister, and approved by the leader of the Opposition, and I wish to give effect to it . "" Like my old friend and associate, the honourable member for Hume, I feel very strongly on this question, and I am going to use plain language. 1 did mv best to point out to the members with whom I was associated what I conceived to be my duty and theirs, and that was to stand by our principles, and not to attempt to get away from any consequences that adherence to those principles might entail.

History has repeated itself on this occasion. I well recall the time when the Labour Party were previously in power, under the honourable member for South Sydney, a man respected in this House and in the country. I recall also my own action at that time, and the action of those friends who are now associated with me. I remember keenly the dastardly tricks that were resorted to in order to displace that Government from power.",42
260,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Order ! The honourable member is too old a member not tonot; know that those remarks are quite contrary to the Standing Orders, and I ask him to withdraw them",42
261,Mr CHANTER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I used the word I was "" dastardly "" because I conceive that everything that infringes the sacred principles of fair plav is dastardly.",42
262,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I have asked the honourable member to withdraw the statementI ask him now not to qualify it. Mr CHANTER. - Certainly, I withdraw it in deference to your ruling, sir, and' as it is not in order to use the word "" dastardly,"" I shall try to find another to meet the circumstances. I will say that the thing was done in the most highly improper way, both from a political and personal point of ' view. It was done in such a way as todestroy the feeling of pride which every Britisher has at all times in the intention to give fair play even to his opponent, and not hit below the belt. On that occasion, the blow was struck below thebelt. I have no desire now to re-quote thestatements which I made then, although 1 can well remember them, and they are recorded in Hansard.; but I resented asstrongly then as I do now, the manner in which we, as friends and associates, and' not foes, of a party who had absolutely assisted us to give effect to the legislation of 'the country, were treating them. To-day we had an undoubted right, established by precedent, to debate the great question of the policy submitted to the people by the Prime Minister on the one hand, and criticised by the leader of the Opposition on the other. That policy is now before the public in a concrete form, but the Opposition, by their action to-da,v, will to a certain extent succeed in closing our mouths as to whether we are going to stand by that policy and by our pledges, or be traitors to the cause. The situation can be viewed in no other light. We were a great party, but we now number only four. I was one of the three who, in the face of all the capio talistic influence, the land-owning interests, and the free-trade and importing interests, raised the banner of protection for Australians in New South Wales twenty-four vears ago. I have kept that banner flying ever since, and I have on this occasion' taken action with my old friend and associate, the honourable member for Hume, because I wanted to see that banner continue to float over Australia. I was prepared to lay down my political life at any time in its defence, and I will not join with anv set of men. who will drag it down into the dust for the sake of gaining office temporarilv, or saving their own political skins at the next elections. I can say fearlessly that no man has promised me on behalf of the Labour Partv immunity from attack at the next elections. I say that in their presence, and I know what their wishes are.",42

264,Mr CHANTER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I have known the honourable member for the last thirty years, and I know that God has gifted him with great freedom of speech. I am fighting now for an opportunity for him to stand on the floor of tfie House and give the reasons why, in his opinion, the policy laid on the table by the Prime Minister should not be given effect to. We do not want this hide-and-seek business. We want fearless, courageous action on the part of the representatives of the people, in order that the country may be shown that the difference between ""the policy put forward by the Prime Minister and that proposed to be submitted on behalf of the Opposition is practically the difference between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. difference is that the Labour Party are getting the plums of office, and the other party want to get them out. This move Adjournment. [27 MAY , 1909.] Adjournment. 141 has been taken for no other purpose; and I say that it is an unholy act to displace a set of men simply in order to take their places without altering their policy. Looking back into history, a study of the works of any great parliamentary authority will show that whenever trouble arose between the two great political parties in England, no Government was ever displaced except on a difference of policy. But this Government is to be displaced without any difference as to policy.

Sitting .suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m.",45
290,Mr STORRER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Bass) [7.45]--It is not my intention to take up much time in discussing the motion for adjournment. I regret exceedingly I have not an opportunity to give an explanation of my vote this afternoon. That opportunity has been taken away by the tactics adopted, which I deplore, as I always have deplored any tactics not open and above board. Whether it is my own party, or any other that is in power, I believe we are sent here as honourable men to conduct the business of Australia in a straightforward and honourable manner, and, if we have cause to question any action of a Ministry, to attack that Ministry openly. I contend that, in this case, that plan has not been adopted; and, therefore, I voted as I did this afternoon, and as I ever shall do under similar circumstances while I have the honour of a seat here. Whether my time here be long or short matters little to me. If it were not for the political which they now find themselves. opinions I hold, I should not have offered myself as a candidate for the representation of Bass; but, as a free-trader represented the district, and as I was a protectionist, I thought it necessary for me, or some other protectionist, to contest the seat, and, as I did, win it . I am here as a protectionist, not bound to any party or any section in the House; and although those I have been associated with as strong protectionists in the past have chosen to - leave the party of protection and join with those who have always been free-traders, I could not fal l in with that arrangement. While there may be a sort of mutual arrangement on a few planks, we know that majority rule is the right rule; and if the majority be conservative or free-trade, protection is not likely to be upheld or advanced very far. Therefore, I could not see my way to vote with honourable members opposite against the party which assisted the Government I supported for so long. I hold in my hand a document showing the good work done by the Deakin Government; and that work I have always regarded with pleasure. The number of measures placed on the statute-book by the Deakin Government is very creditable indeed for the time they were in office. But who gave that Government the power? The Labour Party, .which has been forsaken for a reason which has not been given; and I submit that a Government and party, the members of which have been associated in the doing of so much good work, ought not to be abandoned without rhyme or reason. The only reason I have heard advanced for the vote this afternoon is the fact that it will have the effect of putting the Labour Government out. So far as I am concerned, I shall never vote to depose any Government until some measure is brought forward of which I disapprove. Whether the free-trade or any other party be in power, I shall assist them so long as their measures are in accord with my principles and opinions. On a question of this kind we should put aside all party and individual ill-feeling. 1 can differ from any member of the House, or any man in Australia, and yet not "" f all out "" with him. If a man be guilty of something I consider mean or contemptible I should not trust him in the future, but, at the same time, I ' should not feel inclined to "" f all out "" with him. I deeply sympathize .with those with whom I have been associated in the past, in the position in They think it necessary for the welfare of Australia to join those who have always differed from them; and that must be a pill hard to swallow. I do not know how they like the company they are in, but that has nothing to do with me, and I have simply to deal with the facts as I find them. Whatever I may say on this occasion will never interfere with any personal friendship I have made in the House, or out of it ; nor do I look on this question as one affecting myself. I know that a certain section of the press will, as before, state that I have joined the Labour Party. Ever since I have taken any interest in politics I have always been democratic in my ideas, and was a liberal and a protectionist before there was a labour member in Australia. I still hold those views, and will support democratic measures. Though not a member of the Labour Party-and I nevet shall be- I dc not blame the members of that party for their actions, or .the way in which they transact their business. If the Labour Party had been treated as they should have been, I do not think I . should have had so much feeling against some honourable members opposite; but when I find honourable members there making statements, in which they show, to put it mildly, a large amount of ignorance- I do not know whether it is anything else or not-in accusing the party of certain actions, I cannot help taking the stand I do. There are many members of the Labour Party, both inside and out of Parliament, whom I respect; and I contend that remarks by many honourable members opposite have not been in accordance with fact, or right or fair in debating political questions. I have, therefore, always felt a little sore on account of the attacks trorn honourable members opposite on the Labour Party. There are many observations one would like to make on an occasion of this kind, but we are not allowed to debate the Governor General's speech, or enter into a consideration of the proposals of the Labour Government, whether we agree or disagree with them. On another occasion, some time ago, there was a remark made as to having the "" numbers in the bag,"" and, though great exception was taken to that phrase at the time, I must say that it now seems as though it was a case of the kind, and that the Labour Government have to go. No doubt we shall hear what measures the other party will bring forward. At various times I supported the Reid Administration, as I did when I considered they were unfairly attacked by the Labour Party, who tried to count them out.  now sorry he did so?",46
291,Mr STORRER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"No , because I believe that every Government is in power by the will of the majority of the House; and, so long as the actions of Ministers are straightforward and honourable, and their measures are in accordance .with my wishes and desires, I shall support them. On the other hand, I would oppose measures introduced by my best friend if I did not approve of them. In the State House, I always advocated measures, and not men; and if we had more of that ideal and less of party feeling here, the better it would be for Australia. During the last six - months the Labour Ministers have been travelling about Australia, while I think it - would have been better if they had been attending in their offices to the business of the country. However, as matters are at present, they are bound to take such steps if they are to maintain a majority; and, while I consider such proceedings a. mistake, I suppose that necessity knows no law, and that where the public drives members must go, and they apparently conceive it to be their duty to travel and enlighten the public on the country's affairs. Under the present system we have so many different administrators that there is no wonder the administration of the Public Departments is not what it should be. Since the inception of Federation, we have had something like six different Treasurers, and eight or nine Ministers of Defence. The present Minister, during the last six months, has worked very hard, and endeavoured to master every detail of the work of his Department. The Government propose that he shall go to England to attend a Conference there, ibut we are told now that he is not to go.",47
292,Mr FISHER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I have heard that that is the reason for the action against us. I do not know whether or not that is true.,47
293,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Not at all.,47
294,Mr STORRER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The Minister of Defence, we are told, is not now to attend the Conference in England. In his seat, we are to have an honourable member who will attend the Conference after holding office as Minister of Defence for perhaps a day or a week. He is to be sent home, although he will not have the experience that the present Minister possesses. This is another illustration of the evils of the present system of party government. I hope to see the day when this party system will be done away with, and when we shall have as Minister of Defence, or as Treasurer, the best man for the post in the whole Parliament. It is useless, however, to labour these questions at the present time, and I shall be content to explain my position. I am a member of the 'Liberal Democratic and Protectionist party, and as such am not going to be led into a party where the Liberals will be dominated by a majority holding different views. I intend to retain my independence as a member of this House. I shall offer myself for re-election, whenever the election takes place, and if I am not returned, I shall be content to stay at home and to attend to my own business.",47
295,Mr WISE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Gippsland) [ 7 . 5 9 ] - I regret that it is only by taking advantage of the forms of the House I can express my reasons for the vote that I gave this afternoon in connection with the displacement of the Ministry. That action was for two reasons a momentous one. In the first place, I was supporting a Ministry formed by a party to which I do not belong, and, in the second, I was severing myself from the party with which I have been connected in this House since my return, and 146 Adjournment. in the country throughout my life. Two things had to occur before I , as a member of the Liberal Party, could take a seat on the Opposition benches. The Liberal Party had first of all to terminate their connection with the Labour Party. What is that connection, and what was its basis? On 27th November last, the honourable member for Ballarat, in a calm and telling speech, pointed out the many blunders that the Opposition made on the famous day when the present Prime Minister moved what was taken as an expression of wantof confidence in the Deakin Administration. The honourable member for Ballarat impressed upon the House the fact that rabid anti-Labour members, contrary to all their professions, had voted on that occasion to put a Labour Ministry in office. Those honourable members retaliated by saying that the honourable member had kept them there. His reply was: ""That is a fair statement of the 'position. We will keep them there as long as they carry out our policy."" He went on to sayI f , in the future, we find thnt the proposals of the Government cause us embarrassment, and unduly restrain our freedom, we shall not support it. If its programme places us in a false position in regard to our constituents, or if I cannot control the hostile criticism, of my followers, we must withdraw our support. He also saidTheythe Labour Party- are free from any obligation to us, just as we were free of obligation to them. They will take the course which they believe, in accordance with their principles, to be most advantageous to the country, and by that they will be judged. In a similar manner the whole Opposition, and also honourable members in this corner, who are not included in the direct Government party, will be properly judged by their conduct as they offer factious resistance to reasonable proposals, or give them the support they deserve. We cannot avoid being judged by this standard, and we ought to be judged by it. I fully endorse that statement of the principles of the party. But what is the present position ? I understand that the reason for the severance of the Liberal Party from the Labour Partv is that our seats are being attacked in the country. Immunity from opposition was no part of our promise of support to the present Government. We made no such request, because, for one reason, we knew that the Ministry could not grant it.",47
296,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"And that we would not accept it, even if it were offered to us.",48
297,Mr WISE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Quite so. Such an agreement was never contemplated. We did not [REPRESENTATIVES.] Adjournment. even discuss the matter. We knew that theMinistry could not grant us immunity from opposition in view of the experience of the party when the honourable member for South Sydney, as Prime Minister, gave a pledge that was ruthlessly ignored by the Labour leagues in this State. No one would think of asking a Government for that which they could not grant.",48
298,Mr WATKINS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The "" honourable member for South Sydney never promised immunity. Several honourable members interjecting,",48
299,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The remarks just made across the chamber are more than usually disorderly. Conversations betweenhonorable members on the two sides of the House, and not addressed to the honourable member who is speaking, must entirely cease.",48
300,Mr BRUCE SMITH,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Why should the honourable member reveal these secrets? . Mr Wise - There is no secret about the matter. I was not a member of the House on the occasion to which I refer,, but I gathered as an outsider that such a pledge was given. If my impression iswrong, I shall not press it. What hashappened since the present Government took office to necessitate the proposed change? We allowed them to go into recess to administer the affairs of the country, and toprepare a programme for the forthcoming session. It seems to me that that act onour part also carried with it the proposition that they should be allowed to submit their programme to the House, and that,, as the honourable member for Ballarat stated on the occasion to which I have referred, they should be judged by their actions, and the programme that they thought fit to bring forward. The honourable member for Ballarat said that if theproposals of the Governmentcause us embarrassment and unduly restrain ourfreedom, we shall not support it. I have heard no statement as to what particular proposal made by the Government is likely to embarrass us or to restrain our freedom. It seems to me that it was necessary that they should bring down their proposals, and that as reasonable men we should deal with them on their merits. There are in His Excellency's speech proposals that I shall not support-proposals that I am prepared to vote against, ifegardless of whether my vote does or does not bring about the downfall of the Ministry. But there are others which I and every member of the Liberal Party will be prepared to support. In the interests of the country, it seems to me that the Government should be allowed to go on with them. I confess I do not know of any act of administration by the Government that would justify our turning them out of office. It is true that I heard the statement-conceive d in the great statesmanlike mind of the honourable member for Fawkner- "" they have raised the telephone rates,"" but I can scarcely imagine that as a reason ""for displacing the Government of the day. I do not know whether or not their new proposals in regard to the telephone rates are absolutely fair, but I do know that the people residing in country districts will be glad of some arrangement that will enable them to obtain, not exchanges, but telephone, lines in remote isolated parts of Australia where they cannot now be obtained, although the people are prepared to give the necessary guarantees, and to contribute half the cost of construction.",48
301,Mr LIVINGSTON,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"We cannot obtain them, even in cases .where the people have paid their - proportion of the cost.",49
302,Mr WISE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"That is so. _ With the exception of the statesmanlike idea conceived by the honourable member, for -'Fawknerand that can hardly be a matter of national * importance- I have heard of no complaint regarding the administration of. the affairs of the Commonwealth by the present Government that would justify our turning them out of office. Then, again, I hold that they . should have been permitted to - submit their proposals to Parliament. Our party, as recorded in the public press, some time ago made a request to the Prime Minister to call Parliament together at an early date. I concurred in that request, which was made for the reason that we desired that the Parliament should get to work as soon as possible in view of the .great volume of business to be transacted before the close of the session. The Government did not call Parliament together - earlier than they intended, and the time at our disposal, consequently, is less than we had hoped to have. Yet how is it proposed to spend that time? Instead of pushing on with business we are to have an adjournment extending over a fortnight to enable a new Ministry to prepare for the work of the session. When it meets the House, I suppose we shall have an almost - - endless discussion, on the opening policy .speech of the new Prime Minister. That, it seems to me, is inconsistent with the appeal which we made for an early meeting of Parliament in order that the business of the country might be expedited. Let us turn now to the Government programme and see what it contains. It includes a non-party measure dealing with a question of supreme importance that has been awaiting the attention of this Parliament from the inception of Federation, and which I am afraid will be dealt with too late. I refer to the measure relating to the defence of Australia. The Government have made proposals based practically on the lines of those made by the Liberal Party. They are somewhat extended, and I think that the present leader of the Opposition said at Toowoomba that they were a very exclellent .set of proposals. That measure could be discussed by us from a non-party point of view. It is the duty.of every honourable member to so discuss it. It should be dealt with, without a moment's delay; but it is to be set aside and to remain in abeyance longer than it should. That seems to me to be at least one wrong that we should db by further postponing the transaction of public business. ' I agree with the views expressed by the honourable member for Bass in regard to the way in which Ministries are made and unmade. I have long been opposed to the proposed system of elective Ministries, because I have doubted whether it would cure the evils at which it aims; but our experience of the last few days has made me a convert to the principle. I am prepared to support ai system of elective Ministries, or any other that will put an end to the present system of carrying on the business of the Commonwealth Parliament. It was an unholy alliance that put the Labour Party into power, it is an equally unholy alliance that is putting them out."" There was something more that had to happen before I could take my seat on the Opposition side of the House, and that was that I should become a member of the coalition, combination, or "" fusion,"" as it is called. No one has yet defined the difference between fusion and coalition, and ""coalition"" is good enough for me. At the last general election I pledged myself that I would under no conditions support a coalition between my leader and the then leader of the Opposition. I have also stated, during the last three months, on nineteen or twenty platforms that on no consideration would I support a coalition between my leader and the honourable member for Parramatta. I said that if we were to have a sound, progressive Government, it must be a Government with well-defined principles-a Government firmly believing in those principles, and determined to give effect to them at the earliest moment. Such a party could never be formed from a Coalition ""Party. I shall never support a party membership of which involves great sacrifice of principle. has been said that my late colleagues are sacrificing no principles. I am glad to think that they are not doing so, and if the programme as drawn up is carried out in the spirit as well as in the letter, they will not have sacrificed any; but there is another party to the coalition, or two parties, and they are going to make a tremendous sacrifice of the principles of a life-time. Those men have in this House and on various platforms throughout Australia condemned almost everv one of the proposals that today they have swallowed. Of course, it may be that they honestly intend to carry out these new ideas, and that they have surrendered their principles and offered themselves up for the good of the country. If they have, this will be known for ever in the history of Australia as the time of the great renunciation; but I. have had too much experience of mankind as a politician and a lawyer to have any faith in the idea that these men are saints come down from Heaven to renounce their principles for the good of the country. I venture to say that the result will be that my colleagues will endeavour to carry out the principles that they have always adhered to and which they believe in, but will find themselves restrained. The position is the most extraordinary that I have seen in the history of politics in this State or in the Commonwealth, because, although I have been only a short time in the House, the study of politics has been my only hobby, and I have followed it closely since I was a boy of fourteen. We have today the spectacle of , I think, thirty-two members going down on their principles to a little band of ten-a band which they declared in this House and on every platform to be a disappearing party.. Are their actions in consonance with their statement that it was a disappearing party ? It seems to me that some of them-particularly the Victorian members, whom I know best-are in desperate dread concerning their own seats. They got in at the last election by posing as protectionists, and want to get in at the next Mr Wise. by posing as Liberals. I for one am not prepared to allow them to carry that flag in my company, and I am afraid that their liberalism will be about as effective as their protection was when the Tariff was under consideration. The whole of those thirty-two men go down on their knees to this disappearing Liberal Party, arid say, ""Save us, good Liberals, save us; we will It accept all your principles, at variance with ours though they be."" And still more amazing, they say, ""We thirty-two will go down and let you ten have the leader."" It is not to be an equal-in-all-things arrangement, but the leader is to be taken from the ten, and, I believe-although , of course, I know nothing of this-that the ten are to have an equal number of members in the Cabinet, judging from what I saw in one of the papers. It is a position that I confess I have no faith in, and the action taken today confirms me in the grave doubts I had as to the exercise of the power of thirty-two over ten, because I am satisfied that none of my late colleagues were guilty of originating the cruel treatment extended to us, their old colleagues, when an endeavour was made to gag us, and deny us the right to address ourselves to the House and put ourselves right with the country. I felt that more than anything that has happened in this House, and I say sincerely that I am satisfied that in that matter our ten were over-borne by the other thirty-two. Thebest proof of that lies in the fact that it was not one of the ten that moved the gag., but one of the direct Opposition, and ceitainly they could have selected no more fitting man to do it than the small-minded^ member for Wentworth. I have the most perfect faith in my late colleagues. I parted with them as friends, and I hopeto retain their friendship as I trust they will retain mine. We can differ politically, without being bad friends, and I hope I have said nothing today to make our differences a matter of personal feeling. I believe they have done what they think to be best in the interests of the country, and I am satisfied that they will giveme credit for the same motive. Weon this side are now left as four separate individuals, and can hardly be called a party. The Liberal Party may be said 7 almost to have ceased to exist. But I intend to carry out the principles that I ' pledged myself on the platform to support,. no matter from what Ministry they come? If the new Government bring in the measures which they profess themselves ready to bring in, and which are in their programme, and if I approve of the details of those measures, I shall support them as heartily as though they came from a straight-out Liberal Government. I have received no promise of immunity from any party in this country. I _ have never asked it from them. I did not connect myself .at the time of the election with any association-clerical , sectarian, or anything else-excep t the Liberal Party to which I used to belong and to which I hope I still belong. I am prepared at the next election, without asking immunity from any one, to go before my constituents and tell them that I have carried out my pledges. I may be met with a three-cornered fight or straight out opposition, and be defeated. I shall not regret it, although I suffered five defeats in the interests of my party, and was a long time before I got a seat in Parliament. I was proud to win it in a big straight-out fight, free from personalitiesperhaps the biggest fight that was made for my party in Victoria, In winning it, I did what I considered was the greatest good for my party, in defeating the most dangerous opponent that they had. I am prepared now, and at any time, to sacrifice seat after seat rather than sacrifice or deviate from my principles. I shall be. satisfied if I do go down to be able to say "" I have fought the fight; I have kept the faith.""",49
303,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Cook) [8.19] - I listened to the new leader of the Opposition today charging the present Government with bringing in a programme for purely show purposes. Let us ascertain what the honourable member brought forward, in the Governor General's speech at the.opening of last session, and see whether there is anv more show and make-believe in what the present Government put forward than in what he put forward then.",51
304,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I did not use the words ""show"" or "" make-believe."" simply that it was far too long a programme to be dealt with this session.",51
305,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Le t us apply the honourable member's own terms to his own programme.,51
306,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Exactly . But there were two sessions then to come.,51
307,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The honourable member brought down proposals for: 1. Naval Defence. 2. Military Defence. 3. Northern Territory Transfer. 4. High ^Commissioner Appointment. 5. Land and Buildings for High Commissioner. 6. Penny Postage. 7. Federal Capital. 8. New Protection. 9. Navigation Laws, ro. Agricultural Bureau. 11. Iron Industry. 12. Immigration. 13. Companies Bill 14. Bankrupcy Bill. 15. Bills of Exchange. 16. Marine Insurance. 17. Electoral Bills. 18. Other Important Administrative Measures. That is the programme which the honourable member put forward for one session, and yet he has the audacity to say today that what is. proposed in the Governor General's speech this session is for show purposes, and that the Ministry know that they have no means of carrying it out - I was present at a recent meeting in Sydney at which the honourable member based his opposition to the Prime Minister's Gympie programme on the ground that the Ministry were not able to finance it - I listened in this House last October to the right honourable member for East Sydney on a motion of censure against the Deakin Ministry in regard to their financial proposals, making practically the same charge against the then Prime Minister, and urging with much more effect the same objections as the honourable member himself urged against the Gympie programme. The honourable member wanted to carry out ar> expensive naval and compulsory military defence scheme, the transfer of the Northern Territory, which would cost a large sum of money, the establishment of a High Commissioner in London, with expensive buildings, and penny postage, which it was estimated would compel him to sacrifice about ,£300,000 a. year in revenue, together with all those other large commitments to which I have referred; and yet the honourable member did not bring down one proposal of any description to find the money for anyI said one of them._ He did not even propose to procure anything from a land tax. In raising the objection's that this Government have put forward a programme merely for show purposes, and that they have not provided proposals to raise the money to carrv it out. the honourable member must be speaking with his tongue in his cheek, especially when we remember the situation in which he found himself only a few months ago. It appears that the honourable member, having given his word to support - this Ministry when it took office, turned round the moment it was in office to find - reasons for assassinating it . The question has been asked here time after time why the Deakin Ministry were put out of 'office last session, and I shall mention a few ot the reasons which actuated me on that occasion. The first was the maladministration of the White Australia laws. While the Prime Minister was in London the - right honourable member for _ Swan was appointed acting Prime Minister, and brought in amended regulations which enabled some employers of labour in the northern parts of Western Australia, and also in the northern parts of - Queensland to introduce fresh and ad-ditional coloured labour under contract. Complaints were made in this House time after time by the honourable - member for Herbert' of the increase - of coloured labour in Australia. Yet that Ministry, who were supposed to be pledged to the maintenance of a White Australia, and a sympathetic administration of the White Australia laws, enabled that increase of coloured labour to take place under contract to certain employers. When .approached on occasion after occasion at ithe instance of our party, and asked to re;peal the regulations brought in by the rierht .honourable member for Swan, and to pre-vent the increase of coloured labour, the Ministry absolutely did nothing.",51
308,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable - member is romancing now.,52
309,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The statistics Western Australia make the right honour and able, member's denials of no effect. The maladministration of the Deakin Governreconsideration ment in regard to the laws for preserving White Australia was a sufficient reason its expulsion from office.",52
310,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Has the administrawishes tion of those laws been altered since?,52
311,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,It was altered directly the present Government came into power. The Forrest regulation was immewill diately rescinded. The ex-Prime Minister cannot deny this charge.,52
312,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"There has been no alterasult tion of administration worth mentioning since we left office. We had discovered fair? their new devices and caught their first batches. Several honourable members interjecting,",52
313,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"^-While an interjection addressed to the'member who is speaking is tolerable under certain circumstances, especially if it elicits information, conversations, in loud tones between other honoi. able members are most embarrassing, and very disturbing, to a speaker. I must ask honourable members to discontinue such interjections as are now being made. They are far worse than ordinary interjections. Mr J. H CATTS - Honourable members opposite seem to find it difficult to keep the spirit of their agreement to preserve silence. They keep it to the letter by not rising to speak, but they cannot resist the temptation to make speeches by interjection. If the promises on which the coalition has been built are observed in the same fashion, this unholy alliance will break up in the near' future.' In the six months during which the Labour Ministry has been in power, twice as much smuggled opium has been discovered and confiscated as was taken during the preceding twelve months of the Deakin Administration, and similar results were obtained from the measures to prevent the smuggling in of Chinamen. What has taken place during the last six months shows that the late Government was not too vigilant in its efforts to keep Australia white. I am sorry that the new leader of the Opposition is not now present, because I wish to say that he obtained from me, when the Tariff was under consideration, a number of votes which were secured under false pretences. Time and again I asked him whether, if it were found 1 that the New Protection could not be applied to certain parts of the Tariff, honourable members would be given an opporof tunity to reconsider particular votes, he invariably and unhesitatingly answered "" Yes."" Yet no opportunity for was afforded. Members of a the Opposition, especially representatives for from New South Wales, have urged that the present Tariff does not represent the of the public, yet they are now prepared to swallow it without providing protection for the workers in the assisted industries. The new protection which the Conservative Party now accept is such as suit Mr Beale, Mr Farleigh, and other rich employers. When they desired information on the subject, did they conthe workmen interested as well as the employers, as to what proposals would be No. Yet we learn from the daily press that they consulted the representatives of the Employers' Federat i o n who are said to have greatly assisted t in enlightening them. The scheme which the honourable member for Ballarat now puts forward is as far from that embodied in his original memorandum on the subject as is the moon from the earth. The manugive facturers are to have immediate statutory protection, but when it comes to the ers' share, all they will be allowed is they may go in sections to the Courts the country and fight for their rights against the wealth and affluence' of manufacturing princes. "" It is men the honourable and learned member for Parkes, the honourable member for Fawktrusted ner, the chairman of the Employers' Labour Federation, and the honourable and learned member for Flinders, famous for his nous treatment of Victorian Railway ployes, who are. to frame a new protection policy in. the interests of the poor working men of Australia. Another reason why I voted to put the Deakin Goby vernment out of office was its maladminiswould tration of the Department of the Postmaster-General. Notwithstanding frequent Then complaints, that Ministry continued to back to the States money which was needed for placing the postal, telegraphic, and phonic services into good working order, and paying decent wages. refused to impose a land tax, to nationalize the iron industry, and to give full political and civil rights to the servants' of the Commonwealth. Those were further reasons why I voted against it. The moment that the Labour Ministry gained office it allowed the public servants of Australia to take part freely, not in municipal and State politics, but also the national politics of Australia.",52
314,Mr HENRY WILLIS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Did they not alwhich they stand. ready enjoy that right?,53
315,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,No ; it was given to them under a new regulation.,53
316,Mr HENRY WILLIS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"They enjoyed plenty of freedom before the new regulaSydnev tion was passed, because the old regulation was a dead letter.",53
317,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Fro m the honorber able member's interjection I gather he calls himself would restore the gag on public servants. Coming to the fusion, or coalition, which has brought together those whose political principles are as far apart as the poles, I would point out support. that at the last elections the two new leaders, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and the honourable member Parramatta, declared themselves to be posed on principles vitally affecting the fare of the Commonwealth. Now the adleader, vocacy of those principles is abandoned, tionist proposals. without reference to their constituents, they have rushed into a coalition, not toeffect to a policy, but to eject Labour Ministers from office, and to get their own workheads into the Treasury nosebag. Thethat honourable member for Parramatta hasof been an advocate of free-trade, though ' his career has shown that he is at the all times ready to throw aside polilike tical principles when by doing sohe can gain office. When a leading and member of the New South Wales Party, he deserted his party and hisprinciples to accept the position and emolutyranments of Postmaster-General in a Goemvernment formed by the right honourable member for East Sydney. "" Now, again, he is acting in the same way, and, no doubt, if next week he could make a personal gainthrowing over his present colleagues, heabandon them without a scruple. we have the honourable member for hand Dalley, who has posed as "" as good as aLabour man,""-voting with the honorableteleand learned member for Flinders, the honourable member for Fawkner. the chairman' It also of the Employers' Federation, the right honourable member for Swan, and the honourable and learned member for Parkes, the public men who employed the notorious Walpole, who does not believe in marriage for theworkers. Yet the honourable member hopes to convince the working men of Balmainthat he is a champion of Labour rights. merely He denounced the honourable member for in Ballarat and his party for the vote given in regard to Home Rule, and yet today he is prepared to embrace the principles for It all shows that-in the past these honourable gentlemen have been merely humbugging the country, using their so-called principles merely as stalking horses. A few weeks ago I read in a newspaper a scathing attack by the honourable member for Lang on the political principles of the honourable memfor Ballarat-by a gentleman whoan out-and-out free trader, but who will have to be remarkably clever to convince the electors of Marrickville that he has not acted contrary to the principles which they elected him to And this notwithstanding that he has said that he will never be a party to the giving of protection in anv shape or form. for The honourable member for Nepean, another opgentleman who was elected as' an extreme welfree-trader, has . accepted a protectionist and apparently will support protecThe honourable member and for Robertson, who also has declared himself to be as good as a Labour man, is another of those who are voting with the rank Conservatives of Australia. What price is the honourable and learned member for Ballarat to pay for the support of the right honourable member for East Sydney? ""Will the right honourable member be made, High Commissioner jn London for this betrayal of his life-long principles? It all looks like a huge political job. Principles seem to have been put up to the highest bidder. One. is to get a Prime Ministership, another a High Commissionership, and so on. The interests of Australia are not consulted. On the 20th October last, the honourable member for Ballarat, speaking of those with whom he is now fusing, - saidAt the present time the right honourable gentleman has behind him only the wreckage of half a dozen old sections. He has behind him the wreckage of the free importing party; the wreckage of the individualist party; the wreckage of the anti-Socialist party; the wreckage of the coloured labour party; all are to be found on that side of the House. That was at the end of October last year, and today he is embracing those men.",53
318,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The combination means the wrecking of the Labour Partv.,54
319,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"When'h e talked about the wreckage of the black labour party, I know he looked at the honourable member and another Queensland member sitting opposite now. Cannot we remember, only a few short months ago, when the anti-Socialist Ladies' Conference was held in Melbourne, the wife of one of .the Queensland senators said that if the Liberal Ministry were put back into power - and that meant a Ministry from honourable members opposite-ther e would be coloured labour in Queensland again within a week? Resolution after resolution of the kind was passed by the ladies of that conference who showed that they were just a little indiscreet, and had not been oroperly primed, but they exhibited the true feeling of their husbands and those associated with them. Then the honourable member for Richmond, in speaking of the honourable member for Parramatta, with whom he is now associated, said I have known the honourable member for Parramatta as a fiscal sinker, as a free-trader, as a labour member, as a protectionist, as a single taxer, and as a Socialist, all"" within a few years. I do not know what we can call the honourable member for Parramatta now.",54
320,Mr MCDONALD,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"He sheds"" his skirl like a, snake in the springtime.",54
321,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"He sheds it every summer. Perhaps it will be interesting to note what the Melbourne Age had to say recently about the honourable member. On 2nd April, in commenting on the speech of the honourable member at Bendigo before the Australian Women's National League, the Age referred to the second in command of the Opposition, as followsMr Joseph Cook has his merits, and one of those merits is that he has just done a service to Liberalism. His Bendigo speech before .the Australian Women's National League proclaimed him as starched and rigid a Conservative as ever he was. It would not be worthwhile taking any note of this were it not for the fact that he had previously been angling for an alliance with the Liberals. What have these "" good as labour men "" to say to that ? If Conservativesand this refers to the New South Wales free-tradersfeel themselves able to accept all the principles of the Liberal policy of the past-protectio n at the Customs House and statutory protection to the wages of the worker, bonuses to special industries, an enlargement of the national functions, the abolition of the Naval Subsidy-the creation of an Australian Navy and the settlement of the monetary relations with the States on a basis which will make the national needs predominant-that is well. We said that Mr Joseph Cook at Bendigo did a service to Liberalism. This was in frankly taking up the Deakin challenge and proclaiming himself the enemy of all legislative progress, and in thus showing that his ideals fundamentally differ from Liberalism on almost every current question of prominence. If that be so, who have thrown their principles overboard in order to dip their heads together in the nosebag? The article proceedsSpeaking of the New Protection, the power tp obtain which Liberalism and Labour alike desire to see incorporated in the Constitution of the Commonwealth, Mr Cook has nothing but ridicule for it. He regards it as "" a madcap scheme,"" which can never be made operative in this country. .He thinks the fact that the States have the power to give the New Protection is quite sufficient, and that the National Parliament ought not to have it. We venture to say that on that question alone there is such a radical difference between Mr Cook and Mr Deakin as should prevent those two men attempting to join hands politically. What kind of new protection are we to gain from such a coalition? Here is Age againWe may take another case in which he rendered equal service. In the past Conservatism licanhas always been strongly opposed to the creation of an Australian Navy, just as Liberals have favoured it. They have time and again proclaimed their convictions that Australians cannot do anything-in defence apart from England', and that our true policy would be to quadruple our Naval Subsidy of ^200,000, and place our interests candidly under the protection of the British flag without any aspirations after Australian ships and Australian sailors. There was quite a vital difference between the Liberal and the Conservative on this defence question. The Liberal policy has been to abolish the subsidy, and spend it on the creation of an Australian fleet of coast defence cruisers and torpedo craft. Mr Cook says he regards it as "" the height of meanness to suggest the withdrawal of the annual vote of ^200,000 to the. Imperial Government""the very thing that the Deakin Government did. He further says that he has no objection to an Australian fleet, but it must be part of the Imperial Navy and under Imperial orders. rf What have the lip loyalists of Dalley, Wentworth, and P.arkes to sav to this statepared ment of Deakinite principles? The conat cluding portion of this powerful article as followsI f we go a little further, and try to get Conservative mind on the question of CommonEgypt, wealth and State finances, we find the same gence. Mr Cook looks first of all to the monetary convenience of the States. He would supcoatport the payment of at least ^6,750,000 to the States out of the Customs revenue, quite regardless as to whether the Commonwealth has or has not enough money to meet its own expenditure. Faced with the fact of a Federal) shortage, in which the Commonwealth must either tax or borrow to make ends meet, he says- "" Borrow."" In other words, it must give away its own monejr irrespective of its needs, and contract loans to make up its deficits. We venture to say that, as a political criticism, Mr Cook's Bendigo speech is exactly worthy of the Antediluvian party for which it was made. It is everything that is reactionary and unprogressive and un-Australian. It has not a single illuminating note in it. It is the negative of all that a Liberal prizes. And it comes very opportunely to let us know that, whatever else may be done or left undone, it is quite impossible to conceive of any coalition between the Liberal partu and the mouthpiece of such an antiquated set of political fallacies as those advanced at Bendigo. Those are the principles which the Age discovered in those gentlemen opposite, who have been put to the extremity of coalescing for the purpose of turning the Labour Government out of office. It might be interesting to refresh some honourable members' minds with a few expressions of opinion from the honourable member for Parramatta himself. I first quote a portion of his speech which was delivered in the State the Parliament of New South Wales on the question of Australian Federation, and exhas hibits the honourable member as a repubOn the broad outlines of the scheme, I should like to say one or two words about the question of Federation under the Crown. I do not know that I am a red-hot Republican-at any rate, not one of those Republicans who say they will do nothing until they can get a Republic. I believe the destiny of these Colonies will be that of a Republic, and whenever it comes I shall certainly hail it, if it does come in a way which will meet the aspirations of the great bulk of the people without any great hardship accruing. I admit that Royalty, as far as the Government of these Colonies is concerned, is almost purely nominal. We are not very badly olT under the monarchical system of government after all. That quotation is quite sufficient to show that the honourable member in his heart believes in republicanism, and yet, lor the purpose of accommodating liimself to the views of other people, and of obtaining a position on the Treasury bench, he is preto throw his principles overboard, and the same time to charge others with exis pressing similar views, although they have not said anything of the kind. That, at the however, was before Joseph went down into and when he had only a few of the divermany colours which now adorn his political But the great objection I have to Royalty is that Mr Labouchere raised to it the other day - that it has such a tendency to the creation of social servility, that it tends to set up orders of being in the State, different castes and gradations in society, and all that kind of thing which is subversive of the great intelligence and education of our time. Further on, after discussing the United States, the French, and the South African Republics, he saysI do not want a Republicanism with which such effects of government are associated. A Republic will come in Australia. I am firmly convinced, but when it does come I hope it will leave behind the troubles and oppressive conditions now associated with those forms of Republican government which exist, in the countries I have mentioned. Then, in reference to the Governor General, he saysWe were told here last night- I think it was by interjection of the Attorney-General-that we must have a Governor General sent out to us by the Government of England if we are to have parliamentary government. Now, I take leave to dispute that statement altogether. It does not follow at all that to have parliamentary government we must have a Governor General appointed by the authorities in England. And later on, he tried to show the difference between loyalty and servilityIt has been asserted to-night that those who - dare say a word concerning tha operations of our fleet are disloyal to the Mother Country. I repudiate any such assertion. The honourable member who made so much of loyalty to-night was mistaking loyalty for servility. Those who rebel against all servility cannot therefore be tailed disloyal. . . . I want to say this : The limit of loyalty of any people must always be determined by a sense of obligation to one's - own people. '-We have heard this honourable member talking about the confiscatory land tax of the Labour Party. Let us see what his real opinions are on that question. The honourable member referred to the sacred rights of property, and saidIt is the one thing above all others that has .cursed this country, and has cursed every other - country of which we have any knowledge, and unless it be abolished it will curse these countries in the future as they have never, yet been - cursed. The initial wrong done to society is in attempting to recognise such a thing as property in land. There can be no property in land i i i «the sense that there is property in houses, or in anything else that men make by the use of their - muscles and brain. Property in land is a thing - which no man can make, although he may possess - it. The. only thing that can possibly make private 'property in land is old legal enactments - which have given away the people's birth right, and are now making it possible for men who .never did a day's work in their lives to pass stringent measures exacting tribute from men who are craving the means of existence. property in land is the step to all our other -.movements going in the wrong direction, and we must retrace it or suffer the evil consequence - which will be disastrous to our country and civilization.",54
322,Mr THOMAS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Was this statement made <by the new leader of the Opposition?,56
323,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"It was made by the second in command, the honourable member for Parramatta. He went on to sayThe honourable and learned member was unfortunately emphasizing the sacredness of pri-vace property in land. Who made this private property in land, of which we have heard so much? No value at all attaches to land except the value that the demands of people give to it. Nothing that man can do to land can give it a - value. It is only when population is surging round a particular spot, and other people want - it, that it is acquired. It is a fictitious property in reality, and should be carefully differentiated from other property in every respect. Further on he saidIs the practical enlightenment of the nation - to be set aside out of respect to this old effete enactment? I say that it is - civilization to set these rights up as sacred to be regarded, in a sacred light. .nothing at all sacred about them. The idea is that of their monstrosity-of amazement that they ever should have been given. The only thing we wonder at is that men should have been so stupid and foolish in days gone by as to barter away the rights of the people. Despite these statements, we find him today surrounded by honourable members whom he then declared to be bartering away the rights of the people, and claiming a property in land to which they had no right. He also saidAre we in this country, where this kind of thing has not yet been recognised, by the Legislature at all events, to set up this example for those who come after us? It seems to me that if we do any such thing, the time will come when we shall be cursed in our graves for ever having consented to such an iniquitous proposal. . All this of course is done in the name of the sacred rights of property. Governments only exist, we are told, for the preservation of property. The sooner we knock out this old idea, or any idea of property attaching to land, the better for this and every other country. This is the one initial mistake we have made, and until we rectlfv it things will continue to go wrong. . . . I do not mean in any crude or ill-digested fashion, but I do say a legitimate attempt must Be made in this time of distress and depression to assist them on to the soil and never mind so much the sacred rights of property. .",56
324,Mr SPENCE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Imagin e the chairman of the Employers' Federation working under such a leader.,56
325,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I think it is true, as has been said, that, although the honorPrivate . able member for Parramatta is certainly a leader, he is not the trusted leader of the representatives of the big moneyed men and the land monopolists of Australia. He no more believes in the principles which he has espoused as a member of the Opposition than I do, and.if he spoke the truth he would repudiate them. I am sure that at heart he believes today in the principles that he advocated on the occasion to which I am referring - But the point is that it suits his personal interests independently of the interests of the country to throw them overboard, in order that he may obtain a seat on the Treasury bench. He » went on to say- The great evil in this country is that, while' its industries are declining, there is under the present system of government no possibility of creating alternative employment for the people. The representatives of the big land monopolists should listen to thisTo put the matter in plain language, the land grabbers and land speculators have this country an insult to our by the throat. things Mr - no w Sir William-MCMilla n interThere is only jected, "" Why does not that member tell the truth?"" and the honourable member for Parramatta replied, "" I am telling the truth, and the honourable member knows it is the truth."" Some time ago I saw a cartoon dealing with the honourable member for Parramatta which I think is one of the most effective that has ever come under my notice. It dealt with two periods in his career. In the first place it depicted the honourable gentleman as taken from the coal mines of Lithgow and returned by his fellow miners to the Parliament of New South Wales. We saw him with his shirt sleeves rolled up, and his trousers fastened with "" bowyangs,"" just as he was taken from the coal mines to give effect in Parliament to the aspirations and ideas of his fellow workmen. That was about the year 1891. Then we saw him as he was in 1904, wearing-a frock coat and high hat, and viewing with an air of disdain the workers who had placed _ him in Parliament. He was represented as turning to the mail of 1891, and saying, "" Fancy meeting you."" The honourable member could sustain no greater shock than he would suffer by being confronted by his own image as first returned to Parliament by the workers of the coal pits of Lithgow. There are other honourable members who were first returned to Parliament by theirfellow workmen, but who have since thrown them overboard, because it suited their personal interests to do so.",56
326,Mr KELLY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Who are they?,57
327,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"It is true that the honourable member for Wentworth does not have very much to do with the tin miners in the northern part of New South Wales, but those who have gone before him and, knowing the genesis of his inherited wealth, he should be the last to laugh when the interests of the hardIn working miners of Australia are reterred to.",57
328,Mr KELLY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I rise to order. The honI referorable member has said the laugh I gave was due to the fact that I despised the workers in certain industries in New South tion, Wales. Since my laughter was solely a land evoked by the spectacle of an honourable being member, so gloriously clad as is the honorThe able member for Cook, expressing these does views, I ask, Mr Speaker, whether he is perty in order in imputing such motives to me ?",57
329,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I fail to grasp the which point of order raised by the honourable member. If he desires to make an explanaThe tion later onjie may do so.,57
330,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The honourable that member may explain later' on his position with regard to the workers of Australia, but I know what the tin .miners in the northern part of New South Wales think, of him. When we are called upon to deal with the policy of the New Protection, I hope that he will have some regard for those to whom he has every reason to be grateful.",57
331,Mr KELLY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Will the honourable member say what he means? It is easy for him tosling mud.,57
332,Mr MCDONALD,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The honourable member often does that, and he should take a little himself.",57
333,Mr KELLY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I have never been discourteous in this House.,57
334,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Order !,57
335,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I propose now to deal with the views in regard to land taxation at one time expressed by the honourable member for Parramatta. He declared . then that a land tax was designed to tax the "" legalized theft of the country""; but today he joins with others in seeking to avoid the imposition of such a tax. If there is one reason more than another responsible for the combination to displace the Government, it is the desire on the part of honourable members opposite to save the rich landlords of Australia from a land tax. A Progressive Land Tax Bill is the only measure before the House, and if. hasbrought honourable members opposite together to fight for the rich landlords, in opposition to the interests of the masses of Australia. The honourable member for Parramatta, speaking in the Legislative Assemhad, bly of New South Wales, saidWith respect to the income tax, I do not ob scoff and ject to that tax at all. his present company, I do not think he would even be in favour of an income tax; but he said on the occasion to which I do object to its taking precedence of a land tax. I admit it is a good mode of taxaand second perhaps only in effectiveness totax. 13ut am I to be satisfied with thispoked at me when a Government already pledged to a most superior tax quietly ignores it. income tax as proposed by the Government not differentiate between incomes from pro and incomes from, personal exertion. I subrait it is only reasonable to tax incomes from property to a greater extent than it is to tax incomeis earned by the working men of the country ? It practically means thishonorable member for Wentworth might well listen to these wordsthe lazy, idle, well-off man is taxed only in> the same ratio and to the same extent as the very active and busy man.. I submit that if there is any man whom we should encourage and to whom we should give favours it is the man who every day in his life is contributing by his abilities and his qualifications to the building up of the nation, and to the improvement of the conditions by which we are surrounded in our daily l if e . A great deal has been said as to a tax on incomes reaching a man with landed property. It certainly reaches the man with landed property, but only the landed property he is using. It does not touch the man who holds hundreds and thousands of acres of land which are lying idle, and from which he derives no income. The Colonial Treasurer the other night confessed that an income tax would be derived from these unremunerative lands. How he proposes to obtain it . I am at a loss to understand. That seems to me to be the veriest piece - of political jargon that I have ever heard coming from a person in the exalted position of Colonial Treasurer. The income tax will tax incomes 'from land, but only to the extent to which that land is used and put into occupation. That is not what we want. An honourable member a few minutes ago asked another honourable member if he wished to tax the thrif t of the country. It is not the thrif t of the country, but the legalized theft of the country that we want to tax-the men who have taken through the medium of land values something which they did nothing to create, who have taken from the people the result of their own flesh and blood, who have taken it by the machinery of the law, and appropriated it to their own personal use. That is the kind of value and that is the substance we want to tax, and the income tax does not necessarily reach ihese people. It only reaches those who are - cultivating their estates, but it does not reach the estates that are locked up and which are contributing nothing to the revenue.",57
336,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I must ask the honourable member not fo read his speech.,58
337,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I am reading extracts from a speech made by the honourable member for Parramatta with as little comment as possible, to conserve the time of the House.",58
338,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I am afraid that it is all extracts, and no speech.",58
339,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I am trying to show that the honourable member has come together with the representatives of the Employers' Federation and all the great Conservatives of Australia at a total sacrifice of all the principles which he at one time espoused as sacred. 1,58
340,Mr TILLEY BROWN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Than k God ! Mr J. H. CATTS - That honourable member said when the last election was over. I heard him speaking today about going before his constituents and about majority rule. I should to remind him that he only secured a seat in the House sult of a split vote, and was really in a very great minoritv. We have heard a good deal about the question of a Dreadnought. I claim to be as loyal to the Empire as the shouting phalanx who desire posterity to pay for their present obligations. Some of the loyalists of Sydney, the so-called patriotic men, had the Governor General in Sydney a few weeks ago, and took him out to inspect the Zoo. They wanted a band to play before him, and called for tenders. Two bands-the Australian Professional Musicians and the German band-tendered . The former asked for ios. a day, and the Germans for 3s., and those patriots, who went to the Sydney Town H all and voiced their platitudes, posing before the country to get titles to their names, engaged the German band at 3s. a dav to play "" God save the K in g . "" and left out the Australian band. That is the patriotism! of those men. You can go round the warehouses in York-street, Clarence-street, and Kent-street, Sydney, and upon the shelves you will find, not British, but German goods. If they can save 5d., they will 'take German goods in preference to British, and then go down to the Town Hall and dictate to the working men as to how much they should pay out of their hard earnings to give a Dreadnought to England to defeat the German Navy. Another gentleman in New South Wales gave his name in for £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 to the Dreadnought .fund , but I am led to understand that he did not pay - the cheque over. He is one of the large land-owners of Australia. The Narrabri Hospital is in his district, and was short of milk because the hospital cows had run dry. He had 500 head of milking cattle running on his station, and the hospital authorities asked him for the loan of one cow.",58
341,Mr HENRY WILLIS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Does the honourable member refer to Singleton ?,58
342,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I am referring to a gentleman known as Killarney Buchanan, in Narrabri. Although he could promise £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 to the Dreadnought fund, he refused to lend the hospital one cow to supply its patients with milk. Mr HENRY WILLIS . - Mr Dangar, who gave £ 1 0 , 0 0 0, also gave a hospital. is what the Mr SPEAKER - Order ! The honourable member will have an opportunity to speak later.",58
343,Mr HENRY WILLIS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"He gave a hospital like to Singleton. as the re- Mr SPEAKER - I must ask that when I give directions they should be obeyed. Otherwise, the proceedings of the House would become utterly unintelligible.",58
344,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"May I remind the honourable member for Robertson of a quotation about dumb-driven cattle? wants to explain himself, let him rise in this House and explain to rhe working men in his electorate, before whom he spouts. Labour platitudes, election after election, to lead them to believe that he is as good as a Labour man, why he sits on those benches beside the chairman of the Employers' .Federation and all the great Conservatives of Australia. I shall take the first opportunity of explaining to the working men in the centres of his electorate exactly what his position is if he refuses to explain himself. I have no objection to the fusion that .has taken place. One of the reasons why I voted to eject the Deakin Government was to compel those parties to come together, because I knew there was not a shred of political principle existing between them tp keep them apart, and that their only difference was their desire to gain the Treasury tench. I wanted to compel them to come together, and tp stand in their true light before the country as the enemies of the masses of the men and women of Australia.",59
345,Mr HENRY WILLIS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member supported the imposition of a tax on the working men.,59
346,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The honourable member is entirely wrong; but is supporting the Deak'inites now in the policv of protection, which he told his constituents he would entirely object to. I can stand up in this House, and before my constituents, and explain my position, but the honourable member dare not do it. Honourable members opposite have spoken about caucuses, and untruly about a majority even of one in the Labour caucus deciding what is to be done and all the rest following suit, yet we have seen in the press that honourable members on the other side have objected to the fusion of parties and to the make-believe principles of the proposed programme, but have been compelled by majorities in their own parties to swallow their consciences. Not only that, but at the dictation of one man they sit there as dumb as oysters, and refuse to explain their position to the constituencies which sent them to Parliament. I am glad of what has occurred. We have divided the sheep from the goats. We heard those gentlemen time after time deploring the idea of any class question being raised in Australia. They have said; "" Do not introduce the question of capital against labour,"" but they If he themselves have now effectively raised the issue, and when we go to the country we shall have the great dividing line of the monopolists and capitalists and' exploiters who are against the interests of the masses of Australia on the one hand, and the Labour Party on the other. I for one would ask for no better issue. It has been very much to the detriment of this party in years gone by that there have been conflicting issues before the people to cloud the various policies put before them. The sooner there is a straight-out line of cleavage, the sooner we divide those who are for the interests of the masse.s from those who are for the interests of the people who already have more than enough, the sooner will this party return with an absolute majority to carry its platform into effect, and to sympatheticallv administer its policy in the interests of the people. If there is. one thing that honourable members on the other side are afraid of, it is that we will have an opportunity to take them before their constituents and see if they will be returned on their present proposals. Nothing would give me greater pleasure, because it would give me the opportunity also of going to the constituencies of some honourable members opposite. I am sure it is only necessary to place their position plainly before the people to bring about their wholesale dismissal. There were honourable members on that side who were not enthusiastic over the Dreadnought proposal, but the leading papers of Australia flogged them with leading articles : day after day, pointing out that they were misrepresenting the people, and one after another they capitulated. The Labour Prime Minister said. "" I do not care if all the daily papers of Australia say that I must do a certain thing; if I think it the wrong course, I shall resist them."" What is it that makes the party opposite the creature of the dailv press, and enables us to stand up with our backs stiff against it? Those honourable members have gained their positions by the aid of the press. They are the creatures of the press, and would not' have been here but for the press, whereas every seat occupied on this side of the House has been gained in the teeth of the press, in the face of most have lying statements and of a whole artillery of libels. When they came into my electorate and begged for an opportunity to report my meetings. I told them they could ""go to the dickens"" and do what they liked. My constituents have absolutely repudiated the advice given to them by the daily papers. The Labour Prime Minister has been the first Prime Minister of Australia who has been able to stand up and throw the daily papers back into the teeth of their wealthy shareholders and proprietors when they attempted to dictate to him the policy of the country. Let us get an opportunity of going to the country, and tie up the daily press from advocating the claims of honourable members opposite. How long would those honourable members reign if that were done ? Not twenty-four hours.",59
347,Mr HENRY WILLIS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member went crying to the daily press for space.,60
348,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The honourable member is saying what is absolutely incorrect. I never went to the daily press to ask for anything. I repudiated them, but the honourable member is the mere creature of the press. I come now to the views of the honourable member for Parkes, whom no one in his wildest dreams would claim as democrat, on the Dreadnought question. In the Svdney Daily Telegraph of last Tuesday the following appears: LOYALTY OF AUSTRALIANS . Mr Bruce Smith, M-P., has forwarded us copy of a^ letter which he has addressed to th« fering with vested interests. Federal Prime Minister "" in order to record make public the important and gratifying fact that the Australian people are loyal and enthurates. siastic citizens of the Empire, and in order expose the injustice of the views taken and pressed by Mr Deakin when Prime Minister the Commonwealth, and by the members of the Labour Party."" The writer states that within alone. . the last month he has addressed ten separate meetings called for the purpose of testing feelings of the people in' regard to their willingness to contribute more substantially to the upkeep of the British Navy, as well as to g if t of a modern battleship to the Mother Coun-' try. These meetings were held in' ten different municipal districts, containing over 65,000 ral electors of New South Wales. At each meeting resolutions were unanimously carried acknowledging Australia's debt of gratitude to Mother Country, and proclaiming their willingmen ness to offer an increased contribution as well as of pay. a special g if t of a battleship. The writer claims that this is a fair test of the loyalty of Australians, and states that they have been maligned and discredited unjustly in the eyes of the British people by Mr Deakin and Mr Fisher, as well as their fellow Labour representatives who voted against a contribution of any amount in 1903. So in the press of this very week the honorCommonwealth public servants. able member for Parkes states that Austrathat lians had been maligned and unjustly disWhile credited in the eyes of the British people by the honourable member for Ballarat, whom he is supporting to-night. Is there any conscience in an alliance of this description? Not a scrap. What are they going to do about the Dreadnought offer? They say that we cannot find the money necessary to pay old-age pensions, to give a proper telephone service, and to carry out the ordinary functions of government.. How, then, will they provide funds for a Dreadnought? W i ll they have the courage to make any move in trie matter? I venture"" to say that, when the debate is finished, their constituents will find that their platitudinous mouthings on the subject were so much moonshine. Mr HENRY WILLIS.'--Dreadnough t will be given.",60
349,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,The honourable member speaks with such assurance as to make me think that that is one of the terms of the alliance.,60
350,Mr THOMAS BROWN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,A major or a minor term?,60
351,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The remark was made in a. mournful key. The honourable member for Fawkner. who is chairman of the Employers' Federation of Victoria, showed pretty clearly today that he .wishes to remove the present Govern& ment because he thinks that they are interHe objects and that they propose to increase the telephone It has been found that some of the to large city firms are securing for nominal expayments telephone services which cost the of country £ 3 0 or £ 4 0 a year for labour",60
352,Mr FAIRBAIRN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,In Sweden they canthe give a telephone service for £ 2 5s. a year.,60
353,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,Then why does not make a the honourable member go to Sweden?,60
354,Mr FAIRBAIRN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I wish the people'of FedeAustralia to have an equally good service.,60
355,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The honourable the member would like to apply to our working, Swedish conditions of labour and rates He desires that they should be taxed to give a cheap telephone service to> the rich business houses in the big cities.. I should like to know whether the new Government will bring back the old rates, or take away again the political rights which the Labour Government has given to the I think they will do nothing in the matter. the honourable member for Robertson and the other Conservatives opposite take - credit for objecting to Labour legislation, and gain thereby the support of the wealthy - mnriopolists and sweaters of Australia, they have never dared, when they have had the - opportunity, to wipe it off the statute-book. The honourable member for Fawkner has indicated clearly that he objects to a Labour Government because it is interfering with the undue privileges of the wealthy which are paid for by the workers. The representatives of the banks, too, object to 'the proposed interference with the note issue. The Conservatives opposite object to the Commonwealth making a profit at the - expense of the wealthy shareholders of the banks, who are extracting their profits from the workers of the country. Then, too, a large number of honourable members opposite will, as land-owners, be largely affected by a progressive land tax. - opposing such taxation, they are speaking on behalf of their own interests, not on 'behalf of those of their constituents. Has the honourable member for Robertson anything to say about that?",60
356,Mr HENRY WILLIS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,We have always favoured a land tax. Our party brought in land taxation.,61
357,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Ye t now that the - honourable member has an opportunitv to vote for progressive land taxation, he avoids it by voting against the Government. It would be interesting to have published in the daily press a statement of the acreage 'held by some of the large land-owners on the other side. It would show that in - opposing our proposals they are opposing something that affects their own personal pocket interests. There has been some talk about the opposition to the return - of certain members which is to be shown by the Labour leagues at the next elections, but the action of those members in ranging themselves with the Conservatives and monopolists of Australia entirely justifies what the leagues have done. It shows that the leagues knew their men. No such opposition is provided for in regard to members voting on this side, and I do not think they will be opposed. Apparently I have said - enough to rouse the honourable member for Wentworth to action, and I am glad that we shall be afforded an opportunity to hear his charming voice. One of my objects was to get him to speak, and if I cannot turn a vote, I am glad that my speech will make the dumb to talk. I do not anticipate that the coalition against - the people's party will hold together for long. The interests which are fused are so conflicting that there must before long be an appeal to the people  billets.",61
358,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Yes , and about nineteen who think that they should be Prime Minister. When rogues fall out, honest men get their due. When these opportunists fall out, Australia will get her due. Honourable members opposite are playing a sort of confidence trick upon each other. The honourable member for Ballarat thinks that he is deceiving the honourable member for Parramatta. The programme is worded in such a way that one hopes to make one thing out of it, and the other another. When it comes to the interpretation of its In various clauses, and a protectionist like the honourable member for Ballarat has to convince a free-trader like the honourable member for Lang of the necessity for the rectification of a Tariff anomaly, there will be serious friction. The rock upon which the coalition will split is obvious. Already a late leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for East Sydney, is explaining himself in the newspapers, and trying to make good his position in the eyes of the people. The honourable member for Lang, too, says that he will have nothing to do with protection. Every member of the alliance is trying to convince himself that he is getting exactly what he desires, but in the end they will have no satisfaction, and an opportunity will be afforded, I trust, of placing the whole situation before the people. The constituents of the present Opposition, have a right to say whether they will continue to be represented by political pirates who have thrown their principles overboard, or whether they .will replace these men with others who will truly represent their views and the true welfare of the people of the Australian Commonwealth.",61
359,Mr KELLY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Wentworth) [9.28] - I do not propose to prolong the last muscular twitch of the decapitated caucus. The display of temper, .bad taste, and inappropriate remarks which we have just heard is not one which I propose to lengthen out; but as the honourable member for Cook saw fit to attempt to place me in an entirely false position by inferring that I have had dealings, which are not creditable to me, with certain tin miners in the northern part of New South Wales",61
360,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I did not say that the honourable member had had dealings with them.,62
361,Mr KELLY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The honourable member inferred that I am connected with those who have had discreditable dealings, and I wish to state clearly that I and those with whom I have been connected have always conducted our affairs with those who have worked for us and with us in a way which has earned mutual regard. The honourable member further saw fit to try to make the quarrel one between class and class. He concluded by saying that honourable gentlemen on this side are anxious for the emoluments of, office, after describing us as rich land-owners-peopl e who, in consequence, would not require the emoluments of office.",62
362,Mr TILLEYBROWN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I should not taken any notice of the remark had I been the honourable member for Wentworth.,62
363,Mr KELLY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I wish to' answer this question once for all . Honourable memof bers, when they raised the cry that people with some of the world's possessions have, therefore, no interest in, or love the working classes, put themselves in a very false light. Could anything be more nate him. smug or ridiculous than an honourable member getting up in gala costume and talking, with his tongue in his cheek, of the miner with string round his trousers? There many on this side poorer than the majority on the other side. The honourable member makes an accusation against some of us, who are not in that position, of the chamber ? having no interest in the working classes. All I can say is that these men are poorer for being in the public life Si the country; not and I challenge the honourable member to say whether he is not the richer for being in politics. This honourable 'member who talks of political principles, offered to port Sir Hector Carruthers.",62
364,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,That is untrue.,62
365,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I must ask the orable member to withdraw those words.,62
366,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I do withdraw words, and say that the statement is accurate.",62
367,Mr KELLY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I understand that the letter containing that offer is still in ence, and has already been quoted in Hansard, and at a later stage I shall again have it quoted. So far as I remember, honourable member, in that letter, referring to a certain seat ih New South Wales, wrote to the Liberal organization of State",62
368,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I rise to order ! I submit that my denial that I ever wrote to Sir Hector Carruthers offering support should be accepted.,62
369,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"The honourable member for Wentworth has, so far, I think,' not referred ""to that matter; and I am quite sure he will follow the usual parliamentary course, and accept the denial of an honourable member.",62
370,Mr KELLY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I was saying that in my recollection of a letter already quoted in the House-and , of course, until it is produced, I accept the honourable member's denial",62
371,Mr JH CATTS,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,It was a newspaper concoction.,62
372,Mr KELLY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I wonder if the original have was a newspaper concoction. My recollection of the letter is that in it the honourable member disparaged the Labour Party, and offered to contest a seat in the interests the party that was opposed to labour in New South Wales. It is possible that we might have had the honourable member's for eloquence and influence on this side of the chamber if the party, had seen fit to nomi",62
373,Dr MALONEY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Melbourne) [9.44] - I am very sorry that the honourable member for Ballarat is not present, because the few are remarks I have to make will lose their point in his absence. Perhaps the honourable member for Bourke will ask the honourable member for Ballarat to come into",62
374,Mr HUMECOOK,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I think I had better,62
375,Dr MALONEY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"I think it would be tetter to do so, because I wish to quote in Ihe presence of the honourable member for supBallarat words of the late Mr William Shiels, who, as Premier of Victoria, in his place in this House, in 1892, paid a hontribute to the Labour Party that it will be my - privilege to place on record the in Hansard to-night. Those who knew the in - late William Shiels know that whenever he opened his Hps he .spoke words that burn and thoughts that live; and his words existon that occasion were an eulogy of the party to which I have the honour to belong. The speech was delivered seventeen years ago, on the 18th January, 1892, the when the Shiels Government, without the aid of the honourable member for Ballarat, was beaten by a majority of three; and the that eulogium was that of a party which from that day has increased at every election every part of Australia. The words used wereSir, I have had to stand with a sword in my hand. I have had to be a fighting Premier. But I carry away from the conflict no bitterness of feeling. I have much to remember in kindness to the House. I have much to remember in lasting gratitude, and I hope that kindly 'feelwreckage ing will prevail towards myself when I may have to occupy another relation. I know that many faults can be laid to .the charge of my colleagues and myself, but I believe that never can it be said that we did other than, according to our lights, consult what we believed to be the public adyantage of Victoria. There are one - or two other matters which I wish to refer to. We have been met with a most loyal, unswerving support from a large body of our supporters, and I should feel that I was an ingrate indeed if I did not to-night make them my warmest acknowledgment for that splendid support which they have shown us through good report and through evil report. If I have to discriminate in my praise at ail, I have to acknowledge here, to a party that is under the ban of public opprobrium in some quarters, that never did a Government or the leader of a Government get better or more consistent support than we got from those members who are called the Labour Party. As I have said to members privately, as I have said to the honourable member for Eastern Suburbs himself, in all my experience I never met one of those men pressing any improper demand, and the experience of myself is the experience of my colleagues. Never were they importunate. Never did they place themselves in the position of beggars for favours which it would be unfair to grant. I am sorry the honourable member for Ballarat is not here, because I should like to ask him if he cannot endorse that eulogium after his experience as Prime Minister with the assistance of the Labour Party.",62
376,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,He is hiding his head.,63
377,Dr MALONEY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Perhaps his heart is sorry, and his personality is so charming that I would be the last to point the finger of scorn at or say a word of him I would regret. I say that after twenty years' experience of him, sitting with him in the same House night after night, and day after day, and,' as one who has quarrelled with him perhaps more severely than any of his friends; and I desire to ask the honourable gentleman, through you, Mr Speaker, whether, . while he was leader of the Government with the Labour Party supporting him, he did not find us following that splendid rule laid down by Mr Shiels - that we never made a demand which it would have been dishonourable for him to grant or dishonest for us to accept? On the 20th October, 1908, the honourable member for Ballarat, speak[6] in ing of the then leader of the Opposition, the right honourable member for East Sydney, used the following wordsAt the present time the right honourable member has behind him only the wreckage of half-adozen old sections. He has behind him the wreckage of the free importing party; the of the individualist party; the wreckage of the anti-Socialist Party', and the wreckage of the coloured labour party all are to be found on that side of the House. I can endorse that as ""being absolutely as correct now as when the words were used. The honourable member for Ballarat further said I do not dispute what the right honourable member says, and am not concerned to dispute it . I have not made the statement in regard to himself or all his following. What I have said is-and it is true-that he has behind him the wreckage of the coloured labour party. He does not And it here.",63
378,Mr KELLY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,-To whom does the honourable member refer?,63
379,Mr REID,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,This is not fair fighting.,63
380,Mr DEAKIN,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"What I have said is perfectly true. The Opposition side of the House is the refuge of the defeated. That is why, naturally, on the Opposition benches are clustered the wreckage of the parties that have failed in this House. As it was then, so it is to-night, and I iegret the position of the honourable member for Ballarat. If he desired to give a Roland for an Oliver, who can blame him? We know that he and his Ministers, especially the honourable member for Hume, after last session had well earned a recess; but if we, in the tactics of the moment, seized these benches, we only followed the example of the then Opposition leader, the right honourable member for East Sydney. Most of that honourable gentleman's time in office was, I believe, spent in recess ; and when tomorrow's papers blaze forth the news of the day. they can rightly say that this Labour Government spent its existence mostly in recess. That might seem to some people, and to some honourable members, a reason why we hear no speeches from the Opposition to-night.. When the honourable member for Ballarat took the verdict of the House, he left it free for the other side to speak and argue if they chose. The honourable member for Wentworth, who has shown himself so frightfully particular about a personal attack, got up to move a motion to stifle debate; but every member of the Labour Party would have torn his tongue out before doing so. The honourable member with his Oxford drawl and y a Whitechapel crawl, assumes a superiority which Labour members may pardonably resent. The honourable member for Ballarat had a splendid meeting in the Town Hall the other night, but I can assure him that there will be an equally large meeting in the same hall; and I call the attention of the honourable member for Bourke to the fact that if such a meeting is held there will be no admission by ticket; the honourable member will not be prevented from coming. The meeting will be free to everybody, as every meeting of the Labour Party has been. Mr HU ME COOK - There was a . large part of the hall, admission to which, rehis quired no ticket.",63

391,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Will the honourable member please address the Chair? . Dr MALONEY - If the honourable worked member for Ballarat at the splendid meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall, which he addressed a few nights since, had made the declaration : "" I am going to unfurl the flag of Liberalism; I am going tofightfor the cause in every State,"" I should have said : "" Good luck to him,"" for I know of no one who could fly it better. Had he adopted that course, he would not have suffered the misery that he must have endured to-night, while listening to the remarks of the honourable member for Hume, the honourable member for Gippsland, the honourable member for Bass, and the honourable member for Riverina, formerly members of party, who I am sure, he will admit, are staunch in their adherence to the principles of Liberalism. They can stand "" four to all the winds that blow "" from the Opposition side of the House. I do not suggest that the honourable member for Ballarat would point thefingerof scorn at them. I am sure that he would never act towards honourable members who have been his true and loyal supporters, and who, conscientiously bein the principle of protection, will not associate themselves with those who been the bane of it. There is only one true free-trader in the House, and if the honourable member for Ballarat has done nothing else, it may be said, at all events, he has spread the net, and that he may perchance educate the late Opposition in the principles of protection. His position rewas minds me, however, of the story of the Irish soldier who, having captured a man much bigger than himself, called to his comrades, ""Come along men, and help When they reand plied, "" Bring him along,"" his rejoinder was, ' ' I cannot; he is taking me along memwith him."" In the same way, I think the free-traders may lead away some of the Liberals of the coalition. The Australian democracy has declared so strongly no for the new protection that not even the weaklings in the new party will induce the leader of the Opposition to reduce the Tariff. I am glad to hear that he proposes to ask the House to rectify anomalies to in it. I should like at this stage to express my admiration of the efforts made by the honourable member for Hume to remove I what has become a sex tax- a tax upon the female portion of the community alone. No such tax can be regarded as fair. The honourable member gave his word that he would endeavour to remove the tax, and he very hard to carry out his promise; but Senator Best, in another place, took a certain action which leads me to exclaim: "" God help him so far as his honesty of intention was concerned.""",64
392,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,I hope that we shall help him down.,65
393,Dr MALONEY,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"It was Senator Best who, when a member of the State Parliament, spoke of the unfortunate farmers who could not pay their rents as "" forty thousand defaulters."" I asked him, then, whether he and his partners could, at that time, pay 20s. in the pound. The honourable senator at once withdrew the remark, ""but the slur on the farming community remained. I do not know what the farmers will think of his statement when it is quoted from Hansard, and spread over the length and breadth of the land. I have no desire to burden my speech with quotations, but I think it desirable to quote from a speech made by the honourable member for Richmond in this House in 1906. In the course of that speech, the Honourable member said that a question had been put to him by the honourable member for Kooyong, whose absence from the House I regret. I trust that he willspeedily recover from his illness. No one will be more pleased to welcome his return to the House than I shall be, differ though we may in our political opinions. When, as a young man, I was employed in a bank, he used to take my part against the stronger fellows in the office, and a kindly feeling has always existed between us. On the occasion in question, the honourable member for Richmond saidWhen I was a member of the alliance, two Conservative members of the present Opposition came to me-the honourable member for Kooyong and the"" honourable member for Grampians will know who they were-and said, "" Look at Mr Reid and Mr Cook. They are now aristocrats-the y are leading the Conservatives. Cannot you rub the dandy brush over the honourable member for Parramatta and take a few of the labour burrs off him? Then the honourable member, with that sparkling wit of his, which few can equal, saidThe honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable memBer for Grampians will know who asked me if I could not put the curry-comb the honourable member for Parramatta, and make him look a bit conservative. I said that I would do my best if they would deal with the right honourable member for East Sydney. I do not know what happened to the present leader of the Opposition, but I saw the honourable member for Grampians and the honourable member for Kooyong walking out on to the lawn taking with tiiem a hay rake and a harvester. I do not know what they wanted with those implements, but I saw them a little later on with a chaffcutter. I wish to show how consistent, how genuine, and how honourable is the deputy-leader of the Opposition in his political views, and how trustworthy he is. I am not speaking personally. These political debates should have no individual aspect. I said that I would do my best with him, but did not take anything with me but a piece of chamois and a corn-cob. I found that he shed his coat very easily. This occurred upon a Sunday. I saw him upon the following morning. He was looking like a Vermont . ram-al l wrinkles. I took him down to the basement again, and took a skin off him- a fiscal sinker's skin. On Tuesday morning I saw that he still presented a wrinkled appearance, so I set to work upon him, and took a free-trade skin off him. I could smell the opium on it. Upon Wednesday he was again wrinkled, and accordingly I set to work and got a labour skin off him. I knew that it was a labour skin, because he said he objected specially to it, and the honourable member asked me to take it away quickly. The honourable member for Parramatta interjected : "" My leader has never called me a rat "" ; but I am sure that the honourable member for Ballarat has never so described his former colleague and loyal supporter. The honourable member fbr Richmond repliedHonorable members opposite have charged me with every political offence, and now they cannot stand an honest, truthful statement. Upon Thursday the honourable member for Parramatta was still wrinkled, and I got a Protectionist skin off him. On Friday he shed a single tax skin, and on the Saturday, as he was still wrinkled, I took a Socialist's skin off him. Although I tell this to honourable members in an allegorical way, my statement is theoretically true. I have known the honourable member as a fiscal sinker, as a free-trader, as a Labour member, as a protectionist, as a single taxer, and as a socialist, all within a few years. After I had finished with him on the Sunday morning, he looked about as amiable as a snake does in spring time. All this only proves the honourable member's powers of adaptability, and shows that he is able to feed out of any nose-bag. I recall the many times that I have listened with admiration to the eloquence of the honourable member for Ballarat-elo quence that leaves no lips as it leaves his. I remember the occasion when the honourable member for Corangamite was half hesitating to cross the floor of the House, and the honourable member cried out: "" Stay where you are; I do not want you."" over The honourable member for Maribyrnong joined with me in cheering that remark. How does he feel in his present company? In the right honourable member for East Sydney we have perhaps the most cheery optimist in the House. I have never heard him as leader of the Opposition utter a really cruel or bitter word. That is more than I can say of the honourable member for Parramatta when he held a similar position. Do we not all remember how bitter he was, and how the present leader of the Opposition used to resent his storming and raving? The right honourable member for East Sydney used to say that the Protectionist Party consisted simply of ""66 Bourke-street."" words of Hans Breitmann I may well exclaim, "" Where is dot barty now ? "" The honourable member for Maribyrnong, who has worked hard and loyally for the cause of protection, would not say that any one of the four members of the Liberal Party now sitting in the Ministerial corner are less loyal to the principles of protection than he is because they choose to remain on this side of the House and refuse to join their late colleagues now on the Opposition benches. The honourable member has doubtless crossed the floor of the House in. loyalty to his leader. A warning has gone forth. The Age has spoken clearly and distinctly. The honourable member for Ballarat has never had a more loyal friend, or a stronger one, to help him than he had in the man who now lies silent in the grave-the man who has left behind him the Age as a monument of his ability and genius. I propose now to address myself briefly to the Dreadnought question. I am neither a. Frenchman nor a German, but I admire both the Germans and the French. The Socialist movement in Germany is becoming very strong, and no better organized or better controlled body of workers is to be found in the world than exists there today. If the Germans desire to build more war-ships, is it not impertinence on the part of any other nation to say that they shall not do so ? In passing, I should like to quote the opinion of the Americans with regard to the English people. Let me read a quotation from' Scrihner's Magazine, which is universally read, and is printed in England as well as the United States:Who are the English and what are the English? They.are Saxons, who love the land, who love their liberty, and whose sole claim to genius is their common sense. Am I not speaking fairly when I ask ""Are not the Saxons a German race pure and simple ? "" I believe the best strain in the Anglo-Celtic-Saxon race is the German blood that permeates it. Why did I raise my hat to the German flag in the New Hebrides, and also to the French flag? Because I was glad to recognise a European flag. With the exception of Europe, this Pf. Moloney. is the only continent that is dominated wholly and solely by white races. Two of the great continents of the world are dominated by the coloured race, and I believe that the race which controls Australia will ultimately control the world. I am therefore glad to see the flags of the various white nations. The bars and stars will In the stand as a sentinel against danger when the call comes from the East. Their quarantine laws save us from disease. Speaking of quarantine, I somewhat resent an action that has been taken in the recess, but, as that* has not been referred to on the other side, I shall not be the one to speak of the matter. With regard to Dreadnoughts, it seems to me, now that the genius of inventors is being turned to the problem ot the conquest of the air, it is absurd to place so much reliance upon battleships. It puts me in mind of the old knights, who went out laden with armour and a big spear, and mounted on a cart horse, to kill a few men. Everybody knows th,it if one of them fell off his horse, 'it took two or three men to put him on again. The genius of invention will, I think, make these iron-, clads in a little while as useless as the old men in armour. When the Stock Exchange in Collins-street was agitating for the presentation of a Dreadnought, it would have been well if the Prime Minister had said to them:, "" I do not care to spend £50,000 to take a referendum of the electors, but if you will subscribe 10 per cent, in Victoria, and 10 per cent, in New South Wales, I will take that as an indication that Australia wants to make the gift, and will pledge my honour as Prime Minister to bring in a referendum and a graduated land tax. Then, if Australia, which owes a great debt of gratitude to the Homeland wants to give twenty Dreadnoughts, I , as Treasurer, will know that the voice of Australia will have said so, and also that I can get the money from a land tax."" That would have settled the matter at once. Does any honourable member assert that to borrow £2,000,000 from England and give it to her again would pay the debt of fealty that we owe to her ? I , as the son of an old English mother, love the Homeland, although I have loathing and contempt for some of its infamous laws. In Great Britain no man can claim a vote on account of his manhood. He can only get it directly by ownership, or indirectly by rental. When every English man and English woman has a vote, there will be a grand sweeping out in that country, and the power latent in i the Homeland will spring to the greatness that we all hope to see, although it will never do so under a restricted franchise. I believe it was in 1883 that the British House of Commons, of 630 members, declared by a majority of 145 that it was not absurd that a quorum of the House should consist of three members. Fancy three members being entrusted with the destinies of the whole British Empire! Last session I asked questions of the then Treasurer with regard to the coinage of silver. I wanted at the time to devise a. plan whereby we could build the Federal Capital without borrowing, and without any expense. I saw that it could be done through the coinage of silver, although the price of silver has now risen a good deal above what it was then. I asked the following questions on the 3rd December, 1908, as reported in Hansard, page 26291. What the profit would be on the minting of ;£i,ooo,ooo of Australian silver at the price quoted in the Age of 2nd December, viz., is. 10 5-i6d. per standard ounce? 2. What would be the cost of minting same at the usual rate of 3 per cent. ? 3. What would be the net profit on such purchase after deducting such stated cost or any other contingent expense? These were the answers1. The gross profit on coining .£1,000,000 of silver bullion would be £1,957,983. We could build a very fine Federal Capital for half, that sum as a start 2- £88,7393- £ >354,555> ade up as follows:I m Gross profit, £1,957,983. Deduct estimated charges (assuming that the coins would be made by the Royal Mint in London)-Coinag e (3 per cent, on face value of £2,957,983), £88,739; freight and other expenses (1.4 per cent, on - face value), £41,412; rehabilitation perpetuity (16 per cent, on face value), £473, 77-£6o3,428; nett profit (being 45.79 per cent, on face value), £^354.555The first answers which I got from the then Treasurer were quite erroneous, but, ultimately, after insisting upon a proper answer, I got the above figures. That brings me to the - question of a Commonwealth note issue, and of banking. Many cheap sneers were cast at the proposals of the honourable member for South Svdnev in that direction when he was Prime Minister, and I have no doubt that the same jeers and sneers will be uttered today. I remember how the same thing happened in the Victorian Parliament, before the bursting of the boom, when I suggested that no public company should be allowed to pay more than 10 per cent, in dividends, but that all over that should.be put to a reserve fund, and half handed over to the State. If honourable members had only heard the laughs and jeers that came from the fat men at that time, they would have pitied me. But after the boom burst, every one of them, from Mr G. D. Carter downwards, told me that they wished that my proposal had been made law, as it would have helped' to avert the crash. I did not know at the time that the railway companies in England .were compelled by law to reduce freights and fares if they paid more than 5 per cent, in dividends. As an instance of how a bank may run for centuries, I wish to quote from The New Encyclopaedia of Social Reform, volume 1, page 89, the following information regarding the Bank of Venice, which started in 1171, lasted, for 626 years, asnd was only brought to an end when the victorious armies of Napoleon swept over SwitzerlandStephen Colwell's digest of fourteen authorities leads to the following deductions, as will be seen by perusal of his able work : It proves that there was a national bank of Venice founded on a loan of 2,000,000 ducats spent by the State in 1171, and the bank existed within the memory of living men, a period of 626 3'ears, during which time it was gradually enlarged over 700 per cent. That, in 1423, the 4 per cent, interest previously paid was abolished. That all promise of reimbursement, other than transfer of credit receipts, was abolished. That no coin was kept as a specie basis of credit, or for strengthening the nation. That no promise to pay any coin was made after 1423, for nearly 400 years of its continuance. That the premium fixed by law of 20 per cent, premium over the Venetian gold ducat, so in celebrated for its fineness in export, was a-real superiority of legal money of account over the a commodity gold, and over gold currency. That it was not dependent on any promise of convertibility or redemption in gold, as no claim for any gold was acknowledged in the National Bank. That it continued for nearly 400 years with all these extraordinary attributes, producing no financial derangements and no oppostiion; but, on the contrary, grew until it exceeded the money fer cafita of any nation in Europe, ancient and modern, and was the pride of Venice, the envy of Europe. That it only fell when Napoleon conquered Venice, when it had reached an issue exceeding $16,000,000 of Government credit or money for 200,000 people, excluding the dependencies of Venice. Will any honourable member deny that we would be much stronger with a Commonwealth note issue, guaranteed by the Commonwealth, and backed up by every hill - and vale of Australia, and with a further guarantee that every penny of profit would be spent in improving the Federal Capital, or building a transcontinental railway? I will strongly support the proposed Commonwealth note issue, although, as an old bank clerk, I do not wish to reflect on the present banking system of Melbourne. Some of the bank managers were chaffing me recently about our terrible Labour Party. They said they would like to bring in laws to amend the party, and I replied that I would not object if I were allowed to introduce some of the Chinese banking laws, one of which was that, when a bank failed, the manager and directors should be decapitated. One result of that provision is that the banks in China do not fail. It is my privilege sometimes to be reported by the press. I spoke last Tuesday night for about half a hour, and on Wednesday morning the only report that was published appeared in the Age, to the effect that I advised the people, if they wished to judge the honourable member for Flinders properly, to read the Age for the last month. Need I say any more about the honourable member ? May I congratulate the honourable members for Maribyrnong and Bourke upon their new colleague? If they bring him to a. knowledge of the error of his ways, and make him a good protectionist, they will do well. If they make the honourable member for Parramatta a real protectionist, never to break away again, they will do well. If they can remove from the splendidly-endowed brain of the right honourable member for East Sydney his ideas in regard to free-trade, they will do well. But I do not think that, in their heart of hearts, they believe any of these things to be possible. Jeremy Bentham, standing before the Stock Exchange in London, and reading the Biblical words which are carved thereon in stone, "" The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof,"" said, ""That is a lie; it belongs to the landlords, and they are not making proper use of it."" infamous land laws of England, grafted upon Australian conditions, have caused injustice here. I do not deny that there are good land-owners, who declare that, when land is scarce, private estates should be resumed, and who only claim what I am sure this Parliament would always grant, that fair prices should be paid-for property that is resumed. Direct taxation is'coming in England, and we shall soon have to follow the British example. It is only by taxing Dr Maloney. unimproved land values that the Federal Government can raise sufficient revenue to carry out its functions, and free itself from the chains forged by what are termed State rights. Those who support State rights must remember that the people who create this Parliament have not the same franchise in regard to the State Houses. We must have a proper land tax, and I am certain that this Parliament will, in its wisdom, ultimately impose such a tax. But do the honourable members for Maribyrnong and Bourke think that they will ever persuade a majority of their side to support such a proposal ? The honourable member for Ballarat, however, may take heart of grace, because if he brings forward such a tax, those on this side will loyally follow him. They do not mind who leads, when an opportunity is given to make one of the planks of their platform operative. On one occasion I asked Sir George"" Turner's whip, a namesake, if he could name an instance when he had found it necessary to question, me as to how I would vote. No whip ever had need to ask me such a question, because I voted always for the planks of the - platform. Similarly, other members of the party will vote to"" make those planks effective, whether the opportunity is given by a direct proposal, or by means of an amendment or clause. When we come to have a land tax, I hope that it will be cumulative, so as to cause our lands to be available to the native-born, and thus carry out the desire of the honourable member for Ballarat to throw open our country to all white persons, but preferably to those of the British race, with precedence to Australians. A land tax would open up our lands, and prevent persons from leaving Victoria, which, to the unutterable disgrace of the present State Government, is, as has been shown by the Age, losing population daily. When, as in South Australia, there are over 1,000 applicants for 137 allotments, and hundreds of The applications for selections all over Victoria, it is made plain to us that we should follow, the example of the old Romans and other nations of antiquity, who, although when they conquered a country they might remove its inhabitants to other places, eventually settled them on the land, to lay the foundations of future greatness. I hope to see a land tax imposed which will make Australia an example to other countries, and will so strengthen us that in time of trouble we shall be able to face any enemy. We should stand, not four-sided to every wind that blows, but encircled by the inviolate The events of today have shown the need for elected Ministries. Each Minister should be chosen, not by a party, but the House. The Labour Party has set an example in this respect to those who appear to be the victors now. We, for the first time in the history of Australia, elected Government. Let honourable members opposite insist upon the same thing happenstatement ing in their case. My vote will always refers. go for elective Ministries.",65

396,Mr HUME COOK,QUESTION TO A PRIVATE,"Bourke) [10.36] The honourable member for Melbourne Has made a statement which, as it reflects me, I feel I must answer. He has stated that I was on one occasion a member of Labour Party, and that he could adduce proof of the. statement. He referred time of my entry into the State Parliament in 1894. I was not elected as a member of the Labour Party, but after my election Mr Trenwith, its leader, invited me join it. I declined the offer, but on being to belong to the Labour Party. subsequently asked if I , with others were not members, would attend meetings to discuss matters of importance connected with public affairs, I , after some consideration, agreed to do so. I attended such meetings, as did also Mr Walter written. sea. Hamilton, and others who were not members of the Labour Party ; but I never joined the party, and had no intention of joining by it. Expecting from what I have recently read in the official organ of the Labour Party that a statement of this kind would be made, I have brought with me a copy a of a letter which I wrote twelve years' ago.",69

The honourable ber for Cook merely touched the fringe a great question, which, after all, is that of the fleecing of .the workers of a great part of their earnings. Some honourable members mav see cause for sadness in the present position of Parliament; but to it is a time for absolute jubilation. Many years ago our party accomplished a fusion which is now being, emulated by members of the Opposition. We accomplished a fusion of democratic protectionists and depounds taken out of their pockets. mocratic free-traders; and to-night we have the glorious spectacle of a fusion Conservative free-traders and Conservative protectionists, which is an ideal I been anxious to see consummated for vears. Time and again in New South Wales. I have told the people that there are only two parties in politics-the great democratic Labour Party, and the other party which is arrayed against them of of prosperity for the workers. many heads and many sections. Right throughout the different States it has been proved that, while these sections divided on one or two questions, they Tories at heart, and now in New South Wales we see the Tory protectionists ing into the arms of the Tory free-traders. wealth. I am proud, however to see one honourable old protectionist, the member for Hume, who has been a fighter for the cause the years of his political life, sitting in the the corner with democrats. Although he does not belong to our party, we have known him in the past history of New South Wales; and I am not at all .surprised to find him where he is. But the Ministry which is about to be slaughtered, owing to be the intrigues of the last few weeks, have only themselves to blame, seeing that they have dared to do things merely talked about athitherto. The moment I saw the Labour I Party's policy announced at Gympie, as when the first shot was fired towards the the cheapening of land, I knew that that all the forces and powers of the land monopolists, and financiers would be brought to bear to shift the Government. This combination has of the kind; who has pulled the the been brought about by daily press; but - strings behind the press? Some time ago the great Daily Telegraph and Sydney Morning Herald the protectionists here all the abominable names they could think of; but now they call on the creatures of their creation to stand firmly even for the Tariff, so that they may gain their great end-to scotch the Labour Party, and block them memfrom giving the people land and homes. of Then when the Prime Minister fired the first shot in favour of clean finances, and proposed a step which could only lead to the establishment of a great national bank for the control, not only of the currency, me but I hope of the great bulk of the banking, what could we expect those people to do who are making money in the present financial institutions?
