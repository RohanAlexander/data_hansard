House ' whether there is any truth in that report, and there is, why the members of this party should not know what he has told his own party?",20
3,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I read the Argus report to mean that I had made .a statement of importance to my .party, to w h i c h ' ! do I have made. not take exception, though most' of the statements made are of importance. If , however, the impression has been conveyed that I have given to my party confidential information which is being withheld from the Opposition, I wish honourable members to understand that it is not so. At a later stage, if I am permitted to divulge information which cannot be made public, I shall have no hesitation in giving it in private, to all members of the Parliament.",20

7,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Since I answered the. question asked yesterday by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith), I have had a further conference on the subject with the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce). It was represented to me by some honourable members - particularl y by the honourable member Elliot  answer given did not contain an exact description of the practice. The Minister for Defence contends that it was an exact and correct description of the practice. I shall ask my honourable colleague to be Mingood enough to prepare a statement that the I may give to the House next week, showexactly what is done in all classes of cases, so that any misconception may be removed:.",20
8,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I ask the honourable gentleman whether, when he is with the Ministei' for Defence, he will deal with the question of returntothe wives and children of soldiers, - other than deceased soldiers, the deduchis tions made contrary to the altered rule the honourable which he haa announced.",20
9,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The only alteration of if rule of which I am aware is in connection with deductions from the funds of deceased soldiers. If the honourable member will give me an explicit - idea of the kind of case to which he refers, I shall see whether it is covered by the statement ILL-TREATMENT OF SEAMAN.",20
10,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Acting Prime Minister been called to a paragraph which appeared in the Melbourne Herald' of the night before last, in which it is reported that a naturalized American seaman was kept hand-cuffed and leg-ironed for a week on the forecastle of a vessel on. which he was serving, because the captain would not give a bond demanded by the Customs Department, and the Department would not allow the man to land, until such a bond had been given? The affair seems rather an extraordinary one.",21
11,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I have not seen the report, but if the honourable member will f urnish me with a copy of it , I shall make an inquiry into the case. ARBITRATION COURT.",21
12,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,When doe's the Acting Prinie Minister think he will be in a position to make a statement to the House as to the policy of the Government in reference to the Arbitration Court 1,21

That I expect to be done within the reasonably early future,- but I cannot fix any date for it . WAR-TIME PROHIBITION. . Mr FINLAYSON - Has the Acting Prime Minister read the speech delivered before the Congregational Union by Mr. E. W. Greenwood, M.L.A., who states that the one man standing in the way of wartime prohibition is the honourable gentleman, because he has refused to allow this House an opportunity to deal with the motion in the name of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Sinclair) ? I ask if the Acting Prime Minister will now consider whether the House may not have an opportunity to consider that motion.",21
14,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The statement _ referred to conveys an unmerited compliment to me, but, like many of the other statements in the Argus report of the meeting, is incorrect. Whether the' 'House will be afforded an opportunity to discuss wartime prohibition, is a totally different matter. I prefer not to yield to the desire of certain persons who wish to get into the spot light at the present time. NA NEWSPAPER REPORTS.",21
15,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS FOUNDED ON,"I remind honourable members that it has been laid down repeatedly that questions founded on newspaper. statements are not in order, and should not be asked unless the honourable members responsible for them are prepared to vouch for the accuracy of the reports, SEVENTH WAR LOAN. NEGOTIABILITY-CONTRIBUTION S OF SOCIETY OF FRIENDS. i l r . FALKINER - Will the Acting Prime Minister consider .the advisability of making the scrip of the seventh war loan marketable as soon as the first deposit has been paid ?",21
16,Mr WATT,QUESTIONS FOUNDED ON,"I think that questions "" affecting the procedure in relation to our stock, which now totals such a huge amount, should not be asked without notice. The practice relating to stock dealings is well established and known, and I would not take any new step regarding our stock until I had consulted the financial advisers of the Government.",21
17,Mr CONSIDINE,QUESTIONS FOUNDED ON,"Has the Acting Prime Minister received a copy of the circular which has been sent to every member of the House on behalf of the Society of Friends in .Sydney, who ask that any contributions they may make to the war loan, either voluntarily or under compulsion, may be applied to other than war purposes ? Is it the intention of the honourable gentleman to acquiesce in that request?",21
18,Mr WATT,QUESTIONS FOUNDED ON,"I have received the circular referred to, but have not yet had time to consider it. If the request contained in it is what the honourable member says, it will not be acceded to o MINISTER FOR RECRUITING. - Mr BRENNAN - I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he can make Cabinet arrangements which will permit of the Minister for Recruiting being in his place to answer questions relating to the misdeeds of his Department? It is very inconvenient that honourable members cannot address questions to ""him.",21
19,Mr WATT,QUESTIONS FOUNDED ON,The Minister for Recruiting is generally in his place when the House meets.,22
20,Mr BRENNAN,QUESTIONS FOUNDED ON,I think he is a shirker.,22
21,Mr WATT,QUESTIONS FOUNDED ON,"That is a characteristically insulting observation,. and because of it I decline to answer the honourable member's question.",22
22,Mr BKENNAN,QUESTIONS FOUNDED ON,"I think that he is a shirker, and a mean shirker at that.",22

27,Mr WEBSTER,IMPORTATION OP NECESSARY,"The Imperial authomatter in hand. rities have informed us that it is not advisable to post single newspapers to the soldiers at the front. They would prefer the public to adopt the method of sendif^ newspapers through constituted bodies, such as, for instance, the Australian forts Fund. We have no power to refuse the Imperial request, and it must be obeyed. AUSTRALIA NIMPERI AL FORCE. PALESTINE HEAD-QUABTERS STAFF.",22

30,Mr WATT,IMPORTATION OP NECESSARY,"I do not think that while I am in conference with my colleagues I should be asked to give an undertaking regarding individual cases, with the circumstances of which I am not familiar. Any reply I made might bind the Government to a course of action that the Department of Defence would not approve. The honourable member may, with confidence, leave the matter with me until we see how the conference with the Min1 ister for Defence results. DR. MANNIX .

32,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTATION OP NECESSARY,Will the Acting Attorney-General supply honourable members with an advance copy of the full text Comof the judgment given by Mr Justice Powers m connection with the Commonwealth Public Servants case before the Arbitration Court?,22
33,Mr GROOM,IMPORTATION OP NECESSARY,"The judgments are always published in the Arbitration Court reports, but delay is occasioned by the fact that the judgment must be obtained from the Judge in revised form and then printed. I understand that when the judgments are published they are sent to honourable members. In this particular instance, without promising to obtain advance copies for all members, I will endeavour to get one copy for the honourable member for Melbourne Ports as soon as possible. STEAD'S WAR FACTS.",23
34,Mr FINLAYSON,IMPORTATION OP NECESSARY,"Is it a fact that the circulation of a book known as Stead's War Facts has been prohibited under the War Precautions Act, and, as the book is merely a collection of statements from Stead's Magazine, do the Government propose to prohibit the circulation of the magazine?

42,Mr HIGGS,IMPORTATION OP NECESSARY,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is he aware that owing to uncertainty as to the copper position shareholders in copper companies are sacrificing their shares? 2. If the Home authorities are unwilling to purchase the Australian output of copper after the 31st of December next, will the Government at once endeavour to obtain for Australian copper producers the right to sell their output to Allied countries?",23
43,Mr WATT,IMPORTATION OP NECESSARY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. I understand the shares in some copper companies have fallen to some 'extent, but am not aware that any shareholders are sacrificing their shares. The uncertainty as to the copper position may possibly have been to some extent responsible, but other factors of importance are industrial disturbances, scarcity of labour, and the increased cost of production. It is probable, also, that the possibility of peace in the not-distant future may have affected the position to some extent. 2. The Prime Minister has, as I informed the honourable member on the Oth instant, negotiations in hand for the sale of copper; and, as soon as the intentions of the British Government are known, an announcement will be made.",23

If so, why were his services not utilized for the preparation of such plans without additional expense to the Government?",24
48,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT METALLURGICAL,"The answers to the lionorable member's questions are as follow:1.

Mr ' WATT - The Minister for Defence informs me as follows:I have instructed the Adjutant-General to notify all Chaplains-General that chaplains are not to be appointed to transports coming to Australia in future unless they have served in the Australian Imperial Force or have previously resided in Australia. In tliese circumstances, I do not think any good would be served in discussing the matter as suggested. GUNBOAT ALBERT.",24
49,Mr MAHO NY,GOVERNMENT METALLURGICAL,"the Assistant Minister for the Navy, upon notice I. Were the boilers taken out of the gunboat Albert before such boat was disposed of by the Department ? 2. If so-=-(a) were such boilers sold; (6) what was the date of such sale; (c) what was the price obtained; (d) to whom were they sold?  honourable member's questions are as follow :1.

Is it not a fact that dissatisfaction exists Mitiongst letter-carriers by reason of the fact that there is a schedule of times to be observed by them on their rounds which is not communicated to the men themselves? 3. Is it not a fact that letter-carriers have been charged with dilatoriness on their rounds and reprimanded, or otherwise punished, without due regard to the nature and extent of the mail matter and weather and other conditions?",24
50,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT METALLURGICAL,"I have not had sufficient time to collect the data required from the various States, and I ask the honourable member to postpone the question. SYDNEY ELECTRIC AL SUPPLY!",24
51,Mr WATT,GOVERNMENT METALLURGICAL,"On 16th October, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith) asked meIs it a fact that the Commonwealth Govern- ' ment have commandeered the city of Sydney's electrical supply? Will the Acting Prime Minister tell the House the reason for this, and whether the same thing has been done in all the Capitals of the Commonwealth? I am now able to in f o rm the honourable member that the Commonwealth Government bave not commandeered the electrical supply of the city of Sydney. What the honourable member doubtless bas in mind is the War Precautions (Electricity ) Regulations, wbicb were made on the 18th September, 1918, in order to give the engineers of the different electrical undertakings authority to .discriminate in the matter of the supply of electricity where they were short of power. NA Bill received from the Senate and  time. . The following papers were presented:Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Fund Act - Repor t by the Auditor-General on the Accounts of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Fund, 31st May, 1916, to 6th April, 1918. Railways Act, By-laws Nos. 6 and 7. LOANBILL (No. 2). SECOND READING.",24
52,Mr WATT,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.27] - As on the resolution in Committee of Supply I gave all the details regarding the Bill which honourable members desire, I shall content myself with merely movingThat this Bill be now read a second time.",25
53,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Y a r r a ) [11.28] - I am anxious not to delay the passage of the Bill , but I wish to refer to two or three. matters which were not dealt with last night. One is the contribution of the Commonwealth under the River Murray Waters Act of 1915. Honourable members know that, under that scheme, the Commonwealth undertook to contribute about £1,000,000, and the States of Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia are to contribute certain proportions of the money required. The Act provided for the appointment of a Commission composed of a representative of the Commonwealth, as chairman, and representatives of each of the three States interested. Some time during 1915 a party left Murray-bridge to take part in the laying of the foundation stone of the first lock. I think we should know what progress has been made with that work ; also, whether any other locks are being built, and whether the Commission has been appointed. I have not heard of any representative of the Commonwealth having been permanently appointed to the Commission, and as for the last three years the Commonwealth has been liable for an expenditure of £1,000,000, and as £99,000 is asked for in this Bill , we have a right to ask the Minister for some in formation regarding the project. One of the most important needs of Australia is the conservation of its waters. Those who were in South Australia in BILL. November last had the opportunity of (on seeing the tremendous quantity of water that was flowing down the River Murray , and there is no doubt that it would be a good thing to conserve what is now going PAPERS. to waste. The agreement, which was ratified by the River Murray Waters Act , provides for a scheme which will irrigate millions of acres, and' render the river navigable for a greater part of the year than is now possible. As this may be the last opportunity we shall have of dealing with this matter, I would like to hear from the Minister a definite statement regarding the progress which has been made in connection with the scheme. Provision is made for the sum of £7,900 for the purchase of land for lighthouses, but as these lighthouses are usually placed only on extreme points of the mainland, or islands, or upon coral islets, where land is practically valueless, the item calls for some explanation.",25
54,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,I think that it includes the purchase of land for stores and workshops.,25
55,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"If land is being acquired in populous centres for the establishment of workshops for the manufacture of the requirements of the Department, of course my argument is stopped at once.",25
56,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Darling Downs-Min ister for Works and Railways) [11.34]. - After the River Murray waters agreement was ratified and assented to, a Commission was appointed consisting of the Commonwealth Minister for Works for the time being, who presides over its deliberations, and is appointed for the period during which, he occupies the position Minister for Works, but not exceeding years; Mr T. Hill , the Engineer the Works and Eailways Department, who is Deputy President of the Comon mission, and advises the Minister on matters of a technical character; Mr H . H . Dare, who represents New South. Wales; Mr J. S. Dethridge, who represents Victoria; and Mr J. H . Eaton, who represents South Australia. A report upon the operations of the mission during the year ended, the 30th June last, has been laid on the table the House, and has been ordered to printed', but has not yet been circulated. Under the agreement ratified by the River Murray Waters Act, the Commoncluded. wealth was to contribute not more than £1,000,000 towards the cost of the works to be undertaken, and the three contractgeneral ing States-Ne w South Wales, Victoria, and South Austraha-were each to tribute £1,221,000, Of course, the passed by this Parliament does not limit the power of the Commonwealth Parliaweirs ment to contribute more in the future, it so decides.",25
57,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Before extra money could be paid by the Commonwealth, an amendpayment ing Bill would be necessary?",26
58,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Yes , fresh authority would have to be given by Parliament. £176,000 The scheme contemplated is the provision of a system of storage works on the Upper Murray; a storage basin in Lake Victoria, which is situated in New South Wales, not far from the boundary of so large for one lock. South Australia; the construction of some weirs and locks from Blanchetown, in South Austi'alia, to Wentworth, are estimated at about nine; weirs and locks from Wentworth to Echuca-thes are estimated at about sixteen or sevenincurred teen in number; weirs and locks from the junction of the Murray and Murrumto bidgee to Hay; or, alternatively, locks Unfortunately, the and weirs from the junction of the Darling with the River Murray up-stream in the River Darling. The New South Wales Government has decided in favour of the Murrumbidgee. According to the agreement: the Government of South sive years, flooding the . works. Australia is to construct the weirs and locks within that State and to Wentworth, and the Victorian Government and the New South Wales Government are to carry of - out similar works ou that portion of the five Murray River which runs between the of two States. The New South Wales Government is to build the locks and weirs the Murrumbidgee. The Commission has been pressing on with these works, realizing their importance; but, at the beginning, the scheme was nothing but a piece of paper, and it has been the duty O. of the Commission to lay down working procedure, settle the terms and conditions, Comand the methods of payments, and adjust various matters calling for attention of under the agreement. As the result be of a conference I had a fortnight ago with State Ministers, I believe that all these preliminaries will soon be conThe Commission is urging the State Governments to proceed as rapidly as possible in the submission of the scheme, and considerable progress has been made - The Blanchecontown lock ' was started before the Act . agreement came into operation, but was included in its scope - All these and locks are to be paid for out of if the contributions of the Commonwealth and the contracting States, and the sum of money which appears on these Estimates is the Commonwealth share ,of the due to South Australia in connection with the Blanchetown works, that State having submitted a claim for for money spent upon the construction of that lock and general surveys and investigation.",26
59,Mr LECKIE,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,The claim should not be,26
60,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"In the elaim, a large amount is included for plant. The matthese ter is now being adjusted among the various contracting States and the Come monwealth. South Australia has since fresh expenditure. The amount asked for also . includes payments due Victoria and New South Wales. construction of River the lock at Blanchetown has been delayed through no fault on the part of the constructing authorities in South Australia, because there have been excessively heavy rivers for three succesLast year, nothing could be done at Blanchetown for eight months. The whole of the coffer-dam was flooded. However, the engineers are now pressing forward with the work, and they have it well in hand. Since the Commission has been established, the South Australian Government, as the constructing authority, has submitted plans and specifications for, and the estimated cost of, the large and very important works which will be necessary at Lake Victoria, and which will enable very considerable quantities of water to be stored and made available for the whole of the down-stream requirements.",26
61,Mr LECKEE,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Available for Australia only 1,27
62,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,That is the intention of the agreement.,27
63,Mr LECKIE,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"They are getting all their end of the agreement, and there is nothing for the other States.",27
64,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"The honourable member is hardly fair in making that statement. As a matter of fact, the three States are working in complete harmony and fairness to one another. They are all doing their best to carry out the agreement according to the spirit and intention of the contract made between them. It was specially provided that this should be one of the first works to be constructed. The agreement says The intention of the contracting Governments is that, so far as is reasonably practicable, the Lake Victoria works shall pleted within four years. The plans and specifications have been carefully looked into. They have been before the Commission several times. Special visits have been paid by the expert engineers of the Commission, so that the scheme could be thoroughly examined on the spot. It was only last week tfiat the final visit was made, and the scheme will be ready for complete submission, to the next meeting of the Commission. In the meantime the States of New South ""Wales and Victoria have had their surveyors at work. Although they have not yet submitted to the Commission, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, their requests in regard to weirs and locks, and to the Upper Murray storage, it does not follow that nothing has been done. Both States have been actively at work in investigating sites for that storage, and also sites for locks and weirs lower down the river. As far as possible, the work is being carried out expeditiously, in order to get the scheme under way. The amount of £99,000 appearing on these Estimates is the Commonwealth Government's contribution towards the actual and estimated expenditure ' on works and investigations, pursuant to the River Murray Agreement, for the year 1917-18, and the period prior thereto, as well as for the current financial year. The total amount which it was. estimated South would be required during the financial year 1917-18-includin g an expenditure of £188,000 incurred by the three constructing authorities prior to the date of the appointment of the Commission-wa s £420,000, the Commonwealth Government's quota being £90,100. Owing to the fact that the Commission's investigations into the expenditure incurred prior to the 31st January, 1917, were not completed during that year, the moneys which the four contracting Governments were asked to furnish were not drawn upon during the year 1917-18. It was necessary to send accountants over to South Australia to see that the claim submitted came within the terms of the agreement. The Commission's estimate of expenditure for the year 1918-19 was £209,000, but as it was estimated that a balance of £168,000 would be available from moneys asked for in connection with the previous be comyear, the total amount which the four Governments were asked to contribute during the current year was £41,000, the Commonwealth Government's shaTe being £8,900. The total amount that the Commonwealth Government has been asked to provide for t'he years 1917-18 and 1918-19 is £99,000.",27
65,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Are the States paying their share?,27
66,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Yes . The procedure adopted is that when an expenditure is incurred, the Commission makes a requisition upon the contributing authorities, who, under the terms of the agreement, contribute their quota proportionately. The arrangement is that the request for the payment of these contributions shall be made only when the necessity arises. This sum of £99,000 will be available to the Commission when it makes its requisition upon the Commonwealth for a pro ratd contribution contemporaneously with its request for contributions from the States. The Commission realizes the i m portance of the task with which it has been intrusted., and is making every effort thing. to advance the work as speedily as possearching sible.",27
67,Mr MAHONY,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Dalley) [11.4.7] - I sire to refer to a matter of ance, bearing' upon the administration of the Department of the Navy. This morning I put to the Acting Minister for  notice, in which I inquired whether boiler was taken out of the Albert and sold separately before she was disposed of. The Minister replied that the boilers were sold with the vessel, and that the price for the Albert, as a whole, was £806. I wish tq.say, as clearly and tinctly as I can, that this statement is absolutely incorrect. A boiler was"" out of the Albert.  member means to say is that he has been informed that my reply is incorrect.",28

I repeat that a boiler was taken out of the Albert and was sold separately. The answer I received was really not a reply to my question. This boiler was sold to a certain firm at a ridiculously low figure, but, subsequently, as the Minister informed me yesterday, another boiler of very much the same type was purchased at a cost of £475 to place the Commonwealth vessel, the Gethana, which was recently built for us in the United States of America.",28
69,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,What was the condition of the boiler taken out of the Albert ?,28
70,Mr MAHONY,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"It was quite equal to the boiler purchased for the Gethana The latter boiler had been taken out of the old tug boat Magic,' which has been in Sydney waters for many , years. was removed from the Magic some time able ago, and had been lying in one of the rivers running into Port Jackson for some time before it was purchased by the people from whom the Department obtoria's tained it . The boiler taken out of the Albert was certainly old, but not older than that purchased for the Gethana. I am not going to be sidestepped by what really no reply to the question that I to the Minister. I shall say no more. leave the matter in the hands of the M in ister, believing that he will do the rightI ask him to make the most inquiries into the transaction, which has cost the country a good deal of money, and I repeat that I am not demaking this statement without knowing some importwhat I am talking about.",28

It is generally admitted that unless that part of the scheme which applies to the upper reaches is of the Murray is carried out, those porput tions of it which relate to lower down I the river cannot be successful. The scheme is undoubtedly one of very considerable importance to large areas in Victoria and New South Wales. I do not know whether we can do anything to push on the Victorian section . 1",28
73,Mr GLYNN,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Unde r the States are in the same position. The reservoir in South Australia also conserves water up stream.,29

76,Mr FENTON,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"The scheme is designed to assist navigation' as well as irrigation, but it seems to me that the interests of Victoria and New South Wales have been neglected to a large extent.",29
77,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"That is hardly correct. Those two contributing authorities are doing their best to advance the scheme so far as it relates to Victoria and New South Wales, but have not anything well enough advanced yet to submit to the Commission.",29
78,Mr FENTON,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Who is to blame for the delay?,29
79,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,It is due to the necessity of making a full investigation so as to be sure of the foundations before a big scheme is entered upon.,29
80,Mr FENTON,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Some of the States appear to be able to get ahead with their part of the scheme.,29

The Commonwealth, being a large contributor to the cost of this national work, it should, I think, Act all the make some effort to spur on the State Governments. In passing the Biver Murray Waters B i ll we were anxious that the best use should be made of the £1,000,000, for which it provided, in the shortest possible time. As the scheme progresses, settlement will follow and production must increase. One wonders why work is carried out fair l y expeditiously in one State while it is delayed navii n another. The very key of the scheme is the conservation of water in the upper reaches of the Murray, and I protest against any further delay.",29
85,Mr FALKINER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Hume) [ 1 2 . 1 ] - I also should like some information from the Minister about the £99,000 for the Murray waters scheme, and also the £25,000 for the-Prime Minister's Department in London. In regard to the Murray waters scheme, nothing has been done, so far as I know, except the boring at a few sites in order to get a proper foundation. If a suitable site has not been found yet, surely we do not require to raise £99,000 for boring operations? I do not agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) that the dam or weir in the upper reaches of the Murray or its tributaries, is the keynote of the scheme. We can do South Australia a lot of good by'the conserving of water in Lake Victoria; and, at a time like this, money should not be raised which it is not withi n the power of the Government to spend. According to the official statement, the taxpayers last year contributed £3,900,000 more than was expended, and that money, with much more, amounting to millions, is now lying in the Commonwealth Bank. At a time like this, the Murray waters scheme might be left in abeyance. It is a well-known fact that irrigation in Victoria and New South Wales is a failure.",29
86,Mr LECKIE,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,What are you talking about ?,29
87,Mr FALKINER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,I am giving some facts that Victorians do .not like. It is well known that millions of money have been written off in Victoria for irrigation. Sir ROBEBT BE ST - Not millions.,29

As regards conserving the water in Lake Victoria, and making the Murray River navigable to South Australia, that I think is a fair proposal, of which South Australia should have had the advantage long ago. When Federaeach tion was brought about one of the main reasons that induced South Australia to come in was that the Murray would be made navigable, and that freight, conplaces sisting of produce, which ought to go to South Australia, would not be diverted the differential railway rates to Melare, bourne and Sydney.",30

101,Mr LECKIE,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"The selection of the site apparently about to be chosen is going to have the effect of wiping out many acres of the best land on the Upper Murray. We have, as already pointed a supplementary expenditure in South Australia. The water from Lake Victoria cannot go anywhere else except into that State; and if the whole scheme to is going by the board because of the expense of the big reservoir on the Upper Murray, and because it is found that more good land will be lost than gained, is it seems we are going to spend a lot of t money on the Lake Victoria scheme which w i ll benefit South Australia alone. Another point is that, owing to this scheme hanging over the people in the Upper Murray and M it t a M it t a districts for some years, they are not putting in im provements, holding that, if they are to be eventually drowned out, they should bo a paid for their land in order that This to has been pending month after month, and year after year; and it is time the different Commissioners came to an understanding as to where the storage is to be. There seems to be a certain amount of jealousy or feeling amongst the engineers, of whom is anxious to put his name at the bottom of a tremendous scheme. But, instead of such a scheme, might it not be possible to have smaller storage which would do exactly the same work, and not wipe out the land to which by I have referred.

If the Upper Murray scheme is to be carried out, the people will be told what they may expect, and I trust that when it ' [256] is finally decided to wipe them out, they will be compensated fairly and generously for giying up their homes.",31

112,Mr LECKIE,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"If so, I shall rise in the good opinion of honourable members opposite. If this Upper Murray scheme is not to be gone on with, we must remember that the money spent on Lake Victoria is exclusively for the benefit of South Australia, and we should be wary in spending Commonwealth money in the interest of one State only.",31
113,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Darling' Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [12.13] I was sorry to hear the honourable member for Indi strike that last note. This is not a South Australian scheme. ',31

115,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"I did not say the honourable member did say so; but this is an Australian scheme, conceived in a truly Federal spirit, and based on equality of contribution. The contracting States, so far as I can see, are working together to give effect to the intention of the Agreement, and it is necessary that South Australia should get the first benefit. Under »the Agreement we have to take over the Blanchetown weir, and in 1917-18 the South Australian Government sent in a claim for £176,571 in connection-with expenditure on the weir and general investigations. This was contemplated ""by the Agreement.",31

We were perfectly justified, to in asking for an appropriation of the the amount that was likely to be expended; but, having got the money, we were not. absolved from the obligation of tryin g to to keep down expenditure as much as possible. It is to the credit of the Government that, although it had so large an of money at . it s disposal, it deliberately exercised economy, and avoided The amount that we are now asking for is only what the Commism - sion reasonably expects to be expended",32

129,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"I shall obtain an exare planation of that item from the Acting The Commission is doing its best to carry out the scheme intrusted to it , and it is strange to hear the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) finding faul t with an irrigation policy. Every country that undertakes new measures is bound at first to meet with setbacks and reverses; just as every pioneer of settlement has his reverses. Many of those who today are living in prosperity are profiting by the experience gained by the reverses of those who preceded them.",32
130,Mr FALKINER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Has irrigation been a failure in India under efficient officers?,33
131,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"No ; but when the Chaffey Brothers came to Australia, and tackled an entirely new irrigation problem, dealing with an Australian river and Australian soil and climate, their first effort resulted in some losses. Yet, today those who have seen Mildura and Henmark know how tremendous are the possibilities of irrigation in this country. My own trip down the Murray was a revelation to me of those possibilities. We had the assurance of - those who settled on the irrigation areas, and who have been connected with them from the jump, that they are a success. Fopulation is thickly settled on areas which, without irrigation, would be practically unoccupied. Lower down, those near the riverare engaged in dairying.",33
132,Mr FALKINER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,The same expenditure would enable you to put a farmer on the land and give him a picture show as well.,33
133,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"That is not so. I had an opportunity of seeing what the South Australian Government is doing on the river for the repatriation of its soldiers. Little communities of fifteen, twenty, or thirty soldiers are scattered along the river; and not far from Murray Bridge there is a school where seventy soldiers are being trained in irrigation methods. I have no doubt that the Murray Biver. scheme will in the future create a great productive asset for Australia.",33
134,Mr FALKINER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,I do not object to the scheme as a whole.,33
135,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"No doubf the honourable member in his speech sounded a proper note. He suggested that failures have occurred, and that it is wise, when making experiments, to study the experience of other people.",33
136,Mr GLYNN,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [12.26] - I was chairman of the Commission of engineers and lawyers appointed by the States concerned which, in 1917-18, drafted the River Murray scheme; and, so far back [256]- 2 as 1887, I personally wrote to an official of the Indian Government for reports on their irrigation methods, to assist projects which were to be carried out by the States. The Lake Victoria reservoir has been planned in the interests of the three States which are partners in the scheme. They and the Commonwealth agreed to construct reservoirs equal, or to bring the storage up, to the total capacity for irrigation of the Murray. About 600,000 acres have been provided for by the existing storage, the Waranga Basin, and the Burrinjuck Dam. It was contemplated to increase the possibilities of irrigation by the construction of new storage at Cumberoona and at Lake Victoria. At the former place, however, they found in 1915 that, although they had gone down about 197 feet, they could not strike a granite foundation. There is an apportionment of the waters of the Murray between the three States that signed the agreement, and it is felt that the construction of Lake. Victoria reservoir will help the upper States by conserving the discharges that come to South Australia.",33
137,Mr LECKIE,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,If the Upper Murray storage is not built the Lake Victoria reservoir will not operate.,33
138,Mr GLYNN,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"I think the .honourable member may rest assured that it will be built. Other storages were in contemplation, because, although the agreement actually mentioned Cumberoona as a site, it was not, as a site, actually decided upon. It was regarded at the time as the storage of the biggest capacity,' but the construction of another storage at the present site was borne in-mind as a possibility. That is the reason why Cumberoona has not been decided upon as a storage up to the present time. There has been' undoubtedly a delay in the construction of the works. It was thought that the Lake Victoria storage might be constructed within four years of the date of the agreement.",33
139,Mr JOWETT,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Will Lake Victoria hold water?,33
140,Mr GLYNN,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"It holds water at the present time in a temporary dam built by the State Government at) the cost of £5,000. I think it was held that Lake Victoria, with a depth of 13' feet, would have a discharge that would increase, without locking, the navigable period by four months.",33
141,Mr JOWETT,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Has any allowance been made for seepage?,34
142,Mr GLYNN,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Los s by both seepage and evaporation' has been taken into account. For'instance, the Waranga Basin has a surface area of about 19 square miles and an average depth of 17 feet, but seepage and evaporation mean a loss of about 7feet annually. The B u r r in j u ck scheme, on the contrary, will have a weir 240 feet high, and an average depth of 160 feet over several square miles, and, owing to the great depth, the loss by percolation and evaporation will be exceedingly small. The Lake Victoria storage will have an average depth of 13 feet, and in regard to it every possible factor was taken into consideration. tioned Waranga Basin merely as an illustration of what happens in a shallow storage.",34
143,Mr FENTON,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,There will be a greater evaporationat Lake Victoria .than at Waranga Basin.,34
144,Mr LECKIE,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,I think the evaporation at Waranga Basin is only about 3.ft. 6 in . Mr Glynn . ^ The figure I gave was for both seepage and evaporation.,34
145,Mr FALKINER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,The evaporation must vary in different climates.,34
146,Mr GLYNN,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Yes , but the figure I mentioned was the estimate given by engineers. Lake Victoria was regarded as one of the reservoirs that were essential to the apportionment of the water to the States. Therefore it must not be regarded as a special reservoir for South Australia.",34
147,Mr LECKIE,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"But it will be so if the rest of the scheme is not proceeded with . .. Mr Glynn - It will be proceeded with. It was thought that there might be some reservoirs in the Tumut River district that might add considerably - to the irrigation possibilities of the Murray, but Cumberoona and Lake Victoria were regarded as the two works that probably would be proceeded with at once and be more easily constructed. As .soon as the reservoirs are constructed, there will be absolutely no loss of water in connection with navigation. The reports of the engineers show that the. water required for irrigation will be sufficient in itself to maintain a navigable depth, because the irrigation Water will be delivered along the stream.",34
148,Mr FENTON,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Apparentl y South Australia is ' more interested in navigation than in irrigation.,34
149,Mr GLYNN,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,No matter what may be the varying interests of the States* they have arrived at an agreement on a basis recommended by the engineers a f t e r an exhaustive inquiry.,34
150,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Did the Minister say that the water used for irrigation would return to the river ?,34
151,Mr GLYNN,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"I had the good fortune to be present at nearly all the conferences, and in order to settle this question of alleged loss by irrigation the engineers were asked to prepare a special report A f t e r an interval of twelve' months they reported that the water required to maintain a.navigable depth.will not materially I haves men- affect the water available for irrigation. The engineers say that there will be no diminution of the water required for i r r i gation if locks to the number mentioned in the agreement are constructed.",34
152,Mr SAMPSON,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,That destroys the value of the locks as storages.,34
153,Mr GLYNN,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,They were never regarded as effective storages. The weirs are mot the real storages unless used for diversions.,34
154,Mr FALKINER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,It is'evident that some honourable members hawe not read the various reports - ',34
155,Mr GLYNN,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"There have been so many of them, I do not think one could find the time to read them all.  .the time the Murray Waters Agreement was made there was a' general consensus of opinion that the right thing was being done, and I am sorry that any sort of captious objection should be raised now. There are difficulties, which I "" think every honourable member should recognise, as there always are when three or four d if ferent bodies have to co-operate. The delay that has taken place in regard to the Murray Waters Agreement arises largely from the fact that three Statesaiid the Commonwealth are closely in terested in the scheme. ' That it will be f r u it f u l of enormous good in the f u t u re I am satisfied, in spite of what the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner). has said. ' The fact is that in Victoria we are just on the verge of having a sufficiency of rain, but we do, unfortunately, have droughts, and the practical result of irrigation in the northern parts of Victoria, more particularly in the electorates of Echuca and Wimmera, has been to demonstrate that by a judicious system of irrigation certain areas can be made to carry an enormous population.",34
156,Mr FALKINER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Is not the Wimmera system more for stock than for irrigation ?  bulk of the water conservation is for i r r i gation purposes, but the money written off in the first instance was largely in regard to expenditure upon works undertaken in my constituency which were recognised to be of an experimental character.

However, we cannot overlook the fact that there is a growing departmental expenditure, and n the general public will not be satisfiedi until the expenditure ceases to grow, and the Government give evidence of their determination to effect economy.

158,Mr WEST,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"East Sydney) [12.45] - I wish to make a few remarks regarding I had an of knowing something about in carrying out the Melbourne water supply, 'and also different schemes in New South Wales. - No one can foresee what expenditure will be entailed in carrying out the River Murray waters scheme. When alock or a weir is built, the first heavy rains rally show that it does not fulfil requirements, and extensive alterations have to be made. Such happenings, cannot be avoided. I do not think that departmental officers deserve the castigation that some honourable members have dealt out to them, probably more for . the purpose of getting press support than in the interests of the country. What I wish to bring particularly under the notice of the House is the need for curtailing expenditure upon Naval Bases and upon the proposed Arsenal until peace is proclaimed. Great changes have been taking place in ship construction and in the manufacture of explosives. Chemists are now producing, explosives of a much greater destructive character than were previously in use. At the time that Admiral Henderson came to Australia and drew up a scheme for our naval requirements, there was a competition between the great nations in regard to the size of Dreadnoughts; but now we find that submarines are far more destructive. As a matter of fact, the methods of naval warfare have been considerably altered. It is certainly necessary for any country to prepare against the contingency pf war. Even if the nations do resort to arbitration, it is only those Powers which will be prepared to resist encroachment who will secure the best terms. We know that in private life powerful firms secure the best terms in arbitration proceedings: and, even in industrial arbitration, if all the employees in a particular industry are in one union, they can secure terms more in keeping with their wishes. The changes brought about by the war must be a guide to our present operations. Por instance, submarines will not Tequire the dredging of channels at Naval Bases to a depth of 45 feet, and the destroyers of the future will be built more on lines of speed than on lines of size or depth. We should pause before we think of constructing Naval Bases to accommodate Dreadnoughts which may not be required. Prior to the war, no one would have imagined that we would have to fight our enemies under the seas or in the heavens. The war has taught us that submarines and aeroplanes, which cost practically nothing in comparison with the heavy expenditure that is necessary in the buildAfr. West. ing of Dreadnoughts and tiheir upkeep, gea&- have proved to be most destructive weapons. If our defence policy of the future is to consist largely in building submarines and aeroplanes, the cost of our preparation foT war is likely to be considerably reduced. But our submarines will have to be distributed along the coast in small Bases, so that they will not have to travel long distances. I have had the pleasure of inspecting a submarine. It was like the inside of a clock; it was mechanism from stem to stern. It has very little storage capacity, and it is surprising, how men can move about in one. As a progressive people we ought to have the latest and most improved methods of destruction; and we are justified in asking the Government to be careful, in view of the present changing conditions in the matter of spending money on building Naval Bases or on the purchase of machinery for munition making. The same remarks apply to the Cordite Factory and similar establishments. Chemistry has made wonderful advances during this war, and with the pleasing' knowledge that the war is slackening off, possibly leading to the submission of peace proposals, and seeing that for the next twenty years there, is little probability of a recurrence of any great conflict between the nations, it will be in the interests of this country to slow down in the expenditure on munitions and instruments of war and Naval Bases. We are spending millions of loan moneys, for which we are paying 5J peT cent. We are handing down the cost of the war to our children, and not attempting to bear our share of it. If more attention was paid to the hise of loan moneys, it would prevent a good deal of the lavish expenditure on luxuries which is now so much apparent. {The Government might seek to prevent the importation of industrial explosives in the future to enable the requirements of our mines to be made in Australia. In the meantime, I ask Ministers to listen to my reasonable request that, before they indulge in further loan expenditure on Naval Bases and on instruments of destruction, and machinery for the manufacture of munitions, they will give serious consideration to the altered conditions brought about by the war.",35
159,Unknown,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,36
160,Mr SAMPSON,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Wimmera) [2.15] I am very pleased to learn from the Minister that it is the intention of the Department to push on rapidly with the Murray River waters scheme. As has already been said during this debate, we have included in the proposed loan expenditure several items which, even if passed, might well be held in abeyance pending greater necessity being shown for the work for whioh they provide. Of all the. items in the schedule to this Bill that relating to the conservation of the waters of the Murray has certainly the greatest claim for immediate expenditure. The question of the locking of the Murray has already been threshed out in this Parliament. The States and the Commonwealth have arrived at an agreement, but unfortunately a considerable time has been occupied in discovering a suitable site at which to provide for the storage of something like 1,000,000 acrefeet of water - It might be advisable at this stage to refer briefly to the possibilities of irrigation on the Murray. That river is the greatest we have in Australia, and with its banks and valleys offers the vastest possibilities of irrigation in the Commonwealth. _ Many exaggerated statements have been made as to its potentialities in this regard, but the reports submitted by the Inter-State Commission we have a gauge of the total capacity of the river, and of what this scheme will mean in the advancement of irrigation in Australia if it be carried out in its entirety. It is, of course, impracticable to impound the whole of the Murray waters. At certain periods the floods coming down are so heavy that they cannot be dammed to their fullest extent, and necessarily large volumes of water must escape into the sea. It it were possible, however, to impound and utilize the average flow' of the catchment of the Murray we should be able to irrigate 4,500,000 acres. At the present time we have an area of something like 350,000 acres of irrigation cultivation or utilization in Australia, so that we can quickly estimate the extent to which our irrigation areas could be enlarged if the whole of the Murray waters could be harnessed and utilized. That, as I have said, is impracticable. .The scheme which has been prepared comprehends, so far as the engineers can forecast their ability to pound these waters, pretty well the ful l storage capacity that can be reached for many years to come. If we were to carry out in its entirety the Upper Murray scheme for impounding 1,000,000 acre-feet of water, and also the Lake Victoria scheme, which would impound an additional 500,000 acre-feet, we would be able to extend our irrigation areas from something like 350,000 acres to 1,500,000 acres. No part of Australia offers such facilities for the successful settlement of returned soldiers as do the irrigable areas of the Murray. The areas already under irrigation in Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales, however, are so large that it would be almost dangerous to establish any further irrigation settlements along* the river without making provision for an additional supply of water to be available during periods of drought. In these circumstances thisscheme 'becomes so urgently necessary that the Government should make every effort to push on with it. The storage works should be built as quickly as possible in order - that we may be able to settle our returned soldiers on the Murray River frontages and valleys. There is a good deal of misapprehension even in regard to the possibilities which the in Murray flatsafford for their settlement. We understand that it is practically assured that a satisfactory site' for the storage of the waters of the Upper Murray can be found, but even if the work of building that storage basin were proceeded with tomorrow several years would elapse before the 1,000,000 acrefeet of water so impounded would be available for irrigaltion purposes. It will thus be seen that, unless this scheme be expedited,.it will not be possible for some years to settle more than a ""comparatively small numbeT pf returned soldiers on the Murray flats. During this discussion it has been said. by some honourable members that irrigation in Australia has been a failure. In Mildura on the Victorian side of the Murray, and Renmark, on the South Australian side, we have two qf the most successful irrigation settlements in any part of the world. We have about 14,000 or 15,000 acres of land in the Merbein and Mildura districts, carrying a population im- of from 7,000 to 8,000 people. In other words, every two acres of land there is - supporting an individual. Even in the United States, where irrigation has been brought to the standard of scientific perfection, no better results can be shown. The same may be said of Renmark. Settle-° ments of returned soldiers have been established between Mildura and Merbein, and our returned men are also being settled in the Swan Hill , Nyah, and Cohuna districts. Returned soldiers may be placed with better hope of success on irrigation settlements that have already been established than would be possible if they were settled in separate communities. If left to themselves,- their spirit would probably be affected by their war, experiences, aud a morbid atmosphere might be created. Then, again, in many instances they would not have had the experience necessary to success. I hold that we should settle them on areas adjacent to successful irrigation districts, where they would be able to obtainthe advice and assistance of experienced men. I have no desire to labour this question. I propose only to urge upon the Government the absolute necessity of pushing on with all possible speed the construction of these storages. Under the presidency . of the Minister, I believe many meetings have been held, and that the urgency of the work is being emphasized by him. I should like the honourable gentleman to further investigate the possibility, of extending the storage capacity of this scheme by utilizing the lakes, depressions and swamps adjacent to the Murray itself. Having Tegard to the"" limited .quantity of wateT available in this, the greatest river in Australia, we should utilize every possible means of storage in order that its waters may be conserved for irrigation purposes during the dry periods of the year. ""We have depressions and lakes lying close to the river on the New South Wales, South Australian, and Victorian sides, and the Government should consider how far the storage capacity of the head works on the Murray and at Lake Victoria could be extended by filling the swamps and depressions adjacent to the stream. I hope 'that the Minister will regard this as one of the mast important matters of his administration, and that he will lose no time in pushing on with the work, which is easily the most far-reaching of any enterprise that could be undertaken in the CommonMr Sampson. wealth at the present time. It does not affect only one State, and I am not speaking in the interest of any one State of the Union. The Burrinjuck scheme promises to provide for a large population, and this, together with many settlements in the Goulburn Valley and also on the South Australian side of the Murray, has proved what can be done by means of irrigation in Australia. We ought to congratulate ourselves on the fact that, after forty years of disagreement and conflict, as between the States, the Commonwealth Government have succeeded in bringing about a satisfactory settlement in regard to this all-important question, which will mean an extension of irrigation to the extent of 1,250,000 acres within the three States I have mentioned. It involves an expenditure of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 which, judiciously spent, would mean doubling the present agricultural production in those States. Seeing that some of the irrigation areas are sufficiently successful to enable 2 acres to support one person, honourable members can see what an enormous increase of population and rural production, and what a stupendous increase of wealth, will be made possible in the most successful portions of the irrigated area. I should like an assurance from the Minister, as chairman of the Board, that all the resources of his Department will be utilized to enable the work to be carried out as speedily as possible, not only for the sake of the production of wealth in Australia, but in order that our returned soldiers may find along the Murray valleys,- adjacent to existing successful settlements, great areas on which they may settle and prosper.",37
161,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"And it is most important to arrive at a decision, because plenty of people holding land near the Murray are not making any improvements.",38
162,Mr SAMPSON,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"That is quite correct. Even if the work is started at once, it will be some years before it can be completed. But it might be possible for the Minister, on the advice of his engineers, to push on, for instance, with a portion of the Upper Murray works as well as the Lake Victoria scheme, wkich would - not require the same length of time for completion as the scheme at the head waters of the Murray. They could thus make water available much sooner than by the ordinary processes of development and construction - under the Department at normal times. I trust the Minister will be able to give, us a further assurance that he will carry on the work as rapidly as possible in order that we may be able to make use of this - great wealth which has been too long neglected, and which will mean such a certain increase in the necessary production of the Commonwealth.",38
163,Mr MATHEWS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Melbourne Ports) [2.30'] - We are scarcely any further advanced with this scheme than when I made my first appearance in this Chamber twelve years ago. We were promised at that time that this great question would be considered, although the States had not come to a definite agreement on it . There was a good deal of talk at the time about the riparian rights of the States, but that difficulty seems to have been got over.",39
164,Mr SAMPSON,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,It is got over only during the currency of this scheme. have to come up again at a later date.,39
165,Mr MATHEWS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"My chief regret is - that the whole scheme has been protracted. We have never had anything really definite about the claims of the different States regarding their riparian rights. On one occasion New South Wales claimed both banks of the Murray, and even the flow from the Victorian rivers into it , so far as regarded that part of the Murray which abuts on New South Wales and Victoria. I am not aware that the "" M a "" - State was so impertinent as to demand any rights over that portion of the Murray which flows through South Australia, but its claims at that time had much to do with delaying the'settlement of the problem. When  definite promise here as to the amount that would be paid by the Commonwealth, I felt that the matter was settled at last. Although a city man, I quite appreciate the necessity for locking the Murray for any irrigation scheme that may be promulgated by any of the States, but the whole business has been in the air so long that the people whose lands abut on the Murray, landthat will be taken over or submerged, are not willing to spend any money in improvements. There was a similar case in Victoria when what was known as the Trawool scheme on the Upper Goulburn was proposed. of property in the township of Yea, a fairsized place, would not nail a paling up on a fence, or put a lock on a door, or a new pane in a window, because they expected the scheme to be. gone on with at an early date. Consequently, Yea retrogressed so much that it has never recovered the position it held' when the Trawool scheme was first mooted. I hope similar results will not follow this scheme, but I am afraid they will , because no comprehensive undertaking has been placed before us, and even the Board of Control has not been properly settled. Two years ago I heard the names of certain gentlemen mentioned for the position of chairman, but I have heard nothing since. What is the use of continually having on our Estimates sums for the Murray water scheme unless something effective is done? Neither of the Ministers associated with this question has told us anything definite. One may appealto them for a definite statement, but I suppose the result would be just as big a blank as the past history It will of this project shows. There are honourable members who represent those por : tions of Victoria abutting on the Murray. There are, for instance, the honourable member for Indi (Mr Leckie), the honourable member for Echuca (Mr . Palmer), and the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson), gentlemen who, perhaps, are quite competent to deal with the question so far as their own particular constituencies are concerned. This, however, is not a question 6f divisions, and not merely - a Victorian, but an Australian, question, on which the House ought to be better informed than it is. If We carry our mind's eye right along the Murray, through Indi to Echuca, down to the border of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, we can conceive enormous advantages that might accrue to New South Wales and Victoria at certain points - Further, we can conceive that some towns might benefit by such a scheme while others would be in jured. The difficulty is that we do not know whether anything is to be done, or exactly what the Government are now doing; and I am rather surprised that the gentlemen I have mentioned, who are experts, have not placed their views before the House and debated the proposal more strongly. I have been waiting for some time to hear, for instance, the honOwners orable member for Echuca give us the advantage of the knowledge he has doubtless garnered during the many years he has represented that part of the State, and endeavour to explain to us the position.  on the subject for nearly an hour and half.",39
166,Mr MATHEWS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"If the honourable member's words were as convincing on the Murray question as they are on general questions, I do not wonder at their having little effect; but my plaint is that we have not heard from him often enough on this particular subwith ject.

The Federal Government promised a cerrigation tain amount of money in order to carry this big scheme into effect, and some action by the Government is neceessary to prevent the whole project lapsing. parently, the Government are not insistin' ing on the States carrying out their part, and I suppose this arises from the old plea of the necessity for economy in war time. But it is just as foolish as most cries of the kind. exact This is .supposed to be a - strong Government with strong supporters, and the project should be proceeded with uta terly irrespective of what the Age, the Argus, or any other newspaper may say. Are the Government afraid of the news- papers-afrai d of the claptrap that has been appearing during the last few weeks ' alleging enormous and unwarrantable excompenditure, and demanding - economy ?

I do not regard this scheme fro m a provincial stand-point; I look upon it as. providing one of the finest opportunities for the repatriation of our soldiers. gestions for sending returned men to the Northern Territory and to other out-back places have been made; but the conservation of the water - of the M u r r ay will provide good opportunities for placing men on the land. Although the scheme has been in existence for three years, little has been done. That is proved by the fact that only about £9,000 has been expended on it . I hope that, as a result of the speeches that have been made today, the Minister will urge the three Governments concerned to push on with -' the necessary work as quickly as possible. There are several items in regard to which I wish for explanations. I wish to know the justification for the acquirements of land at Fairy Meadow, New South Wales, for the establishment of cement works. This National Government is not committed to all the Socialistic scheme's of the Administration which preceded it , yet it has ""paid £3,000 for an option on an iron mine.

We bave promised that, while the war continues, we shall not attempt to take from Labour anything that it has won; but a National Government, supported by Labour and Liberal members, should not enter into new Socialistic schemes, although it may be compelled to carry on enterprises initiated before it took office. It is the connection of Governments with so many industries that is causing most of the industrial trouble which tends to drive capital out of the country, capital being a shy bird which is apt to fly away very quickly. Should any large amount of capital be withdrawn from Australia, those who vote for the members of the present Opposition will be the first to feel the bad effects that will follow. Revelations that have been made to me concerning the brickworks at Canberra convince me that a Government cannot carry oh business enterprises so satisfactorily as private persons can.",42

It was pror posed that the line should go through a of pastoral - properties, and the people interested offered a guarantee of 10 per cenfe on the outlay for the next seven years, which was all that the Department asked for, and also to cart the material to where it would be required. There has, so far, been no answer from the Department approving the application. In another district, where £250,000 has been spent on a railway to open up the country,. the Post and Telegraph Department has refused to spend a few thousand pounds to establish a telephone line along the railway.. When we ask people to go out into the back blocks, we should try to secure to them some of the advantages of civilization which are enjoyed by the residents of ""the more 'thickly populated centres. I have no hesitation in saying that if the post and telegraph systems of the 'States had not been handed over to the Commonwealth, the State authorities would have made far better provision for people in remote districts than has been made by the Commonwealth Government.'. ""No one desires that there should be unnecessary expenditure at the present time; but if money is to be found for the telephone system, it would be better expended in giving facilities to people in the bush than in laying conduits in . the big cities. I happen to be chairman of the Public Works Committee, and I wish to direct attention,' not only to the action of the Government in preventing the reference of works to that Committee which should be referred to it in accordance with the Public Works Committee Act, but also to the action of the Postmaster-General in dividing a work into two sections, with the object of avoiding an inquiry into it by the Public Works Committee. large sum of money is shown on the Estimates for alterations at the General Post Office, and a further sum is set down for alterations in connection with the telegraph office. It is idle for the Postmaster-General to suggest that this expenditure is not required for one work. The division of the work is merely a subterfuge, to enable the Postmaster General to evade the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act. A Minister of the Crown should be the first to see-that the provisions of an Act of Parliament are carried out in their entirety. If the Public Works Committee Act is not a good measure, it is the duty of the Government to immediately amend or repeal it. I understand that the Postmaster-General contends that the alterations referred to involve technical work, which gentlemen n it possessing technical knowledge arc not able to' deal with. It would appear, hoveveT, that the honourable gentleman is himself able to de;il with it, and perhaps from his recent literary efforts we may judge whether he possesses the technical knowledge required. Although inquiries by the Public Works Committee involve a certain amount of expense, and sometimes a good deal of trouble to officials of the Government Departments, there is not the slightest doubt that the work of that Committee has resulted in the-saving of an enormous sum of money to the people of Australia. The members of the Committee have been able to expose some very wasteful expenditure in connection with many publicworks. The Governor General in Council has exempted from inquiry by the Committee all works for water supply and water storage in connection with naval works. I am unable to understand why watersupply required for naval works should be exempt from inquiry by the Public Works Committee. In Western Australia it has been proposed to bring water from Wungong. Creek for 20 miles to the Henderson Naval. Base; and how any inquiry into that proposal could be of advantage to the enemy, it is impossible to conceive. There has been a large expenditure in the building of barracks at the Flinders Naval Base, and the members of the Public Works Committee were able to show that brickwork carried out there by A the Government cost,, for labour alone, over £15 per rod. I have not the slightest doubt that a contractor could have got the same work done for from £7 10s. to £8 per sod. I find that the Naval Stores buildings, and a long list of. other works, are to be exempted from reference to the Public Works Committee; and I repeat that the Public Works Committee Act . should be repealed, or its provisions should not be evaded by subterfuge. To show honourable members the way in which big savings have been effected by the recommendations of Committees, I may say that a few years ago the Wood P'owellising Commission was appointed, of which I was chairman. That Commission recommended to the Government that the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway should be laid with 8-ft. instead of 9-ft. sleepers, as proposed by the Department. As a compromise, and only, I think, as a compromise, a great portion of the line was laid with 8-ft. 6-in. sleepers. The New South ""Wales railways were originally laid with 9-ft. sleepers, but today they are all laid with 8-ft. sleepers. The economy that would have resulted from the laying, of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway with 8-ft. sleepers, ratheT than with 9-ft. sleepers would have been enormous, because, in addition to the saving on the sleepers, there would have been saved the cost of 1 foot of ballast throughout the 1,000 miles of that railway. The alteration from ©-ft. to 8-ft. 6-in. sleepers saved an enormous expenditure on the sleepers, and will save 6 inches of ballast throughout the greater portion of the length of that railway. That is a Tesult of the recommendation of the Powellising Commission. One result of the labours of the Public Works Committee is that officials of the Works Department show far greater care in making recommendations to Ministers than they did previous to the appointment of the Conunittee. I am satisfied that the work of that Committee has saved the Commonwealth an enormous amount of money up to the present time.",42
192,Mr FENTON,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Why exempt military and naval works from reference to the Committee? There need be no secrecy about them.,44
193,Mr GREGORY,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Every time we have had anything to do with the Defence Department, and more particularly in connection with Arsenal, it has been suggested that' it is essential that no outside, person should know anything of what is being done. The whole world knows that we are building an Arsenal, and it is preposterous to say that we should not make public how many men are being employed on the job, lest the enemy should know what our proposals are. No doubt when the Arsenal is in operation there will be certain processes which should be kept secret. But it is absurd to say that there is any need for secrecy in regard to the' general lay-out of the Arsenal, the ex- penditure upon the work, and the number of men employed. I have found that the Defence Department has very much less regard for the expenditure of money than have other Departments. The Defence Department does not care what a job costs, so ""long as it gets what it wants and its officers can proceed at their own sweet will. More light should be thrown on the undertakings of the Defence Department than has been possible in the past. On the other hand, there are certain Government undertakings that ought to be kept secret. For instance, information in regard to the dredging of approaches to Naval Bases should not ""be made public, and I do not think that any Committee would inquire into confidential work of that kind. But, generally speaking, there is no necessity for secrecy. I contend that the investigations by the Public Works Committee have resulted in a saving of many tens of thousands of pounds, and I do not think it is right that a Minister qf the Crown should try to evade the Public Works Committee Act, - or' that the Government should, by exempting certain works, prevent that examination which, in connection with other projects, has proved so beneficial.",44
194,Mr WEBSTER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Gwydir-Postmaste r General) [3.17] - The statement niade by the honourable member for Dampier in regard to the evasion of the Public Works Committee Act is not in accordance with the facts. The two propositions to which he referred are separate and distinct. One is nearing completion; the other is not yet started, and may not be carried out. Therefore, it is not true that the two proposals are related or the mutually dependent. The allegation that there has been an attempt to evade the requirements of the Public Works Committee Act is not justified. My desire to improve the intolerable conditions that have prevailed for so long in connection with the Melbourne General Post Office urged me to adopt acourse which would give relief at the earliest possible moment. It is that course of which the honourable member has complained. Reference has been made to the amount required for conduits, and questions have been asked as to whether that amount will provide for the connection of new services during the year. It will not. Included in the amount of £220,000 are two sums of £64,000 and £66,000, which are required to pay for contracts already let. Some of the material has already arrived, and the remainder of it is expected to be shipped at any time. Unfortunately the initial placing of the orders was unduly delayed, and the war has further hindered the delivery of the material. The Department urgently requires new cables, not for the purpose of installing new services, but to relieve congested aerial lines which are in such a condition as to make it impossible for any new wires to be laid. Thus honourable members will see that £130,000 isrequired for those two contracts. A further sum of £42-,000 is needed to lay the cables and complete the conduit work. The conduits and the labour necessary to install the cable on hand, and that which will be recovered when the new cable is laid, will cost £44,000. When we lay new cables of a larger size we are able to lift smaller cables that are no longer capable of giving the necessary service in - their present position, and to relay them in some other system. Where undergrounding takes place, the aerial lines will be dismantled, and will be used to give relief in other places. In no case will any of this work enable the Department to give one more connection, but we shall be able to give a more perfect service than is possible with the present congestion. Therefore, . this expenditure is urgent in order to keep the Department up to date and to provide the public with a decent service for the money they are paying. The amount necessary for new services is already included in the general amount on the Estimates, and that is for services which have been already approved. We have many applications on hand, and they are causing considerable worry to me and the Department, because we have not the material necessary to grant services as liberally as we should like to do. The business of the Department increased last year by 10 per cent., and it is necessary that a service of this kind should be catered for, not only to serve the public, but also to strengthen the revenue, and give to the Department the return which it is entitled to expect. I offer this explanation in order to remove from the minds of honourable members any impression that the sum included in this Bill is to provide for new services. It is merely for the improvement of services on existing lines.",44
195,Mr FOWLER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Perth) [3.23] - The allocation of so much money as is provided in this Bill for public works would, even in normal times, justify a much more careful inspection than the items appear likely to receive today. The fact that these various amounts are passing with so little observation by the Committee indicates the extent of the demoralization that has overtaken this Parliament, and the unusual control that is being exercised by the Ministry over members generally. But seeing that we are now in a very serious financial position, and that the war has practically altered our entire outlook for many years to come, it is the duty of Parliament to scan the proposed expenditure with much more care than we are giving these proposals at the present time. . I do hot believe there is any necessity for a panio, and I do not want to see a wholesale slaughter of public works, but I would like to make a distinction, and would say that, while works which are reproductive and immediately necessary ought to be carried out, other undertakings which are not urgently necessary, and are not of a reproductive character, should not be proceeded with. The money proposed to be spent on them could very well be allocated to much more necessary purposes. We have large sums set aside for Naval Bases, the most important of which is the Henderson Base in my own State. Perhaps I am rather foolish in my own interests if I suggest that such work going on there could very well be curtailed, but while it may be necessary to continue that work I want to feel assured that we are getting 20s. worth for every £ 1 we spend. I am not sure-in fact, I am certain-that such has not been the case in the past; and I am not sure that that is the position at the present time.",45
196,Mr MAXWELL,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,How could you secure that?,45
197,Mr FOWLER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Perhaps I can give an illustration ofwhat I mean.,45
198,Mr WATKINS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Do you not think that the Westernport Base works could be stopped altogether?,45
199,Mr FOWLER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"I am speaking of the Henderson Base,, and perhaps I shall ticular refer to the other Bases before I close. ing Before the war the Henderson Base work was urged upou the Commonwealth Gowas vernment by the Imperial authorities as being urgent. The"" Imperial officers knew-as some of us did not know, but surmised-that war was inevitable with a few years, and so they urged the concharge struction of the Bases in order more effecready tively to meet the threatened danger. But the war' has actually taken place, and the naval and military situation at Rosyth?-Yes . has been so altered that we would be wise-and perhaps the Imperial - authorities would advise this coursei f these works were slackened for a little tion while, or until, at all events, we knew precisely how the money could be spent to the best advantage. As far as the magazines. Henderson Base is concerned, expenditure has been going on for a considerable time, and the representatives of that State have been frequently warned from reofficer sponsible quarters that there were no neers definite plans that the men employed ferent there were simply muddling along, gineer wasting time and money, and that, as matter of fact, a great deal of the work was absolutely useless. I was told this, not once, but many times. I began wonder what was wrong; so on one occapared sion when the Joint Committee on Public Accounts held an inquiry in connection with' the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, when it was our duty to' call before us qualifications were. the then Director of Naval Works, I deavoured to find out whether the Direcas tor was in any degree responsible for this state of affairs which had been so frehad quently reported to me. When, thereperience. fore, he came before the Committee, went to some trouble to discover what his credentials and experiences were, and propose now to read to the Committee It reads as follows:some questions which I put to him,, together with the answers which he gaveWhat position did you hold at Rosyth?- I was one of the engineers in charge of a section. What particular section were you in charge of?-Not only one section, but several sections. I was on the Base proper in connection arsenal matters, but I was only there a few months. I think I was there nine months', when my health broke down. . What particular sections were you in charge of?-The work there was commencing, and I , in due course. was appointed as one of the engineers,' and sent for from Bermuda, from the West Indies, to take up work at Rosyth. That is what I want to know-wha t parwork were you in charge of at Rosyth? - When I was at Rosyth,- engineers were comin from all places, sent for in reference to taking up work there, and, as I have said, I only there a short time, when, owing to the climate, my health broke down. I came away from a hot climate to a cold climate, and was invalided from Rosyth. I will ask you again, Mr Fanstone, what in particular section - or sections were you in of at Rosyth ?- I had, as I have alsaid, taken up several things there in a general way. I was on the Base proper, and connected with the explosive magazines. Were you in a position of any responsibility What was it?-In connection with the designs and preparing for the work. In connection with the designs, what posiofresponsibility did you hold in connection with the designs?-The responsibility of my own work in connection with the designs-designin g for the Base and for the Had you any men working under you?- I would like to explain that the system operating at Rosyth was the system that is going on at ray own Bases. It is this: I have an in charge, who has a number of engion his staff. They are in charge of difsections. I have, for instance, one enin Western Australia on marine and a data work. That data work is supplied to other engineers for preparing designs, and we are working on these designs in Melbourne to here today: In each case the work is prefor you, and you go on with your work. What I have read does not give honourable members anything more than an impression of the efforts made to get this and man to say what his experiences, and He hummed and enhawed; he hesitated, and he evaded; and honourable members will see, at the finish he had not stated what position he held at Rosyth, and what,was his exThis induced me to ask for the file in connection with his appointment.

HERBERT FANSTONE.  man is on a bed of sickness. rate, .he is not in the Service now. Mr FOWLER;- I am treating this a public matter. The individual not concern me in the least. I am speaki ing of Mr Fanstone's appointment as Director of ""Naval Works. I hope that is understood. I did not know the man until he came before me as a witness.  ""honourable member serve?",46
200,Mr FOWLER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"I am pointing out how money i as been wasted in the past, the necessity for a change in administrabeen tion in. the future, and that some meu who have been to a large extent responand sible for this waste of money and for muddling in this DepaTtment are still there. Sir ""ROBERT BEST - Mr Fanstone is not there now.",47
201,Mr FOWLER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"But who is responsible for his appointment.? However, I wish to get on with the point that I was - endeavouring to make. This is the letter in which he accepted the appointment :Wear Admiral Sir William,In compliance with your wishes, and directed by the Naval Secretary by wire, pointing me your Naval Director of Works from them. the 1st proximo, I be"" to thank you most ""heartily, and also the Naval Board, for the honour conferred and the. interest taken, and also to assure you of my great ambition to serve yourself aiid the Naval Board faithfully, worthy of the Naval profession.

It is most incredible that an illiterate fool of this character, who could not produce a single testimonial in the whole of ' the series to show that he held positions of any responsibility was appointed by those who were entrusted with the.responsibility of administering the Department.",47
202,Mr MAXWEIX,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Who appointed him?,47
203,Mr FOWLER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"He was appointed by oue member of the Naval Board. The rest of the Naval Board endorsed the appointment, and the Minister approved it. But any one with threepennyworth of common sense who looked at this ""man's .[257] this own letters, and the recommendations he At any had sent in, would have realized at once that he was a humbug, and totally unas fitted for the position to which he was does appointed. The result, as I say, is :shown n the way in which the work was carried - on under his .control. There was no plan:; - there was no scheme laid down when he was in charge. On the 18th May, 1.913,, the Henderson Base was opened by the then .Minister with a great deal of eclat during an election campaign, when we were given to understand that everything was going on beautifully. It has since ascertained by a Committee of this House that even then no definite scheme no plans existed upon which the men the were working, and that it was merely a piece of political acting to meet the outcry of the public. I come now to the Westernport Naval Base. Any one who goes round there and looks at the character of the work ""in progress will wonder what on earth it all means. WesternpOTt is a magnificent sheet of deep water, but the site selected f OT the Base is away up at the - end of a wretched billabong, almost - a .gutter at low Brisbane, 17th July, 1911. water, and the particular spot selected for the buildings is opposite a muddy flat, as which will have to be dredged out entirely apbefore even a rowing-boat can go up to",47
204,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,It will provide plenty of work in Victoria.,47
205,Mr FOWLER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Undoubtedl y it will provide a great deal of work. They might as well have put the buildings in a paddock2 miles back from the shore, and brought the water up to them, in the style of Robinson Crusoe, when he was trying to float his first canoe. At Westernport the same wholesale waste of money has been going on; there is the same lack of plans, lack of system, and lack of supervision. In this respect I want to speak of an incident that took place there. Anacquaintance of mine, a practical man well known to many of the workmen employed at the Base, paid a visit to it during the old regime, when work was supposed to be going ahead in boom style. He walked around and came to the place where men were taking out a very nice slope. He could not ascertain why they were doing it. To this day no one .knows why that excavation was made by which well-formed ground sloping gently to the water was transferred into a muddy flat, the whole of which will have to be covered by some road-making material before it can be made use of. He stood looking at the men for some time, and then walked up,to a couple of them and said, "" Hullo, you are having a good time here."" One of them replied, "" Oh, yes; not too bad."" Looking about him he then remarked, "" I wonder what this will cost per cubic yard?"" One of the men stuck his shovel in the ground, and looking towards his mate, asked, "" Bill , what do you think it will cost per cubic yard?"" Bill looked up and said, "" I don't know what it will cost per cubic yard, but I should say it would run into a bob a b shovelful."" That was the sort of thing which went on, not only at Westernport, but elsewhere, in connection with the money which the country has to find for so-called Naval Bases. How much it will cost to make a Naval Base at Westernport at the site selected God only knows. But the best thing we can do is to cut the losses absolutely, and to make over the buildings there either for a lunatic asylum or some similar purpose. I was one of those honourable members who at first thought that we were justified in building a Federal Capital somewhere in virgin country which would provide this Parliament with a worthy habitation for all the hundreds of years that we hope Australia will keep her head above the threatening waves of the outside world. But the position which has been created by the war is so serious that the only course open to this Parliament is to leave the Federal Capital severely alone for another fifty years at least.",47
206,Mr HECTOE LAMOND,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Kee p this Parliament under the influence of Victoria for another fifty years?,48
207,Mr FOWLER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"If we go to Canberra we shall merely be under the influence of Sydney instead of the influence of Melbourne. The present Federal Capital site should never - have been selected. It was the result of intrigue, and of certain State influences that were brought to bear. Canberra is a cold, bleak place in the winter, and it is as hot anywhere else in the summer. Its water supply is deficient-certainl y it is not what it ought to be in the case of a big city. Mr HECTOB. LAMOND - It s water supply is equal to the water supplies of Sydney and Melbourne combined.",48
208,Mr FOWLER,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"I know perfectly well that we can get a water supply in the dead heart of Australia if we are prepared to pay the price for it . There are : other sites immensely superior in that regard to the one which has been selected for the Federal Capital. But, altogether apart from that consideration, we are not justified at the present time in continuing to spend money there, and I am prepared to give a vote in the direction of putting an end to that expenditure indefinitely. In conclusion, let me repeat that I regret very much that the Government do not appear to be seized of the gravity of our financial position. In the near future we shall have to cut much closer to the. bone than the Government are doing. We need to realise that the money we are spending upon these projects is not our own, and is more urgently required by the States than it is by the Commonwealth. For some years to come we shall have to carry a very serious burden in regard to the Statefinancesas well as our own. That is a responsibility which we must face. As a Commonwealth it is our duty to see that the States are successfully tided over the strenuous period which is before us - We can only tax with safety up to a certain point, and already we have very nearly reached that point. If we are going to rise to the occasion, we must have a more definite lead from the Government in regard to the necessity for a drastic curtailment of public works and rigid economy in every Commonwealth Department.",48
209,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Capricornia) [3.51] - I desire to make a few observations concerning our expenditure upon Naval Bases. I recollect that, some two or three years before the outbreak of war, Admiral Percy Scott drew attention to the fact that the submarine was likely to prove a very important weapon in Naval warfare. In this connection, I recollect a story which he told of an incident which occurred at a big naval review. He was in charge of a submarine squadron, one as is of the vessels of which dived beneath a Dreadnought, and after diving back again,' signalled to its leader, "" Have sunk a Dreadnought."" Immediately the reply came back, "" Y o u be damned!"" That circumstance evidences the attitude of the Admiralty towards the submarine arm of the service. But the war has proved to us all what an extraordinary powerful weapon is the submarine, and in my opinion, we ought to suspend work at our Naval Bases and devote the money we are spending there to the building of submarines and aircraft. We have to recollect that the Admiralt y which urged that bur Naval Bases should be proceeded with is the same Admiralt y which made the reply to Admiral Scott that I have quoted. In this Bill provision is made for the expenditure of £340,000 upon Naval Bases, Works, Establishments, &c. Now our Naval Bases are to be built for the purpose of harboring Dreadnoughts.",48
210,Mr FINLAYSON,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,No ; the member is entirely wrong.,49
211,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"I do not believe that we shall require round our coast anytning like the number of Dreadnoughts, cruisers, and destroyers that some honourable members appear to think. We should be spending our money more wisely if we put it into the construction of submarines and aircraft. I doubt the wisdom of spending large sums of money upon an Arsenal. Regarding the railway which it is proposed to construct in the Northern Territory, I think that our financial necessities will make it imperative",49
212,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,To what railway is the honourable member referring ?,49
213,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"To the Pine Creek to Katherine River railway. much obliged to the Minister for Works and Railways for his interjection, because I remember that in speaking uuon the Murray waters question he .distinctly stated that the taxpayers of this country would not have to pay-- ",49
214,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"I did not say anything of the kind. I said that the money required for those works would not come out of revenue, but out of loan funds",49
215,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,Does the honourable gentleman think it right to lead the taxpayers to believe that no burden will be cast upon them because this expenditure is to come out of loan funds?,49
216,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"I did not say anything of the kind, nor did I imply it .",49
217,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,I think Hansard will show that .the honourable gentleman did make a statement to that effect. [257]- 2,49
218,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,The honourable member could not have heard me as clearly as. he usually does.,49
219,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"If c appears to be the policy of the Government to borrow huge sums of money, and to trust to posterity T to repay them. When the Government representing the great Australian Labour party were in office, we constructed oufc of revenue many of the public works for which provision is now being made out of loan account. If the requisite revenue was not forthcoming, the works had to remain in abeyance. I am surprised at the Assistant Minister for the Navy (Mr . Poynton) and the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) proposing to provide for so many public works out of loan money. We have been told that the object which ' the Allies set oufc to attain by this war honourable was the establishment of a league of nations and the bringing about of a general disarmament. If we do not secure those results I shall consider the war has been fruitless. We were led by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and other patriotic and belligerent gentlemen to believe that fchis was a war for the freedom of the world, and the freedom of the world can be secured only by the establishment of a league of nations to enforce peace upon swashbuckling little States and peoples who will insist upon going to war. The league of nations is, in fact, to "" police "" the world. Since we have in Australia, as in every other civilized portion of the globe, a police system which has taken the place of the bid method of settling individual disI am very putes with a waddy, it seems to me to be quite reasonable that the civilized nations of the earth should join together to police the world and fco enforce peace upon it. If that happens, as it ought to do, what necessity will there be for these vast defence preparations which the Australian Government are making? If a league of nations is established-if Germany is disarmed and has to do away with its Navy - it ought to be unnecessary for us to spend large sums on Naval Bases. If Britain , France, It a l y , the TJnited States of America, Germany, Austria, and Russia were fco decide to maintain a joint navy to police the seas and to keep the uncivilized peoples in order, they would not require a navy much larger than that of Britain , and the contributions made by each individual to its maintenance would be only a few shillings per annum). But our honourable friends opposite, who have been talking of the. f ormation of a league of nations to secure the freedom of the world, apparently do not believe that such a thing is possible. They could' never have believed it possible, although they pretended' that the war was for that purpose-, since they come down today with a long list of defence works' involving an expenditure of millions, and the Minister in charge of the measure says that the taxpayers, need not be disturbed because no charge will be. made upon them in respect of such works, inasmuch as-- we are going to raise the. money by loan. The honourable gentleman has not told the people, as they will soonfind out after the war, that they have to pay the interest on these - loan moneys. Our interest bill, as the Minister ought to know, is rapidly growing. He has been so much occupied in trying tokeep his party together, and to bring about peace and harmony in the Ministerial Caucus meetings that he, perhaps, has not gone intothematter.  the honourable member need not worry about them.",49
220,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"They must behaimonious, although the honourable member for  ber"" for Dampier (Mr Gregory), and the honourable member for Indi (Mr Leckie) have shown much independence. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr.. Archibald) has. disclosed the ""actual, state of affairs in; the Liberal Caucus. He has said, "" I have had! experience of two Caucuses*-tli e one is heaven, the other ishell."" The Liberal Caucusis as heavento him. The policy of the Win-the-war party appears to be tosaddle posterity with a huge burden of debt,, and I object to a great deal of the expenditure included in the schedule on that account. Our interest bill will' be nearly £15,000,000 per annum merely for war expenditure, very shortly. The income tax is to beincreased by 30 per cent.., and the estimated receipt from-, that source is? £9,000,000. The Government loses sight of the very important fact that we are spending: probably £50,000,000 of loan money every year: All the business peopleare making'money. You pay, I undercompanies stand,. £3. or £4 fbr a pair of lady's boots, offices. and anything: from nine: up to fourteenguineas for a sac suit.

A man says, "" I do not mind"" paying the extra income tax,, because I am making a lot of money/"" but the business people are making these' huge sums owing to the expenditure of large war loans./- It is a dreadful ad<mission on-the part of the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) to say , that as. this expenditure is all coming, out of loan money the taxpayer need not bother. When the. war loans stop the income oifi the people will be lowered', and how then will we be able to. meet, the huge interest bill? I do not contemplate with any pleasure the prospect of tha Government borrowing money to pay interest on the war debt, following the example of the unfortunate State of Westfern Australia, which cannot meet ita growing, deficit.. The London office has cost over £800,000; and £25,000 is included in this schedule to be spent on it. I presume ' it is in the Prime Minister's Department, and possibly the Acting. Prime Minister (Mr Watt) is of the same opinionas the Minister for Works and Railways, that the taxpayers need not bother; as it is all to come out of loan. ",50
221,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"The honourable member 1 will find words to that effect in Hansard. The Minister has denied it,, and .parliamentary courtesy demands that I should accept his denial; .but I am inr clined to think my rendering represents the general policy of the Government. We were informed by cable recently that a carpet weighing, one ton had been bought for the Prime Minister's room in the London Office. The Commonwealth ought to have a suitable building in London furnished inkeeping with our prestige. This is a great Commonwealth,, and we ought to have a good buildingartistically furnished.",50
222,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"Londo n is a city in which that kind of thing counts.  there work, invery dingy",50
223,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"What a dingy place the Bank of England isi Mr HIOTOB IiAMOiro - If you are Bank of England, you can do as you like.",51
224,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"That brings me to the object of the London Office. The Bank of ""England does an immense business, and is practically the national bank of the United Kingdom, but it carries on its work in a one-storied building that is the reverse of impressive. One is more impressed hy the officer in uniform inside. His apparel is nearly as gorgeous as that worn by the Knights of the Garter. The object of the London Office is to house our representative. What is be in London for? I imagine that he ought to combine business with a certain amount of social distinction. ""What business is being done by the London Office? The honourable member for Illawarra deems it necessary to have a large building for the purpose, presumably, of advertising Australia, bringing'business to us, and bringing immigrants here. I would, remind him that there is a Bill before the British Parliament to restrict emigration. The British Government are going to take power to stop any man, if the necessities of man-power demand it, from leaving the United Kingdom, and our Agents-General have protested against the terms of that measure. Mr ""WATT.,-Do you propose to allow us to get this Bill through in time, to tet the South Australian members catch their trains?",51
225,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,I do not know that I shall have another opportunity.,51
226,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,There are the general Estimates.,51
227,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"I am afraid they will be treated as urgent under the guillotine standing order. The Acting Prime Minister has been very nice and courteous to this side. This is such a change that it impresses us very favourably, but I am reminded of what was said by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) and the honourable member, for Dampier (Mr Gregory). Tne honourable member for Perth was justified in calling attention' tQ' the fact that very little attention was being paid* to the vast sums which it was proposed to expend. Although I do not remember the honourable member's words so well as I rememthe ber the words of the Minister for Works and Bailways (Mr Groom) as to the taxpayers not .bothering ahout this expenditure, because it is. all coining out of loan, I think he suggested there is an irresponsibility on the part of members of this House that is deplorable. Eor the Treasurer te appeal to me to discontinue my remarks on the expenditure of some £2,000,000 by way of loan, on the ground that two or three members desire te go 'away to Adelaide, seems to prove everything that the honourable member for Perth has suggested. I would condone a political offence of a very serious character if I gave way on sueh a- I have-evory desire to be polite-flims y pretext. ""What is the matter with the Federal Parliament is that, owing to the narrow view which some electors take, it is demanded of South Australian representatives that they shall live in Adelaide all the year,. and not stay in Melbourne longer than is absolutely necessary. The same happens in relation to honourable members from New South Wales. If one of these desires, to move his residence. to Melbourne it is resented by the electors, and the poor fellow is compelled to leave for Sydney every Friday, and return to Melbourne in the early part of the week.",51
228,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"'Pu t the Capital -' in a genial climate, and that will not occur.",51
229,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"The result is that Commonwealth public affairs are perforce neglected by a large number of members, and I shall be doing a good service if, as a result of. these few remarks, South Australian members are compelled to stay here over the week-end and spend their time in examining, the items in the sehedule. As to the suggestion of the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr.. Hector Lamond) that the Capital should be plaeed in. a genial climate, so that members might be induced to live there, I am of opinion that the site at Canberra, at least in the summer time, issuch a place. I do not agree with the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) in his criticism of the Capital. It is deplorable that honourable members have so short-sighted a view as to shut down on the' expenditure there,, whereas there ought to be a business-like method of developing the Territory, and carrying out the terms of the Constitution. ""We know very well that the press in Victoria has an extraordinary influence on the people. The Melbourne Age has a good deal of beneficial influence, I admit, and I am prepared, with my friend the honourable member for Melbourne (Br. Maloney), to accord my due ""meed ef praise "" .to that organ. The Argus, too, has an influence, hut it is ' Mr Tunon - Vile !",51
230,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"I shall not use that expression, hut say that its influence is not conducive to good legislation. We ought to he in an atmosphere where the Age and Argus will have their proportion of Federal influence, and no more.",52
231,The CHAIRMAN,CONTROL OP NAVALWATERS,"The honourable member's time has expired. Progress, reported. NA BILL (No. 2). Bill returnod from the Senate without amendment. ADJOURNMENT. CUSTOMS HOUSES: OVEBSTAJTIKG. Motion (hy Mr Watt) proposed. That the House do now adjourn.  the Acting.

In the Customs House, Queensland, there are men practically doing nothing-kickin g their heels around, and drawing their screws-whe n they could be usefully employed in other Departments where there is work for them.",52
