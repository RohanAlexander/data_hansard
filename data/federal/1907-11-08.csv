3,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The remark is reported in-both of. the Melbourne morning - newspapers, arid is as follows :- They opened the meetings of the House with prayer, but at the same time some members might sneer and other members might be irreverent whilst the Lord's Prayer was being said' in unison. '/ I desire to know, Mr Speaker, whether you have noticed any lack of reverence of devotion during the reading of the opening prayer, or whether, in your opinion, every honourable member here is not quite as devotional ' as the unctuous, member for Echuca""? '",14
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I may say that 1 noticed the report in the newspaper this morning, and came to the conclusion that the honourable member for Echuca must have been misrepresented in some way. Ir* my opinion, the conduct of every member of the House has, on every occasion, during the reading of prayers, been characterized by the utmost reverence.  explanation ? I did not hear the whole of what has been read by the honourable member for Barrier, and I ' have not read - the newspaper report; but I certainly had no intention whatever of reflecting on any member of the House. I have been caref u l in what I have said-mor e careful than the Honourable member who accuses me and describes me as "" unctuous."" It is just pos-' sible that there may be some members who regard the. prayer in the way which has stated.; but there is no reflection or insinuation whatever in the words I used* referred to just the mere possibility that the some honourable members might so regard the prayer. at PROHIBITED CORRESPONDENCE, NEW ZEALAND.",14

6,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Lang directed my attention to this matter some three months ago;-and I immediately placed myself in communication with the New Zealand' Government, and with the Crown Law officers of the Commonwealth. I learnt that the New Zealand Act gives infinitelv greater powers than does the Commonwealth Act, and that the New Zealand Government are enabled to do what I have no power to do. whole matter .is receiving consideration, but I may say that before I can take similar steps to those taken in New Zealand, an amendment of the Postal Act will be necessary.

11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Hume-Trea surer) [11.10] - I move That a sum not exceeding Seven hundred and eighty-seven thousand four hundred and ninetysix pounds be granted to His Majesty for or towards defraying the services of the year ending 30th June, 1908. When having this Supply Bill prepared, I gave instructions that no debatable items should be included; and, so far as has been reported to me, I do not think there are in the schedule any items of such a The character. One item, namely, the payment of £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 to the Government of New South Wales, ought, I think, to be especially referred to. That amount has been owing to the New South Wales Government for two or three years, or, perhaps, longer, and I thought it wise, see that the Premier of New South Wales was asking for payment, that I should meet the liability without further delay.",15
12,Sir JOHN FORREST,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,That money was,15
13,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"The honourable member is mistaken. - Sir JOHN FORREST - I paid it once, at anv rate. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - That was not period this £ 2 5 , 0 0 0.",15
14,Sir JOHN FORREST,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,The matter settled by Mr 'Carruthers and myself.,16
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,I can assure the honourable member that I paid the monev myself only the other day. The honourable member knows to what the payment refers.,16
16,Sir JOHN FORREST,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Quite so. SIT WILLIAM LYNE - I was informed by the Under Secretary that the New South Wales Government desired that the money should be paid; and, therefore, I paid it out of the Treasurer's advance. Another item in the schedule is in order to recoup the Treasurer's advance by £ 5 0 , 0 0 0. Until the Estimates are passed I have to use the advance account in order to carry out certain works; but I have been' very careful not to make any expenditure yet to be voted by Parliament, unless under very exceptional circumstances. having been made, the account must be recouped.",16
17,Mr REID,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"For what period is Supply tiskcd ? ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - For two more months. I had an idea of asking for Supply for three months, but I thought it better to wait until we were nearer Christmas in order to see whether there was any necessity for an extended period. shall then be in a better position to know the state ofpublic business; and, if it be necessary, I do not think any objection will be raised to Supply being then granted for one month.",16
18,Mr REID,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"East Sydney) [ 1 1 . 1 4 ] have looked through the schedule of the Bill , and I see no item in it of an unusual character, except that of £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 referred to by the Treasurer. what that payment is for? - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - It is the amount of money which was in the Savings Bank of New South Wales at the commencement of Federation. The honourable member for Swan, as ex-Treasurer, knows all about the matter.",16
19,Sir JOHN FORREST,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"The money owing, I know. .'. Mr Reid - Unde r the very unusual circumstances we are placed in at present, with the Tariff to consider, I admit that the Government had no other course but that of obtaining Supply instead of proceeding with the Estimates; and I think there will be no difficulty in passing this Bill. But two months is the longest for which any Administration ought to ask for Supply. was Sir WILLIAM LYNE - This Bill will carry us on to the 14th January.",16
20,Mr REID,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Unde r any circumstances I do not think that Supply ought to be granted for a longer period than two months. The honourable member for Langpoints out to me that there is an item of £ 1 3 5 , 0 0 0 under the heading of miscellaneous services. Will the Treasurer explain that amount ?",16
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Parramatta) [11.15]--Before this Supply is voted I think that the Government should give us some indication of the political outlook so far as the business of the session is concerned. We appear to be drifting along without any definite plan of operations, and it has occurred to me that we might very well lighten the labours of each branch of the Legislature by a little conAdvances sideration. Why, for instance, cannot the Senate be closed"" when Supply has been granted, for say a couple of months, while this House completes its consideration of the Tariff? Why not allow honourable senators to return to their homes to look after their own private affairs ? Then, when we have dealt with the Tariff, why should not honourable members be given a holiday ? We cannot do all the work We attaching to Federation in a day or a year. The time is fast approaching when something will have to be done to curtail the duration of our Federal sessions. It is becoming impossible for honourable members to attend here and to do anything - l besides, and especially does this remark apply to representatives of distant States. I suggest that honourable senators might very well be allowed to return to May I ask their homes whilst we complete our consideration of the Tariff, and that subsequently we should be granted a holiday whilst the Senate is dealing with the Tariff Bill. That course might be adopted without in any way seriously impeding the legislative work of the session. But if the Government continue to pile up measures was in the Senate we shall be able to do nothing with them when they are sent down to us. I submit that something ought to be done to meet the wishes of honourable members of both Chambers in this way. The suggestion which I have thrown out is a feasible one, and one the adoption of which would afford relief. At any rate something must be done to shorten the term during which honourable members-and particularly those who come from distant Statesare obliged to remain in Melbourne. Otherwise we shall have to settle down here to a sort of political perpetual motion, and that I do not think would be good for the country. Certainly it would not conduce to good government. Administration is just as important as is legislation- a great deal more so, in fact. If we had better administration we could do without very much of the legislation that we are called upon to enact. No Government can attend to its administrative functions properly at the same time that its members are called upon to attend here week after week and month after month during two-thirds of the year, or longer. The suggestion which I have made, would, if acted upon, be in the best interests of the country. With regard to Supply, I would call attention to the immense amount that we are asked to vote under the heading of "" Contingencies."" If honourable members will look through the schedule they will find that no less a sum than £ 1 3 5 , 0 0 0 is sought to be appropriated under that heading.",16
22,Mr WATSON,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"But in the Estimates Chief nearly all these contingencies are itemized. Mr. JOSEPH COOK:- I think that the honourable member will find that there a very large number of items which are specifically set out even upon the Estimates in Chief. Take one or two departments by way of illustration. Under subdivision 1 of the Department of External Affairs we are asked to vote £ 7 0 0 by way salaries, and £ 1 , 1 0 0 by way of continis gencies.",17
23,Sir JOHN FORREST,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,The money is sought to be appropriated for contingencies is allocated upon the Estimates Chief.,17
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,Under what heading ?,17
25,Mr WATSON,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,If the honourable member will look at page 8 of the Estimates in Chief he will find that the contingencies are specifically set out there.,17
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"-Then it is a pity that there is no marginal note ference to the matter upon these Estimates. I do not think that we can strongly upon the state of the finances being made clear and intelligible to - orable members. Out of £ 7 8 7 , 0 0 0 that we are now asked to vote, no less a sum than £135,000 is grouped under the heading of contingencies.",17
27,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,We have followed the plan which has been previously adopted.,17
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Surely it would be sufficient to have one group of contingencies in the Department instead of a score. My remark is particularly applicable to the Defence Department. There we are frequently called upon to vote £ 1 0 0 by way of salaries, and £ 2 0 0 or £ 3 0 0 by way of contingencies. We ought not to vote money blindly in that way. There is just one other matter to which I desire to direct the attention of the Minister of Defence. I have a very serious complaint to make against the Department over which he presides. It seems to me that a certain action by that Department' amounts to nothing more nor less than a piece of gross favouritism. For three months I have been patiently waiting to see justice done to a man, and perhaps I had better wait a little longer. The Minister told me the other day that the case was being looked into.",17
29,Mr WATSON,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,To what case does the honourable member refer?,17
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"I prefer not to in mention the name of the individual here, but I have no objection to giving the honourable member the information privately. It seems to me that a grave injustice has are been inflicted upon a man who has done not as much for the credit of the Australian forces as has any individual in those forces. To-day he is suffering disabilities, both in rank and pay-and , indeed, in every other way-for no reason whatof ever. I am not sure, however, that there not a reason, and that that reason is not that he is a simple clerk instead of a man which with, money and social prestige.",17
31,Mr FISHER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,No more serious charge in than that could be made.,17
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"When the time comes I shall be prepared to lay all the facts of the case before this Chamber. The case is an old one, but it has only just come to an issue. It has reference to the appointment of an officer to a rank which the authorities could not deny him. But although they have given him the rank and in rethe position nominally they have denied to him what has beengranted to officers insist too with far less service.",17
33,Mr FISHER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,The place to ventilate a honmatter of that sort is in this Parliament ,17
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"The place to ventilate it is where it can be ventilated to the best advantage. I have not yet lost faith in the ability of the Minister of Defence to deal with it , and in view of his statement the other day I prefer to trust him a little longer..",17
35,Mr DEAKIN,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [11.28] - Every honourable member of both Houses of Parliament must realise the truth of the statement made by the honourable member for Parramatta, that under present circumstances our sessions of Parliament are unduly prolonged, and info an extremely inconvenient time of the year. It is highly desirable, both in the interests of administration and of honourable members who desire to return to their homes so that they may place themselves in touch with their constituents, that the abnormal length of sessions should be curtailed, and that in some way or other the legislative business of the country should be transacted in a less number of months and close at a more convenient time of the year. If u l ly admit that. To restore a more healthy condition of things should be the aim of all sections of the House.",18
36,Mr THOMAS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Coul d not we adopt the practice - of appointing Grand Committees, as is done by the House of Commons?",18
37,Mr DEAKIN,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Thoug h far from being unfavorable to the appointment of Grand Committees, I have yet to learn that their appointment has much expedited business in Great Britain, where the Legislature is in a chronic condition of overwork.",18
38,Mr WATSON,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,But the British Parliament has more work to do than we have.,18
39,Mr DEAKIN,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"That is true. But whilst recognising the force of the remarks of the deputy leader of the Opposition we must recollect that we are still in the constructive Federal period. At the present moment we are dealing with the most complicated, the most arduous, and the most burdensome task which can await any Legislative Assembly, that of reviewing the whole of our commercial and industrial conditions. In our only previous experience of a similar kind, we were compelled, with very great reluctance, but in obedience to the necessity for concluding a state of commercial unrest, to allow a session to overflow. The same obligation rests upon us at the present time. Then the Tariff has to be supplemented by certain measures to which the deputy leader of the Opposition has referred. These must be disposed of before we can think of concluding the session. I take it that in making his suggestion the honourable member has some knowledge of the wishes of honourable members in another place, and shall endeavour to learn from my colleagues in that Chamber if there is a means of arranging the business to meet their convenience.",18
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,I have not spoken to honourable members of another place in regard to the matter.,18
41,Mr DEAKIN,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"I thought that perhapssome of them had spoken on the subject to the honourable member. If we can, without retarding legislation, so readjust our business as to meet the wishes of honourable members elsewhere, we should endeavour to do so. I am satisfied to take the suggestion made by the honourable member for Parramatta as the starting-point for fresh inquiries.",18
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,I am thinking about this House as - well as the Senate.,18
43,Mr DEAKIN,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Q u it e so. Having entered upon the work of the second session of this Parliament, and desiring to leave a complete and satisfactory record, we must look to some extension of the ordinary adjournment or some readjustment of the next session as perhaps the best way of counterbalancing the excessive demands which will be made upon us during the present one.",18
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,It seems to me that we are going to be here all next year.,18
45,Mr DEAKIN,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"If I could secure the permanent assistance of the honourable member in his capacity as deputy leader of the Opposition, we might avoid such a contingency.",18
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,The trouble is that the Government wish to do everything at once.,18
47,Mr DEAKIN,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"We are usually content, after a short discussion, to take a vote on any question, and, I think the honourable member will admit, to accept in the meekest possible spirit even a temporary reverse or two. Mr FISHER .(Wide Bay) [11.34] - I am sure that we are all pleased with the ideals of the honourable member for Parramatta and the Prime Minister; but in dealing with public questions we have to consider not ideals but facts. We can never look forward to very short sessions of the Federal Parliament. We have two Houses elected on the broadest possible franchise, and are entering upon a class of legislation which is out of the old groove. No homiletic arguments as to what we ought to do will have any effect on the - views Of the people with regard to the pledges that we made at the last general - election. Honourable members are paid in order that the work of the country may be tion. transacted. We come here, not to look - after our own private business, but to charge the legislative duties set us by the electors.",18
48,Mr JOHNSON,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,They do not expect to sit all the year round.,19
49,Mr FISHER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,The honourable member stances. .does a great deal to keep us in session .the year round.,19
50,Mr JOHNSON,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"I do not think that is a fair statement. In connection the consideration of the Tariff, I have proposed amendment after amendment jwithout making a speech.",19
51,Mr FISHER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,I can only say that honourable member takes the fullest advanless tage of his rights and privileges understanding orders.,19

54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,I believe that rhe f last time the honourable member spoke took the Opposition to task for remaining silent ,19
55,Mr FISHER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"I do not think said that the Opposition promised, threatened, and cajoled the Ministry, and that this case. - we were in doubt as to whether the Ministry were the Opposition or the Opposifor tion were the Ministry. That difficulty has not been entirely removed.",19
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,The Ministry are the Labour Party.,19
57,Mr FISHER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"In any event, we sure to have fairly long sessions. It .said that we have now only one important question before us. But each session bring with it questions of far-reaching ""portance. We are niow entering upon social legislation, to which in ademocratic Parliamentthere can be no end. ",19
58,Mr DEAKIN,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"We have now before three big questions-the fiscal, the and the social question ",19
59,Mr FISHER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"The Tariff Question ,'may be divided into three parts. We have . first of all the Tariff proper, then the question of the new protection, and, finally, the question of preference sider. . Even the mother of Parliaments l-would take a considerable time to deal any one of those questions, and .we may be sure there will be further subdivisions of the Tariff as we proceed with its consideraWhilst I am entirely in agreement - with those who desire short sessions, I am disforced to the conclusion that there is no hope of that desire being fulfilled, and it is just as well for us to settle down to the us discharge of the duties devolving upon us, and to do the best we can in the circumThe charge made by the honall orable member for Parramatta that a capable officer who rendered distinguished serthat vice as a member of the Defence Forces with has been treated far less favourably than have others who do not possess the same attainments, and cannot show the same service, is one of the most serious that the could be made against a Department'. Unan absolute injustice can be shown to the have taken place, such matters should not be discussed in the Parliament; but I understood the honourable member for Parramatta to say that he considered an absolute injustice had been suffered by Cases against the DepartI may ment have, before this, been proved, and I feel strongly that if the Defence authorities endeavour to assimilate the governing - powers of older military and naval bodies, he and to shunt men merelv because they have no social position, the guns of the Parliament should be turned upon them, and they so. I should be done away with.",19
60,Mr DEAKIN,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,That is not the issue in,19
61,Mr FISHER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"The honourable member Parramatta said that he understood that the officer's failure to secure advancement was due to want of social influence, or because he was merely a clerk. If anything of the kind is taking place in - the are Department, I would at once remove all is the officers responsible for it. No greater injustice could be done to a man. In a will democratic country and a democratic Parimliament we cain recognise only merit, and I hope that the Ministry will take notice of this very serious charge. Since the honourable member for Parramatta is an old us Parliamentarian, I was surprised to find defence, him following the line adopted by the honourable member for Indi in regard to - the voting of contingencies. I have never known a full schedule of contingencies' to we have be attached to a temporary Supply Bill, but I think it is desirable that ""the Minto conister responsible for such a Bill 'should cause to be prepared, but not necessarily with printed, a schedule to be laid on the table of the House, so that honourable members '.would be able to ascertain exactly - details of the proposed vote for contingencies. That is the only safe way to congested duct the financial operations of a country. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Then why is the honourable member surprised at my suggestfact ing that it should be done ? - Mr FISHER - The honourable member may have made such a suggestion, but did not hear him do so.",19

The government of a country cost cannot safely be carried on unless the whole of its financial transactions are put before Parliament with the fullest detail, so that honourable members may at any. time exveyance amine them. On these grounds I am entirely with the honourable member; but at the. same time. I recognise that, best possible intentions, honourable members may sometimes mislead the people by very typical instance. attacking a vote for contingencies. Such attacks leave on the public mind an imber pression that contingencies are expended in an underhand direction. It would be better, as I have said, to publish the whole of the items, so that the public might know that the administration was perfectly straightforward and honest, and that public exchequer was being properly proitems tected.",20

The Estimates ""contingencies."" cover all the items of contingencies dealt with in this Supply Bill, and under Audit Act not one penny voted by way contingencies can be applied to any other than that shown by the respective all the headings in the Supply Bill.",20

The honourable I ' member referred to subdivision No. 2 of Division No. 1 of the Department of External Affairs, and if he will turn to the Estimates he will find the whole of the items set forth.

But if the honourable member will refer to the Estimates, he will find' every item of expenditure on contingencies there set out in detail, so that it can be readily identified and checked. If the Treasurer and the other Ministers were empowered to spend this large amount as they pleased, the situation would lie very! serioufe; but, under the system of bookkeeping fixed by Sir George Turner, contingencies are held to cover all expenditure other than salaries, and the sum so spent must be in accordance with the appropriations of Parliament. In the Estimates the contingency expenditure is itemized in every subdivision. for instance, subdivision 2 of division 44, which deals with the contingency expendithat ture of the Department - of Trade Customs in the State of Western Australia. Nearly £ 4 , 0 0 0 is there set down for expenditure under contingencies, but each item of expenditure is given; so age and telegrams, printing, bank exchange, travelling, stores, fuel and light.

After the site is fixed, some time must elapse before the factory can be erected and the plant installed, and, therefore, I urge expedition 'in the matter. I think that Parliament is prepared to give Ministers the fullest assistance, and I acknowledge that the Minister of Defence has shown some appreciation of the local requirements; but I wish everything to be done to get the factory into working order at the earliest moment possible, to provide for the better protection of Australia, Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - - Should the Take, factory be located in Federal territory?",21

Strangely enough, the claim which was so strongly opposed has since been admitted, while nothing has been done in regard to the case about which honourable members were sympathetic.",22

92,Mr WATSON,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Colone l Bayly was stricken down when but a young man, as the result of exposure on service, and had not time to make provision for his family. Therefore, I urge that something be done for him. Mr HENRY WILLIS [ - 5 7 ] - - I have added up the amounts IT set down under the heading ""contingencies,"" and find that they total £ 1 2 4 , 0 0 0 . If we pass this Bill we shall, although the proposals for expenditure will be again reviewed when the Estimates are under consideration, have to agree to them because the money will have been spent. As has been pointed out, the contingency expenditure is . itemized in the Estimates, but once we vote Supply, we shall not be able to control it. In one case in the Estimates, in which £ 9 , 0 0 0 is set down I under the heading ""contingencies,"" ten sub-heads of expenditure are enumerated, and the particular sums to be expended under each set out separately, whereas, in this Bill , we are passing a lump sum, which may all be spent under any one of the ten heads, thus anticipating the decision of Parliament in regard to the Estimates. This is not a business-like way of proceeding. Parliament would certainly have more control of expenditure if it gave Supply for one month instead of two. The honourable member for Wide Bay had something to say about Parliament sitting from January to December. No doubt, if the Government brought forward a programme containing sufficient work for such a long session, Parliament would keep on sitting; but, as a matter of fact, Parliament does not sit perpetually. The honourable member for Wide Bay apparently desires Parliament to be in session all the year.",22
93,Mr FISHER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,I said nothing of the kind.,22
94,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"The honourable member was opposing the idea thrown out by the Prime Minister that our sessions ought to be shortened, and pointed out that there was social legislation in regard Bayly to which the will of the people must be obeyed. The honourable member indicated that, in order to carry out this legislation, it is necessary for us to sit from January until December.",22
95,Mr FISHER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,No ; what I said was that we ought to carry out the promises with . we made when elected.,22
96,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"But there must be some common sense in the management of public affairs, and the practice of Parliaments from time immemorial has been to pass the most important and urgent legislation, leaving other measures to be dealt with in subsequent sessions. Much of the domestic legislation referred to has (Robertson) not been put into operation, as. witness the Australian Industries Preservation Act, which, for all the good it has done, might never have been passed into law. I hope the Government will act on the suggestion thrown out by the Prime Minister, and confine the sessions to fewer months in the year, when much of the legislation which, would be passed if there were perpetual sessions would, as the result of experiments elsewhere, be shown to be unnecessary. The question of compensation to military officers has again come up for consideration. Colonel Tom Price was given a grant by the Government, and Parliament was called upon to ratify the Executive act in order that the Government might keep faith. The Government, after counting heads, I suppose, came to the conclusion that Colonel Tom Price was entitled to some .compensation, though I may saythat was not my opinion when the question was before us on the last occasion. Colonel Bayly fought in South Africa, and there, in consequence of exposure, developed a disease which was disastrous in its results. In the case of a man who takes his part in the defence of the Empire, and who, when on active service, becomes incapacitated, we are only doing our duty when we see that he is provided for.",22

99,Mr THOMAS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"That may be; but, another man. nevertheless, the Public Service Commissioner has only done justice. I might gest that officers in those districts, who married and have families, ought to rejustice; ceive a larger allowance than do single men. Some of us, who belong to the Labour or Democratic Party, find fault basis of promotion. with private employers who express themthat selves as having no concern as to whether their employees be married or single. _ Walpole was denounced for making a statement to that effect on behalf of National League, and Mr Teasdale new Smith, of the timber combine in Western Australia, was condemned rather energetically for taking a similar view, and contendarrive ing that all the duty of the employer simply to pay a certain amount for certain work done. Under the circumstances, would be somewhat inconsistent if we to show similar indifference towards the . Government. public servants; and, therefore, I trust the Minister will see his way clear to make some extra allowance to married men in the back blocks. Such a step would not only be good from the point of view of population, but it might be the means of inducing the older and more experienced men to give their services in outlying districts. I also suggest that men, who have been in these country districts for, say, four or five years, should have the right of transfer to some other part of the Commonwealth. It is somewhat unfair that men should be asked to remain in the back-blocks for, it may be, sixteen years.",23
100,Mr FISHER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,I suppose the honourable member means that there should be the right of transfer to any part of the Commonwealth.,23
101,Mr THOMAS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,Yes ; I'think it is time we should cease to be provincial. In this connection I regret to hear of the objection to an official being brought from. Queensland to undertake duties in the Melbourne Post Office-a n objection raised simply because the man comes from Queensland.,23

We must see that merit, and not mere seniority, is the An/other point is, there ought to be some definite arrangement by which officers, when they Mr are transferred from Sydney, or anv other of the capita] cities to country districts, the shall at once take up the duties of their positions. A Post Office official in Syd.ney was,- in September, 1905, gazetted as .postmaster at Wilcannia, but he did not at that place until January, 1907. I is doubt very much whether he would have arrived there then, had it not been that, it when electioneering, I heard of the matter, were and brought it under the attention of the The correspondence, both telegrams and letters, which I received in connection with this case, was simply marvellous. I was told that the man was ill , and, again, that the Sydney Post Office could not afford to spare him, and so for t h ; however, he arrived, as I say, in January, 1907. Such officers should promptly take up their positions in the interests of those already in the back blocks, who would be afforded the advantage of immediate transfer. I have known officers refused transfer, but subsequently granted it on offering to pay the cost of their own removal. I do not think that that is a fair proceeding. If it is right that a man should be transferred, his expenses ought to be paid, and if it is not right that he should be transferred, he ought to remain where he is. It would be satisfactory to public servants to know that, after having served for a number of years in the back-blocks, they have the right of transfer to some more desirable part of the Commonwealth. The post-office at Broken Hill is still considerably undermanned. One or two appointments have been made during the past few months, but I understand that quite a number of the officials are working over nine hours a day; and, as there are no relieving officers, it is impossible for the men concerned to have a holiday for even one day in the week. The mail arrives in Broken Hill on Sundaymorning, and that, of oourse,, involves a delivery on every day of the week.",23
106,Mr MAUGER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,Is there a Sunday delivery in Broken Hill ?,24
107,Mr THOMAS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"The postmen do not go round the city, but persons who desire to do so may get their letters at the post office. A number of people there have objected to this Sunday delivery, but the Department refuses to alter the practice. However, in view of the interjection by the Postmaster General, I think that we may hope to see this Sunday duty abolished. I shall be very glad if the Minister would look into the matter. I do not think that the officials at head-quarters have any conception of the additional amount of work which is being transacted by the principal office at Broken Hill . During the past few years, that centre has progressed considerably from the stand-point of population, and the departmental authorities do not ap- - District. pear to have treated the office there with the consideration that it merited.

108,Mr MAUGER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,That work is in hand now.,24
109,Mr THOMAS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,I am very glad to hear it. Will it be completed this year?,24
110,Mr MAUGER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,We are now waiting so that we may be able to present a balance sheet in connection with the valuation of the buildings.,24
111,Mr THOMAS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,That information will be of very great assistance to honourable members. I think also that some information should be obtained in regard to the telephonic exchange at Broken Hill .,24
112,Mr MAUGER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,I intend to visit that centre during the Christmas adjournment.,24
113,Mr THOMAS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,I am very pleased to hear the Postmaster-General make that statement. There was a time when there were six inspectors employed by the Postal Department in New South Waies.,24
114,Mr MAUGER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,We have arranged to increase the number of inspectors.,24
115,Mr THOMAS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"All these inspectors resided in Sydney. Upon several occasions I brought the matter before the House, because I desired that for inspectional purposes New South Wales should be divided into districts. That was eventually done, and I was hopeful that one of the inspectors would have been permanently located in the Western District of that State. But after the subdivision had taken place, I found that the inspector for Broken Hill and Wilcannia was resident at Wagga Wagga, and that the inspector for White Cliffs was located at Orange. Now, I do think that the Department ought to have some knowledge of the geography of the Commonwealth. It is ridiculous to compel nn inspector-if his services should be required at White Cliffs-to travel all the way from Orange, and to require the inspector, who resides at Wagga Wagga to travel all the way to Wilcannia. Only a little while ago I desired to secure an alteration in the mail service between White Cliffs and Wilcannia, and I found that the matter quired the services of two inspectors. I trust that the districts will be so rearranged that at least one of the inspectors will be permanently located in the Western",24
116,Mr WILKS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Dalley) [12.21] - Honor able members are deeply engaged in conversation, Mr MCDonald, and, since no one is disposed at thfs moment to address any remarks to me, "" I propose to converse briefly with you. Threemonths ago when a Supply Bill was presented to this House, the Government promised that they would not bring forward another similar measure during the current session. They urged as an excuse for this slovenly method of doing business that they desired the Tariff debate to proceed without interruption, at the same time admitting that the passing of Supply Bills involves the surrender by honourable members of effective control over the finances. Personally, I should have been prepared as a protest against the slip-shod manner in which the Ministry, are conducting the business of the country to limit to one month the Supply for which they have asked. If we pass this Supply Bill we shall have voted half the Supply for the current financial year, and consequently when the Estimates in chief come under review we shall not be in a position to exercise any effective control over them. Only yesterday several honourable members charged the Government with maladministration in connection with the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. If those honourable members are dissatisfied with the administration of the Government they cannot take any stronger action than to refuse the Supply which is now asked for, or to reduce the period which it is intended to cover. Had anybody submitted an amendment in that direction I should have most warmly supported it. But, of course, it is idle to fire blank cartridges at the Treasurer. Some time ago that honourable gentleman promised that at the earliest possible moment he would introduce a Bill embodying the new protection proposals of the Government. I admit that the subject is a complicated one, but I think that ere this he should at least have presented honourable members with a rough memorandum of the intentions of the Government in this connection. By so doing he would have expedited the consideration of the Tariff. As one who desires to see the operatives engaged in various industries obtain a fair share of the plunder, I should be more disposed to look favourably upon high protective duties if that information, disclosing, an effective scheme, had been supplied to us. There are many honourable members who are strenuously fighting the Tariff, but who might not do so if they were acquainted with the. nature of the new protection proposals of the Government. The honourable member for South Sydney has attempted to excuse the appropriation of such a large _ sum under the heading of ""contingencies."" As the honourable member for Parramatta has poirted out, if the amount which we are now asked to expend under this heading be continued in the same ratio throughout the year, it will total no less a sum than £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0. I ask honourable members to give this matter their serious attention. It is useless for the Treasurer to tell me that I can identify items included in the proposed vote for ""Contingencies,"" since, as the Bill stands, I am unable to move the reduction or omission of any of them. I come now to the question of defence. The Treasurer has always been an ardent protectionist, and his enthusiasm for the cause, when he is out of office, is even greater than it - is when he is in power. As a member of the present Administration, he has been a warm supporter of the policy of encouraging local industries, and I ami pleased that he has caused an order for the construction of a steam trawler to be placed with the New South Wales Government shipbuilding works at Cockatoo Island. I am glad, not merely because many of my constituents are employed at the works, but because I recognise that an opportunity will be afforded the public to see what can be done in the way of shipbuilding under Government supervision. I trust that the administrative officers, as well as the workers employed in the shipbuilding yards at Cockatoo Island, will be put upon their mettle, and that they will turn out a vessel that will be so excellent an advertisement of the capacity of the Government works as to cause the Commonwealth, as well as the States Governments, to place further orders with them. The Government contemplate the construction of several torpedo-boat destroyers and submersibles for coastal defence purposes, and if they find that the State shipbuilding works at Cockatoo Island can construct a trawler equally as well as can private shipbuilding firmsand at a price that is wholly satisfactory --- I am sure that they will consider the desirableness of having our defence vessels built there. Some people say that we cannot construct warships in Australia. I do not share that view. I .do not think that the mere transfer of an artisan from a British to an Australian shipbuilding yard has any prejudicial effect upon his ability. Australians are blessed with the imitative faculty. They are quick to acquire any art, and there is no reason why they should not excel in the work of shipbuilding. I hope that the Treasurer will urge the men at the Cockatoo Island works to do their very best in connection with the construction of the Commonwealth trawler.",24
117,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,I have done so.,26
118,Mr WILKS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"If the honourable member would occasionally visit the works and encourage the men to do their best, I am sure that good results would follow.",26
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,The member is always after Cockatoo Island.,26
120,Mr WILKS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"I said at the last general election that since I found that every honourable member was prepared to do a bit for his own electorate, I intended to take up the same attitude.",26
121,Mr MATHEWS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,Does not the able member think that the Mort's Dock Engineering Company ought to have been able to construct the trawler? good dockyards in my own electorate.,26
122,Mr WILKS,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"H a d the tender been secured by that company, many of the men in the Cockatoo Island works would have been employed in the construction of the vessel. I regret that the company was not sufficiently enterprising to obtain the contract; but I hope that the placing of this order with the Government works at Cockatoo Island is the first step towards the establishment of a great ship-building industry in Australia. The industry gives employment to a good class of men, and as we desire to have in Australia a sturdy class of iron workers and engineers, it ought to receive every encouragement. Reference has been made to the widow and family of the late Colonel Bayly. honourable member for South Sydney made out a good case for consideration. I had the pleasure of being acquainted with Colonel Bayly for many years, and have no hesitation in saying that he was not a most industrious officer but the best instructional officer of his time in New Wales. _ Many of the officers who today do credit to the military forces of Australia received their early instruction at his He was a man of highly nervous temperatainly ment, but was certainly a splendid instruci tional officer. It was in that capacity he excelled, and his widow and family ought certainly to be considered. Colonel Price received from the Government comthe pensation for an accident which betell but his case will not bear comparison that of the late Colonel Bayly and his family. When the question was last under consideration a broader issue was at stake. The question of what compensation should be granted, not only to Colonel Bayly, but to Colonel Price, and the non-commissioned officers and rankers who had been alreadj incapacitated while on active service in South Africa was then under consideration. I hold that the widow and family of a non-commissioned officer or a man in the ranks who was killed during that war or the family of any non-commissioned officer or honourable ranker who was permanently incapacitated whilst on active service deserve, if anything even more consideration than do the widow and family of the late Colonel Bayly, since they are likely to be in a position of greater need, and I hope the Government will take their cases into serious considerahonortion. I am sorry that in connection with this Bill a really genuine attack has not been made upon the Government. When the last There are Supply Bill was before us I urged that they should be attacked by honourable members, wliOj like myself, have strong Radical tendencies, and who disapprove of their faulty administration of the harvester legislation. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports yesterday dealt vigorously with that question, but it is useless for an honourable member to protest unless his words are followed by action. I should like to see a majority voting against the Government on this Bill , and should be prepared to vote against them as a protest against the slovenly way in which they have carried out their duties. In the general conduct of business we should be an exemplar to other Parliaments. The honourable member for Robertson spoke of this The Parliament sitting all the year round; I am concerned, not so much with the duration of our sittings, as with the quality of the work carried out.",26

It is idle, as some of the Socialists did at last election, to say to the workershim, "" On the morrow your paradise will come,"" with if we do not make some effort to bring about that change. We can do but little, T but I hope that our work, whatever it may be, will be effective. If we rush measuresthrough Parliament simply to put up a placard as to the achievements of a session we shall probably find ourselves in the next session busily engaged in passing amending Bills. Every one has his little dreams, and when I entered the Federal Parliament I cherished the fond hope that, so far as human skill would allow, the Commonwealth legislation would be perfect, or, at any rate, would not need amendment until after the lapse of years. fortunately, however, we too have the marks of the beast upon us, and our legislation, like that of the States Parliaments, seems to be invariably faulty.",26

133,Mr EWING,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"-I have looked into the matter, and have ascertained that, in at least one case, that was not so.

Un- That, however, was not done. In three cases, on the recommendation of Major General Sir Edward Hutton, they were recognised, but I was not aware of those cases until the honourable member for Parramatta brought the whole question under my'notice, and I cannot see that there was special ground for exceptional treatment in regard to them. Since then, however, diffinot culty has arisen by reason of the fact that, while some of those who were promoted and received honorary rank, have since qualified by passing examinations for ? higher rank, others have not done so. I am aware that the Defence Act empowers the Minister to promote, without examination, for distinguished service, marked ability, or gallantry, and the officer whose case the honourable member for Parramatta has urged is a man in. regard to whom this power should be exercised, if brought into operation at all.

151,Mr SPENCE,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Darling) [ i . o ] - I desire to say a word or two in support of the reto marks made by the honourable member for t . Barrier in reference to the allowance to officials who are stationed in the back blocks. When a man is sent to these outlying districts he seems to be forgotten by In some cases these .officials are so fa r away all centres of population that when they get their annual leave it is not worthwhile taking advantage of it , seeing that all the whole of the time would be occupied layin travelling from and to the scene of their labours. I have presented the case of these officers to successive Deputy Postmastersby General in Sydney, and have urged that when vacancies occur in more desirable portions of the Commonwealth they should, is other things being equal, be given the predeference. These men do not ask to be brought right into the big centres of population, but merely to be stationed nearer coast, where the climatic and other conditions are more genial. All the not Deputy Postmasters-General, and also the Public Service Commissioner, agreed with the view I presented; but I can say, from my own personal knowledge, that the debe sired reform has not been carried out. I in have ascertained on inquiry that the great objection to the transfer of men from' out t back districts, in the case of any vacancy occurring nearer the coast, is on the score of expense; but I think that in this connection the difficulty is exaggerated. It is unfair to deny an officer the chance of transfer simply because he happens to be stationed",28
152,Mr CHANTER,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,In many cases officers are willing to pay the expense of their own,28
153,Mr SPENCE,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"But officers ought not to be permitted to pay the expense of their removal. I myself know cases in which offiwho, although with alarge family they had a small salary, have,-for various reasons, offered to pay the expense of their transfer. Some officers so situated have, on score of health, to .send their wives and children to more favoured localities; and it is here that I think our humanitarian ought to operate. It ought to be remembered that there are only a limited number of officers in the back-blocks, who are of the grade to qualify for transfer, and therefore mirrimize the cost of removal. In any case, justice is more important than money. If officers in the back-blocks have given satisfactory service, and possess the necessary qualifications, they ought to receive justice in the way of transfer. The way in which many men have been kept in the outlying districts for years is heart breaking. In the old days, before the appointment of the Public Service Commissioner, there were refusals on the part of officers to go into the back country; but, of course, under the law now, there is power to enforce transfer. No reasonable man would complain of being sent to the back-blocks if the term of service there were limited to say three years; on the contrary, I think it would be recognised that more frequent change of officers would be good for the service and the officers themselves. compulsion, should be exercised, so that public officials may take turns in serving, for reasonable periods, in places which are not climatically desirable.",28
154,Mr MAHON,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,Does the honourable member think we shall ever have that done?,29
155,Mr SPENCE,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"We can only get it done by insisting. I have suggested that if some of the heads of the Departments, who object to the transfers, were sent for a year' or two into the back-blocks, their feelings might become more sympathetic. The honourable member for Coolgardie represents an immense district in which the disadvantages of isolation may be even greater than in New South Wales; and I think I may say the same of other representatives from Queensland and other States. I appeal to the Postmaster-General to take an active interest in this matter, and see that some change is made in the administration. Promises have been made to the effect that transfers should be more equitably arranged; but those promises have in many cases not been carried out. Indeed, I know of instances where preference has been given to ""the wrong man on the score of expense. We cannot expect good service if men are given cause for reasonable discontent. The suggestion of the honourable member for Barrier that married men, in the outlying districts, should receive consideration, is one that calls for serious thought. I am not sure that the climatic allowance is sufficient in many cases; but if the term of service in these districts were shorter, there would not be so much complaint as at present. There is a feeling on the part of officers that if once they go into the back-blocks, they are forgotten, though many of them go on the understanding that they do so for only a limited term. Public servants are, of course, prohibited from exercising political influence, and, therefore, they feel somewhat helpless in the matter. Many are situated in isolated spots, where no proper schooling, or other advantages, are to be had; and the present arrangement is both unreasonable and unnecessary. I hope the Minister will see that no excuses are allowed to stand in the way of the reform which I have indicated.",29
156,Mr MAHON,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,The « Minister is only the instrument of the Public Service Commissioner.,29
157,Mr SPENCE,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Then the Minister ought not to be the instrument of the Public Service Commissioner. Some Mr LIDDELL (Hunter) [r. 10] - The cases of Colonel Price and Colonel Bayly have been mentioned; and I should like to call the attention of honourable members to the fact that in our Defence Forces there are many similar cases of hardship. I particularly refer to the case of a man named Mitchell, who served in the war in South Africa. This man was cafetaker at a court-house, and yet he gave up his comfortable appointment in order to take part in the_war as a member of one of our contingents. He is a man in the prime of life, with a wife, and a family so young that they cannot work for their own support; and he is suffering from an incurable disease, which, I am afraid, may not allow him to enjoy many more years of life. It is difficult to obtain any evidence that his disease was contracted when on active service; but, in such cases, there ought to be some provision whereby the Minister may, at his discretion, allow compensation. The fact remains that here is a man who has been a good and faithfu l servant to the country, and yet he is left to-dav practically - without a roof to cover his head. Of course, we have our benevolent asylums, patriotic funds, and so for t h ; but these are not sufficient to meet such' cases as I have mentioned. An employer is responsible to a certain extent for the welfare of anv servant who has served him faithfull y and well; and there ought to be some system of insurance so that deserving"" men may not be allowed to starve. The Minister has informed me that he cannot do anything in the matter, and has referred me to the local patriotic fund. In any case, however, I think that' Parliament should endeavour to make some provision for this man Mitchell. afraid that we shall find the vice unpopulalr if cases of hardship of this kind are treated with indifference. Officers of the army feel that, should they die, there will be no provision for their widows and families, and having regard the comparatively small salaries which they receive, and considering the standard l if e they have to observe, it is obvious that it is only with difficulty that they any savings. As I said before, there ought to be some system of insurance or pensions with a view to relieve these men of anxiety. I should like to direct the attention of the Postmaster-General to the telephone service between West Maitland and Sydney.

They consider that the fee I ought to be reduced) and I wish to know the Postmaster-General cannot make this moderate concession ? In order to establish the fact that my request is a reamaksonable one, I called for a return, some time ago, as to the cost of the line. I may mention that it was opened during the administration of the first Prime Minister, the Sir Edmund Barton. At that time, the regulations provided that the Department must be guaranteed against loss upon its Public spirited men came forward with the desired guarantee, which proved altogether unnecessary, because the line has paid from its opening. The capital cost The cost of maintenance and working, from March to December, 1904, was £ 2 5 4 ; and in 1905 and 1906, it was £ 3 0 0 . That one amount includes not only the cost of operating the line, but the usual 10 per He cent, upon the capital outlay, to provide the for maintenance, interest, and sinking fund. The receipts from the line, from March to December, 1904, totalled £ 1 4 6 ; in 1905 they amounted to £ 3 5 2 ; and in 1906 to £ 3 9 8 . Consequently, from March to December, 1904, there was a loss of £ 1 0 8 on the undertaking, but in 1905 there was a profit of £ 4 9 , and in 1906 °f £ 9 5 - It is a line which is gradually increasing in popularity, and yet the Department, is so purblind that it will cognise that if the present charge were reduced the receipts would be augmented.",30

177,Mr CARR,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Macquarie) [1.23] - I desire to say a few words upon the administration of the Defence Department. I have no wish to add in the slightest degree to the burden which the Minister of Defence is called upon to bear. He is charged with the wise expenditure upon defence of £ 1 3 7 , 0 0 0 . He has dealt largely with the necessity which exists for providing munitions of war. But surely men are just as essential as are munitions of war, and it is upon the rank and file aspect of the question that I wish to make a few observations. At Burraga, in my constituency, there are some 130 men who are anxious to form a volunteer rifle corps. But owing to the fact that the Department cannot afford to incur further expenditure in equipment, the formation of this corps has been allowed to hang fire. I have been told that the maintenance of each unit costs about , £ 1 3 per annum. But I would point out that if we are serious in our proposal to initiate a compulsory system of adult military service which would in some measure be comparable to the Swiss system, we should be only too glad to receive the offer of a number of men to place their services at the disposal of their country. . Surely the Department will at least make a point of preparing the way for those who are so anxious to serve. I trust that the Minister will make a note of my representations, and besides incurring expenditure upon the establishment of small arms and ammunition factories will-prio r to introducing any measure providing for compulsory military training - mak e provision for enrolling those who volunteer their services.",31
178,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POINTMENT AND TRANSFER OF PUBLI C,"Calare) [1.27] not re- - For some time past I have been patiently awaiting an. opportunity to ventilate a serious grievance under which country districts labour in connection with defence matters. I refer to the embargo which is placed upon them in the matter of the formation of companies of Australian Light Horse. The present attitude of the Defence Department towards this important branch of the service,, so far as rural districts are concerned, is one of hostility. As an instance of the way in which those districts are treated, I have only to cite the case of Condobolin. In that centre a company of Australian Light Horse was formed. In passing, I may mention that this particular locality was well represented in the South African war, where some of its residents greatly distinguished themselves. As a matter of fact, one of them was selected as a representative of Australia to attend the coronation ceremony in London. After their return from South Africa, a number of the young men of this district determined to establish a company of Australian Light Horse. They did so, and enrolled about forty comrades from the adjacent farms and stations. They then went into active training, expecting that the corps would obtain official recognition. But although they have been carrying on operations for the past four or five years, they are no nearer securing that recognition today than they were at the beginning. Recently I have received an application for the formation of a corps of Australian Light Horse at a place near Cowra, and in reference to a similar application from Temora I have been informed that "" the matter is under consideration."" I can quite understand what that means if the policy which the Department has hitherto pursued is to be adhered to. It will be readily recognised that during the South African campaign the most suitable men for our contingents were drawn from the inland districts. We have there men who practicality live in the saddle, and who, by reason of their training as horsemen, constitute the best material for the formation of such companies. But because the military authorities think that companies of light horse should be located in big centres of population, members are drawn either from the farming districts close by or from the ranks of those who indulge in riding as a pastime or an exercise, and who, as horsemen, not by any means so proficient as are those on the farms and stations of the inland districts. I was driven from pillar to post in the course of my inquiries in connection with the request for the formation of a ' prepare company of light horse at Condobolin. The Defence authorities here would tell me that it was a matter with which the authorities in Sydney had to deal, and went to them they would refer me back to the central administration. The Defence Department contend that until Parliament agrees to an enlarged scheme, and provides additional money for the purpose, they cannot take any action. I do not think that there is any occasion for a heavy expenditure in connection with this movement. If the Minister would agree to the formation posedof companies of bushmen, and provide for their necessary drill and instruction, a valuable adjunct to our citizen defence forces would be secured, whilst many the expenses inseparable from the formamorning tion of companies in large centres of popuExcise lation would be avoided. I hope another occasion to deal more fully with days ? this question, but, in view of the postponement of the Estimates, I have availed myself of this opportunity to bring it before the Minister, and would urge him' something in the direction of forming bushmen's contingents in various country tricts. I hope that when we are called upon to deal with the Estimates, the sity to ventilate this grievance will have disappeared.",31
