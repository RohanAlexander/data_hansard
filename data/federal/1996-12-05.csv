8,Mr WARWICK SMITH,HANSARD REPORT,"Bass-Minister f<'r Spurt, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (9.33 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill establishes the core elements of a new telecommunications regulatory framework for the era beginning 1 July 1997. Together with related bills in this package11 in total-it will introduce full and open competition, reinforce and reinvigorate consumer protection arrangements and bring about significant reforms to technical regulation. It will provide an environment in which Australian businesses and telecommunications users will get maximum value from a dynamic telecommunications industry. The regime will provide a framework within which the Australian telecommunications sector can develop into an industry based on: world-class infrastructure using the latest market driven technology mix; a multitude of service providers offering diverse and innovative carriage and content services; and contestable market strategies which drive prices down and quality of service up. The legislative package fulfils in full the government's election commitment to bring about a new era of competition and to establish a world-class consumer protection framework. Telecommunications services are an essential component of our lives both at home and at work. The role they play is becoming increasingly important as technological developments not only provide innovations in traditional telephony services but also allow liS to reach out to the world via services such as the Internet and to access financial, education, health and similar services. We are beginning to see the benefits that telecommunications services present when used as a tool in these ways. The future can only be more exciting. Facilitating the development of a truly competitive market from a monopoly is an evolutionary process. The government must progressively remove regulatory barriers and constraints on genuine competitive conduct; it also must increasingly shift responsibility for regulation to the industry itself. Significant efficiency gains can be achieved through greater reliance on self-regulation in networked industries such as telecommunications because regulatory structures and arrangements can be better designed to reflect industry and community needs. This package of legislation provides the framework for the telecommunications industry to take responsibility for key areas of regulation over and above the legislative guarantees provided. In the areas of competition regulation, mechanisms are available for the industry to develop agreed approaches to access and preselection management for adoption by the regulator. Similarly, in addition to foundation consumer protections and technical standards, the industry will have all the tools necessary to develop codes of conduct in consumer related areas and voluntary technical standards. The successful development of industry codes will be to the benefit of all players. It is therefore incumbent on all in the industry to fully and constructively participate in these self-regulatory mechanisms. The industry itself must provide the necessary resources. Consumer representatives must, where appropriate, have the opportunity to contribute to issues. In this context, I welcome the preparatory work the industry has undertaken in recent times-including work associated with the formation of the Telecommunications Access Forum and an overarching industry forum known as the Communications Industry Forum-to establish self-regulatory and consultative mechanisms in anticipation of its future responsibilities. Self-regulation will evolve over time and should not be expected to be comprehensive from day one. It requires progressive review and strengthening of self-regulatory mechanisms which, in tum, will require industry commitment on an ongoing basis. The government recognises, however, that in some areas industry consensus may not be achievable, and safeguard provisions exist to enable the regulator to step in and establish standards or arbitrate an outcome. I now tum to the major provisions of this bill. There will be no regulatory barriers to entry into the telecommunications industry. For regulatory purposes, the bill separately identifies persons who are responsible for regulatory obligations relating to telecommunications network infrastructure, carriers, and those persons who provide carriage or content services to the public by using this infrastructure, known as service providers. Carriers are very important to the regulatory scheme because they provide the basic transmission infrastructure on which the supply of carriage and content services to the public rely. Carriers will be individually licensed and subject to charges that recover the costs of regulating the industry. They will also share the net losses incurred in fulfilling the universal service obligation. Any artificial arrangements designed to thwart these policy intentions will be met by swift action by the government. The government will be maximising the opportunities for Australian industry through a licence condition that requires all carriers to have an industry development plan, unless exempted. The bill makes use of a new concept of service provider which includes both carriage service providers-who supply carriage services to the public-and content service providers, such as the providers of broadcasting and on-line services. Carriers will be service providers when they provide carriage or content services. Service providers will be regulated by rules established in the legislation, replacing the existing class licence regime. The government does not intend that the bill be used to regulate the content of content services. Content service providers have been included so they can benefit from rights to access services under the proposed access regime. Content will continue to be regulated under legislation such as the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. Telecommunications services are today a fundamental part of social interaction, particularly for those in remote communities. They also provide a lifeline in emergency situations and are an essential component of business activities. While competition is itself a vital part of the government's strategy to encourage continuing improvements in service and price reductions, the government recognises that market forces may not always be sufficient to guarantee outcomes that are in the interests of all consumers. While this bill re-enacts many aspects of the consumer protection and community obligation arrangements in the existing Telecommunications Act, in doing so the government has taken the opportunity to fundamentally reinvigorate those existing arrangements. We have also incorporated additional new protections applicable for an open entry market. At the core of the community obligations of the telecommunications industry is the universal service obligation, USO. The government is firmly committed to maintaining a general obligation on the industry to ensure that all people in Australia have reasonable access to the standard telephone service-including customer equipment-payphones, and prescribed additional carriage services on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business, and a supporting obligation to supply those services on request. The universal service provisions in this bill, while based on those in the Telecommunications Act 1991, incorporate changes to clarify and update the universal service obligation, improve efficiency and transparency, and align it with the open market post-1997 regime. Carriers will contribute to funding of losses incurred in fulfilling the usa in direct. proportion to their share of total 'eligible revenue', which is to be defined in regulations, but would include revenue from a broad range of carriage services. Alternative arrangements will enable carrier contributions to be set according to a methodology determined by the minister, with the agreement of carriers. During the election campaign the government promised that the option of untimed local calls would be maintained and extended to business customers. This bill fulfils that commitment. This bill will also: provide a customer service guarantee covering all carriage service providers in relation to the connection of standard services, rectification of faults and keeping of appointments; extend the existing obligation to enter into the telecommunications industry ombudsman scheme, which I commend to the House, from just carriers to all carriage service providers providing the standard telephone service to residential and small business customers, or a public mobile telecommunications service, and to other carriage service providers directed by the ACA to join the scheme; require carriage service providers who were not carriers on 30 June 1997 to comply with a scheme formulated by the ACA to offer protection to residential customers supplied with the standard telephone service against a failure to supply the service when the customer has made a protected payment; provide that end users of a standard telephone service have direct access, free of charge, to emergency services, in accordance with requirements imposed by the ACA on carriers, carriage service providers and emergency call persons, the objective here to provide, from the perspective of the end-user, a single emergency service that meets the community's needs, while providing necessary flexibility to address changing arrangements and technologies; re-enact obligations on telecommunications operators to cooperate with law enforcement agencies; and protect the confidentiality of communications and the personal particulars of customers from unlawful disclosure by persons in the telecommunications industry. A codes of practice regime is established to provide a framework for industry self-regulation by means of industry-developed codes that are registered with the ACA. The codes regime will supplement and enhance the fundamental consumer protection arrangements established in this bill and to which I have already referred. Codes can address areas of concern to consumers that are currently unregulated. As a fail-safe, this selfregulation mechanism is backed up by the ability of the ACA to make mandatory standards. In Better Communications the coalition gave a commitment that from 1 July 1997 it would eliminate the current exemptions for telecommunications carriers from planning and environmental laws. The provisions in this bill fulfil that commitment. The provisions establish a general rule that, from 1 July 1997, state and territory planning and environment laws will generally apply to telecommunications. There are three exceptions to this general rule: first, some standing exemptions for installation of low impact facilities and temporary defence facilities, and for inspection of land and maintenance of facilities; second, a limited case-by-case appeals pro,cess; and, third, a continuation of some specific powers and immunities currently contained in the Telecommunications Act 1991, including to allow for all facilities legally installed under that regime to continue to be exempt from state and territory laws and to allow individual subscribers to be connected to networks existing as at 30 June 1997. The case-by-case appeals process would be to an independent panel. An appeal will be open to carriers only in limited circumstances: where negotiations with the relevant authorities or owners have broken down; where the facility is an important part of a network of national significance; where the construction of a substantial part of that network has been approved by relevant authorities or already installed; and where the advantages to the national economy from the operation of the network to which the facility belongs outweighs any associated degradation of environmental amenity. The panel will comprise the Chairman of the ACA and up to four specially appointed associate members. In appointing those members, the government will make sure that they are independent, have appropriate experience and the ability to consider all appeals in an impartial manner. The government is very conscious of the public concern about possible degradation of environmental amenity due to installation of aerial cable and construction of mobile towers. The bill requires that carriers colocate mobile facilities on radiocommunications towers and radiocommunications sites-and facilities in ducts-unless it is not technically feasible to do so. Equally important, cabling of the broadband type will not be permitted to be located aerially, unless the relevant state or territory authority agrees. Connections of individual subscribers to these existing types of networks will be required to be underground, unless the subscriber agrees to aerial connection. Mr Billson-An excellent initiative.",13
9,Mr WARWICK SMITH,HANSARD REPORT,"Thank you. I think it is. The government's pre-election commitment to subject the telecommunications industry to state and territory planning and environmental law from July 1997 is reinforced by our intention to have only limited transitional arrangements. These arrangements will apply to carrier activities which have been through notification processes and where construction has commenced before 30 June 1997. In relation to broadband aerial cabling, construction must be completed by 30 September 1997 and construction of other types of telecommunications infrastructure must be completed before 31 December 1997. The government's policy in relation to carrier powers and immunities from I July 1997 strikes the right balance between encouraging investment in infrastructure to meet the growing demand for new telecommunications services and facilitating further competition while also addressing the legitimate concerns of local communities about the effect of the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure in their local environment. Technical regulation arrangements for the telecommunications industry will be significantly reformed by this bill, with greater emphasis placed on industry self-regulation, underpinned by standards made by the ACA for issues where self-regulation is inappropriate. Financial impact The measures contained in this package will require the ACCC to undertake various activities during 1996-97 involving additional expenditure in the order of $1 million. Additional expenditure will be offset by carrier licence application charges and annual fees imposed by the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Termination Bill 1996 and the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) Bill 1996. The details of the ongoing resource requirements for the ACA and ACCC will be considered in the 1997-98 and subsequent budget processes. This is a major piece of telecommunications legislation. I thank my colleagues, particularly the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson), who is in the chamber, and the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), for their contribution to the consideration of the major matters that are contained in this bill. I commend the bill to the House and table the explanatory memorandum to the bill with an explanation of the principles of the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martyn Evans) adjourned. NA (TELECOMMUNICATIONS) BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, and read a first time. Second Reading",16
10,Mr WARWICK SMITH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (9.50 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This is the second of a series of 11 bills to give effect to the major proposed changes to the telecommunications industry. This bill is a critical component of that package of legislation introduced to establish a new regulatory framework that will provide for a more competitive telecommunications industry from 1 July 1997. This bill is titled the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill 1996. The bill contains key competition related provisions that complement the broader regulatory arrangements, including in relation to consumer protection, contained in the Telecommunications Bill 1996, which I have just presented. It will bring the regulation of competition in the telecommunications industry more closely into line with general trade practices law and incorporate telecommunications industry specific rules on competition into the Trade Practices Act 1974. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, will be responsible for administering these rules. The post-1997 telecommunications legislative package will remove regulatory barriers to market entry as well as a number of artificial regulatory distinctions, such as those between mobile and fixed services. The reforms within this package will give all industry operators, both existing and new, the freedom to pursue the business strategy they choose. In an open market, all carriers and service providers, including Telstra, must be given the flexibility to engage in normal competitive conduct-Australian consumers will not benefit from regulation that unnecessarily hampers the ability of operators to respond to the market. Therefore, the approach adopted in this bill is not as interventionist as the antidiscrimination prohibitions in the Telecommunications Act 1991. That said, there remain good reasons for there to continue to be industry specific competition regulation for telecommunications. The removal of regulatory barriers to entry does not automatically result in the appearance of normal competitive market structures. Telstra continues to wield significant market power derived primarily from its historical monopoly position. There is also scope for incumbent operators generally to engage in anti-competitive conduct because competitors in downstream markets depend on access to the carriage services controlled by them. The possibility, for example, of incumbents engaging in anti-competitive crosssubsidy practices could threaten the further development of a competitive environment. All members of the telecommunications industry will be fully subject to general trade practices law contained in part IV of the Trade Practices Act. The exemption from part IV given to carriers under the Telecommunications Act 1991 for the supply of basic carriage services will not be continued. Total reliance on part IV of the TPA to constrain anti-competitive conduct might, in some cases, prove ineffective given the still developing state of competition in the telecommunications industry. The fast pace of change and complex nature of horizontal and vertical arrangements of firms operating in this industry mean that any anti-competitive behaviour could cause rapid damage to the competition that has already developed and severely hamper new entry. Therefore, as well as part IV of the act applying fully to telecommunications, the amendments made by this bill will supplement part IV by increasing the ability of the ACCC to respond swiftly where anti-competitive conduct is evident. Another important feature of the telecommunications industry is that competitors inevitably must make use of each other's networks. This is because many communications services-for example, telephone callsrequire any-to-any connectivity: the ability for any end user of the service to contact any other end user, regardless of who the suppliers are or on what network they are connected. This any-to-any feature-and the government's commitment to promote the di versity of carriage and content services available to end users-requires an access regime that includes additional features to those contained in the general access regime in part IlIA of the Trade Practices Act. Furthermore, the government recognises that there are expectations of continuity regarding the broad rights contained in existing access arrangements in part 8 of the Telecommunications Act 1991. For these reasons, the government's philosophy in preparing the telecommunications access regime has been to follow an approach based on part IlIA of the Trade Practices Act as far as practicable-nevertheless, to introduce some additional refinements to ensure that the arrangements will work effectively for the telecommunications industry. A smooth introduction of the new access regime depends critically on transitional arrangements. Transitional arrangements contained in the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996 will essentially retain exist- Access ing access rights for carriers, extend those rights to service providers and fulfil the government's election commitment to achieve open access in regard to the carriage of broadcasting services over cable networks. I will now tum to the key provisions of this bill in more detail. Anti-competitive conduct This bill inserts a new part XIB into the Trade Practices Act, establishing a number of additional powers for the ACCC to deal with anti-competitive conduct in telecommunications markets and to collect information to assist it in monitoring competition in the telecommunications industry. This part establishes a competition rule that a carrier or carriage service provider must not engage in anti-competitive conduct. The ACCC will be able to bring proceedings before the Federal Court at any time for an injunction to stop anti-competitive conduct, but it will also be able to issue a competition notice stating that a carrier or carriage service provider has engaged in anti-competitive conduct. While a competition notice remains in force: the ACCC will be able to bring proceedings before the Federal Court for substantial pecuniary penalties in relation to further conduct of the kind detailed in the notice; and other persons will be able to seek an injunction to restrain or otherwise deal with further conduct of the kind detailed in the notice or, if they suffer loss or damage as a result of any further conduct, to take action to recover the amount of the loss or damage. A competition notice will also be prima facie evidence of the matters in the notice for the purpose of any proceeding taken in relation to the notice. As the new legislative arrangements will introduce some level of uncertainty until regulators and the industry develop a clear understanding of its operations, the ACCC will be required to formulate guidelines before 1 July 1997 for use in deciding whether to issue a competition notice. The telecommunications access regime in part XIC provides foundation access rights to all industry operators and establishes a framework within which the industry can develop additional arrangements to improve the efficiency with which access is supplied. The access regime provides for regulated access rights to be established for specific carriage services and related services, and provides a framework within which the terms and conditions of access can be determined. It \vill reduce the power of those owning or controlling important infrastructure or services which are necessary for competitive services to be supplied to end users. In doing so, judgments by new and existing operators about whether to build their own networks or buy capacity on existing networks will be driven by normal commercial factors. Decisions to build will only be taken where commercial considerations clearly favour this strategy. The regime will therefore promote the efficient use of, and investment in, infrastructure. Mr Billson-Well done.",17
11,Mr WARWICK SMITH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"It is well done. It is a fundamental issue. I am glad that members have appreciated that fact. It is a clear policy intention that, as much as possible, both the determination of access rights and terms and conditions of access be the result of commercial processes and industry self-regulation. The bill provides for the establishment of a Telecommunications Access Forum, T AF-a body open to all carriers and carriage service providers-to manage those matters. The government expects the industry as a whole to work constructively to develop industry-driven solutions to access issues which retlect the legitimate interests of those seeking access and those under access obligations and which operate in the long-term interests of end users of telecommunications services. The government wants the benefits of increased competition to tlow as soon as possible. It wants all service providers to be placed in the position of having foundation access rights equal to those currently enjoyed by the carriers. Transitional arrangements included in the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996 will provide that services supplied between the existing carriers will, unless they would not promote the objects of the access regime, be declared services under this new access regime. In addition, the ACCC is required to declare a carriage service to bring within this access regime the supply of broadcasting services over cable networks. This fulfils our election commitment to remove the exemption of pay television carriage from the access regime given by the previous government. Conclusion In conclusion, the provisions in part XIB and part XIC will assist in creating more vigorous competition at all levels of the telecommunications market with benefits to the Australian community through lower prices and better quality. The new industryspecific competition provisions contained in this bill will serve to reduce damage that can be intlicted by those wielding general or localised market power. They will also open up opportunities for industry participants to offer new and innovative services to consumers. Together with the provisions contained in other bills in this package, this bill will bring long-term rewards to all users of telecommunications services. Financial Impact The bill is not expected to have a significant financial impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. The bill will, however, involve the transfer of competition and access regulatory functions for telecommunications from Austel to the ACCC and significant work to ensure transitional arrangements operate effectively. Accordingly, further resources will be required for the ACCC, estimated to be in the order of $1 million in the 1996-97 financial year. Additional expenditure will be offset by carrier licence application charges and annual fees imposed by the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Termination Bill 1996 and the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) Bill 1996. The details of the ongoing resource requirements for the ACCC will be considered in the 1997-98 and subsequent budget processes. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum and detail of the principles of the bill. Because the second reading speeches are long in nature, there is the additional attachment detailing in more length the principles that underpin the legislation. These second reading speeches are truncated somewhat so that we can get through the legislation in a reasonable time. Debate (on motion by Mr Martyn Evans) adjourned. NA AUTHORITY BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, and read a first time. Second Reading",19
12,Mr WARWICK SMITH,AUSTRALIAN COMMUNICATIONS,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (10.03 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is part of a package of bills, including the Telecommunications Bill 1996 and the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill 1996, which I have just introduced, that comprise the post-1997 telecommunications legislation. The bill establishes the Australian Communications Authority, to be known as the ACA, as the regulator for the new telecommunications regulatory framework from 1 July 1997. The ACA will be formed by merging Austel, without its competition regulation function, with the Spectrum Management Agency, an existing agency. The administration of competition regulation will be transferred to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The ACA's major functions will be the regulation of telecommunications in accordance with the proposed Telecommunications Act 1996 and the regulation of radiocommunications in accordance with the Radiocommunications Act 1992. This will see the ACA being responsible for many consumer matters, technical regulation and the management of the radiofrequency spectrum. An important consideration for the ACA will be the government's underlying preference for industry self-regulation and the ACA's proposed role in assisting industry to establish self-regulatory arrangements and providing a safety net if self-regulation fails. The ACA will be a body corporate consisting of a chairman, a deputy chairman and between one and three other members. The minister will also be able to appoint associate members for special purposes including inquiries and investigations. The ACA bill includes standard provisions relating to meetings and provides that the ACA's staff will comprise persons appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1922. The ACA's expenditure incurred in administering telecommunications-specific regulation is to be recovered from carriers via annual carrier licence fees imposed under the proposed Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) Act 1996. Financial Impact The transition to the post-1997 telecommunications framework and its initial implementation will require considerable effort by the ACA, Austel, the SMA and the Department of Communications and the Arts. The details of the ongoing resource requirements for the new body, the ACA, will be considered in the 1997-98 and subsequent budget processes. I have pleasure in commending the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum, together with an explanation of the principles of the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martyn Evans) adjourned. NA (UNIVERSAL SERVICE LEVY) BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, and read a first time. Second Reading",20
13,Mr WARWICK SMITH,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (10.06 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill imposes a levy on telecommunications carriers with a view to funding losses incurred by universal service providers in fulfilling the universal service obligation, known as the usn, under the proposed Telecommunications Act 1996. Financial Impact Given the number of variables that are involved, both in terms of universal service costs and carrier revenue shares, the amounts that will be payable under the levy cannot be quantified. Historical figures give some idea of the costs that have been involved in the past. The total net universal service cost was $235 million for 1994-95. This is a major commitment of the government and I have pleasure in commending the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill, together with a more detailed explanation of the principles of the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martyn Evans) adjourned. TELECOMMUNICA TIONS (CARRIER LICENCE CHARGES) BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, and read a first time. Second Reading",20
14,Mr WARWICK SMITH,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (10.08 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill provides for the imposition of application charges and annual charges in relation to carrier licences under the proposed Telecommunications Act 1996. Financial Impact The bill provides for the imposition of application charges of up to $100,000 for new carrier licences. Accordingly, there should be some addition to Commonwealth revenue from this measure. The amount of the addition will depend upon the number of applications received each year and the precise amount at which the charge is set within the overall limit. With effect from 1 July 1998, the bill will also enable ACA and ACCC expenditures incurred in administering telecommunications-specific regulation to be recovered from carriers via annual licence charges. Forward estimates for resource needs for the ACA and the ACCC for 1998-99 and subsequent financial years will be settled in the context of the 1997-98 budget. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill, together with an explanation of the principles of the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martyn Evans) adjourned. NA (NUMBERING CHARGES) BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, and read a first time. Second Reading",21
15,Mr WARWICK SMITH,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (10.09 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill provides for the imposition of charges in relation to certain numbers allocated to carriage service providers. The bill is consistent with the government's pre-election commitment to collect charges from the sale of reserved number ranges and to review the process for the allocation of numbers to service providers with a view to improving efficiency. Financial Impact With respect to the 1997-98 financial year and subsequent financial years, the bill is expected to derive in the vicinity of $30 million per annum in revenue to the Commonwealth. I have pleasure in commending the bill to the House and present an explanatory memorandum to the bill, together with an explanation of the principles of the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martyn Evans) adjourned. NA (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, and read a first time. Second Reading",21
16,Mr WARWICK SMITH,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (10.10 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is part of the package of bills that comprise the post-1997 telecommunications legislation. This bill makes arrangements to facilitate the transition from the current regulatory regime to the post-1997 regime. It provides necessary support to the Telecommunications Bill 1996 and the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill 1996, both of which I have just introduced. The bill contains transitional provisions and consequential amendments to other acts related to the proposed Telecommunications Act 1996 dealing with matters that include: the merger of the Australian Telecommunications Authority, Austel, and the Spectrum Management Agency, the SMA, to form the Australian Communications Authority-to be known as the ACA; the transfer of competition policy resources from Austel to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, on I July 1997; the telecommunications access regime; carrier licences; technical standards; indicative performance standards; the universal service regime; the chart of accounts and cost allocation manual; international aspects of carriers activities; cabling and customer equipment; protection of the confidentiality of communications; reviews and reports about the telecommunications industry; anti-competitive conduct in the telecommunications industry; the numbering plan; the exercise of powers by Austel before 1 July 1997; interception capabilities; and tariffs for the supply of carriage services. The proposed transitional arrangements are aimed at preventing a hiatus when the post1997 telecommunications regime commences by continuing, where appropriate, existing regulatory instruments in the new regime. These regulatory instruments may be only partly relevant in some instances and will need to be reviewed either before or after the commencement date. The arrangements also permit necessary action to occur before I July 1997 so that the benefits of the new regulatory regime flow from the earliest possible date. This is particularly important to achieving a fully functional access regime on 1 July 1997. The consequential amendment made to section 600F of the Corporations Law has been approved by the Ministerial Council for Corporations. Financial Impact The transition to the post-1997 regime and its initial implementation will require considerable effort by the ACA, the ACCC, Austel, the SMA and the Department of Communications and the Arts. The ACCC is expected to receive supplementary funding in the order of $1 million for the necessary pre-commencement tasks it needs to undertake and this will be recovered from carrier licence fees in 1997-98. Details of ongoing resource requirements will be considered in the 1997-98 and subsequent budget processes. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum, together with an explanation of the principles of the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martyn Evans) adjourned.

17,Mr WARWICK SMITH,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (10.17 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill provides for the repeal of the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Act 1991 with effect from 1 July 1998, and deals with the payment by existing telecommunications carriers of carrier licence fees on 1 July 1997. The bill will enable the recovery from existing telecommunications carriers of an additional amount in the order of $1 million to fund the ACCC's activities in preparing for the commencement of and, following commencement, engaging in activities under the Telecommunications Bill 1996, proposed parts lIB and llC of the Trade Practices Act 1974, which deal with anti-competitive conduct in the telecommunications access regime, and also part III of the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996, which contains transitional provisions relating to that telecommunications access regime. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill, together with an explanation of the principles of the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin) adjourned.

20,Mr WARWICK SMITH,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"Bass-Minister licences for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister the Sydney 2000 Games) (10.21 a.m.)-I greater move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Radiocommunications Amendment Bill 1996 is the last in a series of 11 bills that give effect to the government's proposed changes to the telecommunications to take effect in July 1997. The Radiocommunications Amendment Bill 1996 seeks to amend the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to facilitate increased competition in telecomces munications, and deals with a number of other matters to improve mechanisms for the agement of the radiofrequency spectrum. The amendments proposed in the bill complement amendments proposed in related telecomby munications legislation. In essence, the amendments provide for: sale of spectrum while encumbered and later clearance of incumbent users; application of section 50 and other related sections of Trade Practices Act 1974 to the allocation issuing of radiocommunications licences; a ministerial power to limit the amount of spectrum persons can acquire at price based allocations; extending the period of spectrum licences. licences to a maximum of fifteen years; implementation of electromagnetic compatithe bility requirements; the setting of radiocomstandards munications standards for health and safety purposes; and the removal of provisions for technical licence specifications. I now tum to the details of the bill. Selling spark spectrum while encumbered will allow early allocation to the new owner, who can underence take planning while the rights of the bents are protected. Under the proposed system of reallocation declarations, incumstandards bents receive at least two years notice of the need to vacate spectrum. The actual period will depend on the circumstances, including the extent of any previous forewarning of incumbents by planning processes and the urgency of the need for the spectrum for new uses. Incumbents will also have the opportunity to buy at auction the spectrum they are operating in. Under current arrangements, spectrum may be issued for fixed terms up to 10 years. This term is proposed to be extendfor ed to a maximum of 15 years to provide certainty and opportunity for return on investment. A 10-year spectrum licence term was not considered by industry to be long enough to offer an attractive investment. A licence term of up to 15 years should enhance potential participants' confidence to commit to substantial financial investment in comindustry, munications infrastructure. The Trade Practices Act 1974, TPA, currently applies to radiocommunications licenafter they are issued but not to the initial allocation and licence issue. The proposed manamendment would apply section 50 of the TPA to the licence issue process and to the use of spectrum under an authorisation given a licensee to third parties. This closes gaps in regulatory coverage. The amendment proposing the creation of a ministerial power to set limits which would apply during a licence allocation process the supplements the competition protection and functions under the TPA. This would allow the minister to consider and, if necessary, set pro-competitive limits to provide some opportunity for new entrants to purchase spectrum The proposed amendments would support Spectrum Management Agency's EMC making power with respect to a range of devices including computers, navigation equipment, industrial equipment such as arc welding equipment and power tools, and ignition engines. Many of these devices have long histories of either causing interferto other devices or being susceptible to incuminterference from other devices. The proposed extension of the SMA's making powers to include protection of the health and safety of persons who operate, work on or use radiocommunications transmitters or receivers, or are reasonably likely to be affected by their operation, enables the SMA to enforce compliance of radiocommunications devices, receivers and transmitters with such standards. It also harmonises radiocommunications legislation with telecommunications legislation. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill, together with a detailed explanation of the principles of the bill. In so doing, concludes this major package. I take the opportunity on behalf of the government to thank particularly many colleagues who have been involved in the delivery of information and assistance with the preparation of the package and also particularly the Department of Communications and the Arts which put in many hours to put together this major piece of legislation. I thank the opposition for their agreement to allow us to truncate to get this package into the parliament. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin) adjourned. VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (1996-97 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 September, on motion by Mr Bruce Scott: That the bill be now read a second time.",24
21,Mr MARTIN,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill before the House this morning proposes a number of changes to veterans' and war widows' entitlements. Some of those changes are unambiguously good, some are fair, but regrettably some are decidedly unfair. The financial impact of this bill may be minor when viewed in the context of the budget as a whole, but the effect on a number of veterans will be great. I foreshadow that the opposition will be moving some amendments in the consideration in detail stage of this bill. I will comment on some of those amendments that we propose as I go through my speech on the second reading. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) said: The veterans' affairs 1996 package honours key pre-election promises to the veterans' community. When the minister says key promises-and we know about core and non-core promiseswhat he actually means is that the government has honoured some promises but certainly not all promises. The coalition promised before this the election that they would 'maintain all existing veterans' entitlements'. Whilst veterans' specific entitlements have been largely untouched, it is in the area of mainstream aged care services where the veteran community has come in for a hammering. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is in the chamber today and we went through some of this exercise yesterday. The government's structural reform of aged care will net savings in the vicinity of half a billion dollars. A further $88 million will be saved through additional user charges in home and community care. Veterans make up around one-quarter of the male population aged over 65 years and veterans and war widows together make up around 15 per cent of the total population aged over 65. Quite clearly, the veterans community will substantially contribute to the cost cutting measures of the government through a reduction in their entitlements. This is, without qualification, a broken promise. It is worthwhile to touch briefly on a few of these measures because it is the first opportunity we have had to debate them. It may also be the last opportunity this year to bring the government to account over its broken promise to the veterans community. I start by briefly referring to the nursing home entry contribution farce. The government's decision to align the nursing home system with a hostel system will result in many veterans and war widows having to pay an entry contribution to gain admittance to a nursing home. The average commitment will be in the vicinity of $26,000. Mr Bruce Scott-Rubbish!",25
22,Mr MARTIN,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"'Big deal,' the minister says. Mr Bruce Scott-I didn't say, 'Big deal.'",26
23,Mr MARTIN,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"The minister has just come into the chamber and said, 'Big deal.' That reflects the attitude which those in government have to this important issue. Mr Ronaldson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I do not think they were the words used by the minister at all. I think a transcript of Hansard will show that. I think it would be inappropriate for that to be in Hansard.",26
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"Mr Jenkins)Order! I did not hear the interjection, but this goes to a matter raised by the Speaker in the last few days about the difficulty of people interjecting and misinterpretations of interjections. It would be hoped that we would not revert to trial by video or trial by audio on these matters. If the minister feels aggrieved, he might take the steps that are available to him under the standing orders at a later stage.",26
25,Mr MARTIN,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. If the minister is sensitive about just look at what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had to say yesterday in response to this in the House. The issue was being debated here regrettably in question time and subsequently in the MPI. Concern was raised about entry to nursing homes and whether people would have to sell their homes or rent them out. The Prime Minister's response, in a typical uncaring fashion, was, 'So what.' The government has said that their decision to impose an entry fee on new nursing home residents was simply a matter of aligning the two systems of nursing homes and hostel care. As I tried to point out yesterday, this is not a defensible position. The two types of care are radically different. Hostel care can, in many cases, be seen as a lifestyle choice, and that level of care is also available in the homes through community aged care packages. Nursing home care, on the other hand, represents a far more serious decision on the part of the resident. It is a hospital level of care reserved for those who are extremely frail or suffering from dementia. If a potential resident is deemed by an aged care assessment team to require a place in a nursing home, it is considered a last resort. In other words, it is the only appropriate care mechanism available to that person. That is why it is different, and that is what we said yesterday, but the Minister for Family Services said that this was rubbish. Indeed, even the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) said it was rubbish. It clearly demonstrates that on the Gold Coast she has no understanding of the nursing home requirements of aged people, and that of course includes veterans. The income testing recurrent subsidies issue is one which is also of great concern. Many veterans and war widows reside in hostels and nursing homes, and they will be subject to an additional charge of 2Sc in the dollar over the pension-free area. For a single veteran, any money earned over $98 a fortnight will be reduced by a quarter, up to a maximum of $238 a week. Current residents did not plan for this when they entered residential care, and their financial plans in many cases will be ruined. It is an inequitable measure that that, targets frail aged veterans and war widows. Mr Hardgrave-You are trying to scare people.",26
26,Mr MARTIN,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,This is the same nonsense that people on your side have continued to peddle in this place that we are scaring elderly people. It is your policy. It is your bill that is before this place. It is your legislation relevant to aged care that is imposing all this. This is not made up. This is exactly what is going to happen. Read your own legislation before you intervene. Mr Hardgrave-Stop trying to scare people.,26
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"Order! The honourable member for Cunningham might direct his remarks through the chair, and the honourable member for Moreton might not interject.",26
28,Mr MARTIN,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"He is really not a bad bloke, but he should think carefully before he speaks. Increases in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme concessional patient contributions is another area which is of concern to veterans. Although a SOc increase in the patient contribution of pharmaceutical costs does not seem very large, it is affecting a group of people on relatively small fixed incomes. Again, they were not warned of this added impost and many will find it difficult to adjust to the new expense. Finally, there is the increased user charges on home and community care. It is difficult to know where or how this new charge is likely to fall, as it will depend on the states and the providers. Veterans are already significantly disadvantaged when it comes to HACC services. The states have admitted that many providers discriminate against veterans because they assume that their care is the sole responsibility of the states. This measure will have a compounding effect on veterans' ability to access HACC services. I want to say again to my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who I am pleased is in the chamber for this debate, that each of those issues that I have just raised are outside his portfolio responsibilities. I have been on record at RSL congresses and I have been on record in this place on a couple of occasions saying that the minister really did not have that control over the cross-portfolio effects that were going to be felt on the veterans community. I say it again in this speech. The minister actually achieved a reasonable outcome for the veterans community in his own area in not having his government slash and bum the entitlements to veterans. But when you come to the cross-portfolio areas, as I have said to the minister and I have said publicly, it is in those areas where the Minister for Family Services, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) have had their wicked way with you. They have slashed into the effect that will be felt by veterans war widows more broadly because of the policies in aged care that your government continues to pursue. As the House can see, veterans and war widows have not escaped lightly from the budget cuts. For the government to suggest that they have honoured their commitment to the veterans community is pure hyperbole. The minister has, and I accept that, but it is his ministerial colleagues who are putting the spear right into the veterans community. I now tum to the specific measures in the bill. Firstly, I mention the amendments related to allocated pensions. This measure amends the service pension asset test treatment of allocated pensions. The current asset value of allocated pension investments will be taken into account for the purposes of the assets test, regardless of the person's age, effectively closing a loophole, and aligns the Department of Veterans' Affairs with the Department of Social Security, which instituted similar measures in July 1992. I might indicate to the government that the opposition actually agrees it is unfair that some people could gain increased income support by entering into particular investment arrangements. Therefore, of course, we will not be opposing this particular measure. Amendments relating to earnings credits, however, need further consideration. The earnings credit scheme allows pensioners and allowees to take up temporary or casual work without affecting their level of payment. Pensioners can accrue an earnings credit of up to $1,050, or $2,100 for couples combined, to offset earnings on employment before payments are affected. This bill seeks to abolish this arrangement. The earnings credit scheme gave pensioners and allowees an incentive to take any casual or temporary work that became available by giving them an incentive to supplement their payments without immediately or necessarily reducing their level of payment. We believe that this is a regressive step, particularly when the government purports to encourage people back into employment and towards increased financial independence. People will be deterred from taking up this and kind of employment, and the opposition remains opposed to this reduction in veterans' entitlements as it represents yet another broken promise. I am sure that there will be those on the government side who will come into this debate and suggest that, because very few people have taken advantage of this provision, there is no point in keeping it. We would argue that, if there are so few people who have taken advantage of this provision, why eliminate it? When you look at the savings provisions that have been listed, you will see there aren't any. There are no savings provisions listed for this because it is so low. Therefore, why have the change? If the government is committed to the whole issue associated with trying to make people a little more financially independent, giving the elderly in our community who perhaps are in receipt of some benefit-in this case, a veterans' entitlement-the opportunity to earn some funds elsewhere, why take away that right where it might impact on them? On the amendments relating to funeral benefits, this particular measure provides for the payment of a funeral benefit for the transport of the body of a veteran who dies away from home in indigent circumstances. This is in keeping with the overall respectful and supportive treatment of veterans and this, of course, is a feature of the repatriation system. Again, although at a cost of $32,000 over four years to the government, this is a measure with which the opposition concurs fully and one we would not be opposing in any way whatsoever. The amendments similarly relating to the Victoria Cross allowance are not to be opposed by the opposition. These will increase the value of the Victoria Cross allowance paid to Australian recipients to $2,700 and bring it into line with the same allowance paid to British recipients. It follows the former government's granting of a special gold travel card to Australia's three surviving VC recipients: Ted Kenna, Keith Payne and Sir Roden Cutler. As I said, I commend the minister for bringing forward this particular matter where it does align it with other allowances. Amendments relating to lump sum compensation payments, however, are probably worth further consideration. The devisor which is used to calculate preclusion periods is to be changed from the all persons average weekly earnings to the amount above which no pension is payable to a single person under the income test, which is currently $397 per week. Pensioners and allowees affected by this measure will be subject to longer periods without payments, forcing them to use up their compensation at a lower rate before being eligible for financial assistance or continued assistance. We will be opposing this measure. It is only to save $98,000 over four years, according to the government's documentation. We believe that, for such a paltry amount, the angst that will be caused by changing the devisor is not realistic. As I have indicated, we will be moving an amendment at the appropriate stage to try to have the government change its mind. The preclusion period will be applied to compensation recipients only, and not to their partner. That is, for lump sums received on or after 20 March 1997, recovery of past payments to partners will not be made, nor will partners be precluded from receiving any future entitlement they may have during their partner's preclusion period. That saving of $100,000 over four years is not something which the opposition would dispute and, accordingly, we would be agreeing with that particular change. Amendments relating to extended deeming, however, will be opposed because, once again, this represents a broken promise as was delivered to the veterans community by the government during the last election campaign. These particular amendments apply a deeming rate of five per cent on all bank deposits held by pensioners and the unemployed. The first $2,000 for singles, $4,000 for couples, used to be exempt as the 'below threshold rate'. This measure relies on pensioners and allowees being able to access accounts which pay interest at the deemed rate. Under half of all financial institutions make these available; not all are available to pensioners and allowees. This represents, in effect, something close to $100 a year to be taken off pensioners. You have to say that that is pretty miserly; it is pretty miserable. But, regrettably, it is in keeping with some of the things that this government is doing in the area of aged care. I just say to the Minister for Veterans Affairs-because I have seen him in action, and I know he has a genuine commitment to the veterans community-this is really something on which you should go back to the Treasurer and the Minister for Family Services and have another discussion about. It just seems to us on this side of the parliament that, whilst the savings are estimated at something like $7.8 million-and that is a considerable amount of money in anyone's terms-when you look at it in terms of what it will mean to the pensioner who will be affected here of $100 a year being taken from them, it is pretty miserly. Again, I just appeal to the minister to take into consideration and on board some of the views that will be expressed in this debate, particularly by those on this side of the House, in his summing up of this legislation. I just indicate again that we will be moving some amendments in respect of this. Overall, as I said-and I come back to where I started-many of these changes that are being proposed for veterans' and war widows' entitlements are unambiguously good. Some of them are very fair and we do not dispute that. In fact, some of the proposals in here are simply extensions of what we in government were giving consideration to. But there are one or two proposals that are unfair and I think they go to the core issue of looking after those people who are in need in the broad community. They plan their lives. I am sure that all of us who represent elderly people in this parliament recognise that they plan very carefully how they are going to spend their fixed incomes that come in the way of veterans' pensions or some other social security benefit. They would see this change being brought in as a broken promise, at a time when no indication was given to them that this was going to happen. Mr Hardgrave-Your track record government is disgraceful.",26
29,Mr MARTIN,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"I am sure they would be appealing through the various RSL organisations for the government to give further consideration to it. Again, I come back to my friend the member for Moreton, who continues to suggest that the opposition is simply scaremongering on this issue. What people should clearly keep in mind about this is that we are bringing to this place a reflection of what your government is bringing in legislation. Mr Hardgrave-Constantly punishing older Australians over 13 years.",29
30,Mr MARTIN,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"What we are not concerned about is the cant and hypocrisy of some people who say that the Labor Party, when in government, did nothing for the veterans community. My friend, you should travel around to the RSLs and have a listen to what they have to say about what the Labor Party did for the veterans community when it was in government. Have a close listen to what they say about the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs. You should hear what even someone on your side has to say about the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs. You have been here five minutes. Go and check a few of the facts before you enter into some of the debate in this place. Minister, again I say to you that we commend you for those measures in this legislation which are fair and reasonable. We thank you for taking the opportunity to participate in the debate today and taking a reasonable approach to those matters. We hope that you reconsider those issues that we genuinely bring to your attention and that you have some discussions with your colleagues about how those issues may be amended. As I have suggested, I foreshadow that we will be moving in the consideration in detail stage some amendments to those areas that I have already outlined. I look forward to perhaps some response from the minister at that time.",29
31,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"Despite Australia's remoteness, wars have dominated Australian life in the 20th century. The powerful image of Australians at III war, particularly the ANZACs, have had a major impact on the history of this nation. It is frightening to think that, collectively, a whole decade of the first part of this century was dominated by the two world wars. A major war literally means the wholesale decimation of a generation of young Australian men and women whose brains, ability and creativeness will never be fully appreciated. Soldiers on all sides know war is a brutal existence, filled with waste and horror. But the hidden cost to a nation is extraordinary. It must be remembered that each serviceman left behind not only a family, a mother or a wife or both and in many cases children but also their careers and future dreams. A young corporal from New South Wales summed up the horrendous nature of the First World War when he wrote in his diary: Most of us enlisted for Patriotism or Love of Adventure but not one ... had the slightest conception of the terrible price required ... It is hard to believe that half of the eligible men in Australia enlisted in the First World War. Of all those who sailed away to fight, 65 per cent were either killed or wounded. This government recognises Australia's debt of gratitude to our veterans community, which served us so unselfishly in times of conflict. To reflect their invaluable and selfless contribution to our society, the coalition is firmly committed to their well-being and care. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill helps us to achieve this goal. Currently the Department of Veterans' Affairs is responsible for the care of over 300,000 veterans and their dependants. The coalition has guaranteed to maintain all existing veterans' entitlements. This bill introduces the first instalment of the government's veterans' affairs budget commitments. The majority of the measures contained in the bill correct anomalies in the veterans' entitlements. The review of anomalies was a key undertaking in the coalition's policy statements on veterans' issues. The other measures in the bill will help improve administration of the veterans' programs and enhance service delivery. The government has honoured key pre-election promises to the veterans community in the 1996 budget. It provides simpler and more flexible entitlements. It is fair, with better access to services and more assistance to help veterans help themselves. Commemoration, health care, housing, rehabilitation and compensation are the major initiatives covered by this bill. In particular, a number of anomalies will be removed from the system, resulting in more efficient administration and simplified service delivery. With regard to commemoration, I am very pleased that the Victoria Cross allowance will be increased. This rate now being paid to the three surviving recipients will be backdated to August 1995, which is the date the British government increased their Victoria Cross allowance. This financial acknowledgment of the valour of our veterans will be in line with other governments around the world, but it is only a token of the veterans' true worth. This initiative increases the allowance paid to Australian recipients of the Victoria Cross and will cost $45,000, including the backdated payments, over the next four years. The government has also implemented a number of beneficial health care initiatives that do not require legislative action. Funding has been made available to provide Australian merchant mariners with access to asbestos screening programs. This is designed to assist in the detection of illnesses related to asbestos exposure. Previously our World War II Australian mariners had not been eligible for asbestos exposure screening programs which have been available to current and past members of the armed services and civilian employees. This initiative has given eligible veterans equal access to this very important service. The government is also reviewing a list of eligible drugs contained in the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This review will ensure the best outcomes are achieved from the pharmaceutical treatment provided to veterans and war widows. A major review of the medication program for high risk veterans is also taking place. The aim of the review is to reduce inappropriate prescription and medication use and to improve the quality of life and health options of our veterans. Changes announced in the budget will remove anomalies by extending and improving the range of spectacle frames available through the DV A optometrical scheme. The changes will also allow veterans and war widows and widowers to obtain progressive power lenses, or multifocals, if they prefer, instead of bifocal or trifocal lenses. The Department of Veterans' Affairs is a major purchaser of optometrical products, currently spending about $8.4 million per year on supplies and a further $3.1 million on consultations. The DV A is continuing to negotiate with the optometrical industry for improvement in quality and a better range of frames and lenses, as well as suitable pricing. These changes are due to be implemented by 1 February next year. Veterans with special footwear requirements will find it more convenient to obtain new shoes or repair their old shoes. Footwear changes will particularly benefit veterans living in remote areas. They will now be able to be issued with up to three pairs of medical grade footwear at one time. Eligible veterans will also be able to use any footwear repairer contracted by the DV A for repairs to medical grade footwear. This means veterans will have greater access to repair services in locations convenient to them. This bill makes several positive reforms that correct a number of anomalies in the Defence Services Home Act 1918. The first of these reforms is the reduction of the interest rate for new additional advances. Additional advances are available to people who have taken less than the maximum $25,000 loan that is available under the DSH scheme. The maximum amount of additional advance is the remaining balance of the $25,000. A person can have more than one additional advance within this limit. At present, a person who takes out the maximum loan available of $25,000 at an interest rate of 6.85 per cent per annum is disadvantaged if they later seek the balance by way of an additional advance because such advances are available at 10 per cent only. The amendments mean that people will be able to use these advances for purposes such as home repairs or modifications without having to pay what is effectively a three per cent penalty interest rate. The rate of interest for additional advances under the defence service homes scheme will be reduced from 10 per cent to 6.85 per cent. The second reform to the Defence Services Home Act 1918 is the extension of eligibility for assistance to widowers of World War II servicewomen. These veterans are themselves eligible persons and have previously been provided with assistance. At present, the widowers of eligible World War II servicewomen are comparatively disadvantaged if they have already been assisted on the basis of their own service. These veterans are currently not entitled to a second loan based on their status as widowers. On the other hand, World War II widows who are also exservicewomen can receive this assistance. This anomaly will be removed and these men will now be entitled to a second loan. The third major reform of the Defence Services Homes Act 1918 is the extension of eligibility for loan assistance to persons who first enlisted in the Defence Force on or before 14 May 1985 and who served in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia or Somalia within certain periods of time. To date, this group of veterans has been denied assistance, even though their colleagues who enlisted later and served in the same areas have been able to obtain loans under the defence service homes scheme. The amendments mean that veterans will be able to receive defence service homes assistance on the basis of their service in those operational areas, even if they have not completed six years of peacetime service. With Australia's younger veterans in mind, the 1996 budget features a major initiative in the vital area of employment and training to provide ongoing care and assistance to Australia's younger veteran community. The veterans' employment and training scheme ensures that there are programs in place to help veterans who have difficulty in moving to, obtaining or holding civilian employment. The government has committed $2.3 million to this scheme in recognition of the special needs of our younger veterans. This new program will provide veterans with skills for their future and equip them to be competitive in the current employment market. The vets' program will offer a range of services including vocational career guidance and counselling; practical assistance and guidance in securing employment; and training to supplement existing skills and education through short courses, TAFE and university enrolments at the undergraduate level. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA",29
32,Mr SPEAKER,HANSARD REPORT,"My attention has been drawn to comments recorded on page 7470 in yesterday's Proof Hansard made by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in attempting to move a suspension of standing and sessional orders. The comments constitute a serious reflection on the office of Speaker.

VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (1996-97 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed.",32
36,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,HANSARD REPORT,"This vocational rehabilitation program will contain a safety net which protects veterans' entitlements. The safety net will allow a veteran to undergo vocational rehabilitation without the loss of pensions, benefits and allowances that they may receive. When a veteran does find employment, some safety net items will be phased out over a number of years while other items will be retained in their entirety. Other changes that will simplify the administration of veterans' benefits are that there will be no need for pensioners to advise the department about small changes in their level of income. This will eliminate unnecessary administration and will also reduce the level Of intrusion into veterans' lives. Modification will be made to the pension advance scheme, which will also improve administration efficiencies. Applicants will now be able to receive one advance per year but will no longer be required to provide information about how the advance is to be used. Changes have also been made to correct an anomaly in the advance payments scheme. War widows and widowers who receive service pensions or income support supplement at the frozen or ceiling rate will now be able to obtain the $500 maximum allowable on pension advance. This government recognises the crucial role that veterans' advocates play in the repatriation claims scheme. Funding will be provided to ex-service organisations so they can employ more staff. This is in addition to the training programs already provided to ex-service organisations on veterans' entitlements and services. By helping to handle the applications for review of pension claims to the Veterans' Review Board, these advocates will improve the efficiency of the repatriation claims process. By the turn of the century, about 60 per cent of Australia's veteran community will be over 75 years of age and will require different health, compensation and welfare services. Therefore, as a government, we must meet the changing needs of veterans, war widows and widowers. Preparing for these changes is a major challenge for the government and the veteran community. The government is looking at how the demography of the veterans community will change over the next five to 10 years. We will be looking to the ex-service community to play an active role in developing an innovative approach to service delivery in the future. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill has a number of initiatives for the benefit of veterans including the streamlining of age pension payments to veterans receiving the disability pension; the automatic payment of pensions to widows and widowers the death of whose spouse was due to a previously accepted disability; improved entitlements for footwear and spectacles; and an innovative training program to assist veterans to gain and retain civilian employment when they leave the defence forces. These initiatives demonstrate the strong and unequivocal commitment that this government has to veterans and their families. These Australians sacrificed so much for their country and contributed enormously to the freedom and way of life we all enjoy today. I commend this bill to the House.",32
37,Ms MACKLIN,HANSARD REPORT,"Jagajaga) (11.03 a.m.)The proposals in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill, which give effect to the measures announced in the budget, are, in our view, variable in their impact on veterans. Some are beneficial and we support them. Others are detrimental and we will certainly oppose them and propose the removal of particular parts of the bill. I will speak briefly about some of the things that we support in this bill, because they are positive changes. The first of these relates to the proposal to take account of the current asset value of allocated pension investments for the purpose of the assets test regardless of a person's age. This measure will make the assets test for veterans consistent with the test that has applied to other Department of Social Security pensioners since July 1992. It will, however, apply only to allocated pension investments made since the budget-an important matter for veterans to be aware of. We are also obviously very pleased to support the budget decision to increase the Victoria Cross allowance from $250 to $2,700 and to extend the funeral benefits payable to veterans' families. These will now include the costs associated with the transport of the remains of a veteran who has died in financial need away from home when obtaining medical treatment. Each of these measures can make a significant difference to the small number of veterans affected and their families. I am particularly pleased to support such a measure. The opposition also supports the decision to limit variations in pension and income support payments where these fall below $1 per fortnight. Current arrangements are both administratively cumbersome and unnecessarily intrusive for veterans. We are very pleased that they are being modified in the manner outlined. We also support the removal of anomalies in the advance payments scheme to war widows and widowers. As a result, eligible people will be able to receive their full lump sum advance-I gather about $500-in one payment and will not be required to declare how they intend to use it. To date, there have been very few cases in which these people have indicated an intention to spend the advance on anything other than the purposes intended. There is thus little justification for continuing the current requirements. The bill proposes changes to the Defence Service Homes Act. These will extend eligibility for assistance under the act and reduce interest rates on new additional advances taken out to cover house repairs and modifications. As I have in my constituency a very large number of people in this category, I am very pleased to support these changes as well. The opposition supports all of the changes referred to above. They involve a very small additional expenditure for government; nevertheless, they provide significant additional benefits for the individuals affected. Although the number of veterans potentially affected by these measures is relatively small, it is not insignificant. We have a very large number of veterans and spouses and widows of veterans in my electorate of Jagajaga. I want to put on the record the significant debt that all of us owe to the veterans and their families. I very much support the measures, the continued assistance and additional assistance provided in this bill. Other amendments included in this bill are much more problematic. They penalise veterans rather than support them, and in a number of cases they break election promises that have been made to veterans about their entitlements and benefits. What was said before the election was that their entitlements and benefits would not be reduced. On these grounds, we oppose these measures, and I will go through some of these. One of the most objectionable measures in this bill is to discontinue the earnings credits scheme under which service pensioners and recipients of income support supplements can earn about $1,000, or $2,000 in the case of couples, without any impact on the level of earned income considered under the income test for determining their level of pensions and benefits. With the abolition of the scheme, which will take effect in March next year, there will be less incentive for veterans and their spouses to earn additional income to supplement their pension. This is a very short sighted and regressive measure, and we will certainly be opposing it. It will act as a disincentive to people who are going to be seeking and have sought casual or temporary work. I think it will lead to an increased reluctance by some to declare their income that they may earn in this way. Another measure in this bill that we are very concerned about which the shadow minister has referred to is the measure that affects the treatment of lump sum compensation payments. These changes will not just be restricted to veterans. Under current arrangements, people receiving compensation payments, which include a component for loss of income, are not eligible for a government pension and benefits for a period calculated by the Department of Social Security according to a formula based on average weekly earnings. But of course this government is going to make life much harder for people who have any money of their own. Basically, under all of the government's proposals in this budget, you will be required to use every last cent before you become eligible for pensions or benefits. Unfortunately, that will apply to veterans and their families as well. The practical effect of this measure will be to require veterans to live for a longer period on their compensation payments before they become eligible for financial assistance. It is a very mean measure. We also oppose the extension of the five per cent deeming rate to all bank deposits held by veterans. At present, those who hold bank accounts worth $2,000, or $4,000 for couples, are actually assessed for tax purposes at the actual rate payable by the bank. In every instance that I can find, that is at less than five per cent. This is a very punitive measure. We will actually see veterans paying the government for having such small bank accounts. I certainly have not been able to find any evidence where banks will be paying these interest rates, and we have no indication from the government that they will be changing the deeming rate to meet this reality. I understand that the Department of Veterans' Affairs actually estimates that more than 120,000 veterans will be affected by this measure. There is no question that veterans deserve a lot better than that. We also have to view all of the changes in this bill in the context of what else is happening to veterans. Veterans are not protected in any way from all the other very significant changes that affect older people in our community. Veterans, like other pensioners, will have to pay an extra 50c for every pharmaceutical script that they need and, of course, there is no compensating increase in the pension. What about what is going to happen to nursing home fees? We all know what is going to happen there. Dr Southcott-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. On a question of relevance, understanding order 85, I do not believe that the bill talks about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme or nursing homes.",33
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HANSARD REPORT,The member for Jagajaga will direct her remarks to the content of the bill.,34
39,Ms MACKLIN,HANSARD REPORT,"It is very important that veterans, in the context of this bill, understand how their circumstances are going to be changed. Of course, they are going to be very seriously affected by many changes in this bill. I think it is very important that they understand the context in which their circumstances are changing. As others in this House in the context of this debate have made clear, there are a number of other serious changes that will have a major impact on their stances. I have made considerable comment about the nursing home changes over the last few days, so I will forbear from adding them because I think we have made it very clear that veterans, like other older people our community, will have to pay, on $26,000 to get into a nursing home. They will also have to pay the additional fees for home and community care, which many of them are dependent on. Dr Southcott-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Under standing order 85, it appears that the member for Jagajaga is persisting in irrelevance. I ask you to take that into consideration.",34
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HANSARD REPORT,There is no hospital. point of order.,35
41,Ms MACKLIN,HANSARD REPORT,"The other area that I want is to touch on, which is very serious for veterRepatriation as, and I think very important for me to particularly with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in the chamber, that veterans are being seriously affected by the changes to funding for health services both the state and federal arena. I happen have a repatriation hospital in my own elecit; torate. I understand that the minister has recently written to my colleague the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), in answer to some concerns from veterans in my electorate about what is happening at the Austin and Repatririation ation Medical Centre. He stated. in his letter: As such, my department has an arrangement with the ARMC to reduce veteran waiting times in casualty. The minister would be aware that there are some serious problems. He goes on to say: If the hospital administrators are made aware of a veteran waiting in casualty for an extended period of time, the patient is redirected to a private contracted hospital rather than remaining unadmita ted in a casualty ward. It is important for me to say directly to the minister while he is here that that is in fact not happening. I had a letter from a veteran constituent of mine who was left for 15 hours on a trolley in casualty recently. He was then transferred to another public hospital where he circumwas finally admitted some hours later. Unfortunately, Minister, things are not happening in the way that you have described to in your letter. You may not have been given the correct information, but I think it is in important to raise in this place the fact that average, there are some serious problems. The second issue that the minister refers to in his letter are concerns about, as he said, the outbreak of golden staph at the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre. He has been informed, as he says in this letter to my colleague, that the outbreak was contained. We have had a series of major concerns revealed through the media about infection at this medical centre, including the Repatriation Basically, what is being said by senior infection control specialists in Victoria that the problems of infection control at the and the Austin hospitals are the say, result of serious budget cutbacks. That is being said not by me or other politicians, but is by senior infection control specialists. This infection control matter is serious. I in am not saying that the minister knows about to this matter and has not done anything about I am drawing his attention to the matter because it is serious. I would like to put this matter on the public record and ask him to address it as a very serious matter. Patrick Ball, one of my veteran constituents-I am sure he will not mind if I name him-has described the situation at the Repathospital in the following way: What is presently happening and is ongoing to this great hospital is an unmitigated disgrace and a national tragedy. The closure of wards and beds, reduction of staffs and services, constraints and restrictions imposed on doctors and nursing staff causing unnecessary stress, tension and frustration adding to an already excessive overwork. These are very serious matters that are affecting veterans in Victoria. They are pertinent to debate on veterans. I want to take this opportunity to raise them here today-and I know that the minister is concerned about veterans-because it is very important that he take a strong stand when it comes to dealing with the Victorian government which, I am afraid to say, has only seen the Repatriation hospital, along with the Austin, as yet another place to find budget savings. I call on the minister to urgently address serious problems that exist at these hospitals which have traditionally had the most outstanding reputation for care of veterans in our community.",35
42,Mr LINDSAY,HANSARD REPORT,"I draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to what I see as the cargo cult mentality which continues from the other side. It concerns me that there is this continued frightening of older Australians from the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). It is something that this side of the parliament is certainly going to vigorously oppose, because we do not think that is the way the debate should run in this country. In terms of cargo cult mentality-and I see the member for Jagajaga does not really want to listen to thisMs Macklin-I am very happy to listen.",36
43,Mr LINDSAY,HANSARD REPORT,"Thank you. So she will come back. It seems to be the policy of the opposition that the country can spend whatever it needs to spend, that we do not need to worry about our bottom line. The Australian public have woken up. We hear constantly about budget cutbacks and so on. Our problem is simply this: the country cannot spend more than it earns, just as you and I cannot spend more than we earn, without having a problem. In the last five years, the member for Jagajaga was part of a government that spent $80,000 million more than the country had and that caused a problem. We certainly did not cause that problem, but we do take the responsibility for fixing it. That is the direction in which part of the measures in this biII today are going to go. Thank you for listening to me. I would appreciate your support in helping the government fix this terrible problem that we have had in the last five years. It is with pleasure that I speak on this veterans' affairs biB this morning. The honourable member for Maranoa, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), has talked extensively about Australia's debt of gratitude to our ex-servicemen and women. He has spoken about this debt in the same way as the previous ministers for veterans' affairs, members and senators have. In that spirit, I rise to talk about the same debt today. Townsville takes a great pride in their Australian Defence Force service men and women, and rightly so. We also hold tremendous pride and respect for our veteran community. The hugely successful Australia Remembers campaign had its genesis in Townsville. I would like to reiterate Townsville's thanks and my personal thanks to the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Con Sciacca, for the work he put into making the Australia Remembers campaign the success that it was. Townsville's celebration attracted thousands of veterans, visitors, official guests and media from around the world. It was recognised as a centrepiece of the nationwide Australia Remembers campaign. I repeat what I said in my first speech to this House, and it seems ages ago now: as a member of the Townsville City Council, I both watched and participated in the Townsville and Thuringowa Australia Remembers campaign, as the entire community, both young and old, worked hand in hand with business and government to ensure that the Townsville VP50 celebrations were the tremendous success that they proved to be.",36
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HANSARD REPORT,"Mr Nehl)Order! Perhaps the honourable member for Herbert might endeavour to stay within the ambit of the bill, otherwise I am sure the member for Boothby will raise points of order against him.",36
45,Mr LINDSAY,HANSARD REPORT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I might seek your indulgence if he does raise those points of order. This is a wide-ranging debate, so I would seek your indulgence.",36
46,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HANSARD REPORT,It is not that wide ranging. I am not that indulgent either.,36
47,Mr LINDSAY,HANSARD REPORT,"Perhaps the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) might like to leave the chamber. Earlier this year when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) spent some time in my electorate, he paid an impromptu visit to the Townsville RSL, shouting the bar and, in fact, winning a couple of meat trays which he promptly donated back to the RSL. He was with the minister, too. The Prime Minister has a high level of respect for Australia's veteran community, as I would think all members and senators do. During times of conflict Australian men and women went to war to defend their country, their families, their friends and their freedom. During World War II, Townsville was briefly shelled on three occasions by Japanese planes. Almost overnight Townsville was transformed from a small regional township into an enormous military centre for both Australian and American service personnel. The bunkers and gun placements on Castle Hill stand as a permanent reminder to that period of our history. I have noted with interest that veterans' affairs has been one of those areas of recent times where both the government and opposition of the day have been, in many respects, closely aligned with one another. Australians will always have a debt of gratitude to pay to our veteran community and this bill goes a long way in respecting that debt-as did the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. I) 1996 and as will the government's health policy for the veteran community in rural and remote areas. While I do not consider Townsville to be either a remote or a rural centre, you do not have to go far outside of the Townsville and Thuringowa region to get the impression that you are isolated from services and service centres. If you look at the distribution of veterans, war widows and widowers in Queensland, a large number of people are located in rural and remote areas throughout central and northern Queensland. Some 22,488 Queensland veterans, war widows and widowers are located in rural areas, either large or small. A further 1,617 are identified as being located in remote Queensland areas. These are considerable figures. It is hard enough getting around some places in rural and regional Queensland as it is. Inevitably, as we grow older the unavoidable stresses and strains that come with time also start to impact on our lives and our ability to travel freely. I am sure the members for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and Kennedy (Mr Katter) know only too well the problems that many of their constituents face on a daily basis. It is not as though public transport is a readily available luxury. In many areas, sealed roads are still considered a luxury. I am glad that one of the first portfolio tasks the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has set himself and this government is to look at the needs of veterans and war widows and widowers in rural and remote locations. While we talk about our debt of gratitude to the ex-service men and women of Australia, it is impossible to overlook the recipients of the Victoria Cross. Amendments contained in this bill will see the current allowance paid annually to the three surviving Australian VC recipients- Sir Roden Cutler, Mr Keith Payne and Mr Ted Kenna-increased from $250 to $2,700. The heroism and selfless acts of bravery all VC recipients performed during combat are worthy of recognition. I do not mean to suggest that we should glorify war. In fact, I think it is very important that we remember and reflect on the mistakes of the past that led to war and conflict so that they are never repeated. But the actions of our VC recipients more often than not involved them putting their lives at great risk in attempting to save and/or protect other people's lives. This is something that should be remembered and honoured. The British government has recently increased the Victoria Cross allowance it pays from £ 100 to £ 1,300, backdated to 17 August 1995. The Australian allowance will also be backdated to 17 August 1995, ensuring that the financial acknowledgment of the valour of our veterans will now be no less than that paid by other governments. I am pleased that this bill contains amendments to correct anomalies in the defence service homes scheme. Eligibility for DSH assistance is to be extended to, persons who served in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia-within the dates specified in schedule 2 to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986-and to persons who first enlisted in the Defence Force on or before 14 May 1985. Members would be aware that back in 1993 eligibility under the defence home owner scheme was extended to cover operational service in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia. However, operational service coverage was not provided under the DSH scheme. As a result, due to breaks in service in a small number of cases, some ADF personnel who enlisted before 15 May 1985 and who served in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia have not served the necessary period of six years service to be eligible for DSH assistance. This has been an unfortunate oversight and I am pleased that the government is taking steps to correct it. The amendments will ensure that the small number of veterans who have previously fallen through this gap will now be able to receive assistance. There will also be amendments extending eligibility for DSH assistance to certain widowers of World War II servicewomen. According to the explanatory memorandum that was issued with this bill, these amendments remove the restrictions which prevent a widower of an eligible World War II servicewoman, who has been previously provided with initial assistance as an eligible from being eligible for another initial loan on the basis of his widower status. The other amendment in relation to the Defence Service Homes Act 19 I 8 relates to the reduction of interest rates on new additional advances provided to a person under the DSH scheme. The reduction in interest rates on new additional advances under this scheme will be from 10 per cent to 6.85 per cent per annum. That is good news. Although it is expected that this change will assist only a relatively small number of people, those whom it will affect will welcome this amendment. People who currently seek further advances because they did not take the initial maximum $25,000 loan advance at 6.85 per cent have to do so at an interest rate of 10 per cent per annum. This change will mean that eligible people can access further advances for such things as home repairs and maintenance and do so at a significantly lower level of interest. The coalition is looking after our Defence Force service men and women at both ends of their careers. Earlier this year the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) introduced amendments to the defence home owner scheme which will benefit a large number of serving ADF personnel. These amendments increase the loan limit available under the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance Act) 1990 from $40,000 to $80,000. Personnel who had previously accessed a loan did not miss out either. They were given the chance to increase their loan to that $80,000 mark if they wished. In addition, eligible persons and eligible spouses with joint loan entitlements are able to potentially increase their maximum combined loans from $80,000 to $160,000. The minister also introduced amendments to reduce the basic eligibility service period under the act from six to five years for members rendering full-time service. Reservists were also given access to the loans scheme following completion of a basic period of eight years. These particular amendments have been warmly welcomed by the large number of Australian Defence Force personperson, nel stationed in Townsville at Lavarack Barracks and RAAF Garbutt. The amendments in respect of the defence service home scheme contained in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation 'Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill 1996 will likewise be welcomed by Australia's veterans community. This bill also seeks to amend anomalies in relation to funeral benefits. The background paper to this bill states that the current act provides for the payment of funeral benefits to the estate of certain deceased veterans, towards the funeral expenses of other veterans, and for a reasonable charge for transporting the deceased person in certain circumstances. It continues: A payment for transportation expenses is currently not payable for a deceased veteran who is eligible for funeral benefits only by reason that he or she died in financial need. This bill seeks to extend eligibility for benefits payable for a person who dies away from home in financial need. This benefit will apply to any applications made after 20 August 1996-budget night-as applications can be lodged up to 12 months after the death of a veteran. Again, this is a change that will be of particular comfort to veterans in rural and remote regional centres. It is a regrettable fact of life that people in the later stages of life need closer medical attention. For people in remote areas, those services are not always readily available. In the past, Australia has always talked about the tyranny of distance in relation to trade with Europe and America. For many people in rural Queensland and rural and remote Australia, the tyranny of distance is an everyday fact of life. Great advances and improvements have been made over the years, particularly in the area of the Flying Doctor Service. Yet, time and time again, government after government has failed to adequately address one of the central problems: attracting doctors to and being able to keep them in regional and rural areas. If a veteran in a remote part of regional Australia falls seriously ill to the point of requiring hospitalisation-and many of our war veterans do come from these centresthat often means travelling large distances to access those services. Regrettably, they sometimes pass on alone and away from home and regrettably they sometimes are in circumstances of financial need. The changes in this bill address those needs. They are sensible changes, and I support them wholeheartedly. There are a number of other points worth addressing in this bill, because it is a wide-ranging bill. I am sure my colleagues will address some of those. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the fact that we do owe our veteran community a debt of gratitude. Every year I am amazed by the new interest that is shown in our veteran community. Every year on ANZAC Day most of us have seen the crowds of young children growing and growing. Many of them have had grandparents and great-grandparents who have fought in war, defending Australia and other countries. The renewed interest they show should be nurtured and treasured, for it would be a shame if we allowed that interest to fade away. I am certain that it never will. The measures in this bill that is before the House at the moment certainly have the sentiments that I have just outlined. I commend the bill to this House.",36
48,Mr MCCLELLAND,HANSARD REPORT,"Initially I must take issue with a point made by the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). He expressed some disdain for the opposition having what he described as a 'cargo cult' mentality. At the same time he said-and we unquestionably agree with his comment-that all Australians owe a debt of gratitude to our veteran community. That, of course, is very much the fact. Quite simply, you can't put a dollar value on the tremendous contribution and sacrifice that they made for our nation. It was a point stressed by the President of the United States in his historic address to this parliament. The contribution they made was not only to our nation but also to the cause of democracy around the world, which during this century has really been given life in a dramatic way in so many countries as a result of the efforts of human beings from around the world, including very much our own veteran community. I also echo the sentiments of the shadow minister, who said that as you go around RSL clubs--certainly I have found it in my electorate-there is tremendous respect for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and, indeed, for the former minister, Mr Con Sciacca by both the veteran community and members of the armed forces. But we have one primary policy when it comes to veterans-you don't save money at the expense of our veterans. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) said in the context of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill 1996 that it is necessary to look at the provisions of this bill against the totality of the infrastructure which exists in respect to aged care generally. I agree with that. If you ignore the totality of that infrastructure, these veterans measures risk being seen as just gestures.in the face of an otherwise somewhat oppressive set of provisions and challenges now faced by our veterans community. Having said that, there is unquestionably a number of beneficial things in this bill: for instance, the benefits which are going to be paid in respect of our three surviving Victoria Cross awardees. I recall seeing the news when they were awarded the special transportation benefits in this parliament. It was an historic occasion where members of the House rose and gave those three men a standing ovation which was well and truly called for. So any recognition of the contribution they as special Australians have made is certainly welcome. Equally, the funeral benefits contained in the bill are welcome, as are extensions to the defence home owners scheme. Otherwise, it is not extremely difficult to detect those areas where there are detrimental impacts on the veterans community. They are contained in the financial impact statement in the bill and are described as 'savings' for the government. Those are the matters which I would like to address again in the context of what is happening to the general veterans community. The member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) described the fact that, by the year 2000, 60 per cent of the veterans community will be over 75 years of age. In fact, veterans make up about one-quarter of the male population over 65 and seven per cent of women over that age are either veterans or war widows. Together they make up about 15 per cent of the total population over the age of 65. In other words, the infrastructure of the system in respect of aged care and benefits for senior citizens very much impacts upon the veterans community. I will not dwell on matters which have been the subject of debate both in matters of public importance and earlier in this debate, but the shadow minister and the member for Jagajaga referred to the need for senior citizens to face the issue of a nursing home entry contribution fee if they are going to go into any nursing home of reasonable quality. Certainly, there may be nursing homes which do not charge that fee, but they will not be the nursing homes which are in demand and, regrettably, they will be the lesser standard nursing homes. From my perspective and that of the opposition, our veterans are entitled to the very best of care. It will be those higher quality nursing homes which will inevitably, by the simple fact that they are in demand, take the opportunity to charge the nursing home entry contribution fee. The income testing of recurrent subsidies will also fall heavily on the veterans community whereby they will lose 25c in the dollar above the pension-free area of $98 a fortnight, up to a maximum I understand of $238. Equally, the member for Jagajaga has referred to the additional 50c per prescription under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It is a fact of life that, after the age of 75, it is frequently necessary for senior citizens, and indeed veterans, to purchase a number of prescriptions that will certainly eat into their fixed income. The increased user charges on home and community care will also have a dramatic effect on veterans. The fact of the matter is that there are a very significant number of veterans living at home on their own and, of course, they are ageing rapidly. It is that sector of our population in particular which is going to use and need home and community care services. The ultimate burden that will fall on our veterans will largely depend upon whether state governments come into fill the vacuum for the increase in these charges. But, if they do not, most certainly our veterans community is going to be hit very hard by those charges. In addressing the specific areas where we disagree with the bill, the opposition also strongly objects to the amendments relating to earning credits. Previously the earning credit scheme enabled single pensioners an earning credit of $1,050 and couples $2,100 to offset earnings on employment before their pension entitlement was affected. In many ways, the scheme was not dissimilar from that applying to first-class athletes who attain high incomes during the years of their sporting successes and have the ability to, in some way, spread that over future taxation years. That scheme enabled veterans to take the benefit of shortterm engagements-which was consistent with both their health and the availability of job opportunities-without risking the administrative nightmare of losing and then having to reapply for their pension entitlements. We in the opposition say that it is a very retrograde step indeed to penalise those veterans who are attempting to care for themselves and may wish to earn some additional income to have a holiday, for instance, or at this more demanding financial time of the year to buy Christmas presents. We say that is quite unfortunate and unnecessary. It is quite a chronic indictment of the government that the scheme is being abolished because of difficulty which has been experienced in understanding the scheme. Certainly we do not expect members of the veterans community to be tax lawyers but, with some guidance by the department, veterans most certainly would have been able to come to terms with those benefits. The statistics indicate that members of the veterans community are very avid readers and if time had been taken to explain these provisions they most certainly would have been more fully utilised. In that context, the opposition expresses very real concern with the fact that the government has reduced the resources available to the Department of Veterans' Affairs by 15 per cent. That restricts and limits the department's ability to inform people and to provide services to the veterans community. The opposition also strongly opposes the amendments to change the method for calculating the period for which a veteran is precluded from receiving a pension entitlement after receiving lump sum compensation. Presently, a lump sum compensation payment receipt is divided by the average weekly male income, which is about $540, to work out the preclusion period. For instance, if a compensation payout of $50,000 were divided by the average weekly male earnings, it would result in a preclusion period of just under two years. By dividing that same lump sum figure of $50,000 by the maximum pension which is payable to a single person, which is $397, that preclusion period would be extended by an additional six months. We say that that is most harsh and quite unnecessary. If a veteran has suffered a disability or an injury, they entitled to additional sympathy; they do not need the government effectively being a parasite upon that compensation payment before providing well-earned assistance. The opposition also opposes the inclusion of all interest payments in calculating veterans' earnings. Interest will now be deemed to have been earned by veterans on their investments. Whereas currently the first $2,000 for singles and $4,000 for couples was exempt from deeming because it was below the threshold rate, those small and really quite trifling figures are now going to be included in the totality of earnings. On my research, and as referred to by the member for Jagajaga, very few financial institutions in fact pay interest at that deeming rate on such small sums. As the member for Jagajaga pointed out, the department's own figures indicate that some 121,000 allowees are going to be affected by that particular decision of the government. It unquestionably amounts to a broken promise, and that is regrettable. It is really penny pinching, and it is penny pinching in the face of what I and government members have referred to as the tremendous contribution the veterans community has made to this nation. I think it is generally conceded that the former Labor Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca, did a tremendous job in looking after the interests of veterans. In 1996 he introduced a $50 million package to provide a number of benefits to the veterans community, having regard to the fact that they are now moving into their senior years. Those steps were contained in a document called As time goes by: Continuing the commitment. It is regrettable that, while some measures in this bill do benefit the veterans community, the bill does not go nearly as far as required. For instance, a 1994 task force report indicated that there were two major policy issues that should be adopted in respect of veterans. One was the recognition of veterans as a special community of interest in aged care planning and the second was the establishment of a three tier consultation process between the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of Human Services and are Health and ex-service organisations to develop aged care priorities. The government has unquestionably acted contrary to those suggestions. Because of their age, veterans have been hit even harder by those things which I have referred to-higher pharmaceutical benefits contributions and nursing home fees. In respect of the coordination between departments to improve the level of service provision, the government has actually reduced the resources available to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Clearly, health is a major concern to veterans. A recent survey has thrown up that at least a third of veterans suffer from illnesses. Indeed, they said that they experienced 'a lot of bother' from their health problems. Health is an imperative and coordinated health is a chronic need for veterans. Equally, 42 per cent of veterans believed that things could be done to improve their health. That is certainly an area I would like to see the government concentrate upon. Prevention is always cheaper, certainly much more successful and obviously much more human than simply trying to put medication into the equation after an illness has occurred. I would like to see the government do much more for health care for veterans. Indeed, the former Labor government before losing office was in the process of considering extending the gold health care card which currently exists for World War I veterans and World War II veterans. Given that they make up the majority of the veteran community, it is really now a time for the parliament as a whole to look very carefully at that. I think, well and truly, World War II veterans have earned the right to have that gold health care card to enable them to access obviously needed health care. The other point that came out of the survey of veterans was their strong desire to remain in their homes. I would like this government to give specific thought to that measure given its increased charges for home and community services. Things like the home nursing visits and meals on wheels services should be looked at as an essentiality for veterans rather than a privilege. I believe the government could also do a lot of work in that respect. In summary, while there are some benefits in this bill, it is unfortunate that there are any savings to be made at the expense of our veterans community. Quite frankly, we consider that the government should be deplored where they have done that.",39
49,Dr SOUTHCOTT,HANSARD REPORT,"The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill 1996 introduces the first instalment of the government's veterans' affairs budget commitments. By reviewing and correcting certain anomalies in veterans' entitlements, the government has been able to make certain amendments to the relevant statutes which will improve the well-being of our veterans and their families. These amendments honour key pre-election promises to the veteran community. The promises delivered during the election were very important to the electorate of Boothby. Containing, as it does, the Daw Park Repatriation Hospital, Boothby has a significant veteran community which includes two veterans of World War I. It has been said that the legacy of a war lasts 100 years after peace has been declared. That is to say, long after the conflict they served in has become a memory, long after the captains and the kings depart, veterans and their dependants not only deserve our gratefulness and appreciation but also require our support' and care. To highlight this, in 1991 the Veterans Administration in the United States actually had a Confederate widow in its care-125 years after Appomattox. In the same year the Bulletin featured a profile on Australia's veterans from all wars which included a 112-year-old man who was a survivor of the Boer War and who claimed to have known Breaker Morant personally. In 1990 Australia had 120 surviving veterans of World War I-incredibly 60 of them were fit enough to return to GaIIipoli for the dawn service on 25 April 1990. I found that service very moving and I am sure, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Quick, knowing that your father was an original ANZAC, you would have too. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has informed the House, the last surviving Australian veteran of the ANZAC Day landings, Ted Matthews, turned 100 years old last month and was visited by the Prime Minister in Sydney. All of these examples highlight my contention that the responsibility a country owes its veterans and their dependants long outlives the governments who committed the nation to that conflict. With that in mind, all members of our community should appreciate and respect the sacrifices that veterans and their dependents have made. One of the key features of this bill is the proposal to amend the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. Put simply, the amendments are designed to extend eligibility for defence service home assistance to those who served in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia. The defence service home scheme provides financial benefits to certain people who have served in the defence forces. The main benefit available under this scheme is interest subsidies. The maximum loan available is $25,000 with the loan repayable over 25 years. For new borrowers, the interest rate is currently fixed at 6.85 per cent for the term of the loan. Under an agreement between the government and Westpac, the government provides a subsidy to the bank which provides the low interest rate loans. Where a person has taken less than the maximum amount of the loan, they may request an additional advance. Currently, section 33 of the Defence Services Homes Act 1918 provides that the rate of interest for an additional advance is 10 per cent. In the current interest rate climate with interest rates having fallen to such a low level and housing affordability being its highest in 20 years the rate of 10 per cent is not competitive. Item 4 of schedule 2 will substitute a new section 33 into that act. Under the proposal, the following rates will apply: if the person's current loan is subject to the 6.85 per cent interest rate, that rate will apply to an additional advance; if the person's current loan is subject to the 3.75 per cent interest rate, which applied prior to the 6.85 per cent rate, and they have already received an additional advance at the 10 per cent rate, then additional advances up to $10,000 will be subject to the 10 per cent rate; additional advances between $10,000 and $13,000 will be subject to a 7.25 per cent rate; and amounts in excess of $13,000 will be subject to the 3.75 per cent rate. As stated before, eligibility under the scheme is to be extended to people who first served on or before 14 May 1985 and who served in the operational areas of Iraq, Kuwait and other gulf countries, Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia during Australia's deployment to those areas. This aims to address the situation where the person had broken service to complete the six-year eligibility criteria. Secondly, a widower who is eligible in his own right to receive a loan and whose wife was also eligible for a loan will be able to access an advance in either his own right or as a widower. The change will apply to widowers of W orId War II servicewomen and corrects an anomaly where access to the advance is available to widows of World War II servicemen but is not available to relevant widowers. The amendments mean that people will be able to use these advances for purposes such as home repairs or modifications without having to pay what is effectively a penalty interest rate. Over the last 10 years, there have been several occasions on which this nation has recognised the service of their veterans. Several of these stick in my mind as occasions when the nation proudly recognised the service of our veterans. I think the welcome home March for Vietnam veterans in 1987 was a turning point in the way that Australians recognised service in that war. Similarly, the establishment in 1992 of a memorial for the Vietnam War and those 500 servicemen who did not return was very moving when I saw it on television. The visit this year to Long Tan and Nui Dat on August 18 by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), himself a Vietnam veteran, and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) commemorated the service of our Defence Force personnel in that conflict. Two moving ceremonies recognised the service of our World War I veterans. One I have mentioned previously was the dawn service at ANZAC Cove in 1990, and the other one was in France in 1993 which commemorated the 75th anniversaries of the ANZAC landings and the armistice. On both those occasions, World War I veterans aged between 93 and 103 returned to the beaches and the fields which had forged them, which had seared them in their youth. Last year the Australia Remembers campaign was a civic highlight for many groups and individuals in Boothby, as a number of ceremonies and functions recognised the service of those who fought and served in World War II. As the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) has already mentioned in this debate, one of the interesting things to see was how many young people voluntarily attended that ceremony. One of the highlights for me was a dinner held by the Mitcham council which was attended by a World War I veteran as well as many who served in World War II. When he was introduced, they said, 'That is him standing at the back.' While people were delighted to have a World War I veteran there, they were amazed that, rather than sitting down, he was standing listening to all the speeches, something that those who are a bit younger would prefer not to do. So veterans play a key role in Australian life and society. They deserve the gratitude and respect of their country. Australia's involvement in conflicts has shaped us as a nation. Australian art reflects the way that has touched our society. In the 1970s and 1980s, Australian films gained a reputation for well-made, high quality movies, with pictures such as Breaker Morant and Gallipoli which focused on Australia's involvement in war, highlighting how horrific war is for those involved. David Malouf's The Great World looked at how war has touched families in Australia over a period of 80 years-a period of three generations. I suspect that some people overseas, especially in the United Kingdom, still think that Nevil Shute's A Town Like Alice is an accurate reflection of what life is like in Australia at present. Eric Bogle's And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda is one of the most evocative folk songs that I have heard about Australia's ANZAC tradition. And it is incredible to think that Eric Bogle wrote that song after living in Australia for only two years. After such a short time in Australia, he was able to write what I think is a quintessential Australian anti-war song. In the 1960s there was a feeling that somehow the ANZAC tradition glorified war; that the ANZAC Day marches were about the glorification of war. I have never thought that. I thought they are more about remembering how horrific war is and how much it must be avoided. Alan Seymour's One Day of the Year highlighted the cynicism of a younger generation and the disdain they held for such institutions as the ANZAC Day march and the Returned Services League. It is a fair question to ask how a younger generation in the 1990s perceives Australia's traditions and how they feel about Australi as veterans. As I have already mentioned, one of the surprising things about the Australia Remembers campaign was to see how many people in their teens, in their 20s and in their 30s were attending the Australia Remembers marches and the Australia Remembers functions. Three years ago, I visited Turkey and I made, as many Australians do, a pilgrimage to Gallipoli. Walking around well-known names like the Nek, Lone Pine, ANZAC Cove and the trenches which are still there at Quinns Post and Courtneys Post, I met 20 or war 30 other Australians, most of them in their 20s. Coming from a generation that has been spared direct contact with war or a major conflict, what I defected amongst those young Australians was a need to understand why Australia was fighting overseas in World War I and a feeling that it was important as an Australian to visit Gallipoli; that Gallipoli was an important part of what it is to be an Australian. On the day I was there, few articulated why it was important to visit but most knew that it was. As we approach the centenary of Federation, it is evident that young Australians are still looking for positive role models and heroes in our history. Many Australians have visited overseas destinations like VillersBretonneux, the village which in 1918 the Australians were able to save. After World War I the reconstruction of that town was largely paid for by the people of the state of Victoria. Even now you can go to schoolrooms in Villers-Bretonneux where there are signs that say 'N'oubliez jamais I' Australie!' - never forget Australia! Similarly, the veterans of the Kokoda track have an important place in the pantheon of Australian heroes. What that does for me is demonstrate a wider interest in, and a respect for, the deprivations endured and the achievements made by our veterans who defended freedom. Working at the Daw Park Repatriation Hospital in the centre of my electorate, I had the opportunity to care for many veterans of World War II and even occasionally a veteran of World War I, and I was able to gain an understanding of their special needs. One of the things that I have enjoyed as a representative member and, prior to that, as a candidate has been having the opportunity to meet with the members of the different RSL branches in my electorate, their presidents, their committees, and usually to have a dinner or enjoy the dawn service with them. I commend this bill to the House.  congratulate the honourable member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) for his contribution this morning. Indeed, before I get onto the veterans' affairs legislation, I suppose the last function I attended was at the St Marys RSL with the member for Lindsay (Ms Jackie Kelly); the Vietnam veterans were having a very early Christmas party which was very well attended. I am reminded that those who served in the Vietnam War were not always welcomed back to Australia as they should have been. I concur with the honourable member for Boothby about how important the welcome home march was and how important the memorial was-particularly for these veterans coming to grips with their experience. It would be not unusual for me to wish to compliment the former member for Bowman, the Hon. Con Sciacca, for all he contributed in the last parliament to the Australia Remembers campaign. That campaign, of course, was something which enjoyed support from both sides of the House as it then was. I think everyone concedes that Con, as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, did an outstanding job in developing the year-long celebrations that surrounded Australia Remembers. I am particularly pleased that we have a lasting memorial, if you like, to Australia Remembers. We have stage 1 of the special memorial gardens at Mount Druitt. They are beautiful now, and I am sincerely hoping that the RSL and the council will not forget to develop the further stages so that they will be not only as beautiful as they are now but quite outstanding. I apologise for raising a couple of things that may seem of a slight minor nature. However, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), in his second reading speech, indicated that there were a number of health initiatives he was taking that would not require legislation. One of those was the provision of multifocal lenses for veterans who prefer to use them. I must say that I am very pleased at this. I can happily report to the House that I am aware that one of my constituents, who is responsible for a rather significantly large file and whose name I will not mention, has already got his multifocal glasses which, indeed, his specialist required him to have. I am always interested in health issues surrounding veterans, and I must say that I am really concerned about a discussion I have had with one of the veterans in my electorate--; :ld I will not mention his name either. Hc attends at the Nepean hospital where he is required to fill out a Veterans' Affairs entitled patient declaration form. You might say that there is nothing too strange in that. But there are a few things that my veteran has drawn to my attention. Firstly, in the form, where it says 'I elect to be treated by doctors nominated by the hospital, or doctor and doctors to whom this doctor refers me-'doctor' being blank-the hospital always ticks the box that says 'doctors nominated by the hospital'. It is my understanding that this does not conform with the agreements reached with the New South Wales Health Department about the way veterans should be treated in hospitals. I would be most grateful if the officials at the table, or the minister, would be prepared to look into this matter. The second thing is that my constituent is required to provide details of his name, number and Veterans' Affairs number. But the form states 'If the department refuses to cover the costs of my hospital treatment, I acknowledge my liability to meet the hospital accommodation charge of' - and there is a blank-'per day if I elect to be treated by a private doctor' and he is forced to sign that, and the amount of money is not put in. With this ticking and his being forced to sign this declaration, we are not really looking after veterans who may be going to this particular· hospital. I would be interested to know if this is required in all hospitals. I believe the last thing that veterans would want to do when about to have treatment they believe they are entitled to would be to start to worry about whether they are covered for that treatment or not. Maybe this action is appropriate the first time a veteran visits the hospital of his choice-maybe. But this happens every time he visits the hospital of his choice. I just do not think that is good enough. I regret to say that veterans are going to become victims of the new nursing home arrangement that the government is putting in place. I suppose this is a little close to the bone for me, given the recent passing of my father, who was not a veteran. But this is one of the grave mistakes this government is making-a decision of complete indifference to frail age and inflicted upon veterans and war widows. Every time we on this side want to raise the issue, the government says, 'We're only mirroring what you did with hostel care.' It is true that we placed an up-front fee on hostel care. But, if one sets aside the specialist dementia units in my state, when people move into hostels they have a choice about accommodation; they are not being forced into a hostel and indeed they are capable of supporting themselves out in the community. When a veteran or a war widow goes into a nursing home, it is because they have been assessed by an aged care team as requiring that care. At the moment, in relation to nursing home care for veterans, there is no element of assessing the financial status of a veteranwhether he is a wealthy veteran, or a poor veteran, or a middle-class veteran or a battler. Once that medical assessment goes through, he is then in a queue and it is first come, first served. Under this new arrangement they have to find $26,000 up-front, and it is said that the nursing homes draw down only $2,600 a year. Any veteran has full access to all available beds irrespective of their wealth or lack of wealth at the moment. In hostels there are certain provisions for the financially disadvantaged and some beds are set aside, because there is an element of choice in hostels. But when people go into nursing homes they do not often go into the nursing home they end up staying the most time in. The point is that their spouse, or their family or the community, cannot maintain them in their current situation. They require specialist care and go into the nursing home. They may be in a nursing home for 12 months and pay $26,000 up-front, with $2,600 drawn down by the organisation providing the care. If they decide to move to what their relatives may consider a better or more convenient nursing home, it is another $26,000 upfront, with $2,600 drawn down a year. What if there is some change in family circumstances? If the family moves to Queensland, are they going to leave their relative in a nursing home in New South Wales? No. They will certainly want to try to move the relative closer to where they can visit and be involved with him. If the veteran has been in a nursing home for three years, it is $26,000 up-front, with $2,600 being drawn down every year. When the veteran moves to Queensland, it is another $26,000 up-front. It is a very inhumane system. The minister is saying, 'When it comes to veterans, we'll introduce a bit of flexibility; you'll be able to pay a monthly fee.' That sounds pretty reasonable-giving choice and a bit of flexibility. It sounds pretty reasonable, except when you look at it. If they are paying that fee on a monthly basis, they are going to have to find an additional $80 over and above the basic pension. I will tell you what this $26,000 up-front fee is going to do to a lot of veterans and their families. Let us say that a veteran is living with his spouse and they do not have the $26,000. The aged care assessment team has assessed them as requiring nursing home care--often the veteran is kept at home for perhaps a little too long, so the spouse's health starts to suffer. They go to a nursing home and ask whether they can be placed there. The nursing home will say, 'Are you able to pay the $26,000 up-front?' If they have to have a bed and have to pay the $26,000, or the partner or wife has to sell the house to provide the $26,000, I know what will happen. They will sell the house, because at the end of the day they will want the best care for their spouse or partner. When you have an expert team, backed up by your local GP, telling you, 'This is our assessment; unfortunately the veteran needs to be in a nursing home,' you are going to do everything in your power to do it. I really think this is sad. The last thing we should be doing to our veteran community and war widows is giving them unnecessary worry as their health declines in the latter years of their life. I think a lot of us can accept that there needs to be cost recovery, greater efficiencies and all of those sorts of things. But this $26,000 up-front fee is not going to provide one extra nursing home bed for a veteran or a war widow. That is the tragedy. I am not ideological about this. I have some very good nursing homes in my electorate. They are run by some of the religious and migrant communities and they provide an excellent service. But it is also true to say that there are many nursing homes that are run for profit-at the end of the day, they have to meet a bottom line. Unfortunately, in some instances that bottom line leads to a lesser service. In relation to nursing homes operated for profit, I cannot for the life of me see how this $26,000 up-front fee and the drawing down of $2,600 are going to do anything more than line the pockets of the proprietors. I have already spoken in this place about my objections to these measures in relation to the community at large. When members of parliament are gathered as we are to look at the situation of veterans, we have an extra responsibility to take account of and note of their welfare. I believe that history will prove us right on this side of the House: that the veteran community is going to be poorly served by the ruthless regime being introduced that requires an up-front amount of money for nursing home placement. If government members want to say to me that our system was not perfect, I accept that. If they want to say that changes need to be made, I will accept that too. I am more than happy to work with them and to look at ways in which we can provide more nursing home beds and high quality service more effectively and efficiently. We are putting this impost on war veterans and war widows at the time in their lives when they need to go into a nursing home, discriminating amongst them on the basis of whether or not they have $26,000, and perhaps forcing some of them to sell their houses. It is true that, in my mother's case, if this had been in we would not have had to sell the house because we could have found the money. But in my own heart I know that, if my mother had been confronted with that decision, that is what she would have done. I would like to think that, as a family member, I could have played a part; but I know deep down that what people want for their partners-and do not forget they have usually been married for a long time-is the best possible service. They will sell their homes and live with relatives just to meet this payment. If that is the outcome the government wants, fair enough, they will be getting it. But I really do not think it is. As I have said, I think that if we are not concerned about the frail aged in general-and I think we ought to be-let us take special note of the impact this will have on veterans and war widows. I want to say a few other things about this measure. I note that it has changed the deeming rate on accounts and allegedly simplified it. I think the government have simplified it by moving a free area as far as deeming is concerned. I think both sides of parliament understand that we need to have deeming; that is, it really is foolish when citizens who receive government benefits have quite significant sums of money sitting in accounts earning no interest. We also have to be careful when dealing with an older population-and by that I in no way mean any disrespect to them. I think the most common form of so-called liquid asset they hold is bank accounts or credit union accounts. They are very conservative people. Members of this House may have investment strategies and retirement strategies, but these people have usually been through a depression, which has made them very conservative about how they handle money. So, if we deem something at five per cent but banks do not offer interest rates on accounts at five cent, we are effectively taxing them. I note that the officials are at the table. Could the minister indicate when he sums up this debate whether the super investors in society who are very skilled at transferring money from bank accounts into shares, debentures, futures and a bit of property are the clientele we are talking about? I am sure some veterans and war widows, by the way, would do that, but what is the normal pattern of veterans and war widows in relation to handling what I think are, by and large, very modest sums of money? If it is the case that they use bank accounts and credit card accounts-and I believe it is-and we as parliamentarians insist that they be deemed to be earning five per cent interest from those accounts, we are effectively taxing them. It is an extra impost. Whether I am on this side or that side of the House, I would not want to stand up in this place and say that I believe in taxing the modest savings of veterans and war widows. I would be particularly interested in the minister informing the House in his summing up, if he would be kind enough to do so, whether or not this is the case and, if it is, whether he is satisfied with this particular measure in the bill. Perhaps we could take a microscopic look at what is happening to veterans and war widows in relation to deeming, and the lessons learned there may be applied to the wider pensioner population of Australia.",42
50,Ms WORTH,HANSARD REPORT,"The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill 1996 honours key pre-election promises to our veteran community. These measures will provide for simpler and more flexible entitlements, and the major initiatives cover the areas of health care, housing, rehabilitation, compensation and commemoration. Anomalies will be removed from the system, making it fairer and more efficient to administer, and service delivery to veterans will be improved. The government quite rightly gives due recognition to our veteran community for they are the ones who, in the prime of their lives, served their country so unselfishly. As a per mother of a 23-, 20and 17-year-old, I can understand how difficult it must have been for the mothers then, for our now older veterans were about those ages when they were doing so much for their country. The bill includes significant changes to the defence services home scheme, including a reduction in the interest rate from 10 per cent per annum to 6.85 per cent per annum for new additional advances. This will enable many veterans and their families to undertake necessary home repairs and modifications without having to pay what is effectively a penalty interest rate. I understand that around 500 veterans per year access this facility. When we think of the members of the veteran community, we often conjure up images of veterans from the world wars or campaigns fought in the Asian theatre since 1945. But it should not be forgotten that the veteran community is a continuously expanding community. This bill recognises the peacekeeping activities of the members of our Cambodian, Yugoslavian and Somalian contingents who first enlisted in the defence forces before May 1996. It should not be forgotten that these veterans have been involved in these operations for many of the same reasons as veterans from other conflicts-namely, the preservation of peace, justice and democracy-and they rightly deserve the same recognition. This bill will expand the defence services homes eligibility to those new members of the veteran community. As a matter of equity, the current anomaly whereby World War II widows who were also ex-service women can receive a second loan from the defence services home scheme but widowers of World War II ex-service women cannot will be corrected. These men will now be entitled to a second loan. The bill also provides an opportunity for some veterans to increase their incomes. In his second reading speech the Minister for Veterans' Affairs e Mr Bruce Scott) said: The deeming rules will be changed to make them less complex. For money held as cash or on deposit, a deemed interest rate, currently five per cent, will be applied to the first $2,000 for single pensioners and $4,000 for couples. This change will simplify pensioner notification requirements because individuals will no longer need to advise about small interest nuctuations. This has been perceived as intrusive. For some pensioners the change will provide an opportunity to increase their overall income. The introduction of a minimum variation regime will reduce the amount of administrative contact between the veterans and the department over small changes in income and assets. This should reduce the frequency of what can often be a frustrating or stressful necessity for some veterans, especially the more elderly. This measure will also reduce the administrative overheads for the department. At present, the rounding amount is only 10c and this will be increased to $1. In recognition of their duty performed above and beyond what would normally be expected, the three Australians still living who have been awarded the Victoria Cross will have their allowances increased from $250 to $2,700, in line with recent increases made by the British government. There is no reason why our VC awardees should receive any less than their British counterparts. It is expected that there will be a flow-on effect to the George Cross allowance, which is administered by the Department of Social Security. This bill also recognises the role played by veterans organisations in representing the interests of veterans, especially in the repatriation claims system. Staff of these organisations can currently access trammg programs on veterans' entitlements and services, but this increase in funding will now allow staff members to be increased thereby increasing the efficiency of a repatriation claims process. It will also increase the level of support veterans receive from their own community, which I believe should be the objective of any government. The bill will also no longer make it a requirement for war widows to advise the department about the purpose for which any advance payment of pension is required. Often this type of assistance is requested in times when the families of veterans are already under some pressure. The end of this type of intrusion by the government should be welcomed. A lump sum advance of up to $500, to be repaid over a period of up to six months, may be made eligible to service pensioners and income support supplement recipients. An anomaly will be corrected in relation to funeral benefits. A payment will be able to be made for costs associated with the transportation of the remains of a veteran who dies in financial need away from home when obtaining approved medical treatment. This assistance is available for certain other veterans who have died away from home. I am very pleased to actually be speaking on a day which will give me the opportunity to make a very special announcement. It is not often that things work out so conveniently on speakers lists. Today I am pleased and proud to announce that the government has provided a grant of $7,000, under our commemorative activities program, to enable a memorial to be built in Adelaide in honour of ex-service women of World War II. I thank the minister for ensuring that, after some years of trying, this grant application has finally attracted the attention and support which it rightly deserves. The role of service women in World War II was critical to Australia's war effort and, as our social history now tells us, was important to the emergence of women as equal participants in the work force. But women who served in World War II were not revolutionaries searching for a cause on which to wage a campaign. They were responding with pride and courage to the call of their country. That is a response which we honour and respect today and always. The government's commitment to the memorial in Adelaide is testament to the community support and dedication which has driven the project. In particular, I acknowledge the personal contribution made by Mrs Coral Farrelly. The government's $10.4 million commemorative activities program will be officially launched early already we have seen some major funding commitments made-in particular, $100,000 for the national nurses memorial, to be sited on ANZAC Parade, Canberra; and $150,000 for a national service women's memorial, to be sited in the sculpture garden of the Australian War Memorial. I have mentioned Coral Farrelly. I would just like to say a bit more about Coral and some of her activities. Mrs Coral Farrelly OAM is the President of the Council of United Ex-Service Women in South Australia. She has been campaigning for this memorial for some time. I first met her when the previous minister, Con Sciacca, introduced her to me early in 1995 at the Daw Park Repatriation Hospital. She was telling him how badly she needed this memorial. He in tum was saying to me, 'Here is a local woman member of parliament who can do something about it.' The memorial recognises those women who served Australia during the war years at home and overseas. Coral Farrelly has lobbied on behalf of her council. It was considered appropriate in the year of Australia Remembers to have some form of recognition because there is no memorial in South Australia. There are the playing fields, but no actual monument to commemorate those women who gave the best years of their lives to serve Australia. I guess at some stage all of us attempt to access funds from one particular area or another and try to negotiate deals involving state, local and Commonwealth governments and feel the frustration, as I have, over quite a period of time of trying to link it all up, case manage it and make it come together. I pay tribute to Con Sciacca for the work that he did in the year of Australia Remembers last year. I have heard others do that today. Coral is quite an extraordinary woman. I am so pleased that this is coming together and that it has fallen into place. It has fallen into place because of negotiations with the Adelaide City Council, which will put up $2,000 for the project. I am hopeful, after the application of a little more of the power of persuasion on my part, that they will perhaps throw in the grading and levelling of the ground, next year, but which will be necessary. The state government in South Australia has put up $5,000 through their 'art for public places' project. As well as the money, we have been able to benefit from the expertise. The Ex-Prisoners of War Association and the women's auxiliary, hearing of our activities, have found $700 and the 2/3rd Battalion of the machine gunners have put up $300. That adds up to $15,000. With some of the work, hopefully, being done for a good price, I am sure it can be well achieved. Coral and her girls, as she refers to them, have had a lot to say about the design, working cooperatively with 'art for public places'. There will be four faces featured on this monument. The faces will have the navy hat, the army hat, the air force hat and the nurses veil. I am very excited that it has finally come into place. I am hopeful that it will be erected by ANZAC Day next year, because it will be situated north of Government House on the lawns facing out on to King William Street. Coral and her girls were particularly anxious that it be situated along there so that when the ANZAC march takes place down King William Street it will be there for all to see. I think it is particularly important that the memorial be in an accessible place so that our younger generation and their children will be able to view it in the years ahead. That is the very special thing about monuments and memorials. As we have said before-in fact, veterans themselves have said before-it is not to glorify war but is a reminder of the sacrifices made' by veterans, our ex-service men and women, and to remind future generations that war is not worth it and that peace should be worked for. I am also pleased to be able to have this opportunity and time remaining to me to say what a great pleasure it has been for me to mix with the ex-service community in South Australia-the veteran community. It is always a learning curve for any member of parliament because of the experiences they have not only in this place but particularly in their electorate. My father was a member of the air force and fought in New Guinea in the Second World War. My late uncle Frank was in the army. My brother's name went into the draw for national service during the Vietnam War. His marble did not come up but that of many of my friends did. I remember them. Last year's Australia Remembers year and, in particular, my own experience with the ex-service community, has been very special to me. I was elected to the federal parliament in March 1993. In April of that year I attended my first ANZAC dawn service at the Enfield RSL Club. I understand that I was the first member for Adelaide there since Chris Hurford. That caused some excitement. People such as Ray Green, Morrie Stanford and others there have remained my friends ever since. It is like going home when I go back there. I recall that it was there that I met Ian Dunn, the new state president of the RSL in South Australia, and his wonderful wife, both who contribute so much to their veteran community. I pay tribute to all those people. I am pleased to support this bill and commend it to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Leo MCLeay) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Consideration of Senate Message Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for requested amendment announced. Bill returned from the Senate with a request for an amendment. Ordered that the requested amendment be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's requested amendment(1) Schedule 1, item 20, page 8 (line 5), omit ""$326"", substitute ""$332"".",48
51,Mr ABBOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (12.44 p.m.)-I move: That the requested amendment be made. This amendment is of a technical nature only. It increases the amount that Open Learning Agency students can defer for the purposes of repaying through the HECS from $326 to $332 per unit of study. In other words, we are allowing people to defer a greater amount of the Open Learning Agency charge for HECS purposes. This is an amendment which will benefit students. Therefore, I trust it will be uncontroversial. This minor change is necessary because, when the original legislation was put in, the calculations which had produced the $326 figure were of an essentially provisional nature. Now that final figures are in, we are able to produce a more accurate calculation and, therefore, a better and more advantageous figure for students.  p.m.)-Is this particular request the only one being dealt with? Mr Abbott-My understanding is that this is the only one being dealt with now. Later on today there are likely to be two further requests relating to putting the 25 per cent requirement into the legislation.  to some of the more substantive proposals. I might as well do it now, rather than come down a second time later on. I will be extremely brief. We are fundamentally opposed to a number of the key measures contained in this higher education legislation. We see the amendments agreed to by the Senate as very minor amelioratives to the government's proposed changes. The most significant amendment is the Harradine proposition in relation to the reduction in the HECS free payment threshold. That was one of the major items in the bill, producing savings over the forward estimates years in excess of $800 million. The Harradine proposition inserts another provision, the effect of which is that HECS debts are not repayable in a particular year if a person is either exempt from paying a Medicare levy or eligible to pay a reduced rate of Medicare levy. The practical effect is to produce a number of thresholds which are higher than the government's proposals and which go up by a couple of thousand dollars for each child. On the face of it that looks rather attractive. The problem is that we are no longer talking about the taxable income of the individual HECS debtor; we are talking about the joint income of the HECS debtor and his or her spouse. When that is taken into account, the measure becomes far less beneficial. So much so that, on the figures provided to the Senate in the debate last night, the government stands to lose over the four years of the forward estimates only some $50 million of the $800 million that it intended to achieve in savings through the reduction of HECS thresholds. In other words, the government continues to get about 94 per cent of the originally proposed savings. From that statistic alone, it is clear that the degree of relief provided by the Harradine proposition is fairly slight. I think the problem with the Harradine proposItIOn is that it reflects an unrealistic view of social reality. It is hard to envisage there being many households of graduates with spouses or de facto spouses and some dependants on the sorts of incomes relevant to this discussion-the low to mid $20,000where there is not a second earner bringing in at least a few thousand dollars. That is the main reason why the cost of the measure is so slight, when compared with the government's proposal. As the bulk of people for whom HECS debts are relevant are either single or have few children, the degree of relief is pretty derisory at the end of the day. We do not see this Harradine proposal as in any way a significant offset to the negative impact of government's proposal. We are not going to be opposing the government's incorporation into the legislation of some specific provisions relating to the conditions for charging fees. We still say that the guidelines in relation to that ought be disallowable, but there is nothing in the amendments coming back from the Senate which we will be seeking to oppose. (Time expired)",51
52,Mr ABBOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (12.51 p.m.)-I take the point that the member for Sydney, the shadow minister for education  Harradine's amendments do ameliorate this higher education bill. I am pleased that he is grateful for small mercies. What has happened in the Senate, thanks to Senator Harradine's amendments, is an example of Senate scrutiny working at its best. What we have seen here is an example of senators scrutinising and, where appropriate, amending a bill, without defeating the government's legislative intentions. I commend this amendment to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Treaties Committee Membership",52
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," Mr Speaker has received a message from the Senate acquainting the House that Senator Carr has been discharged from the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and that Senator Cooney has been appointed a member of that committee. VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (1996-97 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed. Mr LEO MCLEA Y (Watson) (12.52 p.m.)-This Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill 1996, when looked at in isolation, may appear the fair to veterans but, when looked at in the budget context as a whole, the effect on veterans will be extremely unfair. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in his portfolio summary on the budget said that the budget demonstrates a strong and to unequivocal commitment of the coalition to the veterans who have sacrificed so much for this country. In fact, measures brought in with the budget-including up-front fees for nursing homes, increases in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and home and community care, as well as the most unkind cut of all, abolition of the Commonwealth dental program-show a definite lack of commitment by this government to the veterans community. So much for gratitude. During the First World War, 59,258 Australians died for our country. The effect of this sacrifice in the First World War was felt by every family in Australia at the time. Indeed, Australia's contribution in that war was proportionately larger than that of any other country in what was, in those days, the British empire. Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, would like to bring back the British empire. Fortunately, like the horrors of the First World War, the empire has gone now too. The sacrifices that Australians made in the First World War have been repeated in wars and conflicts many times since then. We remember those sacrifices that our fellow Australians made on days like ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day. Australia has undertaken to hold true to the memories of those who served and died by doing our best for those who returned from the conflicts-and those people often never recover from the conflictand for their families. So it is with sadness that I rise in this debate today to draw the attention of the House to those aspects of the government's programs in this budget which will badly affect the veterans community. This bill is just a little bit of a smokescreen by the government to pretend that it has actually done something. The budget decision on nursing home entry, for instance, is expected to raise $130 million per year from frail, sick and elderly Australians, including veterans. If the government genuinely felt any gratitude or commitment to veterans, one would have thought that it might have exempted veterans from the nursing home charge. But no. A lot of the people who will pay this charge will be veterans. The budget decision to force those in need of nursing home care to find the money upfront is an attack on people at a very vulnerable stage of their lives. We can find in the the papers that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) revealed in this House earlier this week that, if a veteran is living with his or her spouse in their family home and one of them has to go into a nursing home, they might be required to sell their home so that they can put their spouse into a nursing home. This is a person who fought for their country. What is this government's answer to them in the final years of their life? Sell your house to go into a nursing home. So much for gratitude by this government to the people who fought to keep us free. One of my constituents, Fred Jubb-who lives in Kingsgrove and was a member of the 2nd/12th Infantry Battalion-said to me that he thought this was a terribly mean thing for the government to do. That battalion was part of the 18th Infantry Brigade which inflicted the first land defeat on the Japanese in World War II at Milne Bay. So he and his colleagues actually began the roll back of the invasion of Australia. What does the government say to them? If you are old and sick now, you had better cough up $26,000 or $50,000. If you go from a hostel into a nursing home, you might have to pay it twice. If you do not have the money-even though you fought for your country, even though you may have been injured and have carried that wound with you all your life-sell your house and put your spouse into rented accommodation, because that is the only way you will get into a nursing home. Mr Martin-Or go into debt. The Prime Minister said to go into debt. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-As my colleague the member for Cunningham says, the answer of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to this was that they can go into debt. I would have thought that the debt there should have been the country's debt to them. The Prime Minister's answer to this for veterans is, if you or your spouse are ill and need nursing home care, you had better go into debt to pay the up-front fee. I think it is extremely mean if the government is going to make veterans pay this fee. The government intends to raise half a billion dollars from reform of aged care, and it is going to make a further saving of $88 million from additional user charges for home and community care facilities. It is obvious that the veterans community will be substantially hurt by that cost-cutting measure of the government through a reduction in the entitlements. As my colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) pointed out in this House earlier this week, people who are in need of home and community care will find that the costs will leave them very little from their pension if they are going to have to meet these extra charges. I take a very significant interest in the home and community care program because in the early 1980s I was the chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, whose inquiry into aged care facilities was the vehicle that put forward the proposal for the home and community care program. We believed that was necessary so that people could have a choice about whether they, in their frail and declining years, went into a nursing home or received help to stay in their own home to get on with their life. The government is going to charge people more for this. The effect of that will be that it will force more people into nursing homes. It will force veterans who fought for their country to have to make a choice about staying in their own home or having to sell that home. We as a government want to help people to stay in their own home. If a person or their spouse needs to go into a nursing home, the current government is going to force people to sell their home. There is a very dramatic difference in the approach of the Labor Party, which wants to help people, and the current coalition government, which wants to penalise veterans. The veterans are the people who fought to keep this country the way it is. Indeed, it is the injuries that those people received during the war which may have forced them to need nursing home care now. They might not have needed to go into a nursing home otherwise. So the government's gratitude and the government's commitment is: go into debt, as the Prime Minister said, or sell your house. It must really leave a bad taste in these people's mouths. The St George and Canterbury districts of my electorate have a very high concentration of people who depend on services offered by the home and community care program. Proportionately, there is an overrepresentation of people in my electorate who are veterans. The home and community care program has enhanced their independence, security and quality of life. But what the government is going to do now will make those veterans pay more. It will reduce their quality of life. In their young years they fought in the First World War, they fought in Korea or Malaya or in Vietnam. Now that they have got to the stage of needing some help and assistance, the government says, 'It doesn't matter about the debt we owe you. We're going to charge you more now.' Rather than the government putting up the costs of programs such as the home and community care scheme, meals on wheels, home maintenance and things like that for veterans, I think the government should be showing a little bit of compassion. In my electorate, 350 people use the meals on wheels program in Canterbury and 200 in Hurstville. They will either have to pay more or decide not to get the service. Elderly veterans whose health has declined--often because of war related matters-will, in some circumstances, now have to make the choice of whether they have five meals a week or seven. I think that is disgraceful. It is the same thing with the increase in the pharmaceutical benefits concessions. The patient contribution will affect a group of people on relatively small fixed incomes. Although the 50c increase may not seem very large to people in the government-the minister is earning $150,000 a year-it particularly is to elderly people, particularly those veterans who need a wide variety of medication. The government's axing in the budget of the Commonwealth dental program is perhaps one of the cruelest cuts. It will hurt veterans. Now a poor digger from Canterbury won't even be able to get his dentures fixed at the Canterbury Dental Clinic, as the government have stopped that too. They have cut out the emergency vouchers. Vets will now have to pay about $180 to get a cavity filled in their teeth. As the House can see, this phoney statement by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that 'Australia's debt to its ex-service men and women has been acknowledged in the 1996-97 budget with the honouring of key pre-election promises to the veterans community' - that is what the minister saidis a fabrication. It is an unkind and dishonest fabrication. The minister is going out there and saying to veterans, 'Look, we've really enhanced things. We've delivered on what we promised.' The truth is that when the government were going to the election they never went out there and told people about some of the things they were going to do. If they had told people in the veterans community, 'We're going to thank you very much for the contribution you made in defending your country by slugging you an upfront fee in excess of $26,000 per annum if you or your spouse want to go into a nursing home,' I think they would have got a pretty resounding no. If they had told the veterans that they were going to charge them more for their pharmaceutical benefits, I think the veterans would have given them a resounding no. I think if they had told the veterans that they were going to axe the dental program which the veterans need, they would have said no. If they had told the veterans that were going to increase the cost to them or their spouse of the home and community care program facilities like meals on wheels and home maintenance, veterans most certainly would have said no to the government. I think the minister's remarks here are rather hollow. The phoney propositions that the minister is putting forward with this piece of legislation are most unkind. There are some small things in this piece of legislation which are commendable. The increase in the value of the Victoria Cross allowance for the Australian recipients to $2,700, to bring it into line with allowances paid to British recipients, is reasonable; it is a good idea. A few people will profit and a large number of others will not. I think that is unfair. The opposition is concerned that the government will do nothing about deeming rates. A lot of veterans are trying to exist on their savings. The government has had two interest rate cuts in recent months which helped people who are trying to buy houses, but veterans who have been fortunate enough to own their house-even though they might have to sell them now to get into a nursing home-are existing on a small amount of money. The government will not reduce the deeming rate and, therefore, they are disadvantaged as against others. While some entitlements for veterans put forward in this legislation will be of small value to a small number of veterans, they are far outweighed by the policies that the government has implemented in the general aged care area. These policies will militate against veterans more than the rest of the community because the unfortunate fact of life is that, because of the difficult times that veterans went through in the defence of our country, their health is not as good as that of the general community. They are being hit harder and harder by this coalition government's attempts to rack up charges in the budget. While the opposition does not oppose many of the proposals in this bill, my colleague the member for Cunningham will be putting forward some amendments. Our general opposition to the government's position on aged they care is based on how its draconian cuts to aged care facilities will hurt the veterans community more than anyone else.",52
54,Mr CAUSLEY,COMMITTEES,"It is rather uncharitable of the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) to join in this debate today on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill and then try to run all the old misinformation stories on government policies that the Labor Party has been peddling for some time. The member for Watson is deliberately trying to mislead the parliament and veterans about the effectMr Leo MCLeay-I rise on a point of order. The member for Page only just bounced in here recently from the New South Wales parliament where, they tell me, anything goes. While he is misrepresenting my point of view-that is what one would expect-I do not think it is proper for him to suggest in any way that I have deliberately misled the House. I ask him to withdraw.",55
55,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"If the honourable member for Watson is offended that you have claimed he has deliberately misled the house, would you please withdraw that and then we can get on with the debate.",56
56,Mr CAUSLEY,COMMITTEES,I will withdraw the word 'deliberate' .,56
57,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Let us not get into a debate about this. Just withdraw it and let us get on with the debate.,56
58,Mr CAUSLEY,COMMITTEES,I will withdraw it.,56
59,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Thank you.,56
60,Mr CAUSLEY,COMMITTEES,I unreservedly withdraw it. I am just sorry that the member for Watson is so touchy.,56
61,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"It is late in the week and we are all touchy, so just proceed with the debate. Mr Leo MCLeay-I rise on another point of order. I am not touchy, I am just concerned that the member for Page is only telling half the truth.",56
62,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,There is no point of order.,56
63,Mr CAUSLEY,COMMITTEES,"The member for Watson has no credibility in this House because, if did, he would have been opposing most of the monetary policy that has caused these problems in the Australian electorate. The government had to react to the debt that had been building up over a period of time-a legacy of the Labor government. Obviously, that affects the policies of the government. The people of Australia realised that they could not continue to go down this track, and that is why the Labor Party was so comprehensively defeated in the election in March. I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott). The government made some promises to the veterans community about helping them in the areas in which they were disadvantaged. There is no doubt that this is an attempt to overcome the problems associated with the benefits that are given to this particular group in the community. Previous speakers talked about the Australia Remembers program last year. That was a great program and I congratulate the former government for going ahead with it. There is no doubt that members of the community of my age or younger are not well aware of what went on in the wars-the Second World War in particular, and obviously they know very little about the First World War as well. However, it is important for younger members of the community to understand the service that was given by these people in the theatres of war. My father-in-law served on the Western Front in France in the First World War. He told me stories about the disease, the conditions and the suffering that those troops went through and I think not too many people realise what they went through. My state colleague, the member for Monaro, Peter Cochran, has visited New Guinea and he trekked across the Kokoda Trail. I have spoken to him and, if you listen to people who have been there and understand what the conditions were like, you soon realise that these troops went through tremendous hardships. We should always remember, in particular in relation to New Guinea, that some of the troops who were there were only 17 years of age, very young men, because he most of our troops at that particular time were in the Middle East. We owe these people a very great debt and we need to do everything we possibly can to help them. I know that the minister has indicated that he is going to continue to amend the legislation to see that the promises that were made are carried through, and I hope that the parliament will be able to support him in that process. I think some of this is aimed at country veterans. We tend to forget that what is available in the city is often not available in the country and that it is a lot more difficult to provide those services in country areas. The minister is certainly attempting to overcome some of the disadvantages of veterans in country areas. I suppose the north coast of New South Wales is not as isolated as some areas but there are a lot of veterans retiring to the north coast. I had a visit only recently from a representative of the veterans on the Clarence River, Mr Len Judd. He came down to Canberra and spoke with the minister and put some very constructive suggestions to him. Obviously, they were well thought through because they will provide a better service to the veterans and save taxpayer's money. It is very constructive when people can come and talk to the minister and put forward very useful suggestions. There is no doubt that transport in country areas is a problem. There is a problem for people driving to doctors and driving to hospitals because they have to travel hundreds of kilometres at times to get attention. They are areas that we have to watch very carefully to see that we do give a service to these people who are so very entitled to it. (believe that the veterans are very grateful for the fact that the government is moving to help them in some way. One of the speakers before mentioned the fact that already they are taking advantage of the services that have been put forward in this amendment. I am sure that most people will be grateful for the fact that there is help available to them and the veterans that I have in my electorate have expressed that feeling to me. I am happy to stand here today to support the bill and I would again like to congratulate the minister for bringing it forward. Mr AbboU- Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for Page referred to the Kokoda Trail. Veterans always refer to it as the 'Kokoda Track. I think it is important to point that out. The word 'trail' is actually an invention of an American war correspondent which, unfortunately, was popularised.",56
64,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,I am sure we are all very grateful for the correction by the parliamentary secretary.,57
65,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to follow on from my colleagues in this chamber today to support the benefits of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill. My electorate of Robertson is based around the city of Gosford and encompasses the Woy Woy peninsula. It has one of the highest concentrations of veterans anywhere in Australia. In fact, according to official figures supplied by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, there are 9,260 people living on the Central Coast of New South Wales receiving a benefit of one kind or another from the Department of Veterans' Affairs and this figure includes approximately 2,000 war widows. The majority of these veterans live in my electorate of Robertson, the electorate which takes up the southern half of the Central Coast region. The need to support veterans and their families has never been greater. The inevitable march of time has claimed all but a handful of our gallant World War I veterans. Recently, on Sunday, 24 November, there was the sad passing of Mr Harry Newhouse. The Central Coast then lost its last living link with the Gallipoli campaign and with our ANZACs. Mr Newhouse lived on the Central Coast for many years at the Woy Woy Community Nursing Home and had attained the grand old age of lOI. He, in fact, landed at Gallipoli on the second day of the campaign-on 26 April 1915. His brother, George, had landed the day previously-the first day of the campaign, obviously-and was unfortunately killed in action at Gallipoli. So well respected was Mr Newhouse that a memorial service was held on the Central Coast this week at which messages of condolence were read from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott). Harry's memories were recently preserved for all in the wonderful publication The Last ANZACs. Mr Newhouse returned to Gallipoli in 1990 to honour the 75th anniversary of Gallipoli and was among a number of Gallipoli veterans who made that trip to honour those who had fallen there. And whilst our gallant World War I veterans are very few, there are thousands of World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War veterans and their families who are in increasing need of assistance. The average age of World War II veterans is now in excess of 70 years-proud men and women who gave their all for the defence of this country and made sacrifices that those of us from a younger generation cannot even begin to imagine. They are proud and independent men and women who do not easily ask for help or, indeed, do not expect help. As the free and strong nation that we are, we owe these magnificent people a huge debt, a debt which we will never be able to fully repay. And we have a duty as a government and as a nation to ensure that these men and women enjoy their senior years with dignity, respect and honour, secure in the knowledge that the government will ensure that the services and benefits that they require, particularly as they age, are freely available to them. We have, during this debate, heard the minister and honourable members on both sides of the House recognise this debt of gratitude. My colleague Peter Lindsay, the member for Herbert, highlighted the magnificent Australia Remembers initiatives which had the total support of the Australian parliaphasis ment and, of course, the Australian community. I must, however, state at this point my disappointment and my anger that, on taking over as the member for Robertson, the only paper-and I do mean the only paper-that was left in my office by my predecessor was over 3,000 Australia Remembers certificates which had not been issued to the veterans of Robertson. This, of course, meant that many eligible veterans and their families missed out on this magnificent memento of the Commonwealth's recognition of their service during the war years. Many veterans have endured severe injuries and disabilities brought about by the horrors of war. As time marches on the need for medical, physical and emotional support only hecomes more urgent. I would like to take the opportunity at this stage to commend the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for his dedication to and compassion for the men and women that he represents. Under his guidance and the able assistance of his department, many areas of concern and individual problems of veterans on the Central Coast have been addressed. In just eight months of government, this minister has already visited the Central Coast of New South Wales on two occasions. The first was a visit to my electorate to present two very significant federal government grants to assist with the provision of housing and care for veterans. The first grant of over $281,000 was to the Woy Woy Community Nursing Home. This money will be used for the construction of a new hostel which will cater for an additional 40 people, with 15 places specifically for veterans. It was on this occasion when the minister visited the Woy Woy Community Nursing Home that I had the privilege of introducing Mr Harry Newhouse to the minister and they chatted for some considerable time. On the same occasion, the minister also presented a grant of $339,500 to the Gosford RSL Leisure Living Centre. This money, again, will be used to upgrade facilities and to also provide a new dementia wing with the specific emon care for veterans. These two grants are just another illustration of the commitment and dedication that this government has shown in providing the services and support that are required for veterans. Yet another indication of this commitment by our government was the announcement yesterday in this place by the minister of an additional $180,000 annually to ensure that veteran grave site memorials in civilian cemeteries are maintained to the high standard expected by the veteran community and the general public. The Office of Australian War Graves, which is responsible for the care of grave site memorials, already spends over $1,277,000 annually maintaining war graves in Australia and Papua New Guinea. This additional money will be used to carry out maintenance work on memorials in Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and Roma. Many of these grave sites have been maintained by families and by volunteers and it is now becoming increasingly difficult for the veterans, most of them now in their 80s, to continue to maintain some of these sites. It is obviously a government responsibility to ensure that these sites are maintained in the manner which the veterans and the community at large expect. The veterans' affairs legislation amendment bill introduces the first instalment of the government's veterans' affairs budget commitment. The majority of the measures in this bill are designed to address various anomalies in veterans' entitlements and undertaking in the coalition's policy statement on veterans' issues. In addition, other measures in the bill will greatly improve the administration of veterans' programs. This will enhance service deliveries to our veterans, simplify compliance and be less intrusive on the lives of our veterans. Amendments relating to the extended deeming will simplify deeming regulations, freeing veterans from the need to advise the department of minor variations in interest received. Many veterans have reported to me that this requirement is overly intrusive. Not only will this amendment free veterans from this requirement but it is anticipated that banks and building societies will continue the practice of providing accounts offering an interest rate equal to the deeming rate. Presently the first $2,000 for singles and $4,000 for couples held as cash or deposit money is assessed at the actual interest rate payable if in fact that rate is less than five per cent. This current exemption has added considerable complexity to the income assessment rules of financial assets. Each time a veteran's bank or financial institution's savings or investments underwent an interest rate fluctuation, no matter how minor, the veteran was required to advise the department. Many veterans, particularly those in their advanced years, have had difficulty in complying with this regulation and find it overly intrusive. Under these amendments this will no longer be necessary. The changes will give many pensioners the opportunity to increase their overall income. Amendments relating to funeral benefit paid to the relatives of deceased veterans will equity and simplicity and will be less personally intrusive to the families of veterans who have passed on. The benefit will be in relation to the transportation charges of the deceased veteran who died in financial need and will be paid from 20 August 1996. Applications for this benefit may be lodged up to 12 months after the veteran's death, so a benefit may be payable in respect of a veteran who passed on considerably before 20 August this year and will be of assistance to many veterans' families at a very difficult time in will fulfil a key their lives. Amendments relating to the abolition of the earnings credit scheme will simplify administration. The scheme is complex and difficult to administer and understand. It is being accessed by very few veterans. The earnings credit scheme was designed to provide an incentive for people to find work by allowing service pensioners and income support recipients to take up paid work and earn up to $1,050 without suffering immediate reduction. But, as I have mentioned, the scheme is being accessed by very few veterans and has high administration costs. This amendment brings the DV A scheme in line with the Department of Social Security earnings credit scheme, which is also to be abolished. Amendments to the defence service homes scheme will correct anomalies. Ex-servicemen will now be entitled to a second initial loan on the basis of their status as a war widower. This entitlement is already available to World War II widows who are also ex-servicewomen, and the reduction in the interest rate for new additional advances will be welcomed, I know, by defence service home loan recipients. The amendments mean that people will be able to use these advances for purposes such as home repairs or modifications without having to pay what is effectively a penalty interest rate. The amendments reduce the interest rate on new, additional advances provided to a person under the defence service home scheme from 10 per cent to 6.8 per cent per annum, or to an effective rate of not more than 6.85 per cent per annum in the majority of circumstances, depending on the type of previous bring advance that was provided to a person. The amendments mean that people who did not take out their full loan entitlements all at once will not have to pay what is, as I said before, effectively a penalty interest rate for the remainder of their loan. At present, all additional advances are at 10 per cent. Obviously, the take-up rate is expected to be small, because of the numbers who have not already taken out the full $25,000 entitlement. Most veterans are at an age where they are unwilling to incur further debt. In a full year, the take-up rate will be approximately 500 applications. In conclusion, the initiatives contained in the veterans' affairs legislation amendment bill are just part of the veterans' affairs budget package, which continues to demonstrate the strong commitment that this government has to veterans and to their families.",57
66,Ms GAMBARO,COMMITTEES,"Petrie) (1.27 p.m.)Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to address the House on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill 1996. I rise today to acknowledge the active role of veterans in the community and, in particular, the wonderful contribution that they have made to Australia and in the Petrie electorate. The Petrie electorate in Brisbane has a very strong and an extremely visible veterans community from Deception Bay to Redcliffe and Bald Hills. The electorate includes memorials to veterans past, and dedicated buildings and halls, and the Remembrance Day ceremony last month was very well attended. The strong tradition continues and is now being passed on from generation to generation. I wish to make the point that veterans are very proud people who have given so much of themselves so unselfishly. And one of the features that I enjoy, whenever I attend veterans' functions, is that they are always willing to tell a story. The stories are often days past and of people and events and other places, and they are often riddled with great humour and warmth, but deep down they are tinged with the scars of devastation and the destruction of war-a destruction, I hope, that many of us will never experience. Many in the veterans community are active in the Petrie electorate, and organisations and associations such as the Redcliffe RSL, the Rats of Tobruk, the Vietnam Veterans' Association, War Widows and similar groups provide, indeed, very valuable support, friendship and harmony. They have a very important role to play in our community. In fact, I believe that these organisations are vital to the local community for sustainability and growth. Without a doubt, more than ever before, there is a sincere recognition of the efforts of our veterans, and of the very special place that they so richly deserve in Australia's history. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) referred to the deeming rate affecting some 120,000 members of the veterans community. I have to assure them both that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) is taking account of these factors, including the reduction in official interest rates, at the moment. A review is being undertaken at the moment, and she is specially looking at that. This is one of the examples where we are willing to take a pro-active role. One of the shining examples is that the recognition of veterans is as strong today as it was when the ANZAC spirit was born. Ms Macklin-You've just put it in the legislation. Now she is already reviewing it.",60
67,Ms GAMBARO,COMMITTEES,"I am sure the member for Jagajaga would be interested to know that when veterans march for such wonderful occasions as ANZAC Day the children line the streets and applaud. Every year those parades are getting stronger, and more and more attend. I wish to also acknowledge the previous achievements of the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Con Sciacca, for of his great work in this area, and I do acknowledge that he did a tremendous amount of work in this area. I do acknowledge him greatly for that. As the veterans community ages, it has become extremely necessary for the federal government to be prepared to have adequate facilities and services ready to provide for the increasing demands and needs of veterans in areas such as health, housing and care. By the year 2000, it is expected that approximately 60 per cent of the Australian veteran community will be over the age of 75 years. These areas of planning and preparation actively need to be pursued to ensure that the platform is prepared for the care of our veteran community. I wish to acknowledge the fact that the needs of the veteran community cross over a number of portfolios, including the social security area, health and family services. There is a growing need in the community for simplification and for restructuring areas which are causing an incredible amount of unnecessary paperwork, administration, time and energy. The government cares for the veteran community of today and believes that it is very important for it to be sensitive to their needs and especially to that growing area of their health needs. The federal government recognises the ANZAC spirit which is so much a part of many Australian families, and has initiated a package of proposals which further recognises the veteran community and extends and acknowledges their contribution to Australian society. It is a package of initiatives which I support wholeheartedly. I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in the preparation of this bill and subsequent others that he will introduce as he puts forward this very important policy framework that the government has promised to the veterans community. The government is delivering on its commitments to veterans, and will address some very important issues to the veteran community, such as the areas which encompass health, housing, commemoration and compensation. The government, through its budget, has been able to keep its commitments and maintain security and provide strength with compassion and dignity. Other major initiatives to be undertaken by the government include the following: the vocational rehabilitation program for younger veterans; assistance to ex-service organisation practitioners; improvements to health outcomes; improvements in the entitlement for footwear and spectacles; and working to alleviate anomalies in relation to the provision of defence force homes. A number of fundamental and important changes are dealt with in the veterans' affairs legislation presently before this House. A streamlined approach to veterans' affairs will mean much better service delivery, and that is really what it is all about. It will also have the added advantage of taking undue pressure off administration and providing a much more simplified approach than is currently available. In the area of income support, the initiatives introduced will bring far more flexibility and contentment. In some areas there has been rationalisation in the approach by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This much needed reform will be of interest to veterans in the Petrie electorate and will deliver a far more sensible and efficient approach to decision making and income support provisions. In fact, many of the points in this bill address the anomalies which previously existed and it will assure the veteran community that this government is fully supportive of them. Particular issues which I have noted in the legislation, and which I would like to address today, include changes to the funeral benefits, amendments to lump sum advances and changes to areas which will alleviate administration. Firstly, I wish to highlight the point concerning funeral benefits. This legislation corrects some anomalies which previously existed in relation to the payment of transportation expenses and, indeed, is very welcome. A funeral benefit of $550 is automatically payable to the estate of certain deceased veterans, such as former prisoners of war. A benefit is also payable for charges in relation to the transportation of the body of the deceased veteran. Under the new legislation, amendments have been made to allow payment for the costs associated with the transport of remains of a veteran who dies when obtaining medical treatment away from home and the veteran is in financial need. A further amendment which deserves reinforcing is that, in order to obtain a funeral benefit for transportation expenses, it is no longer necessary to provide information about the deceased veteran's financial circumstances. This will ensure that funeral benefits are less personally intrusive than they were before and this will certainly assist certain veterans, as applications for this benefit may be lodged up to 12 months after the veteran's death. This will ensure that the benefit may be payable well before 20 August 1996. There are many in the veteran community who come to a period in their life when they may need a little extra money for the emergency replacement of goods or for a section of the family home which certainly needs maintaining. At the moment there are amendments in the legislation which will allow war widows to receive the maximum benefit of a $500 advance which previously may have been unavailable to them due to service pension or income support having a ceiling rate limiting the maximum amount of this particular advance. The legislation will also ensure that applicants for the lump sum advance will now not have to advise of the intention of the funds, and the amendments will slash administration costs by limiting pension advance payments to one per year. Another move to attack administrative burdens is the introduction of the minimum variation regime which will necessarily mean that pensioners will no longer be inconvenienced by having to inform the Department of Veterans' Affairs every single time there is a change to their income or assets. One of the important areas in the bill is that this government further recognises the efforts of the repatriation claims scheme. A provision of further funding has been made available so that ex-service organisations can employ more staff. Not only will this initiative give the opportunity for further help and support, but it also will allow for positive job creation. Further training will also be provided to ex-service organisations on issues such as veteran entitlements and services. It is important to reinforce that all of measures being introduced by the federal government are indeed very positive measures. The importance of these initiatives is that they have been able to streamline the approach that the government has taken and the necessary administration of the veterans' portfolio, while ensuring that services and opportunities continue to be of a very high nature. The sacrifices of our veterans community should never be forgotten and this government has provided, and will continue to provide, a sustainable and very high quality of life that is indeed needed for veterans and their families. I commend the bill to the House.",60
68,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"in replyFirstly, I want to thank members on both sides of the House for their contribution to this veterans' affairs bill. The interest we have seen from both sides of the House demonstrates the concern that we all have for our veteran community. I acknowledge the shadow minister's response to my second reading speech. I certainly noted his comments, mainly positive but some negative, and I want to comment on them. I also acknowledge the fact that he said I was not doing a bad job. We have got to find the odd positive. But I do want to thank the opposition spokesman because we have been in opposition and know how difficult it can be. I do want to acknowledge his contribution, along with that of the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), although she started to stray from the text of the bill before the House as did many members on the other side of the House. I particularly want to comment on a couple of those areas. I did listen with interest to the contributions when I was in the House and when I had to leave for a while I was watching the debate with interest from my ministerial room. What this bill does is introduce a range of measures that were announced in the budget. The range of measures are particularly designed to ensure that we meet our commitments that we gave the veteran community before the election. We also address some these long standing anomalies and that is also significant. The initiatives we have introduced are really designed to not only improve the lot of our war widows and our veteran community in this nation but also ensure that we continue to acknowledge the great service that our veterans have given to this country. I know that I would not be in this House, nor would anyone be in this parliament today, if it were not for that commitment and the sacrifice which was made by so many hundreds of thousands of Australians. They continue to make that sacrifice because families still suffer from the loss of a loved one and from the trauma that many people still deal with on a day to day basis because of the horrors of war. I was concerned about one aspect of this debate. In this country we have nearly always had a bipartisan approach to veterans' affairs. For years and years, both sides of the parliament have worked long and hard to ensure that the nation provides the best possible care, the best possible support, for our veterans and war widows. For many years, the commitment on all sides of parliament has been to achieve a little more than we have been able to afford as a nation in the past. I was, therefore, concerned at some of the language that was used, such as that we were 'a ruthless regime' and that we were introducing 'wicked' legislation. I found that a little disturbing. Debates in parliament are broadcast live across the country. We have had several phone calls to my office today-and, I dare say, to departmental offices around Australia-from war widows who get concerned when they hear this being said right across the nation. When they are talking about the veteran community, I urge members to use more appropriate language. Members of the veterans community get concerned. It is one of the most vulnerable sections of our community. We have had calls to my office. One particular person would not leave her name, but I wanted to ring her back. It is disturbing that people ring up because they are concerned about what they have heard in the parliament. I would like to see the speedy passage of this bill. It contains a range of measures which are particularly designed to assist our war widows, our veteran community and people in rural and remote Australia. They are also designed to acknowledge the great contribution of our Victoria Cross holders and to bring the commitment from this government in line with what is being paid by the British government. If we can get this bill through this House, through the upper house and get royal assent before Christmas, it will, I hope, be possible to ensure that our Victoria Cross recipients receive the additional benefit before Christmas. It is particularly important that the bill gets speedy passage because of all the other measures it includes as well. I mention the Victoria Cross recipients because the citation that is attached to the three surviving Victoria Cross recipients who are still with us in Australia today is retrospective to August 1995. That is one of the nice retrospective elements that we have introduced. It means that there will be a quite significant lump sum for those three Victoria Cross recipients. I want to touch on a couple of the issues that were raised by the opposition in relation to the deeming rate. The opposition pointed out that 120,000 veterans would be affected by this measure. They said that veterans deserve better and that their income could reduce by up to $100 per annum. I want to correct the misunderstanding of the effect of these provisions on our veteran community. Firstly, pensioners will not be affected by this measure if their sole source of income is from small amounts of financial assets-about $44,000 for single pensioners and $78,000 for couples. The opposition suggested that an estimated 120,000 veterans could be affected. Actually, an estimated 120,000 accounts-not veterans--could be affected. The deeming changes will affect about 100,000 pensioners. On average, the loss will be less than $1 per fortnight. Those whose pension will be reduced will have a reduction of between lOc and $1. 90 per fortnight. The member for Jagajaga also raised a point in relation to those who hold deeming accounts worth $2,000 or $4,000, depending on whether they are single or a couple. She said that many of these small amounts are kept in savings accounts which attract an interest rate of about one per cent. As the opposition would know, banks have established deeming accounts. What we are doing-and what opposition members were doing when they were in government-is encouraging pensioners to put their money into higher interest bearing accounts. I would like to advise the House that deeming accounts for small amounts are available with banks and they are called special deeming accounts. They can receive five per cent for small deposits and up to seven per cent for large deposits. What we are talking about is encouraging the veteran community, and our pensioners too for that matter, to put their money into these deeming accounts because they will earn more money and they will be better off if they do so. This is far from being a draconian measure; it is something that we want to encourage. I would ask those on the other side of the House to encourage our veterans community to take up these deeming accounts because they do lead, at the end of the day, to a higher income for these people. The opposition said that earnings credit gives less incentive to earn additional income to supplement a pension. The incentive is already built into the system today. All pensioners have an income-free area. It is $98 per fortnight for a single person and $172 per fortnight for a couple. Therefore, the abolition of the earnings credit is not a disincentive; the incentive is already built into the system. The opposition said also that this measure that we are introducing will lead to an increased reluctance to disclose income. To suggest that the veterans community, including our war widows, would knowingly go out there and defraud the Commonwealth simply amazes me. I have to say I reject that suggestion by the opposition. It is that sort of language that really does disturb me because, as I said earlier, this broadcast and all the contributions that have been made here today are being heard right across this nation on the parliamentary broadcast network. In the interests of time. I will sum up reasonably quickly. All of us know that question time is coming on and we all want to see this bill pass through both houses as quickly as possible. I listened with interest to the issues raised by the member for Jagajaga in relation to Heidelberg and Austin hospitals. I must advise her that I have written to the Minister for Health in Victoria. It concerns me to hear that veterans may lie on a table or a trolley for 15 hours, but I urge the member in future to raise the issue directly with me and not wait until there is an appropriate debate in the parliament to raise it. The interests of the veterans must always be of paramount importance to this nation, to this parliament, on both sides of the House. I urge the member for Jagajaga in future to come and see me about such issues as soon as she hears of them. However, I can tell her that I have already written to the Minister for Health in Victoria and am awaiting his reply. I acknowledge that perhaps there are some problems there at the moment. In conclusion, I thank the staff of the Department of Veterans' Affairs both here in the national office and also right across the nation because they do untiring work to assist our veterans and our war widows. They do an absolutely fantastic job. I want to thank my adviser, Gary Kent, and the staff from the national office who are in the advisers box at the moment. A lot of work went on not only prior to the budget but also in drafting the legislation and ensuring that it conforms with all the rules and regulations. Of course, the department will have to be implementing this and ensuring that we deliver it to the community that we serve. I thank members on both sides of the House for their great contributions. I just urge that in future a much more restrained use of language be employed, bearing in mind the concern that this sort of language could have on our veterans community.

Very briefly, I thank the minister for the way in which he has responded to the concerns that were raised in this debate by members of the opposition. The amendments which I have moved, Nos 1 and 2, refer to the earnings credit scheme which is part of this bill, Nos 3, 4, 5 and 6 to the lump sum compensation, and No.7 to extended deeming. I commented in my second reading speech on why we were moving these amendments and I did ask the minister to take them into consideration perhaps between now and when the Senate is going to consider this legislation. He has already given an indication that he will do so and have a look at whether or not there needs to be some changes, but I certainly gather from some of the comments that he has made that that may not happen. We have brought these amendments forward because we are trying to assist the government in making this a fairer system. The comments I made in my second reading speech are pertinent to the reasons. I simply ask the minister once again to consider these particular matters. We would also wish speedy passage of this legislation through both houses. Amendments negatived. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Bruce Scott)-by leave-read a third time. NA BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 September, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time.",64
70,Mr MELHAM,PROCEEDS OF CRIME AMENDMENT,"The Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill 1996 has two principal purposes. The first is to facilitate cooperation between Australia and other nations to pursue the proceeds of criminal activity. It does so by allowing Australia to payout of the proceeds of crime to foreign nations that have assisted us in the seizure of those proceeds. Further, the bill also allows Australia to receive the proceeds of crime paid to this country by other nations which Australian authorities have assisted to seize proceeds offshore. The aim of this bill is entirely laudable and I wish to express the opposition's unequivocal support for these measures. Increasingly, organised crime-desperate to evade scrutiny-moves the proceeds of its activities through the world's international monetary system. Money laundering, particularly of moneys obtained through the drug trade, can be sent around the world in the blink of an eye through anyone of a number of tax havens or sham transactions. Pursuing these assets can take considerable time and resources but at the end of the day criminals want to enjoy the spoils of their wrongdoing and sooner or later their ill-gotten gains wind up in countries where they can be seized and seized they must be. Just as the means of the international criminal has become more complex so too have the investigative techniques available to law enforcement agencies. Just as it is imperative for international law enforcement agencies to cooperate to arrest criminals themselves, so too it is imperative that the proceeds of their crimes be seized. Any assistance that we can provide to both the Australian and overseas authorities to seize assets laundered through the international monetary system will clearly help in the greater struggle against these malefactors. In his recent historic speech to the joint sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate, President Clinton identified the fight against international drug trafficking and organised crime as part of the next great challenge facing all nations. President Clinton said: As we deal with these challenges to our security must recognise the new ones which are emerging and the new approaches they require. Terrorism, international crime and drug trafficking are forces of destruction that have no tolerance for national borders. Together we must show zero tolerance for them .... It means, in short, pursuing a concerted strategy-intelligence and police cooperation world wide, coordinated action in every country to stop money laundering, shutting down grey markets for guns and false documents and increasing extraditions. It means security coordination ... and giving in each of our nations our law enforcement officials the tools they need to cooperate and succeed. Such cooperation is essential and I think the government needs to be applauded for introducing this aspect of the bill before us. We will give credit where credit is due and in this instance it is due. It is a situation that has cross-party support and it should have crossparty support. Too often the public only sees the differences between the parties; they do not see the cooperation between political parties. This is one bill where there is cooperation between both sides of the House. It provides a material way that all parties in this parliament can reaffirm their commitment to this most important struggle. But the commitment to the war against drugs and organised crime must be about more than just words. As the President said, we must give our law enforcement officials the tools they need. It is therefore with great disappointment that I tum to the second aspect of the bill. I will be moving amendments during consideration in detail. I note the time and think it appropriate that I defer to question time at this stage. I seek leave to continue my comments at a later stage.",65
71,Mr SPEAKER,PROCEEDS OF CRIME AMENDMENT,"Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 101 A. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",66

The Minister for Defence Industry, Science and we Personnel (Mrs Bishop) will answer questions on his behalf. Also, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is absent from question time today. He is in Perth for personal reasons. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) will answer questions on his behalf. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA High Speed Train Service",66
73,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Speaker, could I have your indulgence to correct, in a small way, an answer I gave yesterday. In response to a question from the honourable member for Eden-Monaro regarding the high speed train, I made the comment that $1 million had been provided by the FAC for the feasibility study into the upgrading of Canberra airport. I have been informed that the final cost of that feasibility study will in fact be considerably less than $1 million. The exact amount is yet to be determined, but as the answer was, technically, inadvertently inaccurate I wanted to correct it immediately. NA",66
74,Mr SPEAKER,POINTS OF ORDER,"Yesterday the member for Hotham addressed a number of questions to me relating to the taking of points of order and Speaker's rulings. I have reflected on the points made by the honourable member, as I undertook to do. The end result of my reflection is that there is in fact no simple formula that may be applied to situations requiring interpretation of standing orders. Much depends on the context in which various points of order may be raised. On some occasions it may be appropriate for a response to be made immediately and for that response to be in the form of a ruling. On other occasions this may not be the case. Just because a member prefaces a query or comment with the term 'point of order', or even if a member explicitly requests a ruling, does not mean that the chair's response is a ruling. An example of the context in which the response of the chair may not involve a ruling would arise under the application of the concluding segment of standing order 86, which provides that a number of procedural motions may not be received again after being negatived if the Speaker or the chair is of opinion that an abuse of the forms of the House or obstruction is involved. Standing order 107 clearly provides for the Speaker to apply an opinion as to which matter of public importance is the most urgent or important where two matters are lodged for discussion on the same day. Consequently, a ruling, an opinion or advice may be involved, depending on the particular matter and the circumstances in which it is raised. I also refer to the manner in which this matter was raised yesterday. I do not believe that it is appropriate for a series of fragmenthypocrisy ed questions to be addressed to the Speaker, each addressed following the chair's response, similar to the way in which one might see questions addressed to a witness in a courtroom proceeding. And I now know how they feel. In future, if a member has a series of related questions to be addressed to me, I would prefer them to be delivered in the one question in the normal course of events, similar to the way in which members phrase questions on notice. In fact, it would be helpful in many cases if members were to raise matters with me in writing. NA Private Health Insurance",66
75,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Does the minister stand by the Prime Minister's promise to maintain community rating for private health insurance? Has the minister seen reports today proposing longer waiting periods for everybody over the age 45 and, for those over the age of 60, a five-year waiting period? Does this mean that older people will have to payout $5,000 in health insurance premiums before getting any cover for pre-existing conditions? Will the minister reiterate his government's commitment to community rating so that older Australians are protected?",67
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Remove those papers from your desks.,67
77,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is extraordinary to the hear the opposition talking about community rating. This is the mob that allowed private health funds to tender for bulk work and offered 30 to 40 per cent discounts.,67
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Hunter will heed my earlier words.,67
79,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You talk about community rating, yet your own changes in 1995 allowed funds to undermine community rating by tendering for the work of employed persons who, by definition, are younger and fitter and offering 30 to 40 per cent discounts. So what are you on about? It is extreme to allow a drop-out of private health insurance from 70 per cent to 33 per cent, to allow the proportion of over-65s to go up which deliberately destroys community rating and then to come and whinge and bleat about community rating. That is utter and extreme hypocrisy. As for the point you specifically raise, it is a submission to the Productivity Commission and I will wait to see what the Productivity Commission finally delivers in February. But I would say this: it seems to me fundamentally unfair that someone who has been in insurance for 40 years gets no benefit when someone else can join and get the same benefits on a single day. If we are going to protect community rating, you have to be clear about what community rating is. Community rating means that people are not disadvantaged because of illness or age. Nothing we have done has harmed that and the sloppy, deliberately harmful things that you did over 10 years in government to private health insurance are the biggest attack on community rating the country has ever seen, and I am doing my best to try to undo your mess.

Can the Prime Minister tell the parliament how Australians of this and future generations will benefit from the government's commitment to the nation's environment and communications services in regional Australia?,68
81,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-One of the most important commitments the coalition took to the last election was the commitment to make an historic capital investment in Australia's environmental future. That was a commitment that was overwhelmingly supported by the Australian people. I note that a very important mentfirst step towards realising that vision to invest so much in Australia's environmental future has been achieved in the Senate today with the passage of the second reading of the bill. What happens in the committee stage is not a matter I wish to comment on. That is a matter for the Senate to determine in its own time. But a very valuable first step has already been taken. Be it noted that the Australia-world-class Ian Labor Party voted to a man and a woman against the investment of $1 billion in Australia's environmental future.

90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Protecting the environment and improving communications services in regional Australia are two large parts of the jigsaw puzzle of the 21 st century for Australcommunications services for regional Australia, top line communications facilities for the bush and for regional Australia. In case the Leader of the Opposition or anybody else opposite imagines that this is a very late thought so far as the coalition is concerned, I remind them of a speech I made as Leader of the Opposition to the National Farmers Federation on 21 November 1995. It is worthwhile all members hearing this and being reminded of what I said in that speech. I said: The second major area of infrastructure development is the upgrading of regional communications. I will want to know over the next few days whether the members of the Australian Labor Party are against upgrading regional communications. It would appear from the reaction of some of their colleagues in another place that they really are. I went on to say: Ensuring that all Australians, no matter where they live and work, can access and derive practical benefits from advances in communications technologies is an enormous challenge facing policy makers in this country. The Labor Party wants an Australia where you have communications haves and communications have-nots. The have-nots are those who live in the bush and the regional areas of Australia. What we have done with these measures is not only make an historically large capital commitment to the environmental future of Australia-a capital commitment that the Labor Party has fought hypocritically tooth and nail to stop, to destroy, to oppose-but also make a massive commitment to the communications needs of the Australian regions and the Australian bush. As a result of what we are proposing, we will have a first-class commitment to our environmental future. We will have a without parallel commitment to our communications future. As a result, we will provide two of the very important ingredients of a practical vision for Australia in the 21st century. Telstra: Environment",68

94,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. It does go, in fact, to this $1 billion roving Liberal Party election slush fund on the environment. Is the Prime Minister aware of a report today in the West Australian which reads: Prime Minister John Howard has refused Premier Richard Court's request for a firm commitment of $300 million to pay for a key $580 million WA anti-salinity election pledge. It goes on: Last night a spokesman for Mr Howard refused to say if the Prime Minister had accepted Mr Court's request. ""I would point out that the letter from Premier is a request,"" Mr Howard's spokesman said. ""It is a request, not a final document."" Will you now commit $300 million to the fighting land degradation program in Western Australia?",69

The passage of the government's higher education legislation yesterday in the Senate is very good news for Australians who want expanded educational opportunity. I would like to pay tribute to Senator Vanstone for this very substantial legislative achievement which has now been registered. This legislation not only provides the opportunity for improved resourcing for Australia's universities but also is very fair legislation. It is legislation that will improve equity and access to Australian universities. Members of this House will remember the very strange notion of equity which was held on the other side of the House during the term of the previous government. The Labor Party thought it was fair to lock out of universities the every year tens of thousands of studentsqualified students and largely students from low income areas. They thought it was fair to prohibit universities from offering places to Australian students on the same terms as students from overseas. They thought it was fair to deny universities additional funding if universities were able to find additional places for Australia's students. If a university overenrolled they were denied extra funding. They thought it was fair that students in the lower cost courses with perhaps very frequently lower expectations of income should pay a much higher proportion of the cost of those courses than students in the more expensive courses with higher income expectations like medicine.,69

I am very pleased and proud to say on behalf of the government that this legislation gets rid of these inequities entrenched by the Labor Party. Australian students now have the same right as overseas students to access Australian universities. Universities that now enrol above agreed targets will be able to receive HECS equivalent funding for those additional places, so they will get additional places at HECS rates for the students they are prepared to take in. There will be 4,000 scholarships for low income and disadvantaged students under this legislation. This will greatly improve access for low income and disadvantaged students on merit. Students in courses which are more expensive to provide with higher income expectations wi II be required to make a payment which recognises that and that is quite fair. These policies taken together will address the problem of unmet demand and open the doors of Australian universities. They will mean over the next few years that Australian universities will have more places and they will be better resourced. In 1997 Australian universities will be receiving some $50 million more in funding than they received this year. The universities under this legislation will have the flexibility that Labor denied them. They will be able to use their resources in the best possible way to ensure that they meet the needs of their communities and provide excellent world-class education in our university system to Australian students.

Will the Treasurer confirm that private consumption is an even more important contributor than business investment to that forecast? Given yesterday'S national accounts showing almost no consumption growth and a large accumulation of retail stocks and given Monday's trend retail sales figures showing falls for an utterly unprecedented three months in a row, will the Treasurer now acknowledge there is a significant risk that his budget growth forecast will not be met, with all that means for further unemployment growth?",70

113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Melbourne will be in the galleries in a moment if he is not careful.,71
114,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As we do approach Christmas, which is a time when most Australians and their families will be able to celebrate in comfort, celebrate in relative aftluence and celebrate in a happy set of circumstances, there will be a section of the Australian population who, through no fault of their own, will not be able to celebrate Christmas in such a happy fashion. I hope that all Australians who are in more fortunate circumstances will dig very deeply into their pockets and give generously to organisations such as the Salvation Army, the Society of St Vincent de Paul and the many other great organisations which are associated with charitable efforts at Christmas time. I had the opportunity this morning of launching the national Christmas appeal for the Salvation Army. I made the point that Australians traditionally, when properly approached and properly apprised of the circumstances, were willing to give very generously for those people in very necessitous circumstances. I hope that all Australians understand that there is a section of our population who will celebrate Christmas in less happy circumstances than we will and through no fault of their own-through not having a job, through a death in the family, through misadventure of some other kind-they will not be able to celebrate Christmas in such a happy set of circumstances. I would have thought that concern for that section of the population is something that unites all Australians across the political divide. In the August budget the government increased funding for emergency relief by over $5 million a year for the next four financial years. We have also committed ourselves to reviewing the funding formula for that emergency relief program to make it more relevant to local needs throughout Australia and to give groups like the Salvation Army, the Smith Family and the Society of St Vincent de Paul much greater certainty in funding. At the end of the day, those organisations depend very heavily on the generosity of Australians in all walks of life. I take this opportunity of appealing to Australians this Christmas to give very generously to those organisations so that our less fortunate fellow citizens may be able to enjoy something approaching the Christmas that most of us are privileged to look forward to enjoying in a few weeks time. Wage Increases",71
115,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Minister, is it not a fact that your proposed $8 wage increase will be available to only 18 per cent of the work force? Is it not also a fact that, during 1995, 29 per cent of the work force were eligible for safety net wage increases because they gained no increase under enterprise bargaining? Does your proposal not mean that almost one million workers face the prospect of no increase in their wages at all this year and the probability that most of them will get no increase before the end of the century?",71

119,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Ironic even.,72
120,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Ironic even, as the Prime Minister says. I thought the Labor Party lost the election on 2 March, and yet 10 months after the election the shadow minister in a time warpMr O'Connor- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under standing order 59, I ask you to ask the minister to address his remarks through the chair.",72
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Corio. I am sure the Minister for Industrial Relations was not ignoring his responsibilities.,72
122,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly was not, Mr Speaker. So the shadow minister thought he was the government. He went down there with the ALP submission-a sort of new accord. This was the accord that they put up before the election. They lost the election, but expletivedo not worry about 2 March because we are going to go on with the accord regardless. Incredibly, he asked me whether some of the figures that he has put in his question were right. Those are figures in our submission so, to the extent that you have simply repeated our submission, of course they are right. What is the point of those figures? The point of those figures is to show and to back up that our submission is based on the idea that the award system should be a safety net. What is interesting in the shadow minister's question is that, by the way in which he has asked that question, he is walking away from a policy position which in government previously the Labor Party supported. I have a quote from the former Prime Minister in April 1993. When describing the nature of the award system as it ought to be in the future, he said: Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals. It is a model under which compulsorily arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net. So, if you are asking me will it be the case that in the future the vast majority of people will receive their wage increases through agreements, the answer is yes. That was your policy. That is our policy today. That is the policy that we put to the commission, and that is the policy which by your question today you repudiate. The incredible irony of the shadow minister fronting before the Industrial Relations Commission was brought home to me recently when in my bedtime reading I had a copy of a book by John Edwards, who was recounting the development of wages policy before the 1993 election. The question of the role of the commission came up in discussions between Mr Kelty and Mr Keating. From the chapter 'The unwinnable election', someone asked what would happen if the commission refused to agree. Mr Kelty said: The IRe will have to do it because if they don't they have no other role. They'll have nothing to do. If they knock it back, we abolish thecommission. I bet you did not say that to the commission when you were there today. Customs: Drugs",72
123,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs and the minister responsible for customs. Given that the Australian Customs Service is the barrier which prevents drugs from coming into this country, can the minister inform the House what impact the service is having in this crucial role?  member for Longman for his question. One of the functions of the Customs Service is to police the border to prevent drugs from coming into the country. I am pleased to inform the House of a significant drug seizure in Sydney, with the discovery of just on five tonnes of compressed cannabis valued at in excess of $50 million in cargo imported from Cambodia. This is the largest consignment of illicit drugs ever to be found in cargo in Australia. It is the result of some excellent work by Customs and by a number of Customs officers, including the Customs drug-dog detector unit. The interception was the result of new technology and working smarter. The seizure involved was contained in 258 bags of compressed cannabis in a 40-foot container of raw jute. There was a false wall in the container and, on unpacking that container, Customs found and removed the false wall to find the compressed cannabis. It was in that way the seizure was brought about. The circumstances of the interception involved the use of a computer system to profile and target the consignment, as well as the involvement, as I have mentioned, of the drug-dog detector unit, and confirmed suspicions of Customs in this area. The find illustrates the advantage of applying risk management rather than blanket approaches to the role of Customs at the border. The find and exclusion of such a significant quantity of drugs from circulation in Australia are of benefit 'to the entire community and a major setback to those who would peddle those sorts of drugs in our community. To date this year, this brings the amount of seizure by Customs-<:oming in on passengers as well as by post-of cocaine to a total of 92 kilograms; heroin to 60 kilograms; ecstasy to in excess of 30 kilograms, or 30,000 tablets; and cannabis to now in excess of 900 seizures. This is a significant find. It is an indication to the Australian community that Customs, in working smarter and with new technology, are able to apprehend and seize at the border these sorts of illegal and illicit drugs. Wage Increases",72
124,Ms ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is it not a fact that the government's submission to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission would mean that most, if not all, workers on paid rates awards, such as public servants, nurses and teachers, amongst others, would receive no increase in their take-home pay as a result of safety net increases for the next three years?",73
125,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member would care to read the submission carefully, basically we are saying that the system should provide for an award safety net and that that award safety net should be updated by the Industrial Relations Commission. To answer your question specifically, as appropriate, that should include paid rates awards provided, however, that obviously the commission would also want to apply a principle of full absorption across the system. So that is our view, and it is consistent with what we have said. Mr Bevis-Merry Christmas.",73
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Brisbane!,73
127,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member interjects, 'Merry Christmas.' The truth of the matter is that it will be a merry Christmas for a lot of Australians because not only have we now put in place the structural changes which you need to comprehend, if you want a full understanding of what I am saying to you about the nature of the system in future, but the other good thing for those thinking about Christmas and beyond is that, once you get beyond Christmas and into the new year and the commission brings down its decision, you will be facing, firstly, on 1 January, a tremendous benefit in your pay packet as a result of the family tax initiative. I can tell the honourable member that I am not just going to answer this question for you; I am also going to answer the question for a lot of people in my electorate. We are going to be putting around in my electorate, as I am sure will be put in literally hundreds and thousands of post office boxes around the country, a very simple pamphlet. It has a Christmas present on the front and it says, 'Good news for 1997-our promise delivered'. Our promise for the average family, according to this pamphlet, is $34 a fortnight. So it is a pretty good deal. As far as the low paid are concerned, we are supporting a very fair figure for those people in terms of an increase in the safety net; our submission is $8. It is interesting that the Labor Party is complaining about it, but their figure for the last three years was $8. Of course, they did not have the benefits of the outcomes from better economic management that we are delivering, which are low inflation, tax cuts, assistance with private health insurance and, on top of all those goodies, about $145 a month for a family with an average mortgage-a great start to 1997 for average workers and for the community as a whole.

What is the outlook for this meeting?,74
130,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Riverina for his question. I know that he has a great interest in those industries in his electorate which are exporting more as a consequence of trade liberalisation, be it the light manufacturing sector in Wagga and Griffith and dairy product, beef, wool and other wine industry doing very well at the moment from Griffith to Europe-and full marks to them. I say to the House that the World Trade Organisation first ministerial meeting will place in Singapore from Monday to Friday next week. I say further that the trade liberalisation agenda is all about jobs, as the Prime Minister has emphasised: it is about job creation, extra jobs, here in Australia as a consequence of a win-win world circumstance associated with fairer, as well as freer, trade liberalisation. We look to the Singapore meeting and the agenda associated with the Singapore meeting, firstly, to ensure Australia continues to get full value from the implementation of Uruguay Round results and, secondly, to establish new work programs to build on the Uruguay Round in major market access areas of interest to us, particularly with regard to agriculture and also processed food, services and, indeed, industrial goods; to achieve a bold Singapore declaration which contains ambitious future liberalisation goals for the World Trade Organisation, and which charts the way forward to improved trading circumstances for developed countries and for developing countries; and, indeed, to lift the standard of living and job creation worldwide, here in Australia as well as elsewhere-for this part of the world and beyond.

We are in the process of doing that and introducing The intention is that there will be-and arrangements are being put in place for thisa Senate committee process to allow a brief examination of that next week, possibly on Monday night, with a report back during the week. This is so that the Senate can complete its deliberations on the legislation, the legislation can come back into the lower house and we can then complete the passage of that legislation before the House rises. The importance of all that is that we can have the referral and acceptance of the Victorian industrial relations power to the Commonwealth completed and in operation as at the commencement of the other processes of the workplace relations bill. So, from the point of view of employers and employees in Victoria, there will be no confusion with the start up of the two systems. The whole thing will, in effect, start as at 1 January. That is convenient for all parties. I do appreciate that it will require both chambers to deal with the matter expeditiously, and I look forward to receiving support from the other side of the House to enable that to occur. I think the indications are reasonably positive in that regard. It will mean that, on top of the significant changes and reforms introduced by the workplace relations bill, we will have this crowning achievement in terms of the historic development of a single and simpler system for both employers and employees. I finish by making the point that not only will no worker-particularly some hundreds of thousands of them in Victoria-be worse off but workers will be provided with many opportunities to be better off over time as a result of a much simpler and better system.

I ask the minister whether he said when he appointed Dr Stocker last month: The expert advice that Dr Stocker would be able to provide would greatly assist the government in the effective management of science and technology. Will the minister heed this expert advice from Dr Stocker and reverse his 27 per cent budget cut to industry R&D incentives?",76

Of course Dr Stocker, in his role as chief scientist, has an interest in maximising funding opportunities for R&D, just as all of us on this side have.

Dr Stocker warned that the recent flowering of R&D activity in Australia was ""a fragile flower"" and should not be assumed to be permanent. That is utterly unobjectionable. We all know, particularly after 13 years of Labor, that private sector investment in research and development has to be encouraged and expanded. That is utterly-utterly!-in accord with government policy. We do not complacently accept any aspect of economic policy, particularly that. What those opposite do not take into account but people like Dr John Stocker do is the initiatives we have launched in regard to research and development. The START program, which provides $520 million over four years, was especially drawn up to adapt to circumstances of particular companies, small and medium sized ones especially. So there might be loans, interest rate subsidies or grants. On top of that we have retained our general tax concession, unlike most other countries, at 125 per cent. We have expanded by two the cooperative research centres program, which is linking universities, research agencies and the private sector. We have increased university science and technology research funding by $130 million and have provided $90 million for research infrastructure, $30 million to the ARC for the collaborative grants scheme and $9 million for postgraduate awards. We have maintained funding for the rural research and development corporations, which represents an increase in real terms of 5V2 per cent. So there is no doubt at all that this government has a commitment to science and technology, engineering and research and development in both the public and private sectors. Road Safety: Black Spot Program",76

157,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hunter.,77
158,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and whether the funds will be directed to a significant black spot in my electorate of Swan at the intersection of Brearley A venue and the Great Eastern Highway, which has a documented history of crashes resulting in injury?",77
159,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Swan for his question. Of course, what the honourable member for Swan has just done for his electors is draw to the attention of the national parliament and the minister responsible the needs of his own electorate, which is a new experience for the electors of Swan. The member for Swan, unlike the previous member for Swan, stands up in the parliament to represent his electors' interests. It is not any wonder they changed their member and got such a good one to take up their interests. I have had the opportunity of meeting with members of local government in the honourable member for Swan's electorate, as he has been a champion for some of their causes, as indeed he has been today. The intersection that the honourable member for Swan referred to would be very familiar to members of parliament, particularly those who travel to Perth. It is the turn-off from the Great Eastern Highway to the Perth airport. It is a well known black spot in Perth and one which needs remediation. This government, since it was elected on 2 March, has introduced the black spots program with $149 million worth of funding over the next four years. It is a very good program indeed and one which was in place during the term of the previous government but one which they axed-one of the saddest things for trying to improve road safety around Australia. It was a good program. For every $500,000 spent on the black spots program, evidence proved that it saved a life. This government is about improving road safety. That is why we have allocated $149 million over the next four years in this new, reintroduced black spots road funding program. For the benefit of the honourable member for Swan, I am aware of this intersection. He has drawn it to my attention. I can only say to him that there is a proper process now in place for nominations for black spots to be corrected over the next four years. I look forward to seeing the honourable member for Swan-as he is entitled to-or the local government that represents that area putting forward that black spot for remediation. You can rest assured that under this government that black spot can be remediated and lives can be saved in the future. But that will only happen under a coalition government that has the courage and determination to do something about road safety. Shipbuilding industry",77
160,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Has the minister seen a report in today's West Australian newspaper that senior federal ministers are looking at a new assistance package for the shipbuilding industry? Is the government considering such a measure? Wouldn't it be simpler to reverse the government's job destroying decision to axe the ships bounty?",77
161,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question has been asked so often this week that it is pretty hard to keep repeating the answer to it. It is a fact that I met with representatives of the industry last week, at which meeting we discussed the various issues they raised and they expressed their concerns. All I can say is what I have said previously during the week, that this was a decision forced upon the government because of the shocking financial state the Labor Party left the government in and that we had to set about bringing down a budget which consolidated the financial position of Australia. Various concessions were withdrawn to meet that criteria, and businesses were expecting that. In relation to ship bounties, I can do no better than quote a previous Labor minister for industry: ... there'll be opportunities for the government to assist, to offer assistance during the nurturing phase, but of course, taking the shipbuilding example, government involvement there will be temporary. The program put forward is due to end on 30 June 1997. That is where it currently sits. Mr Crean-I seek leave to table the newspaper report, Mr Speaker. Leave not granted. Refugees",78
162,Mrs SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Is the minister aware of claims made in the press that his department is considering giving entry to Australia of 1,300 Vietnamese refugees with-to quote from one of those reports-'heroin habits, criminal records and medical conditions'? Is there any substance to these claims?",78
163,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am aware of the claims that the member for Moncrieff has referred to.,78
164,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Where were they?,78
165,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They were in the press. Currently, there are some 1,400 people who have been determined to be refugees and who remain in camps in South-East Asia and, particularly, in Hong Kong. Over the past 18 months, at the request of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Australia has been examining some 20 cases comprising 35 refugees, some of whom have previously been considered but rejected for resettlement in Australia. It has been made clear by my officials to the UNHCR that successful applicants must satisfy health and character criteria. People with criminal records and with drug addiction problems will not be able to satisfy these criteria. There is some limited scope for using the medical waiver, but Australia will not consider resettlement of criminals or drug addicts. We take our international and humanitarian obligations very seriously. We will not undermine the health and character standards of Australia by enabling people to enter Australia if they have poor character and health records. Australia National: Services",78
166,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Will the minister guarantee that existing Indian Pacific, Ghan and Overland services will continue to operate? Will he guarantee that the Indian Pacific will continue to run through Broken Hill and western New South Wales? Will he guarantee that the vital rail freight services currently provided to a range of important industries in Tasmania and South Australia will continue in their present form?",78
167,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The services that the honourable member for Melbourne refers to are all part of AN's current services. I have given instructions to AN that all services that are currently operated by AN will continue to operate during the period of calling for expressions of interest and scoping study through to the period when they are to be sold. At that point, if we find that those passenger services that the honourable member for Melbourne refers to have not been taken up, then we will consider taking those back over and reforming them. It is a worthwhile point to make that the honourable member for Melbourne and the party that he represents have allowed these services to decline over the last few years very substantially indeed. They have done it during a period in which some 7,000 jobs at AN were cut out by the former Labor government. I think it is important for people to recognise that what Labor was proposing for AN was death by a thousand cuts-the end of AN over a long and tortuous period. Those services that he mentioned are important services. We have instructed AN to maintain them whilst ever the Commonwealth government is in ownership of those. I have also indicated publicly on occasions before that it is our intention to ensure that whoever takes over the operations of AN does so with the objective of trying to maintain all of the services that are currently being operated by AN and also of trying to maintain as many jobs within AN as there currently are today. There is no doubt at all that, under the reform program I announced on behalf of the government just a couple of weeks ago, the future for AN and the future for people who use AN services is much better, much more guaranteed and on a much sounder footing than would be the case if Labor was still in office today running AN down, as it had done over the last 13 years. Citrus Industry",78
168,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question, genuinely without notice, is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Minister, you would be aware of the difficult financial circumstances that growers find themselves in in southern Australia as a result of the dramatic reduction in the price of Brazilian concentrate imported to this country. You would also be aware of the movements that we have seen in access to our citrus products in overseas markets. Will you provide your commitment to this House and to citrus growers that, in the next round of discussions during your coming visit to APEC, you will ensure a much better deal will be achieved for all horticulturalists in terms of genuine free trade and levelling up the playing field?",79
169,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Mallee for his question. I enjoyed meeting with citrus growers with him in Mildura in the immediate aftermath of the budget in August and on other occasions, as we share an electorate boundary between Mildura and Wentworth and places further east-in my case right through to Albury and beyond. The plight of the citrus industry is one that is dear to my heart. It is one which has seen a massive adjustment made because you, when in government, so rapidly slashed tariffs without any quid pro quo as to leave them exposed to the circumstances, which did not allow for them to modernise or have any degree of sensible transition. Further, in more recent times the citrus industry has begun to bounce back. I give full credit to the citrus industry, as it has developed new products such as freshly squeezed orange juice and the like, and is starting to boost its own export effort to California and elsewhere. I want to salute the work of the citrus industry in that regard. The truth of the matter is that the citrus industry is in a very tough economic circumstance. In recognition of that, there was reaffirmation in the budget of some millions of dollars-not many, but some-with regard to a particular package relating to the citrus industry. I would add further, in answer to the very fair question by the member for Mallee, that I will be pursuing the further legitimate interests of the Australian citrus industry and the jobs represented by the Australian citrus industry in Singapore at the World Trade citrus Organisation next week, because we are determined to see that those who would do the wrong thing by free and fairer trade would be dealt with under the World Trade Organisation. Black Hawk Helicopter Accident",79
170,Mr TED GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Has the minister seen reports today concerning the plight of one of the soldiers, Lance Corporal Gerry Bampton, who sadly became a paraplegic as a result of the terrible Black Hawk tragedy which occurred in Townsville? Is it the case that Corporal Bampton has been waiting many months for modifications to be made to his home so that he can, for example, bring his wheelchair into the home? Why has it taken so long to undertake the necessary work? Will the minister assure the House that the work will be done immediately and to the satisfaction of Lance Corporal Bampton? Also, are there any other soldiers who were injured in that accident awaiting similar assistance to help them overcome any special circumstances arising from the accident?",79
171,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. The plight of Gerry Bampton and his wife, Tracey, is very important to me and to the government. Gerry Bampton remains in hospital at present, where he has been since the accident. He is a paraplegic, with no feeling from the waist down. He is expected to leave hospital on 15 December. He and his family will be housed in a defence service home while their home, which is their own, will be modified. Two architects have looked at the house. The first was somebody whom the Bamptons themselves sought-somebody who is in a wheelchair himself. I am advised that his basic advice was that the whole needed to be demolished and a new one built. The compensation people thought it was reasonable to get a second opinion, and have got such a second opinion. The modifications will, indeed, be going ahead. The whole question of compensation and the adequacy of compensation for people who have paraplegia or quadriplegia, or any other injury which brings about a like disability, was one that became of concern to me even before this accident. That is why I announced in the terms of reference to investigate the military compensation scheme and its adequacy, and for that to report back to me on 1 March. With regard to other people who are injured, nobody is as badly injured or as seriously injured as a result of that accidentothers do have injuries-as Gerry Bampton. I admire the enormous courage of Gerry and Tracey Bampton. They are facing a very difficult future. They are facing it with couincluding rage. There has been an instruction to the department that they are to be assisted at times. Mr Bevis-Will the work they want done be done?",80
172,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The modification of the house will take place, so that he can be in it Australia. in his wheelchair. It was not possible to have the house altered in time for his leaving the hospital. That is why we have provided them with another house. I might also add that in the immediate past few days a new car has been provided. It is yet to be modified. I want to assure you that the sadness and the plight of the people who are affected by this accident remain ever present both to me and to the government. We understand the debt we owe to the men and women of Australia who put their lives on the line. Trade",80
173,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister for Trade and follows an earlier question from the member for Riverina. I refer the minister to the European house Union's proposals for next week's World Trade Organisation meeting in Singapore in which it reportedly pushes for multilateral, as opposed to sector by sector, trade negotiations. What is the government's reaction to such proposals and how is this reconciled with the EU's resistance to substantial freeing up of trade in agriculture?",80
174,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Groom puts a very pertinent issue before the House in respect of the World Trade Organisation ministerial meetings next week. The member for Groom, the member for Wakefield and others, including the member for Riverina, have taken a particular interest in these aspects because one of our outlets for food product in recent years has been Europe. The dairy industry formally advised the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and me today that it has a very strong vested interest in the progress being maintained as it exports millions of dollars of extra product, cheese, to Europe as well as, for the first time ever, to Korea and elsewhere in all Asia. These are job creating exports and are part of the benefits and bonus flowing from trade liberalisation, although I accept that there is a long way to go to win the case at the grassroots level in many of the member economies of the OECD, including here in With respect to the Europeans, there are several sectors scheduled for negotiation in accord with a built-in agenda-in 1999, agriculture; the year 2000, services; in 1997, telecommunications and others. It does get to a stage where, whilst sector by sector is proceeding, there can be further progress made when you take into account deals that extend beyond one sector and the degree of multilateral approach to the overall advancement of trade negotiations. At the end of the day, aspects of both will unfold in the aftermath of the Singapore ministerial meeting. We will be exploring further with the Europeans their commitment to that trade Iiberalisation. Sir Leon Brittan has indicated that he is anxious to see some genuine progress made, and I welcome that. We remain concerned about the common agricultural policy. We hope that the clock will continue to tick against the continuation of that common agricultural policy with a heavy subsidisation involved. I give the member for Groom my absolute assurance that I will be in there in Singapore batting for Australian jobs and sensible progress with respect to these very important trade negotiations.",80

The article makes the claim that all future disaster funding for the states will be dependent upon the public recognition and my role as the Minister for Finance. This is not true. One recommendation in the review of the disaster relief arrangements instigated by my predecessor suggested that a communications strategy be developed by the Department of Finance and the states to provide information to the public on disaster assistance relief available from all levels of government. Mr Bevis-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the procedure to which the minister is seeking to gain access relates to a personal misrepresentation, not a question of policy. It is quite clear from what the minister has said that this is not a matter of personal misrepresentation; it is a disagreement on a policy matter which has been published in the press.",81

He went on to say that he had consulted with Bill O'Chee, which makes my point. I, in debating with Bill O'Chee on ABC radio talkback, made the point that this conversation never occurred; it was an invention of Bill O'Chee's.

The words that he quoted were 'ruthless regime'. It was only when I read the Hansard proof that I realised that it was me that he was referring to. I make the point to the minister that I used these words in relation to the new arrangements for nursing homes and the up-front fee that veterans and war widows would be subjected to.

192,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"It is only one question; not a series. It relates to standing order 100 and to proceedings in the House on Tuesday, 4 December. At page 7411 of the Hansard, it clearly shows you making a ruling and me, in accordance with standing order 100, moving dissent at once. You would not allowMr Reith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order is based on the statement that you made earlier at the start of question time. This is clearly not a question, as the smile on the face of the Manager of Opposition Business indicates. As the preliminary part of the question indicates, he now wishes to revisit a matter which has been before the chair previously. On that basis it is not an appropriate question. It is clearly outside the terms of your earlier statement, and I do not believe it should be countenanced. Further in support of my point of order, House of Representatives Practice does, in fact, outline the circumstances and the nature of questions that can be put to the Speaker. It is true that, by convention, some latitude has been given to members when it comes to asking questions about the procedures and operations of standing orders, but there must be a point in time where the line should be drawn. It does seem to me, Mr Speaker, that your statement today was a very fair one.

201,Mr SHARP,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I am tabling in parliament today the government's response to the Plane safe find report. In opposition I had been very active in highlighting the need for the establishment a parliamentary inquiry and became an enthuwork siastic member of the House of Representahundreds tives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure inquiry into aviation safety in the commuter and general aviation sectors. This parliamentary inquiry was established following the release in July 1994 of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation's report into the Monarch Airlines accident crash, which killed the two crew and five passengers on board on 11 June 1993. I took a close interest in that tragedy because all the passenprivate gers were known to me, and most of them were my constituents. The inquiry was advertised widely, resulting in over 250 submissions from interested parties and 22 public hearings conducted several locations around the country at Moorabbin, Bankstown and Brisbane, as well as in Canberra. Before the plane safe inquiry passengers. was completed, the tragic Seaview accident took place, taking nine lives. The CAA was then split into the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA, and Airservices Australia, under separate legislative charters, as I cated in my first speech on this May 1994. It gave me no satisfaction that the Seaview accident had occurred, despite the warning signals that had been given by me and many others in the aviation industry months before. While the plane safe committee understood that many people took the opportunity to make 'complaints submissions', directed primarily at the regulator, it was surprised at the evidence that pointed to divisions within the industry, clashes of personalities and the readiness of some to vilify others in the industry. Too many people were chasing too little business. Pressures then mount to save dollars on safety related activities, such as Response maintenance, leading to violation of safety regulations. The committee also uncovered wars going on inside and outside the CAA. We did not a harmonious safety regulator, focused on teamwork, working to a common purpose. The relationship between the CAA and of industry was no better. The regulatory framewas simply out of date, comprising of often unintelligible and inconsistent regulations-in some cases, simply unnecessary or counterproductive. The Australian aviation industry has some of the most professional personnel in the world and they have helped maintain our international standing in aviation safety. But there was also a feeling in general aviation that the former CAA spent an inordinate amount of effort in the safety surveillance of operations, seeking out relatively minor defects, compared with the effort put into monitoring the operations of airlines in carrying fare paying passengers, especially the operations of commuter and charter airlines, where little effort seemed to be taken. The at CAA failed to view the bigger picture and appreciate that the regulator's primary role must be on ensuring the safety of fare paying I plan to give a further reference to the committee's successor-the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communiadvocations, Transport and Microeconomic Resubject in form-in the coming year. The committee focused on many critical and key areas in its conclusions and recommendations in the Plane safe report. I am pleased to announce today the government's response to each of these recommendations in the five key areas: improving safety, the effectiveness of regulation, organisational performance, knowledge of the industry and accountability. The deficiencies highlighted in the report have been corroborated by the Monarch coronial inquiry and the Seaview commission of inquiry report. The government's efforts to address these deficiencies began in my response to the Monarch coronial report on 25 June. On 28 June I launched the most extensive review of Australia's aviation safety regulation regime in aviation history. This review process is an important step forward for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It is about simplicity and efficiency. It comprises two parts: a regulatory framework program which will result in a total rewrite of and a regulatory role program involving a thorough examination of the way the Civil Aviation Safety Authority carries out its regulatory responsibilities. An overarching program advisory panel is overseeing the review chaired by Mr James Kimpton of Ansett Australia, an immediate past chairman of the Australian Air Transport Association. An important member is John Laverick, the father of one of the victims of the Seaview crash, who has become an effective advocate for consumer rights in aviation. He is supported by Hilary Caldwell, wife of a victim of the Monarch crash. For too long the consumer has been forgotten in aviation regulation. Today I have taken steps towards addressing this oversight. In conjunction with the two major domestic Australian airlines and the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, I have signed a code of conduct in relation to domestic code share flights. This code provides that: tickets issued from Qantas and Ansett incorporate printed information advising a code-share service is being operated and giving the name of the carrier operating the service, tickets issued by travel agents have a sticker advising the consumer if it is a codeshare flight and indicating they can seek further information from the ticketing airline, and code-share flights be clearly indicated on airline timetables. This is only a first step. A safety pamphlet providing a simple explanation of charter and regular public transport safety regulatory and operational standards so that consumers are aware of the standards relevant to the type of different operations available in Australia is being prepared. Further information for the public and the industry will be provided by the release today of a comprehensive series of aviation safety and activity indicators. This new publication will complement traditional presentations of accident statistics with indicators including flying hours, licences, occupations, airspace incursions and load factors, to the regulations; be updated annually. In my ministerial statement accompanying the tabling of the Seaview Commission of Inquiry on 8 October this year, I touched on the need for a change of culture inside the regulator. None of us on the Plane safe committee believed that this would be an easy task. CAS A has been criticised as simply the regulatory arm of the old Civil Aviation Authority under a new name, and still suffering from many of its shortcomings. These criticisms must be addressed and implementation of the Plane safe recommendations is a fundamental part of this process. The response to these recommendations provide CAS A and the industry with an opportunity to repair Australia's aviation safety regulatory regime. The government will place more onus on owners rather than their employees to ensure that airline operations are conducted in accordance with regulations. The government demands a significant improvement in aviation safety in this country, which will need commitment to move forward from all participants in the aviation industry, including all CASA staff and management. At this critical time for the authority, it needs strong leadership from a board with an understanding of the aviation industry and an intelligently informed appreciation of the reforms needed within CASA to address the difficulties of the past. I need board members with aviation experience to closely guide the rebuilding of Australia's aviation safety regulator and the other regulatory reforms currently under way. That is why I call on the board members to make way to enable the government to implement its election commitment in this respect. In conclusion, I extend my thanks to my colleagues on the Plane safe committee: the  Morris), chaired the committee throughout its deliberations and did a very good job; the deputy chairman, the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur); another very active member of the committee, the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), who participated, I think, in everyone of the hearings of the Plane safe inquiry; and to other members of the committee. I take this opportunity to thank those people who gave evidence to us. Even though at times the evidence given to us was frustrating and conflicted with previous evidence given, causing members of the committee taking an interest in this inquiry to take longer to deliberate over it than we otherwise would have done, I thank all the people who gave evidence. It was valuable evidence which will help build a safer aviation industry for Australia. I also thank the committee secretary, Mr Malcolm Aldons, and the secretariat staff. They successfully mastered one of the most daunting data management tasks ever to confront a parliamentary committee. I take this opportunity to thank our consultant, Mr Trevor Thomas, who was engaged by the committee specifically to assist in providing advice throughout the time of the inquiry. I table the government's formal response to each of the recommendations contained in the Plane safe report.",83
202,Mr TANNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Melbourne) (3.28 p.m.}-by leave-This is the third ministerial statement on aviation safety regulations we have had in roughly five months. Unfortunately, quantity is no substitute for quality. It has been roughly nine months since the government had its first opportunity to make a response to the findings of the Plane safe inquiry. If ministerial statements were the solution, then we would have had all the problems well behind us by now. It is also, I observe in passing, a great pity that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), who has been so productive when it comes to making ministerial statements on aviation safety, has failed to come into this House and make a ministerial statement on the proposed privatisation of Australian National and National Rail, which he saw fit to announce on the Channel 9 Sunday program rather tban to the parliament. The opposition welcomes the acceptance by the government of the substantive recommendations in the Plane safe inquiry. I particularly refer to the proposed code of conduct on code sharing; the proposal to publish safety deficiency reports for individual operators, which will create greater information on which people can judge the safety performance of the various airlines offering passenger services; and the proposal to conduct a greater number of random and surprise checks on charter operators and also those people potentially involved in trading in bogus parts, which is becoming an increasing problem not only in Australia but also in other parts of the world. I would describe these as long overdue and important first steps. But they are by no means the conclusion to the problems that we face in aviation safety. I also note that the minister proposes to request the House committee to conduct another inquiry. It is not specified in his speech, but I presume that he refers to the sports aviation recommendation that was included in the Plane safe recommendations. As a member of that committee I certainly hope he does, because we have had enough inquiries, I think, on these issues to understand what the problems really are. It is fortunate that we are at last seeing the minister address some of the substantive issues in aviation safety regulation after the first two non-event statements that he has made to the House in which there are only two substantial messages: firstly, his unrelenting and personal vendetta against the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and, in particular, the chairman of the board, Mr Justice Fisher; and, secondly, his commendable proposal for a regulatory review with respect to our civil aviation safety regulations. With respect to the first, we have seen on numerous occasions completely unfounded attacks on the integrity, the performance and the competence of the members of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, in which he has demeaned his office of minister and has bemused people in the industry to the point where editors of distinguished specialist publications in the industry such as the Aviation Report and Flying have commented adversely on the minister's approach in this area. Many others have also commented on the peculiarity of his vendetta against the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The regulatory review, as I indicated, is a worthwhile proposal which merits action in its own right, but it is not the primary solution to the problems that we have had in civil aviation safety regulation because those problems are essentially problems of enforcement. They are not problems necessarily related to the content of the regulations, although there clearly is need for improvement there. The primary problems we face in aviation safety regulation, as was made very plain in the Monarch and Seaview reports, relate to the enforcement of the regulations. Even in the question of establishing that regulatory review, the minister was unable to avoid some rather spectacular blunders reflecting his interests and his debts to particular sections of the industry. He asked the representatives of the various components of the industry represented on the program advisory panel for the regulatory review to nominate a person from amongst themselves to chair that panel. They came forward with a nomination. The minister decided that he did not like their nomination and, therefore, unilaterally decided that Mr Boyd Munro from the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association would be appointed to chair the panel. As a result of this unilateral announcement, the bulk of the members of the panel representing the bulk of the industry-the industry that carries 30 million passengers every year, the people who actually do the hard work and have the responsibility of ensuring that Australians can catch planes, helicopters and the like without fear for their safety-rebelled. They rejected the minister's nomination and said that, if that were the case, they would simply refuse to serve. The minister, therefore, had to ignominiously back down and we ended up with Mr James Kimpton-a very worthwhile appointment-to chair that board. In his approach to these issues, the minister has constantly been attacking not only the board of CASA but also the staff and the management of CAS A, virtually never actually providing detail of anything that they are alleged to have done, never providing evidence, never providing substance-just making sweeping statements and accusations indicating ongoing failings but with no action on his part to deal with these things other than his continuing vendetta against the board. Recent examples of his behaviour with respect to the civil aviation safety regulation matters include overruling his own experts in CAS A on the electronic locater transmitters issue, which I have mentioned previously in the House. And it was recently admitted in the Senate estimates process by the CEO of CASA, Mr Leroy Keith, that, as a result of the decision that was forced on CASA by the minister against their expert advice to allow hand-held EL Ts to be used in lieu of fixed ELTs, this would mean that a 'lesser standard' would apply. In Mr Keith's words, the reason for this was that: The force in AOPAand a few words there are not pertinentMr Sharp-Oh! Would you like to cut and paste them?",85
203,Mr TANNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Would you like those words as well: were opposed to a relatively expensive beacon. I am happy to table the full quote. What Mr Keith was admitting was that CASA had advised against a regulation allowing handheld ELTs and been overruled by the minister. There is a minute on the record of 16 May from the chief flying operations manager of the technical branch of CASA, Mr Holger von Munchausen, disassociating himself and the other technical advisers in that branch of CAS A from the minister's decision. The second recent performance in this area that has merited some attention has related to the Falcon Airlines crash where the minister has given two answers in the House on two issues that he has sought to connect: the crash itself, which, fortunately, led to no loss of life; and the fact that a CASA inspector in North Queensland was a former owner of Falcon Airlines and that potentially there was a conflict of interest there. There was a critical issue in all of this, key fact, and the minister did not mention it on either occasion-another slippery little performance. He did not mention the key fact that Mr Kilin, the former owner of Falcon Airlines, was employed by CASA explicitly on the basis that he would not be engaged in any supervisory activities with respect to Falcon Airlines. But did the minister mention that in either of his statements in the House in response to questions? No. Has he mentioned it in public in any situation at all? No. Has he mentioned it at all? No, he has not mentioned it in the slightest. There may well be issues of conflict of interest involved in some situations in CASA, but one of the reasons that they tend to arise is that CASA has a very small pool of people to draw from. By definition, in order to get people to engage in aviation regulatory activity, they are going to have to go primarily to people who are in the aviation industry, the very people who are being regulated. It is difficult to avoid. It is an important issue and something that any government has to pay serious attention to. There have been significant improvements in recent times, which I applaud-initiated by Leroy Keith-but the minister, in his unrelenting attempts to blacken the name of CASA and its board, has failed to point out that this safeguard was built in there. It is the key fact in this story. We have seen a similar performance with respect to the recent resignation of Dr Robert Liddell, the former chief medical officer of CASA, who made a number of allegations. The minister and his office have concluded that, in this situation, CASA was right. It appears Dr Liddell resigned because he was unhappy that his budget for overseas travel had been cut and CAS A was refusing to pay the cost of his being trained to fly 767s. CAS A determined that this was an excessive amount of money to be provided for unilaterally discretionary expenditure, and Dr Liddell was unhappy about this. CAS A pointed out that the cuts that had been made in Dr Liddell's discretionary budget had been made across the organisation in discretionary budgets because the minister had asked CASA to conduct the regulatory one review. That had not been given additional funding and, therefore, these cuts had to be made. Have we heard the minister at any stage publicly state that CASA was in the right in these situations, that there was nothing wrong in the circumstances that led to Dr Liddell's resigning? No, we have not. The minister has deliberately, duplicitously and highly irresponsibly continued to attack his own authority, an authority that has a fundamental and very important responsibility-to ensure the safety of people in the aviation sector, passengers in planes and other aviation craft throughout this country. I am concerned about the likely consequences of these unrelenting attacks. I am concerned about the possible future of the CEO of CASA, Mr Leroy Keith, who is facing a very difficult task and is constantly being effectively undermined by the minister's interference and by his attacks on CAS A. I would be not at all surprised if at some stage Mr Keith decides that he has had enough. I have confidence in Mr Keith. I would like to hear the minister stand up and say that he has confidence in Mr Keith. To the best of my knowledge, there has not been one divided vote on that board, Minister. The board that you attack, the board that you criticise, has not had any serious divisions. That includes Mr Keith. I would like to hear you stand up and express your confidence in Mr Keith. I have confidence in him. Instead of constantly sniping, criticising, publicly attacldng and running a vendetta against your own authority, I would like to see you get in there, roll your sleeves up, get your hands a bit dirty and start working with them to deal with some of the critical issues, instead of just throwing mud at them. At least we made a start today by responding to some of the important recommendations in the Plane safe report. That is an important start. Minister, it is critical that you realise, Justice Fisher pointed out, that CASA is not there to serve the industry. The industry is not CASA's customer. CAS A is there to regulate the industry. It regulates the industry on behalf of 30 million passengers, who have safety concerns. Minister, you are responsible for them and you have to look after them. CASA regulates the industry on the passengers' behalf. It is not there to serve the industry; it is there to regulate the industry. I appeal to those mainstream, large players in the industry-to the Qantases and the Ansetts and the regional carriers-who have been quiet in the debate so far and who ultimately must represent the interests of those passengers, the people who provide their business, to come out and give their views on the outrageous stuff that has been going on from this minister with respect to civil aviation safety regulation. Local Government",86
204,Mr WARWICK SMITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (3.40 p.m.)-by leave-I am tabling today for the information of honourable members the first ever local government national report and accompanying policy paper outlining the Commonwealth policy on local government. Under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995, the federal minister responsible for local government is required to report annually to parliament on the operation of the act. This report is an important document aimed at improving the accountability of councils, encouraging council efficiency and effectiveness. It also makes the process of distributing Commonwealth grants to councils transparent. Together with this first national report, I am tabling a policy paper on local government, Commonwealth councils and communitylooking ahead, which challenges local government to take advantage of Commonwealth support and work together to advance good governance, good economic management and greater fairness in our community. We would all agree that local government as Mr plays a key role in the well-being of every Australian. From Huon Valley to Minjilang, from Busselton to Cardwell, across Australia some 770 local councils provide leadership and services to their local communities. In total, local government expenditure exceeds $11 billion, or some five per cent of total government spending, and in 1995-96 local councils employed some 155,000 people. The services of local government are vital to businesses as well as to individuals. Local public works, recreation, public health, community services, building, planning and development approval and cultural activities are just a few examples of services for which we rely on local councils. Despite the diversity in councils, the central challenge for each is to provide the highest quality and widest range of services, consistent with the needs and aspirations of its community and the resources available. This must be achieved within the provisions of relevant state and territory legislation and regulation. If Australia is to develop and prosper, all three spheres of government-Commonwealth, state and territory and local-must play their part in establishing a framework of governance which allows individuals, families, business and communities to realise their potential and flourish. To meet this challenge councils must seek continuous improvement in all council activities, identify and introduce new technologies or processes which can achieve quantum improvement in councils' operations or service delivery, provide leadership in balancing the demands of the vocal against the views of the wider community, and seek to broaden and deepen the council financial base to provide greater financial capacity and stability. Many councils are taking up this challenge and this needs to be an ongoing process, as it is for other governments and the private sector. While local government governance is primarily an issue for state and territory governments and local councils themselves, the Commonwealth wishes to ensure that financial assistance to local government contributes to optimal community outcomes. Most local councils derive the largest share of their revenue from property rates. Other sources of income generated by councils include charges for garbage collection, public services, housing and community services, economic services, health and community services, recreational and cultural amenities and charges associated with development activities. Total income from these sources, however, is generally not sufficient to fully finance councils' operations and provide an appropriate level of services to residents. Councils with small populations and a limited revenue base are often among the most stretched. The Commonwealth provides significant financial assistance and program funding to local government. As a matter of good management, however, local councils should seek as far as possible to achieve financial security in their own right. This requires them to consolidate their revenue bases, explore alternative financing mechanisms and ensure that their administration and services are as affordable and efficient as possible. In 1996-97 the Commonwealth is contributing over $1.2 billion to increase the financial capacity of local councils and provide greater certainty in their funding. This represents an increase of four per cent over Commonwealth funding to local government in 1995-96, an excellent result for local government in the light of the very difficult economic circumstances faced by the government when it came to office. The funding provided by the Commonwealth through financial assistance grants, known as FAGs, is a significant element in the budgets of individual local councils, ranging up to around half of their income in some cases, especially in remote areas. The overall contribution by FAGs to local government income is over 10 per cent. In keeping with the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act the government will initiate a review of local government financial assistance, to be carried out not later than 30 June 2001. This will be done in consultation with the states and territories and local government. An important purpose of the report being tabled today is to improve the transparency with which states and the Northern Territory Grants Commission determine the distribution of financial assistance to councils within their jurisdictions. The information provided through this annual report will be valuable background for this planned review of FAGs. The documents being tabled today review the existing position of councils but, importantly, also look to the future. Commonwealth, councils and community-looking ahead sets out a range of new initiatives. These are summarised in the policy paper but the main elements include: training for council officers to enhance their skills to meet emerging policy and management challenges; continuing support for the National Awards for Innovation in Local Government, NAILG, to promote excellence and innovation in local government activities and services. For the 1997 awards there is a reduced number of categories to encourage even higher quality applications and proposals; the government's response to the recommendations of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force that relate to local government. In consultation with the states, territories and local government, I intend to provide support for the implementation of local government related recommendations; cooperation with councils affected by the Sydney 2000 Games to facilitate their making the best possible use of opportunities provided by this unique event in conjunction with my role as Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the 2000 Olympics; and continued support for benchmarking and continuous improvement initiatives. I will be making more detailed announcements on these and the other initiatives early in the new year after discussions, including with State and local governments. The initiatives outlined in Commonwealth, councils and community-looking ahead provide a framework for addressing the challenges facing local government. Prior to commending the report, I also extend my thanks and the thanks of my office to the National Office of Local Government, who have worked tirelessly to prepare this documentation in a reasonably short period. It is the first time this report has been ed to the parliament. It is by virtue of an act that both sides of the parliament supported prior to the election and it is also equipped with detailed maps of all the local council districts, all 770 of them right around Australia. To colleagues of the National Office of Local Government, we extend a special thank you to you for the work you have done as well. I commend it and the national report to honourable members.",88
205,Mr LATHAM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-Among the documents that the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) is tabling today, there is one outstanding omission. The former Labor government had an accord with the local government sector-a very useful accord, an expression of partnership between federal and local governments in Australia consummated by the former minister Brian Howe. The coalition's version of that accord will not be found among the documents the minister is tabling today. The minister has been trying to negotiate a memorandum of understanding with the Australian Local Government Association throughout the course of this week with its general assembly here in Canberra. The fact that that memorandum has not been signed off by both parties, I believe, is a fundamental breach of trust and process between the new federal government and the local government sector. I think it is very disappointing that the new minister and the new coalition government have been unable to continue that sense of partnership and formal agreement that the former government had in place with local government authorities throughout the country. I further understand that the main stumbling block in arriving at a memorandum of understanding is the position in relation to the future of financial assistance grants. As the shadow minister, I have no doubt that the concerns of local government are well placed-not only legitimate concerns but also legitimate confusion about what this government wants to do with the $1.2 billion financial assistance grants program. The new minister, Mr Smith, started his presenttime as minister addressing the IMM in Canberra talking about the importance of amalgamation of councils-something that needs to be linked in his opinion to the financial assistance grants. Mr Broadbent-Hear, hear!",90
206,Mr LATHAM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"That, despite the support of the honourable member now interjecting, has fallen off the agenda. If Mr Broadbent is so supportive of linking financial assistance grants to amalgamations he will be very disappointed to see that among the documents being tabled by the minister today there is no such linkage. So the minister flew that proposition up the flagpole but it fell down just as quickly. The Australian Labor Party, in the broad sweep of reforms that might produce local government efficiencies, sees council amalgamations as a low order priority. We think more important issues should be raised with respect to financial assistance grants. Then we had the National Commission of Audit which recommended the abolition of the direct payment of financial assistance grants to local government and that those payments should be incorporated into state government payments. The recommendations of the National Commission of Audit have not been refuted by the minister. I was expecting that in his ministerial statement today he might take the opportunity in this important week for local government to rule out of hand, to rule as unacceptable, any linkage, any direct payment, of financial assistance grants on to states. The Labor Party believes passionately that the system we put in place under Tom Uren should remain in place; that is, there should be a direct allocation to the councils themselves, not the rolling of financial assistance grants into general state payments. The confusion of local government is well recorded by those events. Then we have the announcement today by the minister that he is conducting a review. Having tried two policy proposals and got nowhere, we are now getting a review to be completed by 1 July 2001. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, as a long standing and long serving member of the House, you and many others would appreciate that this is perhaps a world record for time in which a review of a straightforward part of Commonwealth responsibilities is to be conducted-41/2 years of uncertainty for local government in the future direction of financial assistance grants. I can only suggest that the minister is either overworked or has to take these things step by step. There has been a debate about whether or not the government is full of hares or tortoises. The minister has put himself in the tortoise camp. I can only suggest that he wants to get the Olympics out of the way in the year 2000 before he can finalise the FAG review. He has mentioned that it is in the act. If he seeks the cooperation of the opposition in amending the act for a more prompt review, then I can assure him that that cooperation would be forthcoming. The Labor Party is quite concerned about the direction of policy affecting the local government sector. There has been an exaggeration of the imbalance between municipal responsibilities and municipal finances since March. We have seen savage cuts to the child-care sector. Child-care centres have been forced to close under this government's policies, something that really affects local government hard and directly. The abolition of employment programs is driving down new work opportunities out of the local government sector. The cuts to the information technology initiative for libraries, cuts to urban flood mitigation program, cuts to better cities mark II, cuts to road infrastructure-all of these cuts are impacting harshly upon municipal budgets. While the government might claim a four per cent gross increase in the FAGs allocation for 1996-97, everyone knows, including everyone at the general assembly this week, that that is merely the continuation of indexation introduced by the former government. When one accounts for inflation costs to councils, it reflects a real change close enough to zero. Moreover, only action by the Premiers and the ALGA in May prevented councils from having to pay all federal sales taxes without a dollar of federal land rates in return. Each of the policies of the new government concerning local government underrates the role of councils as a service provider. During a time of economic and social change, communities need new sources of stability and opportunity. Particularly in our regions, local government should be seen and developed as an important stabiliser for society. If properly resourced and chartered, it can do the things and provide the opportunities which individuals, families and communities are now struggling to do and provide. Moreover, the Labor Party urges the minister to quickly finalise the issue of constitutional recognition for local government. What is happening with the constitutional convention? What has happened to the government's firm election promise to place the constitutional recognition of local government on the agenda of that constitutional convention? We all remember so sadly the shameful campaign led by the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and other members of the Liberal Party in 1988 to oppose the constitutional recognition of local government. Now in federal government the coalition should speedily support its commitment for the constitutional recognition of local government. The Labor Party believes passionately in the active role of government, especially at a local level. It might just be that amid the flurry of change in Australia and beyond the only true stabilisers most of us will find, the the only lasting guarantees we will have against insecurity, lie in the things we will share in common and are willing to share with each other. Local government at community level is a very important expression of that principle. It can do good things at a local level. Local government has always been supported by the Australian Labor Party: in our origins more than a century ago, in the pioneering reforms of Tom Uren, continued by Brian Howe. We note with grave concern and disappointment that many of those supportive functions and programs for local government are being wound back and wound down. We urge the government to place on the agenda of COAG an active review of the functions and financial opportunities available to local government in Australia, particularly to resurrect the place management trials that were going to feature as part of the better cities program mark II-that is, new systems of integrated service delivery to address the primary problems of disadvantage in our society at a local level. If being is a whole of life experience, local government can be used as a catalyst to develop whole of government solutions. Moreover, we urge so many colleagues and friends in the local government sector to join our campaign for public sector renewal to show that government in our society during this time of change has a very active creative role to play, especially at a local level. So I make those remarks with respect to the minister's statement and the omission in his tabling of a memorandum of understanding with local government. It is a sad moment that the partnership established by the former government is not to be continued at this time. Finally, I wish to place on record the appreciation of the Australian Labor Party for Mr David Plumridge, the outgoing President of the ALGA. We appreciate his efforts and service to the sector and his active cooperation with the former minister, Mr Brian Howe. We warmly welcome councillor John Campbell, Deputy Mayor of the City of Brisbane, as the new President of the ALGA. We look forward as ever to a very constructive relationship with the peak body of local government and each of the 700-odd councils throughout Australia. NA Resignation",90
207,Mr LANGMORE,MEMBER FOR FRASER,"by leave- Mr Speaker, tomorrow I will hand you my resignation from this House. So I thank you and the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) for the courtesy of allowing me to make this final statement. It has been an extraordinary privilege to represent the people of Fraser in this House for the last 12 years, a privilege to which earlier in life I barely dared to aspire. There is no other electorate I would rather have represented, for the voters in Fraser are generally, socially and environmentally concerned, politically well informed, interested in public issues, supportive of humane, equitable policies and culturally diverse. This has made my work both interesting and demanding but has also meant there has been strong support for advocacy of policies aimed disadvantaged at goals in those areas. At the launch of my first campaign for Fraser in 1984, I said that the principal factors which led me into politics have been concern about unemployment, about injustice both within Australia and between rich and poor countries, concern about international conflict, particularly about the arms race, and a fascination with attempts to ensure good government. These have been amongst the main issues on which I concentrated while a member. In my maiden speech I discussed three issues: responsible government for Canberra, the growth of employment and the arms race. There has been striking progress on each of those issues since then. After much debate, the Commonwealth government's benevolent dictatorship of Canberra ended with the election of the ACT Legislative Assembly in 1989. The number of people in employment in Australia grew by over two million between 1983 and 1995, a fine national achievement to which the accord, moderately stimulatory macro-economic policy and active employment programs all contributed. As one of the originators, with Ralph Willis, of the accord and as a constant advocate of employment stimulating policies, I played a minor part in the development of policies which contributed to that growth. Yet for many reasons unemployment remains Australia's most pressing economic and social problem. In relation to the third issue, the conclusion of the Cold War has transformed global security, and since 1987 there has been a striking decline in global military expenditure-by a third, in fact. In Australia, for example, the proportion of GDP spent on defence has fallen from 2.6 per cent in 198384 to two per cent last year, releasing billions of dollars for improvements in health, education and other desperately needed community services. In a situation where Australia has no enemies, there are no impending threats and most other countries are also reducing the proportion of their national income spent on defence, this reallocation of expenditure priorities is the only responsible policy-and I am particularly delighted that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is here to hear that. So there has been striking progress in each of the areas I identified as my priorities when first elected, though I can claim no responsibility for some of them. Since being elected, I have also continued to constantly advocate strategies and policies which would contribute to increasing equity, strengthening community services, reducing injustice and poverty in Australia and overseas, and protecting ecological diversity. There have, of course, been many debates and conflicts about policies in those areas during the last dozen years. Every member has four loyalties: to their electorate, to the members of the party which preselects them, to their caucus colleagues and to their own values and principles. Each of those loyalties is of crucial importance, yet it is inevitable that they will frequently be in conflict. Each of us resolve those conflicts in different ways on different occasions. For me, there was a central issue of conflict-the dominance of market fundamentalism in economic departments of the Public Service and amongst many of the economic commentators, and the int1uence this has had on some of my colleagues. This narrow and simplistic doctrine not only neglects the frequency of market failure but also misplaces priorities by obsessively emphasising economic criteria at the expense of human well-being. Yet we are a human society, and economic development is a means to an end-not an end in itself. So I have continued to argue for balancing economic criteria with broader human, social and ecological goals and for allowing politics to have its proper role, which is the articulation of the interests of all groups in the community, not just the financial markets, and the reconciling of those differing interests in the context of national and global goals and imperatives. The conflict this involved within the Labor Party prevented me from becoming a minister, which I greatly regret. But I am glad to have had the opportunity to continue to argue this case. Yet some of the best aspects of being a member of parliament are the opportunity to participate in a cooperative activity and the friendships which grow through sharing in the political process. lowe more to Ralph Willis than to any other member, for he gave me my major opportunity as an economic adviser and he has been happy to continue to discuss issues throughout the last 13 years. His intellectual rigour, commitment to principle, transparent integrity and wise political and human judgment were a firm foundation for many of the crucial aspects of policy while Labor was in government. On many occasions I have appreciated Kim Beazley's willingness to consult and listen to suggestions. Kim's eloquence was vividly demonstrated by his speeches during President Clinton's visit. Gareth Evans's extraordinary intellectual energy is expressed through his constant interest in rigorous analysis and in feasible policy innovation. He was Australian's finest postwar foreign minister. Mr Gareth Evans-What about pre-war?",92
208,Mr LANGMORE,MEMBER FOR FRASER,"Enough is enough. Barry Jones's scholarship is legendary. One of the memorable pleasures of sitting in the chamber has been listening to him speak with extensive knowledge and deep feeling about particular people or policies. There are many other members and senators with whom it has been a particular pleasure to cooperate, and whose friendship I have especially valued, including Peter Baldwin, Bob Brown, Bruce Childs, Barney Cooney, Laurie and Martin Ferguson, Colin Hollis, Harry Jenkins, Michael Lee, Leo MCLeay, Allan and Peter Morris, my squash partner Neil O'Keefe, Lindsay Tanner, Andrew Theophanous and Margaret Reynolds. ",93
209,Mr LANGMORE,MEMBER FOR FRASER,"We drew most of the time. There has been very effective collaboration between colleagues from the ACT: Annette Ellis, Kate Lundy and Bob MCMullan. Most recently I have enjoyed working with Robert MCClelland on the caucus living standards and employment committee. Many who are no longer here have also been friends and allies, including Gordon Bilney, Neal Blewett, Maggie Deahm, Wendy Fatin, Garrie Gibson, Brian Howe, John Kerin, Dick Klugman, Jeannette MCHugh, Susan Ryan, Michael Tate, Robert Tickner and Olive Zakharov. Gough Whitlam for whom I worked has, of course, been an inspiration throughout my political career. I have deeply appreciated the kindliness many members of the Liberal, National, Democrat and Green parties-and their cooperation particularly in parliamentary committees. I have, however, been told to keep these remarks short, so will not embarrass them by naming them-with one exception: Margaret Reid, whose habitual pleasantness and cooperation on ACT matters I have valued highly. At a later function I hope to thank more fully many people in the Labor Party in Canberra who have been generously and effectively supportive, but would like to record now profound appreciation to my staff throughout the last 12 years, noting those currently with me who are in the gallery: Andrea Lloyd, Simon Corbell and Kate Crowle. Each of them is highly professional, effective, dedicated, good humoured and a delight to work with. Like all other members, I have been superbsenior ly supported by the efficient, thoughtful and humane staff of parliament in the library, committees, Hansard, the clerks, serjeants Table Offices, the stenographers, attendants, drivers, switchboard operators, dining room and cafeteria staff, and cleaners. For example, I often have been grateful for the clerks at the table who have been courteous enough to look at the speaker when he is addressing an almost empty chamber. A major aspect of members' privilege is the quality of the support we receive from those who work in and around this building. I thank too those journalists who accurately report what happens here and whose commentary contributes to increasing our effectiveness. I wholeheartedly wish members well in the continuing struggle for good government in Australia. I will continue to pray for you in the words with which we open each sitting day. Thank you.",94
210,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMBER FOR FRASER,"On indulgence, I and a large number of colleagues on this side of the House will take advantage of the normal valedictories at the end of next week to speak at length about John's career and the way in which we have valued our friendships with him over the years. But I would like to of make one or two brief points today on behalf of the opposition, as this is John's last day in the chamber. John, in the words that he has used, has portrayed the essential aspects of his character. One aspect is the capacity to exercise a generous heart. He has been more generous to his colleagues than he has been to himself in the remarks that he has made in his farewell to this place. He managed, despite his strictures upon himself, to give just about all of us a guernsey. His very Christian spirit, which has informed his life, and his humility and friendship are obvious in the way in which he has handled his remarks. He has been done a great honour in the appointment that he has received. He does not leave this place for any dilatory reason. He leaves because he is going to be the most official of Australian origin in the United Nations when he takes up his position next year as Director of the Social Policy and Division of the United Nations. That division in that international body carries with it the hopes of hundreds of millions of people, that their plight, their concerns, their issues and their needs will have the attention of the world communitythose who can do something about these matters-well and truly focused on them. It is a heavy burden that he will bear, when he goes to that body, to ensure that the many resolutions of the United Nations and the conferences that have been held to consider these matters-at which many ministers and many diplomats from many governments often make pro forma speeches-are actually held to the words put down on paper or sent out into the ether, and that they actually do the job that they've promised to do. There has probably been no person in this parliament more fit to hold that position than John. If you go over the record of John's speeches, two things strike me-they may strike other people differently. One is that I often find things in them with which I disagree. But what I can never fault is the systematic logic that follows through each argument; that is underpinned by his social conscience-which will lead him in various directions; but he has never gone in a direction purely on emotional grounds. He takes that through as an intellectual exercise to ensure that his arguments are well honed. He has a capacity, therefore, to speak to people who might be of a different mind from himself. Having established a position which he has arrived at by his process of logic, he does not abandon it readily. One of the reasons, which I think he alluded to himself, why he has not enjoyed ministerial office is that he is one of the few people in this place who does not roll with the punches. The fact that he does not roll with the punches means that he gets hit pretty often. So there are aspects of his life in this place which I am sure have been a matter of disappointment to him. But one thing which would never have been a matter of disappointment to him is the fact that he served here for a lengthy period and, as a member of parliament, did all the things effectively, correctly, innovatively and creatively that a member of parliament ought to do in this place. He has been in parliament as the committee system of the House of Representatives has developed. He has used and enhanced the opportunities thus presented in ways which probably very few people in the parliament over that period have managed to emulate. He has had an extraordinary background, as would befit somebody capable of attaining appointment to that post. He has been overseas studying development issues-to Papua New Guinea, for instance-and has been on the staff of successive leaders and frontbenchers, including a period on the staff of the former Prime Minister. I would have enjoyed watching the discussions between the two of them on the policy papers that he would have presented from time to time. But he has been a noted servant of the Labor Party for a very long period and, through the Labor Party, a noted servant of the Australian people. I cannot resist just one last minor jibe as John goes-a precedent has been established shortly before he has left-and that is that it is the first time. I have actually had an admission out of John that the processes by which the defence vote declined as a percentage of GDP have been acceptable, and he has pronounced himself satisfied-by implicationwith the contemporary position, in what he has had to say. This has been a source-you might understand--of some dispute between Mr Langmore and me over the years. I conclude with this point: his motivation has always been the creation of a decent opportunity in life for all humanity and a deep and abiding concern for the peace of the world and the need for it to be free of conflict. With that type of attitude of mind he will do us, as a people, honour not only by simply holding this particular position but also in the way in which he holds it, the policies pursued and the programs developed that will have underpinning them the motivation that goes with one of the most decent consciences in this country.",94
211,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR FRASER,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition. John, your many friends in this place, the other place and the organisational and administrative wings of the parliament extend to you their very best regards, and I know I speak on behalf of them all. God speed and may you always have the best interests of Australia at heart.",95
212,Mr RUDDOCK,MEMBER FOR FRASER," Mr Speaker, I did endeavour to get your eye before you spoke as I would like to associate members on this side of the House with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), although not necessarily all of them. John leaves with a great deal of goodwill from members on this side of the House who have worked with him. He is widely respected for the work that he has contributed, particularly in the area of internamy tional aid. He has been a courageous writer, particularly on economic matters. I know he does not always enjoy the support of his own side-and I imagine not always from this side either-on the views that he has put on those matters, but the tenacity of the views that he puts has been well noted and understood. John, we wish you well in your new endeavours. Whatever follows in relation to the seat of Fraser, undoubtedly the seat will remember you well.",96
213,Mr SINCLAIR,MEMBER FOR FRASER,"I wish to echo the sentiments expressed by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), who has just spoken, and those of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). In so doing I might add that I know that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and many of his colleagues would also like to speak but, in the interests of brevity, decline the opportunity. I wish to do so today for three reasons. One is that I have probably known John as long as anybody in this place. Secondly, I as a parliamentarian have certainly known him since he came to work on the staff of a former Prime Minister, as the Leader of the Opposition suggested. Thirdly, and above all, I think it is important that we have a parliamentarian from Australia going into the United Nations. Many of us are extraordinarily apprehensive about the way in which the United Nations functions and that too often those who are international bureaucrats live within a world that has not necessarily identified with the communities from which they came. Of you, John, that will never be said. You are very much an Australian. You have made a contribution here, you have made a contribution in Papua New Guinea, you have made a contribution as an academic and as a parliamentarian, and you have certainly made an incredible contribution to the parliamentary committee system. I think it is very important that somebody with that background reflecting the Australian idiom will now be contributing at such a senior level within the United Nations. On behalf of all those who will not have an opportunity to speak today, and certainly on own behalf, I wish you well. I am sure that Australia will have a very rigorous voice for whatever time you are in the post you are about to occupy. NA Living Standards",96
214,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to look after low income workers and the interests of their families, in particular because of the impact of the $8 per week offer from the government which will see their overall living standards fall substantially. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number a/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",96
215,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Canberra) (4.18 p.m.)I am glad this matter of public importance is so popular that so many people have come into hear the beginning of it. Mr Ruddock-See how many are here at the end of it.,96
216,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right. Sometimes an opportunity is presented to us in parliament to highlight the contrast between opposition and government on a fundamental or a defining issue. This is one such occasion. On many occasions, the matters debated between government and opposition, between members of parliament and between political parties in parliamentary debates are complex issues. Their impact is remote and often not felt directly by the Australian people. Here today, however, we have the opportunity to make a simple, direct and substantial contrast on a matter that goes to the very heart of the living standards of Australian families. The issue of wages, the level of wage increases, who gets those wage increases, how substantial they are and what workers have to do to get them: these are fundamental issues that affect the living standards of every Australian worker and everybody in the family of every Australian worker. This morning I had the privilege of presenting, on behalf of the opposition, our submission to the living wage case being heard by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. That submission makes very clear and very stark the contrast between the government and the opposition on wages. It is unusual for an opposition to make a submission like that, and those who take the opportunity to read it will realise that we have made it clear this is not a practice we intend to pursue regularly. Rather, it was an initiative generated by two particular circumstances related to this application at the time. Firstly, it involves the extent to which the principles underpinning this application date back to decisions in which many of us on the front-bench of the opposition were involved. We feel that, particularly having seen the nature of the government's submission, many elements of agreement which were entered into by the Australian trade union movement on behalf of Australian workers and which underpinned the move to enterprise bargaining may be undermined. We felt that, as one party to that agreement, we should speak up for the principles that underpinned it. Secondly, this is a very important case. Not every year in which wage principles are reviewed is there a review as fundamental as that associated with this year's living wage claim. For those two reasons, we felt we would make a one-off submission. We believe that what the government is offering is miserably inadequate in the current circumstances: in the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, in the climate of the social changes that are being undertaken and at the end of five years of economic growth. Worse are the constraints that the government, in its submission, seeks to place on the increase. It denies any benefit at all from this increase to hundreds of thousands of workers dependent upon safety net increases for any wage increase they might receive. Those workers are not dependent on safety net increases just for today or for next year. If the submission of the government were to be accepted by the Industrial Relations Commission, virtually a million workers would face the prospect of no wage increase at all for the remainder of the century. This issue was raised today with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) in question time. He cracked a few rather bad jokes and changed the subject because he had no answer to the obvious fact that it is unquestionably true that one million workers who would have received a safety net increase under the principles set down by the previous government and operating at the moment as a consequence of the 1995 decision will not do so if the government's submission is accepted. So how do these two significantly unsatisfactory results-the miserable nature of the increase and the narrow constraints placed on those to whom they might apply-come about? The miserable nature of the offer is established by the chart which accompanies our submission. It shows that workers on the lowest award wage-and this is the point at which there is the highest propensity for safety net increases to flow: workers at the lower area of award wage increases-will have the real value of their wage cut by about $15 over the next three years. They will have the real value of their wage cut every year, and by the end of the three years they will be $15 a week worse off. Of course, the fall in the real value of wages will be greater for everybody whose award is above that lowest level. The percentage increase will be less and the proportionate fall will be more so that every worker who depends upon this government's submission for his or her living standards will see their living standards fall. Often when charts like this are presented people challenge the underlying assumptions. I knew there was a great risk that in any such submission that would be the government's response. But I had a very easy solution. I took the press release of the now Minister for Industrial Relations of June 1995 when he assessed the adequacy of the $14 increase offered by the previous government, replicated exactly the assumptions which he put in his paper-his figures, his assumptions-and they damned him from his own mouth. It is not surprising that the figures came with that conclusion, because the minister said last year that a $14 a week offer by the previous government was inadequate. Yet, 15 months later, he comes with an offer barely half that. It is doubly inadequate. If $14 was unsatisfactory, this is doubly unsatisfactory. Of course, the minister is now trying to change the mode of assessment, trying to bring new factors in rather selectively. He has a selective fascination with the potential impact of the family tax package on some workers but fails to mention the impact that health insurance charges, pharmaceutical benefits and the like will have on them. All of these are affecting the living standards of every Australian family. What the minister shows in his June 1995 too-smart-by-half press release is that what the government is advocating is a fall in real wages for the lowest paid Australians. In fact, the government is proposing a fall in real wages for everybody who depends on the award for their wage increase-and that is 29 per cent of the work force, about three million Australian workers. But it gets worse. For II per cent of the work force, about a million Australian workers, the government's recommendation is that there should be no wage increase at allnothing; zero. These workers are in three categories. The first category is those who have pre-existing over-award payments-and those people are not necessarily very well paid; they could be earning as little as $18,000 a year. But the government says that they are taking too big a share of the economic output, that they should get no wage increase. These people's annual wage is less than the weekly wage increase for the chief executives of some of our largest companies; yet the government says they should get nothing. The second category is those on paid rate awards-and their case was very effectively put by the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) in question time today. I am sure all the workers of Fraser heard those words with telling effect, because it affects most of the workers in that electorate. This government believes they should get no wage increase at all. Their out wage will be recalculated as a minimum and an overaward component, and they will get no increase at all until the overaward component is absorbed-that is, teachers, nurses and public servants. The government's recommendation is that they should get nothing. The third category is those whose award rate is more than average weekly ordinary time earnings-that is, more than about $35,000 a year. I thought those were people who were John Howard's battlers, but they are now fat cats who would have to work for 10 years just to earn enough to meet the costs of the city penthouse of the Minister for Industrial Relations. But they earn too much to get any increase at all. The government believes that, even if they cannot win an enterprise bargain increase, they should get nothing, that they should not have access to any award increase at all. So the most fundamental factor determining the living standards of battling Australian families is the income coming in. You want to freeze it at zero for a million Australians. It is just not good enough. The safety net increase needs to be greater. The tables attached to our submission suggest that to maintain the real wages of the lowest paid it needs to be about $15-certainly not less than $14-just to maintain the real value of the minimum award rate for the lowest paid worker. That does not take into account some crucial questions which the government's submission absolutely ignores. Where is the share of the five years of economic growth for those low paid workers? Where is their return on the significant increase in Australian productivity over the last five years? Where is their reward for all the pain of the difficult process of change and adjustment the Australian work force has been going through? Of course, they can all resort to enterprise bargaining for their increase-and many workers will. But people should not be blackmailed into enterprise bargaining; they should not be bludgeoned into it. If they cannot win an enterprise bargain in their workplace, they should still have some capacity to maintain their living standards. There is a key role for enterprise bargaining. An incentive to enter into such agreements remains appropriate. But many workplaces are currently entering into their fourth or fifth round of enterprise bargaining, and bargaining fatigue is beginning to set in. There are many people who have never had an enterprise bargaining increase. All they have had since 1991 is the $24 safety net from the previous government. A million of those will get nothing further for the rest of this century. Twenty-four dollars for eight years-that is this government's policy for some of the lowest paid and most vulnerable of Australia's workers. Even many of those who have had enterprise bargaining and have had success in enterprise bargaining are saying 'enough'. You certainly will not as a government, and no employer will, win productivity increases in Australia's workplace by dragging reluctant workers to the negotiating table for a round of enterprise bargaining they do not wish to enter that will make them feel more insecure, more uncertain and more apprehensive about their future. In the economy there is room to be more generous than your miserable offer. Our not less than $14 option still allows for overall wage outcomes to be well within the Reserve Bank of Australia's comfort zone. It looked that way to us last year when we made the recommendation. The data suggests that it is still true. Our proposal adds only 0.25 per cent to the existing wage growth figures and, therefore, will bring wage outcomes to about four per cent, consistent with the RBA's inflation target of two per cent to 21/2 per cent-in fact, well below the level of wage increases that would drive it to the increase in inflation. That leaves us with the vital question: if it is economically responsible to offer more than $8, if it makes our society fairer to offer more than $8 and if it helps the living standards of ordinary Australians to offer more than $8, why didn't the government do it? The answer is clear. The conservative side of politics has had a long standing antipathy to wage increases and they have had a manic desire to force people off the award system. It meant that their ambition was not to offer as much as they could justify but to offer as little as they could get away with. It might have been a very interesting ploy in the industrial relations minister's competition with the Treasurer (Mr Costello)-the way this $8 increase was offered-but it is a very miserable offer. The only thing about the offer which I welcome is the opportunity it provides to make a stark contrast between government and opposition and to illustrate the real difference to Australian workers between an Australian Labor Party government and a conservative government. Now we know that the difference is at least $1,000 a year.",96
217,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have just heard a speech of phantasmagoric hypocrisy. About 18 months ago I got into a cab with an enormous man. He was your classic worker, with the Jacky Howe singlet under the flannelette shirt and the stubbies. He told me about his position in relation to supporting his wife and his three kids. Then he went on to say that he was a former union official and had helped the ALP in election campaigns for more than 20 years. I had not told this man at this stage that I was a Liberal candidate. In fact, I do not think I did tell him, because he had so much to say about how the ALP had totally deserted people like him-a classic battler. He said things like, 'They're not interested in the battlers at all.' After all the rhetoric we have heard from the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), the reality isMr Bruce Scott-The chardonnay socialist.",99
218,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He is the chardonnay socialist, as the minister says. This man said that the ALP is not interested in the real people. How can they be interested in the real people when they are not real themselves? The member for Canberra lists as his occupations before coming to Canberra 'union official' and 'party official'. Has he ever had a real job? Has he ever really worked with hands for a living and sweated? There is just no humility on this issue. You would think after the result in March that they might have learnt a lesson. They never learnt a lesson then, as is obvious from the rhetoric that followed that loss. Even the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), whom I respect, has come out with some pretty extraordinary statements as well about the election, saying, 'Well, it wasn't our fault. That was just an aberration.' In reality, when you think about it, look at what happened in March and then look at what happened in Lindsay. Did they learn from Lindsay? Not at all. 'The result means virtually nothing,' the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). Mr Bruce Scott-No. Still out of touch.",100
219,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, they are still out of touch and they will stay out of touch because none of them represent real people. They stand for this minority group of people, whom I will refer to in due course, given the statements of some people. They are a massive minority over there. Let us look at what members have had to say. Let us look at the members on this side of the House from Queensland. What sorts of seats do they represent? The member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) represents working-class areas such as Sandgate and Nudgee, where the real battlers are-people who have their backs to the wall. Look at her background. She has been unemployed herself. She has hit the coalface too, but she has climbed out of that and she has worked her way into here. What better person to represent those sorts of people than a battler herself? We should look at the member for Forde (Mrs Elson)-another person with a solid background, representing the battlers of Eagleby and Beenleigh, who really know what it is like and have been doing it tough under the regime of the previous government. Then we should look at the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro), representing working class areas such as Redcliffe and Chermside. Look at the background she had and the hard work she had to do to get to where she got. his She understands the battlers. She worked in the restaurants, she worked hard and she got her hands dirty. Then we should look at other members such as the member for Bowman (Mrs West), representing areas such as Wynnum and Lota, other battler areas of Queensland. The member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) represents such battler areas as Coopers Plains and Salisbury. The member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall) represents such battler areas as Morningside and East Brisbane. Those are all classic areas where the electorate has deserted the ALP in droves. The voters have come over to this side because said they know that the people over here can adequately represent them. They do not live in academia like the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), who is at the table. The people over there have got no idea of what real people are like. While he is writing his newspaper articles on economics, the people in those electorates are out there sweating and working hard. Mr Tanner-What about the rest of your members? Tell us about Bruce. We haven't heard about Bruce's background yet. Tell us about Bruce.",100
220,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Melbourne had a great deal of indulgence while he was speaking on the ministerial statement. You have had your quota.,100
221,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Think of the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) down in the mines with the miners. He knows what it is like to work hard, as do the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch). They are all people who know what it is like to work hard with their hands and who know what real people are like. Look at the votes that the member for Leichhardt got in Weipa. Do you remember the Weipa dispute and the performance by the former Prime Minister here at the arbitration commission? What did the electorate do up there? They voted for the member for Leichhardt in droves. These and many others epitomise the shift that people who work daily by the sweat of their brow are making. These members recognise that there are battlers out there. Mr Bruce Scott-What about in the farming areas?",100
222,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister might restrain his enthusiasm to participate in the debate, too.",101
223,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is where the mandate has come from. The opposition fail to recognise that. They are getting around as if in a state of automatism. It has not hit them that they have lost. They do not realise that. They are wandering around shell-shocked, coming out with these ridiculous statements about the state of our offer to the arbitration commission and looking at that in isolation rather than in the context of the other advantages that have been given. Mr Hockey-They are deluded.",101
224,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They are deluded, as my colleague from North Sydney says. The member for Canberra wanted to abolish junior wage rates. Members of the opposition talk about a wage increase and put 220,000 jobs at risk with such a proposal. What did Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, say about this proposal? He said: We have got to be alive to the argument that forcing up youth rates can contribute to youth unemployment. I am very conscious of the fact that any thrust in youth rates will see employers simply opt not to employ young people and again, I think that state and federal governments can work together on that front. He should be talking to you blokes over there. Mr Hockey-He's the only Labor Premier in Australia.",101
225,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right. That is another sign. Get back to listening to some of the people who have made some sense, like the former member for Petrie, the one who lost the support of the battlers out there. What did he say? He said, 'The government had become a hostage to minority interests and, as a consequence, had lost its way.' He was staring into the abyss of disaster. He could see it coming. He knew that the Labor Party had lost its way, but you people over there do not realise that, because you do not have the sort of constituency that he recognised he had. There are many other quotes. Bill Hayden, another famous Labor minister and long time Labor member in this place who represented a very working-class area, said in a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald: . .. the ... bullying ... by several, largely selfappointed, political elites ... determined to have us toe the line on what they state to be politically correct. He goes on in a similar vein. The opposition does not want to listen to people who make sense, such as the former Senator Walsh, a former finance minister on their side. You do not want to listen to him because he does not make sense! There used to be people on that side of the House who knew about hard work-something you blokes do not know about. There used to be people like Clyde Cameron and Mick Young over there, who were both shearers. Those people made sense. They were the true-blue Labor blokes. Fred Daly was another true-blue Labor bloke. Those people listened to the working class. They are not here any longer. It is these people on this side of the House-people such as the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) and others-who are listening to the people, to the battlers. Let us have no more of this unctuousnessthere is another word for the member for Melbourne-this pretension of fervour. If the opposition had really cared about these battlers, they would have passed the industrial relations bill, instead of holding it up for months in the Senate whilst they went on a sortie all over the country. I think one of the senators went to Bali during the hearing and put his toes in the sand for a while, while the hearings were going on-that is absolute hypocrisy. More importantly, we have to tum the debate to a number of very important things. What will the offer made by the government in the context of the $1 billion tax initiative that is coming up from 1 January do for the battlers? It is going to provide a person who is supporting children-particularly where one of them is under five-with $19.20 per fortnight. What is wrong with that? That is money in the pocket, that is real money. Do not forget the assistance we are offering in relation to private health insurance. Above all, do not forget the interest rate drop we have achieved. That puts $145 a month in people's pockets. What were the interest rates under the former Labor government? Did they go to 18 per cent once? Mr Hockey-And 22 per cent.",101
226,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They went up to 22 per cent for businesses, as I am reminded. The opposition is incapable of understanding that. It is incapable of seeing that, with a combination of the tax initiative offer from 1 January, the gains that will be given by these measures and the other factors I have mentioned, we are seeing a growth of 0.8 per cent in the September quarter. We are seeing that picking up now. Mr MCMullan-Ha, ha! Nine per cent in six months.",102
227,Mr TONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The shadow minister laughs. Of course he wants to laugh, because he does not want to recognise that growth. So, basically, where are the opposition left in all of this? They are totally covered in Of course, in the context of this particular debate they do not want to talk about the real people suffering out there; that is, the people who are unemployed. What did a very famous Labor Treasurer say in 1994? Do you remember him? Does the honourable member for Melbourne remember him? What did he say? He said that one man's wage increase is another man's job. Do you ever think about the unemployed? Do you ever consider them in this equation? Do you ever think that perhaps they would like a job? You just do not want to think about it. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is a classic example. He has never had a real job in his life. He comes in here and lectures us about what the workers really want. He does not know what work is about. Have you ever sweated? Have you ever got your hands dirty? Have you ever got your hands scratched? You do not know what it is about. This place has become a retirement village for people like the member for Werriwa and others. This is where they go. The former ACTU presidents and others come here. They slot in here-apart from people like the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), whom I respect and who does know about working hard. So many of them have never had a real job. They have never worked. They come in here and try to lecture us and swamp us with all these figures about going backwards and all of that. They have ignored history and ignored the fact that the economy is improving by way of these growth figures. They have ignored the fact that we are committed to families by way of the family tax initiative. They have ignored the advice of real labour people who are telling them they are out of touch, out of step and out of kilter. Is it any wonder that they are that minority on the other side and they are going to stay that way? What we are going to see is just more of this bleating and more of this gloom and doom. At the end of the day, the people who will be voting for us in droves will continue to be those blue-collar workers who respect us and who will stay with us.",102
228,Mr MCCLELLAND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Barton) (4.47 p.m.)egg. The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith)and I have respected his stand on environmental matters-spoke today without any real background knowledge of a number of my colleagues here. Quite simply, his comments were false. They have a depth of experiences in life, including much more manual labour than those opposite would have had to endure, because those opposite had their mums and dads pay their way through university and life. I say to the member for Dickson as I say to those opposite: what would that man in the singlet say if you went back to him and said, 'What do you think of the government's $8 wage rise?' What would the supposed Howard battlers say? This euphemism has become the government's cliche. What would they say if you walked up to them and said, 'Listen, we are offering an extra $8. You are on $360 a week now. We'll offer you an extra $8'? What would they say? They would well and truly say, 'Well, you can stick that up your jumper.' Mr Bruce Scott-You really are out of touch.",102
229,Mr MCCLELLAND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Out of touch? The facts of the matter are that a lot of workers suffered as a result of being forced into enterprise negotiations, and very many of them are in industries where it is simply impossible to bargain because of the nature of the work. Take, for exampleMr MCMullan-Three million of them.",103
230,Mr MCCLELLAND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You can take, for example, the private household sector. Eighty per cent of those people working in that sector earn less than $10 an hour. In agriculture, 48 per cent earn less than $10. The great majority of employees working in personal services, the clothing and footwear industry, restaurants, hotels and clubs, welfare and religious institutions, and retail trade earn less than $10 an hour. Commonsense suggests that in those industries the workers cannot simply negotiate because of the nature of the work. For instance, in the rural industry-New Zealand jokes aside-how do you more efficiently crutch a sheep? It does not make sense. Equally, as Steve HutchinsMr Bruce Scott-Productivity, mate. Wide combs for a start.",103
231,Mr MCCLELLAND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is technology. It is not effort. That is dead right. That involves management and it involves investment in infrastructure, and your side is sorely lacking in addressing management efficiencies. Equally, Steve Hutchins, the National President of the Transport Workers Union, has said, 'It doesn't take a genius to work out that, if you can't drive faster, drive for longer or carry more on the back of your truck, then the scope for improving labour productivity is pretty limited.' It is those workers-those rural workers, those in the repressed industries of that nature where enterprise bargaining has not occurred-who need government assistance. John Buchanan from ACIRT at Sydney University has said that, while some 35 per cent of employees have been successful in negotiating enterprise agreements over the past five years, they have had wage increases of 4.8 per cent. On the other hand, those left on basic award conditions have had rises of only 1.3 per cent, as against inflation rates of three to six per cent. The reality is that enterprise bargaining has left a lot of those ordinary workers behind. The fact of the matter is that Labor had on its agenda the safety net increase of $14 to address that. If the government does not participate and does not address the situation faced by those people, they are simply left under the enterprise bargaining framework to negotiate terms and conditions of surrender. It is about time that the government realised the reality of that. In answer to a question today, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) said, 'Well, it's now a regime where the majority of workers are going to receive their pay increases by negotiation.' There are so many workers-about three million Australians-who are not in a position, because of their particular industry or occupation, to achieve pay increases by negotiation. This government has left them well and truly behind. The shadow minister referred to executive payments. I read in the Canberra Times this morning that the government is supporting payments of up to $700,000 a year for its senior executives. And it is saying that ordinary Australians are not entitled, for a full week's work, to $368 a week! The reality is starkly demonstrated today in the Sydney Morning Herald. It is quoting figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics which show that families on this level of income can afford just $6.50 a week for red meat, $1.80 a week for poultry and $1.74 a week for fish. Most of us sitting here in these comfortable leather seats would spend more than that each night for our dinner. Those families spend less than $10 a week on dairy products, eggs, margarine and oils, and just over $10 a week on fruit, nuts and vegetables. I would ask the minister, if he were here, how many apples you could buy for $10 a week. I suggest that, in a family of three children, they would not even get an apple each day in their school lunch. Mr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: is it appropriate for the member for Throsby to be reading a newspaper whilst his colleague is speaking?",103
232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! I am sure that the honourable member for Throsby is aware of the practices of the House.,104
233,Mr MCCLELLAND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am proud, as a member of the Australian parliament, to be supporting an application for a living wage. To deny any Australian a living wage is short-sighted in the extreme. A fundamentally decent and committed Australian recently said: What are the consequences of people being poor? Some are obvious, such as the frustration and guilt-and often despair-of people who simply don't have the means to cope with the day-today living expenses which most of us manage without too much drama: paying the rent, getting about on public transport, putting food on the table, providing for the children. But the effects go beyond these things. Poverty is actually a health hazard, connected with higher rates of mortality, chronic illness and use of hospitals. The Bishops' Pastoral Statement which is the keynote text for this conference mentions other broader consequences such as social division, disharmony and greater crime levels. That Australian-that fundamentally decent Australian-was Kim Beazley. He stands in stark contrast to the Shakespearian theatrics that take place on the opposite side when they mouth euphemisms and cliches about battlers. If you are supporting battlers, if you are in a seat where you have people on that level of income, there is no way that this measly, mean offer of $8 a week can be justified. The government, by its failure to support the claim for a living wage, is denying those families, which it continues to patronise, a decent standard of living. It is quite literally condemning them to years-indeed generations-of institutionalised poverty. The facts of the matter are that you, quite frankly, do not understand that they are being left behind in the wake of enterprise negotiations. They have to be supported-and you are not doing it. You are leaving them well and truly in the lurch. It is going to be intergenerational. You stand to be condemned. By the time of the next election you will well and truly be condemned.",104
234,Ms JEANES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In raising the issue of living standards, those on the other side of the House seem to have forgotten the last 13 years of Australian political history. They have forgotten what they have done to people in my electorate who are representative of the ordinary women and men of Australian society. In 1983 I watched the television with sadness as the effect of electoral defeat showed on the face of Malcolm Fraser. I always thought he was a very decent man. I did not spend a lot of energy dwelling on the defeat at the time, although I had sympathy with the Liberal side of politics, because I was very deeply involved in my life as a battler. I was raising two very young children and had to work part time to pay the household accounts. In March 1983, when Malcolm Fraser left office, the real variable housing interest rate, after discounting for inflation, was only 1.8 per cent. By 1989 people were paying 17.9 per cent. The real rate had escalated to 10.8 per cent. My family found this rate rise crippling. So did the many families around us. The sleepless nights caused by the worry this created is something that people should not have to live with. Since the March electionsince the Howard government has been managing the economy-housing interest rates have already fallen three times. The variable rate has fallen from 10.5 per cent to 8.75 per cent. That reduction will save the average Australian family $145 on their monthly housing interest bill. If those opposite do not realise that these rate cuts had a beneficial impact on the living standards of ordinary Australian families, particularly the low-income families who have less disposable income and, therefore, fewer choices about how they spend that income, then it is no wonder that I am standing here on this side of the House with my colleagues and you lot are not. It was about this time that the colleagues of those opposite began to lose touch. They either did not care about or did not understand the effects that their handling of the economy was having on the ordinary families of Australia like mine. I was so angry about the effect of these rises on my family and on the families of my friends who lived in the same mortgage belt area that I decided to find out more about politics and the reasons behind such devastating decisions-decisions that so adversely affected ordinary families like my own. I sought to play an active part in the Australian political process. I chose to join the Liberal Party and to enrol at Flinders University to study politics. As policy and law-makers in this place, we all have a responsibility to develop policies and to pass laws that contribute to the empowerment of the people that we representthe people of Australia-so that they can make their own decisions about the matters that affect their daily lives, and so that they can make those decisions with confidence that they will be able to carry them out. People are not empowered when they do not have the capacity to make those decisions or the confidence that they will be able to carry them out. The Hawke-Keating era did not provide the people of Australia with the capacity or the confidence that they deserve to take control of their daily lives. The empowerment of the Australian people was not the goal of the previous government. That is why the Australian people rejected them on 2 March this year. In fact, phone calls to my office suggest that the previous government contributed to the disempowerment of people. Many people believe that social security benefits are their right for life and that they should not have to make an effort to look for work to receive them. This is truly a sad state of affairs-that people do not want to make a contribution to the economic advancement of this country and that this attitude was perpetuated under the previous government. The Australian people became fed up. They knew that they were getting nowhere. They knew that the uncertainty generated by growing unemployment ranks threatened their security and the security of their families and neighbours. They knew, when they looked around them and saw the symptoms of the previous government's failure to produce employment opportunities for young Australians, that their rhetoric and their desire to stay in power was not met by their commitment. The impact and the despair amongst Australia's young people cannot be overlooked as a factor in your election defeat. It is indeed the greatest tragedy that our nation has to grapple with and the greatest priority that this government has to deal with. As I moved about my electorate last year, the young people I met told me they were sick of training programs and that they did not want to do another training program; they just wanted a job so they could enjoy a decent standard of living. Tragically, too many of the young people that I met did not have anything like the skills needed to be job ready. They were supported through successful programs like JPET, which the previous government introduced and then axed on 30 June last year. A great lot of sense that made at the time, I thought, to introduce a pilot program that was successful and then abandon the program and the young people it supported! I am proud to say this government has reinstated the JPET program. It will be of great benefit to the young people in my electorate who are not yet job ready. Tragically, many of these young people have often never had the benefit of a role model who gets up in the morning and goes to work. They never had the benefit of a role model who supported their family by earning an income and making a contribution to the wealth and stability of the country and, therefore, to the future of their families. Sadly, too many of them have not had this role model in either the form of a parent or grandparent. These young people had to be supported through programs like JPET, through the work of the many wonderful organisations around the country like Y-Train, a successful organisation in my electorate run by the YWCA, which has the job of assisting young people to become job ready. It has the job of teaching them the daily life skills that they didn't learn from their families. They did not learn about these skills in their families because their families did not have these skills. It is perhaps this country's other great tragedy that some families are not equipped to pass on these and many other skills to their children so that they can become independent young adults and can make their own contribution to this country in a constructive and meaningful way. Too often their contribution is made using spray cans, needles, stolen property, alcohol and other harmful substances. This is not a reality that any of us in this House should be in the least bit proud of. It is a reality that all of us should focus on and it is a reality that developed under the noses of the members of the previous government. The reality is that people out of work-the people for whom you didn't achieve anything-are doing it even harder.",104
235,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl}-The honourable member will address her remarks through the chair.,106
236,Ms JEANES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker. That is the reality that this government is faced with and is now dealing with. Employment growth must be fostered in the 800,000 small businesses around the country and under this government it will be. Throughout 1995, I visited hundreds of small businesses in my electorate. Each time. I left a small business operator, I left with the get them. very clear message that they either had had a bad experience with the unfair dismissal laws of the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) or they knew of someone who had. Those opposite did not understand the devastating effect that this legislation had on the confidence of small business operators to take on more people. Each time. I left a small business, I left with the message that businesses were unable to find people who were trained appropriately for their immediate needs. Too many had had bad experiences with the CES and with training providers. The people opposite did not hear this message. All the money from Working Nation was going into training programs that did not train people for the jobs that small employers were too scared to take them on for anyway. This scenario will change under the measures announced, which are to be implemented by this government to more effectively equip young people for existing employment opportunities. Small businesses were also telling me and every other coalition member and candidate around the country that they were drowning under a sea of paperwork and those opposite were not listening. Our response to this massive inhibitor to small business success is well known. The commitment to establish a task force to investigate ways to reduce the burden of paperwork on small business was met and the task force has reported back to the government with 62 recommendations. Our response should be announced in February next year. I note that this is less than one year since we came to office. Why didn't people on the other side respond in the 13 years? The effect of all these barriers has been that small businesses have not employed more people. The effect was, therefore, that their capacity to produce more was not realised. The effect was, therefore, that less wealth was created. The drain, therefore, on the social security budget was not alleviated, governments did not receive income in the form of taxes that small business had the capacity to deliver and people who did not have jobs and had not had them for a long time still did not This is how the people on the other side managed the economy. This is how the people on the other side affected the living standards of the Australian people. What those opposite also failed to realise is that many small business operators are also low income earners. So many that I spoke to would also lay awake at night worrying about where the next job was coming from and how they were going to pay their bills. Those opposite did nothing for their living standards. The member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) is not qualified to talk about living standards falling because he was a part of a government that caused them to plummet. The people opposite were in power to oversee the increasing gap between the wealthy and the poor in this country. So how can those on the other side stand in this place and bleat because we make a realistic offer to the wage earners of Australia, a wage offer that Australian businesses can afford? That is beyond me. You on the other side ignore your own track record and the inability of your party in government over the past 13 years to effectively deal with the underlying social and economic problems that this country faces. Your inability to deal with these problems is the reason that the living standards of too many Australian families are unacceptable. This government is dedicated to dealing with the chaos that you left. This government is addressing the social and economic problems that this country faces, to bring about the empowerment of Australian families so that they wi 11 have meaningful choices available to them and so that they can make the decisions based on those choices that will benefit their lifestyles and their living standards. We will do it much better than you did.",106
237,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! This discussion has concluded. EUTHANASIA LAWS BILL 1996 Main Committee Report Bill returned from Main Committee with an unresolved question; certified copy of bill and schedule of unresolved question presented. Mr Latham-Just seeking a point of clarification, Mr Deputy Speaker: you mentioned an unresolved question but did not report that to the House. I would appreciate a report on the status of the unresolved question. I am also aware that a number of members had amendments that they wanted to make to the second reading as well as to the detail of the bill. I seek your guidance now, in the context of this motion, as to how those amendments might be made.",107

Mr Latham-Thank you. Ordered that the bill be taken into consideration at the next sitting. NA Publications Committee Report",107
240,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES," Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a most important report to give you. I present the fifth report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-adopted. NA BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed.",107
241,Mr MELHAM,PROCEEDS OF CRIME AMENDMENT,"I will be moving at the consideration in detail stage an amendment, which has been circulated, in relation to schedule 1, page 3, line 30 to page 4 line 11, omit item 6. It is with great disappointment that I turn to the second aspect of the bill before this House. Item 6 of schedule 1 of the bill repeals section 34D of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 and inserts a new provision. The purpose of this amendment to the act, the purpose of this new provision, is to allow the government to transfer funds distributable from the confiscated asset fund to consolidated revenue. Our amendment will maintain the status quo. At present, funds seized under the Procee-s of Crime Act are paid into a trust fund until such time as any legal proceedings in relation to those funds are determined. Where the Commonwealth is successful in proving that those funds or assets are the proceeds of crime, the funds become distributable for the purposes of the act. Since the establishment of the trust fund, $29.8 million has been paid in: $26.4 million as a result of funds seized pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, a further $3.3 million pursuant to the Customs Act 1901, and $22,000 pursuant to section 9 of the Crimes Act 1914. As at 31 July this year, the trust fund had a total of $7.25 million credited to it, of which $5.9 million was available for distribution. Under the present legislation, available funds are distributed once per year by the Attorney-General for two purposes. Fifty per cent of the funds are available for the funding of special law enforcement projects. In the 1995 funding round, $5.4 million was paid out of the trust fund to 10 law enforcement projects. These projects included $450,000 to enhance the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's fraud detection system; $290,000 to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs movement alert system, a system designed to detect and monitor the attempted movements of undesirables to Australia; and $1.8 million to the National Crime Authority to assist with its telecommunications intercept capabilities. Other recipients included the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Institute of Criminology. In the 1994 funding round, a further $5.2 million was distributed to 20 law enforcement projects in sums ranging from $54,500 to $675,000. Recipients included the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Taxation Office. Collectively, these measures have provided an invaluable boost to Australia's law enforcement capabilities. The other 50 per cent of the funds are available for drug education and rehabilitation projects. Since 1992-93, the Department of Health and Family Services has received a net total of $7.638 million from the trust fund, $11.86 million gross. These moneys have been used to support additional projects under the national drug strategy. Activities funded during that period include the second phase of the 'Speed catches up with you' public education and awareness campaIgn; a campaign designed to promote awareness about the effect of amphetamines; an annual conference held in Sydney in June 1994 on the principles of developing and implementing a balanced national drug strategy to address the problems of drug abuse; the production of a general resource document on the health effects of cannabis and a time series analysis of the patterns of use, and community attitudes towards the use, of cannabis; a technical study of the toxic effects of MDMA, otherwise known as ecstasy; and the national initiatives in drug education program. This consisted of two phases-the ongoing comprehensive training of teachers to develop skills and knowledge in relation to drug education and, subsequently, the extension of this education to parents and to industry and community groups. The trust fund has also been used in the past to supplement the budget of the national drug strategy when funds were otherwise unavailable. In two years the base funding of the strategy was supplemented by $2 million advances against future allocations from the trust fund. The use of these advances explains the $4 million differential between the net and gross figures I provided previously for allocations from the trust fund. Once again, all of these programs have been very valuable in increasing our awareness of the impact of drugs on our community and providing us with some of the resources we need to tackle these difficult and complex issues. So what is wrong with these funds being transferred to consolidated revenue rather than directly to these projects? No doubt the government will say that the mere transfer of the funds available under the trust fund to consolidated revenue will not stop funds being available for these purposes, but the budget makes a lie of those assertions. Across the board this government has cut the budget of our law enforcement agencies. The Australian Federal Police will have its budget cut by $26.5 million over the next two years. The Australian Customs Service will be cut by $73 million over four years. We heard in question time today the great service they are doing. Their funds should be increased, not cut. Cuts already announced to the Australian Customs Service have resulted in the loss of adequate border protection in many major regional centres and the virtual conversion of the Australian Customs Service to a nine to five operation. If only criminals worked office hours! The National Crime Authority, Australia's premier law enforcement agency in the fight against organised crime, will have its budget cut by $11.3 million over the next three years-almost 20 per cent of its budget. That is a cut which the Chairman of the National Crime Authority, Mr John Broome, has already admitted will-far from making the NCA more efficient, as claimed in the government's election commitments-reduce the authority's investigative capacity. This will be particularly noticeable in South Australia and Western Australia. Staff at the authority's Adelaide office are being reduced from 33 to only 10. In Perth staff numbers will be cut from 27 to 15. I must say, in fairness to other officers of the NCA who have been affected by these cuts, that a further 20 staff have lost their jobs in Melbourne, 12 in Sydney and three in Brisbane. However, the relative impact of these cuts has been most noticeable in the Adelaide and Perth offices. These cuts will effectively remove the ability of the NCA to conduct ongoing on the ground operations in South Australia and the West. As any good police officer will tell you, unless you have your police on the ground and familiar with local conditions it is almost impossible to do your job properly. Mr Bob Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I think the member for Banks is drifting far away from the intention of the bill by going into secondary areas in his assumptions of the budget and the cutbacks in areas of Customs and police.",107
242,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROCEEDS OF CRIME AMENDMENT,"I thank the honourable member for Paterson, but there is no point of order.",109
243,Mr MELHAM,PROCEEDS OF CRIME AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. This government's abandonment of South Australia and Western Australia is reminiscent of the rightly maligned defence policy known as the Brisbane Line where the government only committed itself to defending Australia south of Brisbane. In the war against drugs and organised crime such a policy should not be allowed to rear its ugly head. All Australians are deserving of protection from the evils of drug importation and organised crime. No Australian or group of Australians should have to fend for themselves, particularly when those Australians are often at the forefront of that war. All Australians should be concerned that this government is giving the drug barons and crime lords the green light in South Australia and the West. What I am saying today is that there is cross-party support for this. This can be justified. That is why we support the bill, but we are moving this particular amendment in relation to this. I do not believe that the community would worry about money going into consolidated revenue if it can be properly accounted for. That is the point I am trying to make in relation to this debate. That is why we have moved this particular amendment. The position is that the government has also cut $0.5 million, over 15 per cent, from the budget of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board. One has to wonder how this body will continue to effectively assist federal and state law enforcement bodies coordinate their activities after a cut of this magnitude. The money could be used for these aspects of policing. The CLEB not only performs these routine functions but in the last year has had added to its responsibilities the coordination of the new uniform national gun laws, the national paedophile register and the National Missing Persons Bureau. Finally, the government has cut $160,000 a year from research on the criminal justice response to violence against women. This funding was announced under the previous Labor government's Justice Statement. Despite all its posturing before the election about the need to protect women from domestic violence, this government has turned around and cut funding to a program that would help us all to understand-so as to fix one of the principal reasons why too many women choose not to report domestic violence-the criminal justice system, the very system that is supposed to protect women in the first place. In total, the federal budget has seen nearly $120 million taken out of Australia's fight against crime. So much for giving our law enforcement officials the resources they need. But I do wish to give the government credit where credit is due. The only new spending proposal in the law and order field is the government's establishment of the national campaign against violence and crime. The additional $3 million to be allocated over the next three years is a welcome addition to the $1 million per year announced in the Justice Statement for the safer Australia program. However, it is disappointing that this is less than the $5 million per year promised to the Australian people by the coalition in its law and justice policy. Safer Australia represented an innovative entry by the Commonwealth into the funding of community based safety projects. Headed by an independent board shared by two outstanding Australians, Ruth Cracknell and Margaret Whitlam, the board made recommendations to the federal government for the funding of 21 community based safety projects. These included the 'safe as houses' project proposed by the Cairns City Council, which aimed to reduce the level of home burglaries; the Council of the Ageing's video in five languages outlining some of the causes of fear for older people about burglary and home assault; Phantast's anti-graffiti project in south-east Queensland; and the Victorian Council of Churches projects to reduce crime in public spaces by finding alternative activities for young people in their community education campaign aimed at educating nonEnglish speaking background communities on the dangers of carrying weapons and knives. The money could be given to these programs rather than going into consolidated revenue. I think that is something that the whole of the Australian community would endorse and support. It is not a political This crosses party barriers. That is why we are going to move this amendment to the government's bill. We believe that a few more riders should be added to allow funding to go to these programs. It should not be put into consolidated revenue. That is the point that I was making earlier in relation to our amendment and is why I outlined those programs. They are worthwhile initiatives that should be continued. They do not have to suffer budget cuts. Instead of this money going into consolidated revenue, it should go across the board into these programs. It is making the criminals pay. It is one way of sending the message that, if we catch the proceeds from a person's crime, this is a direct way in which the money can go back. It is going back in a positive fashion to clean up the mess that that crime has caused rather than going into consolidated revenue. That is what our amendment is all about. The previous Labor government gave a commitment during the election campaign that, if it was returned, it would fund these projects. Regrettably for these community groups we were not returned. So we are saying that the government should not put this money into consolidated revenue. Instead, it should send it across to these projects. The current government froze funding for the safer Australia program, despite promising to meet all funding commitments made by the previous government in the 1995 financial year. As a result, none of these valuable and innovative projects has received a cent. Given that the national campaign against violence and crime is yet to be launched, a matter which I trust will be rectified early in the new year, they have had no means to obtain Commonwealth funding since that time. It saddens me to say that the government's treatment of these community groups has been wasteful of their time and contemptuous of their commitment. I urge the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to establish the national campaign against violence and crime as soon as possible. I also urge him to give special consideration to these 21 most deserving projects that have issue. been waiting so long for the funding they deserve. What can we conclude about this government's law and order budget? Whilst no-one would suggest that this government actively supports organised crime, its inaction, its negligence and its lack of commitment mark it out as a government that does not have the fortitude for the fight. In the realm of law and order the budget represents a litany of lies and broken promises. The Attorney-General and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have betrayed the Australian people. In doing so, they have put ordinary Australians in the firing line. Their record is not any better when it comes to drug education and rehabilitation. The primary role of these programs is not just to reform drug users, thereby improving the quality of their lives. Both education and rehabilitation are a critical means of making our homes, our streets and our workplaces safer for all Australians-safer from the misery and destruction that drugs cause in our society. That is what some of the money could be used for rather than having it go into consolidated revenue. These are sound and proven programs that reduce the likelihood of crimes, and not just drug related crimes, from being committed in the future. The drug culture of Australia is surrounded by the commission of property offences and violent crime. A large proportion of home invasions in this country are carried out by drug users seeking cash or readily saleable goods, such as VCRs and televisions, to fund their drug habit. We all too regularly read in our papers of drug related killings, to mention the often high level of non-lethal violence that permeates drug culture. Prostitution, youth homelessness and abuse are all too often connected with the prevalence of drugs in our society. Prevention is better than cure. The money should be going to prevention; it should not be going into consolidated revenue. This government's withdrawal of funding which either stops young Australians entering this unsavoury world or which helps drug users kick the habit will only see this blight on our society spread. Every Australian will pay for this lack of foresight in higher insurance premiums on their homes or in the ruined lives of their children or their friends. This aspect of the bill is ill-conceived and short-sighted. In this government's desperate dash for cash, it has lost sight of the reasons why we are elected to government: to make Australia a safer and happier place for us all. This bill will save the government a miserly $12.83 million over four years, even if one makes the assumption, which I do not believe can be made, that all the moneys currently held in the trust fund will ultimately be distributable. Yet these funds provide much needed additional assistance to our law enforcement agencies and help those otherwise tempted by drugs to say no. As I said earlier, at the considertion in detail stage I will move the amendment that I have circulated. However, regardless of the vote on the amendment, I wish to note that the opposition will support the bill. If we do fail, I urge the government to reconsider its decision not to effectively use the moneys that will be paid into consolidated revenue for law enforcement, drug rehabilitation and education purposes. No matter how misguided this government's policy on the use of the moneys available from the confiscated assets trust fund may be, the facilitation of cooperation between Australian and international law enforcement agencies to track down those proceeds must be our priority. Without our commitment to that cause, no funds will be made available through the trust fund at all. More importantly, we would be failing to send international criminals a signal not of our resolve, and we would be failing to give our law enforcement agencies the assistance that they need to get on with the job.

244,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being nearly 5.30 p.m., I propose the question that the House do now adjourn. O'Donoghue, Ms Lois",111
245,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding Australian who is retiring as Chairperson of ATSIC tomorrow, and that is Dr Lois O'Donoghue CBE, AM. Lois O'Donoghue has given outstanding service to the Australian community, and I think it is appropriate that she is recognised by the parliament today. Lowitja is her Aboriginal name. She was born at Indulkana in central South Australia and is a member of the Yankunytjatjara people of north-west South Australia. Dr O'Donoghue was the inaugural full-time Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission from its inception in 1990 until her retirement on 6 December, 1996. Dr O'Donoghue received the Order of Australia award in 1977, was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1983 and in 1984 was honoured as Australian of the Year in recognition of her outstanding contribution to the welfare of Aboriginal people. In 1993 Dr O'Donoghue was a leading member of the Aboriginal negotiating team which negotiated with the federal government the agreement which provided the basis for the Native Title Act. Lois O'Donoghue has received honorary doctorate awards from the Murdoch University in Western Australia, the universities of Flinders and Adelaide in South Australia, the Australian National University in Canberra and the Queensland University of Technology. She is also a Honorary Fellow of the Australian Royal College of Nursing. She has outstanding professional qualifications: she has professional qualifications as a trained nurse and a mental health nurse. She was also a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. I first met Lois O'Donoghue in 1993 during the discussions surrounding the Native Title Act. She is an outstanding individual. With her bubbly personality, she has guided ATSIC through its inception, through tortuous years, through the harrowing period of a change of government-but she has done it with dignity, with honour and with a genuineness that I think reaches out to all Australians. She is a truly wonderful person. I am honoured and privileged to have been associated with her, to be able to call her a friend. Her public service will not cease; she will continue to give outstanding public service. I am sure that even the new government, the new minister, has an excellent relationship with her. It is not easy to hold the position that she has held. If you think it is hard politics in this chamber in mainstream Australia, there are no tougher politics than indigenous politics in this country. Not only do you have to contend with politics in the broad community, you have to contend with them within your own community-and Lois has handled herself with distinction. She is a truly outstanding advocate for her people. I know that the sentiments which I am expressing are shared across the political spectrum, across the political divide. I think it right that she do move on. It is time for a changing of the guard. And it is time that we recognise there should be no divides. There is a new dawn, and she will be part of it. The very manner in which she has handled the transition of government has guaranteed the survival of ATSIC. She was moderate throughout the last couple of months, and I think she has made a number of moving speeches. Lois O'Donoghue is someone special. She enriches this country. She enriches all of us. She enriches her people. She is not a bitter person. She has been subjected to some terrible things over the years-and yet she carries herself with distinction and without malice, without ill-feeling. That is the sort of message we want to continue in terms of reconciliation: an equal partnership, walking hand in hand with each other. We have our differences of opinion. We need to respect those differences-not, in effect, to highlight them. That is what enriches us. Lois O'Donoghue was, and still is, an outstanding spokesperson for her people. (Time expired) Native Title",111
246,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise a matter of grave concern that has been reported to me by a local government authority in my electorate. Yesterday this local government authority, the Belmont City Council, had 66 claims of native title placed over its parks",112
247,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,How many?,112
248,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"Sixty-six-over its drainage reserves, over its river reserve and over its road reserves. The very concerning thing is that these 66 reserves are reserves, for example, like a regional park such as Garvey Park. I see the honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) in the chamber. He would know, for example, Hardey Park, which was bequeathed to the city of Belmont by the Hardey family in, I believe, about 1908 and then vested as a crown reserve in the city of Belmont. This has had a native title claim placed over it. It also makes me wonder about motive, when part of one of these claims is the war memorial in Faulkner Park; a claim has been placed over this particular icon in the city of Belmont. The other great concern is that a part of the grounds of the local Belmont Steelers Rugby Club has been listed as part of this native title claim-this wide-ranging claim.",112
249,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,Why only part?,113
250,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"Because a drainage reserve runs through part of the oval. My concern about this is: what is the motivation? What can you do with a drainage reserve that is five metres wide, or whatever it is, which is already developed? Are you ever going to build anything there? Are you ever going to do anything meaningful with it? And a road reserve-it does not have title as such. What do they intend to do on a reserve like this? I have some sort of cynicism that this be a claim more for what can be got out of it rather than any recognition. I think there is some sort of curious grab for land being made for which they want to be compensated. I do not often quote Wilson Tuckey, but Wilson says that the price of absolution is 30 pieces of silver-so, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will leave the inference to you. The very concerning part about all of this is: where do we go from here? Is this a strategy whereby these people are combing all the parks and reserves of all the local government authorities? Is the Canning council next? Is the Victoria Park town council next? Is the South Perth city council next? Are they going to identify every park and reserve in that city and try to lay an ambit claim over them? Already within the city of Belmont, there are two overlapping claims on the airport. Currently, those claims are in the Federal Court under a directional hearing. At the moment this hearing gives some possible uncertainty to the privatisation of the Perth airport. I am very disappointed that these things take so long to determine. The Belmont City Council are very concerned because they now have to employ, at ratepayers' expense, a large number of staff to help with the determination of these claims. They then have to engage legal advice. As we know, these claims take some time to determine. This could go on for years. Two years is possibly the shortest period that these claims will go for before there is any direction about them. The only successful claims so far have been the original claim in the Murray Island, the Mabo case itself, and the one small claim in New South Wales. With all the hundreds of claims out there, these are the only ones that have had some determination made about them. I am relaxed about native title; the whole concept of native title is good. But at the moment it is an unworkable mess and it is only the legal fraternity who are getting much out of it. The genuine Aboriginals who are seeking some determination over the land which they can rightfully claim have gotten nothing. This flawed legislation brought in during the previous parliament under the Labor Party brings nothing but hostility to a might community when something like this happens-66 claims over parks and reserves within the city of Belmont. These people are not getting the cash. I hope, when the amendments finally go to the Senate, that the Greens and Democrats wake up to themselves and try to help-(Time expired) National Capital",113
251,Ms ELLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Much has been said over the months and very recently about the role of Canberra as the national capital. When I read the comments of former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser in the Australian newspaper yesterday, I thought, 'Enough is enough.' The people of Canberra, the businesses attempting to invest in Canberra and the families investing their future in Canberra just do not deserve this; neither does anyone who historically had anything to do with the establishment and development of Canberra as the national capital. Heaven forbid, foremost on that list is the late Sir Robert Menzies, who put so much of himself and his faith into the national capital and the reasons for its existence. Many people around the country happen to agree with the sentiments of Menzies and I would like briefly to refer to the report of the National Capital Authority entitled Impressions of Australia. There are a couple of very good quotes that I would like to share with the House. One states: My view is that the single biggest imperative for the planning of Canberra is to tum it into a society where we can be proud because it is sustainable. That came from a gentleman participating in the Brisbane workshop that was behind that report. Another general comment states: Indeed, quantitative research conducted in 1992 found that 82 per cent of respondents considered it was important for Australians to feel proud of national capital. One more very brief quote from a Perth participant in the process states: I'm proud of Canberra. I enjoy Canberra. As an Australian, I expect the best and a lot of Canberra does deliver that. But what in fact do we have now? A Prime Minister who refuses to live in the Lodge, and I wonder-in fact, I despair-at the precedent that that sets. Does it mean that when we have future prime ministers living in, say, Perth, or Darwin, or Brisbane, or Hobart, or Melbourne they should do the same as the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard)? We also have an ex-Liberal Prime Minister who bags the ACT mercilessly and quite stupidly in the national press. I wonder why? According to Mr Fraser, we have four main groups living in Canberra: the military, politicians, public servants and journalists. He says that he is appalled at the steady and continuing growth of Canberra. Well, Mr Speaker, he can rest easy. Canberra, as a community of Australia and as the national capital in which Menzies and others so much believed, is being so severely affected by this non-resident Prime Minister and his lot that we may well end up with just journalists, politicians, public servants and military personnel-and that will be if we are lucky. The Prime Minister promised that no more than 2,500 Public Service jobs would go. That promise was made in the election campaignobviously a non-core promise. It was announced in the budget that 10,500 Public Service positions alone were to go, and they were on top of the 10,000 or so already gone since the election. I recall clearly the words of the current Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) during the campaign. He said, 'We will cut Canberra off at the knees.' How true those words are today. There is a business community in the ACT which is local, believes in the national capital and has backed that belief over the years with investment and growth. They have lived and invested here honestly. What this community wants is honesty from the politicians. If the Prime Minister has decided to relocate the national capital to their Sydney, or maybe share it between Sydney or Melbourne or whatever else is his design, let him tell the Australian community and let him explain why future Clinton-type visits may have to be between several places so as to see what we might call the national capital. As far as the ACT Chief Minister and her government are concerned, feigning disagreement with this federal conservative government is just not good enough. Her policies are the same. With an ACT election just over 12 months away, it is easy to guess what her motives could be. The effect of all this political posturing is the continuing decline of our local growth, our local economy and our local confidence. Many are doing everything they can to steer Canberra through this difficult time. This community happens to believe in the national capital, in the place where they live. I know Canberra will survive because of this community's determination. The hardship for the families, the broken small businesses and the redundant public servants will not forget this ongoing Canberra bashing. The Howard and Carnell governments stand condemned. Fisher Essay Competition",113
252,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Over the last couple of days we have had the privilege of hosting in Canberra two fine young Australians who were the winners for 1996 of the Fisher electorate essay competition. They are Cassie Dee Hughes of year 5 from the Mt KiIcoy State School and Fiona Hardy, a year 10 student from the Yarraman P-lO State School. Both students delivered essay entries on the topic 'The Australia. I would like to see in the year 2000'. I would like to read into the Hansard these two entries as points of view which honourable members 'Nould no doubt like to consider. Firstly, the essay by Cassie Dee Hughes states: I believe that if the few things I've written in this essay were to be realised, our country would be a healthier and fairer place to live. Cities today are very busy. Traffic is increasing and so is pollution. People are getting more jobs and more buildings are being built. People are driving cars to work releasing poisonous smoke into the atmosphere. The increased use of public transport such as buses and trains would alleviate some of our pollution related problems. Education is another thing I would like to talk about. I think that the University fees are much too high and this is not fair on low income earners. Schools should get more assistance because teachers are overworked and too tired to have fun with their families. A percentage of families today are either poor or unhappy. This causes the children to run away and a lot could happen such as rape and becoming involved with drugs. I believe that if families are closely bonded that children will have less difficulties as they grow up. Aboriginals are no different to us and I think it is cruel the way we treat them for I say we should be able to work, rest and play together. Australian homes are getting very expensive and some people in our country can not afford them so they are forced to live in the street. Shelter is a basic need for everyone so that they can feel safe and happy. Our country would be a healthier and fairer place to live in if there was less pollution, improved education, happier families, less racism and more affordable housing. Now the essay by Fiona Hardy: It is commendable to say that unemployment should be non-existent by the year 2000 and other such statements; but in truth the year 2000 is but four years away and any solution between now and then would be a quick fix and more than likely cause more problems in the long run. It is therefore, more practical to 'nip these problems in the bud', and attempt to solve these dilemmas before they start. Children should be given more incentives to learn. Ausstudy was introduced to give such incentives and allowed access to higher education for all as was the HECC Scheme. The allowance is not enough to sustain an interest in studying and therefore it should be increased as to prevent the future problems of unemployment. This would aid in the nurturing of the intellectual ability of young Australians. ***** I endeavour to present Australia as a non-discriminatory country, as do most of the Australian population. It is becoming increasingly harder to do so. The current number of immigrants is believed to be excessive. The Regulations regarding Australian immigration are far too lenient and should be tightened to prevent people from rorting the system. As for the numbers of immigrants allowed into this island nation; these numbers are far too large for both our resources and our economy to cope. If immigration is not reduced we shall suffer from severe overpopulation. By the year 2000 immigrant intake should be sliced to an acceptable level. With overpopulation comes pollution. A problem that should be overcome by the human race as quickly as possible. It goes without saying that Australia is relatively lucky in this respect. We have clean air, reasonable water supplies and a peaceful atmosphere. We should strive to conserve such beauty. Although our laws regarding conservation of the environment are strict, they could perhaps be tightened or more rigidly enforced to preserve our unique surrQundings. Artificial features should be kept to a minimum if dealing with imported ideas and/or species, e.g. Euro-Disney. ***** The new gun laws should be up and running by the year 2000. Although some amendments have to be made, as is the case with every new legislation. I believe the gun laws at present are now too lenient. No exceptions to the legislation should be made, no matter who it may inconvenience. The gun lobby is an extremist minority group that should be ignored at all costs. If necessary a referendum should be held as to determine that these proposed gun laws would be adequate for the country's population. In short, Australia is a fair and fine country with very few problems within society. The only outstanding problem I foresee is the current rate with which our population is growing. The ideal Monarchist, Democratic Australia would be one with little unemployment, tight restrictions regarding guns and the environment and an intellectually advanced population. These two fine young people are wonderful representatives of their age groups. I congratulate them on winning their essay competitions. I know they had a wonderful time meeting you, Mr Speaker, travelling around Parliament House and looking at the sights of Canberra. I also thank Mrs Judy MCArdle, from my office, who chaperoned them while in Canberra. Featherdale Wildlife Park",114
253,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"On Friday, I November at the 1996 Australian Tourism Awards in Perth, Featherdale Wildlife Park was awarded Australia's most prestigious tourism award in the category of significant tourist attraction. Situated only 40 minutes west of Sydney in the electorate of Greenway, en route to the beautiful Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park is home to Australia's largest collection of native animals. There are over 2,500, all of which are exhibited in a magnificent natural bushland environment. Visitors to Featherdale enjoy numerous activities, including being photographed cuddling lovable koalas and handfeeding friendly kangaroos or inquisitive emus. The significant tourist attraction award highlights Featherdale's outstanding achievement in the Australian tourism industry. Over the past 12 months, Featherdale has received a record number of visitors, initiated by the development of a number of new and exciting visitor facilities and a continuation of the park's active role in conservation and preservation of rare and endangered wildlife, including being the last known home of Fatso the wombat, star of A Country Practice. Featherdale also provides significant value-added employment for local professionals, including my dentist, who was called in on one occasion to carry out some dental work on a chimpanzee resident of the park. On a visit to Darwin I also had a personal experience of the Australia-wide reputation of Featherdale. At the Northern Territory Wildlife Park, visitors are treated to a display by a number of eagles. The eagles are let loose by their trainers and then fly into surrounding trees. The eagles are then attracted back to their trainers, who wave a piece of fish or meat around. One of the eagles used in this display is a white-breasted sea-eagle which was bred at Featherdale and was the first such eagle raised in captivity. Featherdale has over 200 species of native birds, which are featured in aviaries landscaped with trees and plants from the Jabiru and Kakadu regions of Australia. Featherdale was established on seven acres of land originally purchased by Charles and Marjorie Wiggs in 1953. Featherdale has evolved from a poultry farm into one of the best privately owned wildlife parks in Australia. With the vision and encouragement of the Wiggs's son-in-law, Bruce Kubbere, who had studied Australian fauna since his childhood, Featherdale opened to the public as a wildlife park in 1972. In the earlier years, Bruce and his wife Margaret operated a plant nursery in conjunction with the wildlife park. Beautiful Australian native trees and plants now line the walkways and landscape the enclosures as a legacy of the park's history. A campaign to save Featherdale from housing commission resumption was formed in 1975. The then Premier of New South Wales, Sir Robert Askin, was presented with thousands of signed petitions. Most of the petitions were signed by local residents, who stressed the importance of Featherdale Wildlife Park to the district's school children. Fortunately, the government rescinded its original decision and the park was saved. Featherdale has developed into one of Australia's finest tourist attractions, and has played an integral part in the growth of tourism in the district of Blacktown in Sydney as well as the whole of New South Wales. The Blacktown local government area now boasts a number of significant man-made attractions in addition to Featherdale Wildlife Park. We also have the Parklea Markets, Eastern Creek Raceway, Australia's Wonderland and outback wool sheds, plus attractions such as Nurragingy Reserve and Prospect Reservoir. These attractions make this part of western Sydney an interesting place to spend some time, see our outstanding tourist attractions and meet many friendly people. I understand that the ownership of Featherdale will soon change hands. I congratulate the Wigg and Kubbere families for a job well done in their contribution to wildlife in western Sydney. I wish both families all the best for the future and hope the new owners of Featherdale will maintain the high standard already set by these two great pioneering families. Port Macquarie By-election",116
254,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening in the adjournment debate I want to bring to the attention of the House the results of a fairly important by-election that was held in New South Wales last Saturday-the by-election for the state seat of Port Macquarie. For the information of members, the successful candidate in that by-election was the National Party's Robert Oakeshott, whom some members of this staff, particularly staff of this place, would know quite well. Robert worked here for the last three years in my otfice as a media research officer and, latterly, he worked in the government members' secretariat. The more interesting thing to note, particularly following the outcome of the by-election on Saturday, is some of the comments that have been made by some of the senior Labor politicians in New South Wales about the swings-who they went to and who they went against. In the field that stood for the by-election in Port Macquarie, there was no Labor candidate. The Premier of New South Wales decided that Port Macquarie was not a good enough seat for Labor to inject any funds into a campaign and stand a candidate. They did not think they could win, notwithstanding that they crowed about the fact that in 1995 at the March' general election they received 38 per cent of the vote. Subsequent to that, the sitting National Party member resigned and the Premier called a by-election that took about three months to contest. It was a fairly lengthy period and a long campaign, yet there was no sign of any Labor candidate. Some of the other votes that were achieved in the election were quite interesting as well. I go back to the comments that were made by one of the Labor Party senior ministers in New South Wales who talked about a swing against the National Party in the seat of Port Macquarie. But what he failed to realise was that there were a number of Independent candidates. One of those Independent candidates was a former high profile Liberal Party member who actually stood against me in the federal election in 1993, one John Barrett. John Barrett managed to achieve 32 per cent of the vote. Our candidate, the ultimate winner, the National Party's Robert Oakeshott, achieved 46.8 per cent of the vote. According to my arithmetic, that is almost 79 per cent of the vote. If we did not have Greens, the Shooters Party and AAFI, it would have left only 21 per cent for the Labor Party to win if they had stood a candidate. But they were too gutless and they wimped out because they knew what the result would be. They ""Saw what happened in the federal by-election in Lindsay and decided that they would not embarrass themselves and stand a candidate. With 900 votes still to count yesterday, the National Party's Robert Oakeshott got 46.8 per cent of the vote, the conservative Independent, Barrett, got 32 per cent of the vote and the Shooters Party got 6.9 per cent of the vote-and this is the first real outing for the Shooters Party this year, apart from the Lindsay by-election. I cannot recall what result they got there, but I do not think they achieved that much. The Shooters Party actually brought workers and campaigners in from all over New South Wales. This was the big test for Mr Tingle's party, and it achieved nothing-6.9 per cent of the vote. AAFI brought a candidate up from Sydney, put a bit of money into a campaign, ran a fairly high profile campaign in the last month leading up to the poll last Saturday and achieved 6.2 per cent of the vote. Of course, the Greens, like the Democrats, in these byelections have collapsed. They achieved only 5.2 per cent of the vote. I just wanted to highlight to the House the lack of faith that the Labor Party have in their support and their branches in regional New South Wales where they are not prepared to stand a candidate, they are not prepared to put any money into a campaign and they certainly did not do it in the by-election in the state seat of Port Macquarie. More than that, after achieving 38 per cent of the vote in the general election in March 1995, it seems that there was probably only 21 per cent of the vote available for them to win in this by-election if they had bothered to stand a candidate, if Bob Carr had not wimped out and had been prepared to stand a candidate and represent the policies that he has been implementing in New South Wales since being elected in March 1995. But he was not prepared to do that. He was not prepared to test his hand. He was not prepared to cop a message from people in regional New South Wales, who are sick to death of the policies of the Carr Labor government. Along with other members of this place, particularly from our side of this House, I congratulate Robert Oakeshott on his win last Saturday. New South Wales By-elections Australian Capital Territory",117
255,Mr MCMULLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Canberra) (5.58 p.m.)I rise to speak on a matter to do with my electorate here in the ACT and to support the remarks of the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis). But before I do, I need to comment on the enthusiasm with which the last speaker, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), referred to regional by-elections in New South Wales. He seems to have forgotten the by-election in Clarence and the by-election in Orange, which were substantial vindications and which won substantial support for and swings to the Labor government and Mr Carr. I want to take the very brief time available to me to support the remarks made by my colleague the member for Namadgi about the continuing damage being done to the economy of the ACT by this government. Since there has been some speculation about the possibility of a by-election, the rhetoric has changed but the substance is unchanged. With an impending ACT election, we see the Chief Minister seeking to pretend that she is in some way distanced from and different in her attitudes from the federal Liberal government. But she does not trumpet the fact that, when decisions are made and submissions are made by this government which are profoundly antagonistic to every worker in the ACT, namely, the submission to the living wage case, she is a signatory to that agreement and that her government supports the Howard government's submission, which says that nobody on a paid rates award, which covers almost every worker in the ACT, should get any wage rise at all. I think all the working people in the ACT will want to give serious consideration to the implications of that message, as the people of Fraser will want to give serious consideration to the implications of that in the forthcoming by-election. More broadly, I am concerned that the recent trend of events has led, for the first time since John Howard was last responsible for the national economy, to unemployment in the ACT being higher than the national average.",118

Main Committee adjourned at 1.11 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: (Question No. 460) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 25 June 1996: For each Job Club project conducted in the Minister's Department's Melbourne East area what was the (a) total funding provided, (b) total number of commencements, (c) unit cost and (d) total number of outcomes (i) in 1990-91, (ii) in 1991-92, (iii) in 1992-93, (iv) in 1993-94 (v) in 1994-95 and (vi) between 1 July 1995 and 25 June 1996. Dr Kemp-The minister has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The geographical area covered by the Department's Area Melbourne East has changed three times since 1 July 1990. The current Regional Office configuration has, however, been in place since 1992-93 and reliable data can only be provided from that financial year onwards. The attached table describes Area Melbourne East Job Clubs contracts, by the financial year in which they were signed. Against each contract is NA Provider Contracted in 1992-93 Peopleworks Association Inc Skillseekers Australian Chamber of Commerce Skill seekers Outer Eastern College of T AFE J Ford & Associates Brotherhood of St Laurence Richmond Employment Box Hill Job Club Lalor Job Club Total Contracted in 1993-94 NA Job Club the total level of funding received, the total number of commencements registered and the consequent unit cost. Up until the end of 1994, Job Club contracts were awarded on a calendar year rather than a financial year basis. Accordingly, Job Clubs are listed by the financial year in which they were contracted. However, a proportion (which cannot be quantified) of the contracts' expenditure and commencements contracted in one year may actually take place in the following financial year. The ""total outcomes"" data provided are those known as positive outcomes, i.e. those former Job Club participants who found employment or chose to undertake non-Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs funded education or training, and which were identified through the Department's Post Program Monitoring (PPM) survey. Not all former LMP participants return their PPM survey forms and, therefore, any outcome figures quoted will not relate strictly to all former clients who have participated in an LMP. The percentage of Job Club positive outcomes in the attached tables can only be reliably stated at Area level because the proportion of known client outcomes at the provider level is often too low to be statistically robust.

(2) What plans does the Government have for the introduction of tax indexation. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is no estimate of fiscal drag in the Budget Statements, 1996-97. However, as inflation is low, and expected to remain low, fiscal drag for 1996-97 and the forward estimates period would have a much lower impact than was the case when inflation was relatively high under the previous government. (2) The Government has no plans for the introduction of tax indexation. Public Sector Borrowing (Question No. 634) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 9 September 1996: (1) Has the net public sector borrowing requirement shown any trend increase since 1976. . (2) Has net public debt shown any trend increase SInce 1976. .(3) Has - he gap between private investment and pnvate savmg in Australia widened since 1976.

(5) How do Australia's public sector deficits and public debt compare to other member nations of the OECD. (6) What evidence is there to support his assertion that Australia has an inter-generational public sector budgetary problem. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The net public sector borrowing requirement has fluctuated significantly over the past two decades, so the trend figures are not meaningful. As the Commonwealth public sector borrowing requirement includes the effect of asset sales and repayment of State debt it has not been a useful indicator of the impact of the public sector on national savings in recent years. (2) There has been a clear trend increase in Commonwealth General Government debt, the component which arises mainly from Commonwealth Budget deficit. This is now the largest component of public sector debt. (3) In the past 30 years private sector net lending (private saving less private investment) has fluctuated widely over the course of the business cycle. As shown in Chart 17 of Statement 2 of 1996-97 Budget Paper No.1, there have been periods of both significant net lending and net borrowing. After allowing for cyclical sensitivities, private investment has remained a fairly constant proportion of GDP. Private saving also remained reasonably steady as a proportion of GDP up to the early 1980s but since then has shown a gradual trend decline. This has been more than accounted for by a decline in household saving, offset partly by an increase in corporate saving, including private financial enterprise saving. (4) No public sector balance data are currently available on an inflation-adjusted, cyclically corrected basis. (5) The OECD Economic Outlook provides data on financial balances and net financial liabilities for the total general government sector for selected OECD member countries. While the OECD does adjust data in an attempt to improve comparability between countries, there remains the need to exercise caution in making cross-country comparisons, as methods of data collection, coverage and classification can differ between countries. In the early 1990s the general government deficit in Australia exceeded the OECD average over a few years. Despite growth in the economy since then, Australia's fiscal position remained in deficit at 2V2 per cent of GDP in 1995. Labor left Australia with the highest current account deficit in the OECD, and this imbalance between national savings and investment must be addressed by boosting national savings. Commonwealth budget deficits in recent years have been a major source of the poor national savings performance. In regard to Australia's levels of gross and net debt, it is the pace at which net debt levels have built up in recent years-particularly in the Commonwealth general government sector-that has required corrective action. A series of large budget deficits over recent years has resulted in Commonwealth general government net debt rising from around 4 per cent of GDP in 1989-90 to over 19 per cent of GDP in 1995-96. Without corrective action Commonwealth general government net debt would remain broadly unchanged as a proportion of GDP, with a high probability of ratcheting up further in the future. (6) The Commonwealth general government sector has generally been in deficit in underlying terms over the past two decades reflecting a generally significant dis saving position. A dissaving position by the Commonwealth general government sector means that it is reducing the level of public sector net worth and therefore potentially disadvantaging future generations.

Hydropower in Laos: Australian Government Involvement (Question No. 954) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 19 November 1996: (I) What is the extent of the Australian Government's involvement, under the UN Development Program (UNDP), in facilitating hydropower expansion in Laos. (2) Are there three Au sAID-funded positions within the Hydropower Project Office of the Laotian Ministry for Industry and Handicraft; if so, what are the job descriptions for the positions. (3) What were the findings of the Au sAID Cost Engineer at the Ministry for Industry and Handicraft. (4) Is the Cost Engineer's report publicly available; if not, is this contrary to AusAID's commitment to openness in its operations. (5) Will the position of Cost Engineer be filled again. (6) What mechanisms exist for personnel to report to AusAID and UNDP. (7) Does AusAID maintain working relationships intersecwith Australian companies operating in Laos, including Transfield and Tasmanian Hydroelectric Commission Enterprises Corporation; if so, what are the details. (8) What is the total cost of the Laotian hydropower project and what is AusAID's contribution. Mr Downer-the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) The Lao government has identified hydropower as its primary resource to provide revenue to develop the country. The Hydropower Project Office (HPO) has the responsibility of assessing commercial proposals to develop hydropower in Laos. Given Laos' status as a ""least developed country"" the HPO lacks education, skills and experience to properly assess the hydropower proposals to ensure that the people of Laos receive a fair return from the utilisation of a major national resource, and that all environmental, social, legal and technical concerns are met. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) approached AusAID and sought Australian participation in an assistance program aimed at upgrading the skills levels of HPO personnel and at establishing a system that will allow hydropower proposals to be properly assessed. Specifically Australian assistance is in two parts. Firstly, AusAID is funding, through UNDP, a full time ""Power Development Adviser"" at the HPO. Secondly, AusAID is directly funding a number of short term advisers and training programs for HPO staff. (2) There is only one full time AusAID funded position at the HPO, the ""Power Development Adviser"". This Long Term Adviser assists the HPO to plan and manage the appropriate development of hydropower in Laos, taking account of all relevant environmental, social, legal and technical factors. The Long Term Adviser has four specific functions: to advise the HPO on the planning of power sector development for Laos; to advise the HPO on the financing options and ownership arrangements for power schemes; to advise the HPO on the further development of individual power schemes; and to identify specific HPO needs for short term specialist assistance and training in legal, financial, and technical fields, and assist in the identification selection of expert sources of this specialist ance and training. AusAID-funded short term advisers include a financial adviser, a costing engineer, an environment adviser and a legal adviser, with assignments of between one and two months. (3) The Cost Engineer's assignment was to develop a common format for the presentation of costing information by the proponents of commercial hydropower schemes, and to establish a computerised data base and train HPO personnel in its use. The assignment was successfully completed. There were no ""findings"" as such. (4) Yes. The report is available. (5) No. The Cost Engineer had a specific assignment which has been completed. (6) The full time Power Development Adviser is contracted to the UNDP and he reports to them. Au sAID receives copies of his reports. The short term advisers provide a report to AusAID on their activities at the completion of their assignments. and Au sAID personnel in Vientiane monitor the project assistand have regular contact with the advisers. (7) AusAID maintains close working relationships with companies implementing Australian aid projects in Laos. This included Transfield Constructions which was contracted, through a tender process, to be the construction manager of a project to build 4 bridges in a remote area in north-eastern Laos.
