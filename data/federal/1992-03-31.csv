1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Leo MCLeay) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA One Nation Package",10
2,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer him to Senator Walsh's comments in the Australian Left Review.,10
3,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,10
4,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,10
5,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Senator Walsh is one of the most perceptive gentlemen ever to have worked in this establishment, and I refer the Prime Minister to his comments about the economic growth forecast in the 'One Nation, One Job' statement. He said: I doubt that it should be taken seriously. But if it is going to be taken seriously, that is a formula for very largely repeating the mistakes of 1989. Can the Prime Minister assure the House that the Government stands by its growth forecasts in the 'One Nation, One Job' statement?",10
6,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have said on a number of occasions that if we cannot make 4 per cent growth a year, the whole lot of us ought to give it away. Mr MCGauran-You will be.",10
7,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland!,10
8,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the Government, the Opposition, the press gallery-the whole show. If we cannot run this place at a speed at which we can have employment growth, not only at least work force growth but beyond work force growth, so that we can bring down unemployment, what hope is there for the place? In fact, in the late 1980s when Australia had demand running at more than twice product growth, when GNE was running at 91h per cent and GDP was running at about 4 per cent, we saw demand spill into imports. We could not produce more than about 4 to 4 1h per cent GDP. I might say that that is after 30 years of coalition government.",10
9,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,10
10,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Look, guys, I can understand your groaning because it is something to groan about. All the economies around us can do 6 to 8 per cent without spilling into imports. But the most we can do is what our capital stock would allow us; that is, to produce 4 per cent before all the demand spills into imports. We have been about trying to lift that productive capacity and rebuild the capital stock through the 1980s, which fell apart from about 1965 until the early 1980s. Apart from the mineral boom, which was investment in mining, in the rest of the economy, and certainly at the elaborate .transformation of product, investment fell to pieces. So we could run the place at about 4 per cent per year, and that was about it. Mr Andrews interjecting",10
11,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Menzies will cease interjecting.,10
12,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not see any problems with a forecast which shows 4 per cent-odd a year. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition actually said the other day that he would adopt the growth forecast and use the money to pay for tax cuts. It did not take him long. The Government's forecasts were out there for a couple of days and he decided he might adopt them and use the proceeds from that growth to spend on further tax cuts for Fightback mark II, which we know is rattling along in some accountant's office somewhere in Sydney and Melbourne. I think the only thing that Senator Walsh has done is bring the Australian Left Review back to life. I thought it had gone out of business-no offence intended to my colleagues on the Left, no offence at all. I thought it had actually faded away quietly, that it had quietly gone out of business, but Walshie has brought it back to life. It is an ill wind that blows no good, I suppose, from that perspective. Manufacturing Industry  follows the answer given by the Prime Minister. I ask the Treasurer: what information is he able to provide on the state of Australia's manufacturing industry in 1983? What changes have occurred since?",10
13,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Shortland for his question. I am delighted to be able to respond because what has happened to manufacturing industry in the last 10 years is little short of spectacular.,11
14,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,11
15,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,11
16,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point is that we have been assiduously engaged in a trade liberalisation strategy which is about not only ensuring that manufacturing industry in Australia has the capacity to compete on the Australian market, but also that it has an export orientation, an interest and an incentive to export and earn export dollars, export income, for Australia. This is a highly respectable strategy for us to be adopting. It is a strategy which has been urged not only upon us but also upon others interested in trade liberalisation by the World Bank. It is one which not only involves a restructuring of industry assistance, such as tariffs and quotas, but also involves providing support more directly for exporters. In the Prime Minister's most recent statement we provided some additional resources for Austrade; some additional resources for the development import finance facility to allow for the export particularly of capital equipment; extra support for the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation; and increased support for the export access scheme. That is on top of the ongoing support w-ich is provided through the export market development grants scheme which, in its own way, has been very helpful to exporters as they promote their exports and as they develop their export opportunities. The honourable member for Shortland asked me what has happened in the last 10 years. I think it is interesting to compare what has happened in the last five years with what happened in the five years leading up to the assumption of government by the Australian Labor Party. We find that in the last five years of the former Government manufactured exports were growing at just 4.2 per cent per year, whereas in the last five years they have grown to 7.2 per cent-almost a doubling of manufactured exports as a result of the success of our policies. Again, if we look at the area of sophisticated manufactured exports we find that under the old regime, that tired old regime which scrounged its way through the 1970s and into the early 1980s, export growth was 5112 per cent, whereas under us in the last five years it has been growing at 15 per centthree times as much as the annual growth of exports of sophisticated manufactured goods. This is an important change, and it is one which will continue in the future so long as there is the kind of appropriate support and the appropriate supportive policies that are necessary to continue that change. The Opposition, of course, pretends to be interested in manufacturing industry as it rips to zero every tariff and every other support mechanism in sight. Not only that, it is intent on ripping to bits those programs which also support our exporters more directly. The Opposition says that micro-economic· change will make all the difference. In the two pages of the 800 devoted to microeconomic change, the Opposition holds out the prospect that here is the answer for Australian exporters, particularly manufacturing exporters. The honourable member for Barker may have got it right when he said-I quote from the Hansard: By 'micro-economic refonn', what the Hughes Committee and others . . . mean is, enabling things to be done better . . . through eliminating waste andlisten to thismaking use of our resources, both human and cattle. That is the way in which he intends that we should make better use of and provide better opportunities for our exporters. In even more illuminating fashion, he went on to say that by 1995 there will be little need for an export market development grant scheme or others like it. Here we have a hidden part of the consumption tax package of the Opposition. Nowhere has it said that it would eliminate these programs. But, of course, the honourable member for Barker has let the cat out of the bag. Here is another half a billion dollars worth of programs which the Opposition intends to get rid of because it says that Australian exporters will not need them by 1995, as a result of the implementation of two pages of policy, out of the 800. It is not surprising. We have had, since FederationMr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order in respect of your role as custodian of the rights of all honourable members of this House. I draw your attention to a ruling given by your predecessor on 12 February 1986 which led to a Minister being asked to curtail an answer. Indeed, the Prime Minister of the day was asked to sit down because of the length of his answer to a question. I draw your attention to the fact that we have had just two questions in 12 minutes. This answer has now been rolling for some seven minutes, with the prospect of it rolling further. In the interests of the rights of all honourable members, I ask that you ask the Minister to curtail his answer.",11
17,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"erder! I say to the Leader of the National Party, as I have said to him and his colleagues on both sides frequently, as have my predecessors, that we in the chair would welcome time limits being put on questions. Those on both sides of the House have decided that they will not put time limits on answers. The Minister is in order.",12
18,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For as long as there has been a Federation, there has been an argument about free trade and protection. Of course, we now have the situation where the Opposition has .decided that it will put a squatter in charge of the nation's factories. Mr Aldred- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. You were correct in saying that there is no specific standing order governing the length of answers in Question Time. But I would point out to you, Sir, that in 1976",12
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Do you have a point of order? Mr Aldred-In 1976 the average length of an answer to a question,12
20,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order? Mr Aldred-was 2.4 minutes; last year it was 3.8 minutes.,12
21,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is the honourable member for Deakin's point of order? Mr Aldred-As at 6 March this year it was 5.4 minutes. My point of order is that the way in which the Minister is answering this question is against the complete spirit of Question Time. You should have him draw his answer to a conclusion.,12
22,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. The honourable member for Deakin will resume his seat. Dr Kemp-Take as long as you like.,12
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Goldstein.,12

25,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The House will come to order. Mr Aldred- Mr Speaker, on a further point of order: that is clearly an improper reflection upon an honourable member under the Standing Orders. I ask that the Treasurer withdraw that remark.",12
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member for Deakin finds the remark offensive, the Minister will withdraw it.",12
27,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw. This is the kind of thing which"""":"""" Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order and I ask the Minister to sit down.",12
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will get to his point of order. Mr Thckey-I will, Sir. I am drawing your attention to the previous requirements in Standing Orders that have been drawn to your attention, particularly standing order 142, but more importantly the precedent in this place. A moment ago you made a complaint relating to your having no power to draw an answer to a conclusion. You are the first Speaker who has found himself incompetent to do that. I draw your attention to",12

31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for O'Connor.,13
32,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What the honourable member for O'Connor said then is a direct reflection on the Chair, describing the Chair as incompetent to act in a particular mannerMr Thckey-I have a point of order.",13

34,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would ask, Mr Speaker, that for the dignity of the House and the dignity of the Chair he be asked to withdraw it.",13
35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I take it that the honourable member for O'Connor-and the honourable member for O'Connor might confirm this in case I am putting words in his mouth-made the remarks he did in the broad sense of a series of Speakers, not me personally. That is the way I took that remark. I might point out to the honourable member for O'Connor, as I did to the honourable member . for Deakin and the Leader of the National Party, that many Speakers in - he past have complained that the House has not put time limits on answers. I point out to the honourable member for O'Connor and other honourable members on his side and the Government side that governments and oppositions have not imposed time limits. The situation at present is that there are not limits on answers. The Minister is answering the question; the Minister is in order; the Minister has the call.",13

In respect of precedents established by previous Speakers, I would point out to you that Speaker Snedden asked Ministers on 29 occasions to draw their answers to a conclusion, mainly in respect of the excessive time involved; Speaker Jenkins asked 12 Ministers to draw their answers to a conclusion; and Speaker Child 12.",13
40,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Will you get to the point. Mr Aldred-You have asked on only four occasions that Ministers draw their answers to a conclusion in respect of the excessive amount of time involved. I ask you to sit the Minister down.,13
41,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I commend the honourable member for Deakin on his research capacities. There is no point of order. The Minister is in order.,13
42,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, there has been this debate about the role of manufacturing industry. It is a debate which went nowhere during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, as of course there was no real belief that Australian manufacturing could compete and succeed. Mr Beale-Here we go again.",13
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Higgins will cease interjecting.,13
44,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Now the Opposition has time got to the point where it wants to put the nation's factories under the tender care of one of South Australia's biggest squatters, this is an opportunity for the farmers to get their revenge on manufacturing industry. Mr Downer-You should be in charge of the Mafia, not the Treasury.",13
45,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Mayo will cease interjecting.,13

76,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the point of order. I wish to raise is that yesterday you allowed the word 'lie' to be used by the Prime Minister. I refer you to page 1344 of Hansard. If it was parliamentary yesterday, why is it not parliamentary today? Opposition members-Hear, hear!",14
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! For a member to accuse another member of lying is not parliamentary.

The Leader will withdraw the remark.",14
80,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw the remark, Mr Speaker.",15
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Then ask your question.,15
82,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Prime Minister: is Senator Walsh correct when he suggests that interest rates could rise to 20 per cent if the Government delivers its tax promise? Why did the Prime Minister misrepresent the situation in his 'One Nation, One Job' statement when he promised the Australian people both low interest rates and unfunded tax cuts? Prime Minister, if your own supporters do not believe you and what you say, how can anybody else believe you?",15
83,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This guy would make a cat laugh. If our tax cuts are unfunded, then so are the Leader of the Opposition's, which came from the same source. Opposition members-Wrong!",15
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,15
85,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The notion is that if a government volunteers to return fiscal drag to taxpayers-that is, the impact of ,inflation on the tax scales-that is to pay it. as though it needed to be funded. What is this notion? It is that the incidence of inflation on the tax system raises the incidence of tax on taxpayers. The Government gives it back, but it has to be funded. Funded from what? Cuts in government spending, eh? You are as-lly, bunch, are you not? When I put the questlOn to you, you all just smile and look silly. That is okay. We have dispensed with that little bit of nonsense about funding and unfunding. As to interest rates, the results of the tax cuts 1989, which Senator Walsh - lso referred to, gave us a large part of that low inflation rate we have today. · Mr Downer-The recession.",15
86,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The recession? Well, how come we came out of the 1982 receSsion with lO'lz per cent unemployment and we come out of this one with PIz?",15
87,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,15
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,15
89,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sorry-inflation. The fact is that in 1988-89, in the height of the boom-when demand was running at twice the capacity of the economy to produce; when there were shortages of labour; when pressure was on the accord and the inflation rate; and when employers were offering 12 to 15 per cent wage settlements-had those tax cuts not been there, instead of coming through this recessionary period from a peak of about 6 or 7 per centiriflation, we would have begun at about 11 or 12 per cent. Instead of being at 1'/2 per cent now, we would more likely be at about 7 per cent. That is what the tax cuts of 1989 did. They broke the inflationary cycle in Australia for the first time in 20 years. They proved that we could go through a period of high growth and high demand without bust!ng the wages system and without wages breaking out. That is what the effect was in 1988-89. What we are doing now with our tax cuts is again providing a climate which is conducive to reasonable and moderate wage settlements to keep the inflation rate down, whereas the tax cuts of the Opposition are paid in lieu of the GST. We have the same tax rates as you in that middle range from $20,000 to $40,000 with no 15 per cent GST. As a result, it will provide a much better wages climate for low inflation. In the maintenance of low inflation, which all of the One Nation forecasts have, we will have interest rates lower in nominal terms than we have had for 20 years. So the aSsertion of Senator Walsh, that rates will go back into high double digits, basically has no basis to it. How can it if the inflation of rate remains low? Off an inflation rate of 3 per cent-odd, to go back to double digit interest rates, we would need real rates of interest of 8 or 9 per cent. There is no point and no reason why Australians should be burdened by such rates. Therefore, I see no basis to the argument. Even in 1989, when we paid tax cuts worth $6 billion, we still produced a surplus of $8 billion; it was the greatest surplus in our history; it was one of the only three or four surpluses produced by this Government in our history. So that is the principal fact. Senator Walsh's view of the world is essentially gloomy. It is that we' should be producing surpluses forever. Let me make this point: if we produce surpluses for the next four or five years and we bring all of the Commonwealth Government' securities back into Treasury-in other words, there are no Commonwealth securities on offer-what will the Commonwealth do with its surpluses? Will it start buying CBD towers in the capital cities? Will it start buying assets? What will it do with its surplus? Opposition members say that we should then sell them all, because the Opposition is into privatisation. The fact is that all of these things are exaggerations the part of Senator Walsh and the Leader of the Opposition. The fact is that there is nothing wrong with handing back tax cuts of the variety that the Government intends, to produce a climate to keep the inflation rate low and, with it, lower interest rates. The only way Australia will get lower interest rates is with a low, underlying inflation rate. We have proven that we are the only party in national politics which can produce low inflation and keep it there .. Wage Levels",15
90,Mr WRIGHT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Inwhy. dustrial Relations. Is the Minister aware of proposals to improve economic activity by cutting real wages without providing apconsideration: propriate compensation through the' social wage? Will the Minister comment the Government's intentions are regarding this matter?,16
91,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the honourIt able member for Capricornia, I am aware of such a proposal and that the Government does not intend to apply it. This, of course, stems from the Fightback proposal of the Opposition. As honourable members are aware, the Opposition is proposing to introduce a GST with an inflation impact of something in the order of 5 per cent with consequential adjustment of money wages. It is proposing a compensation package through income tax cuts and increased allowances, which it claims will more than fully compensate all sections of the community. It also claims that other economic benefits, including two million jobs by the year 2000, would apply. In all of that, the real wage reduction is a crucial assumption-although I must say that in relation to the two million jobs the GST was not modelled; it is essentially irrelevant-of the Opposition that there would not be an ongoing inflation impact which 'would have severely adverse economic consequences. .

109,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: would you explain to the House how your discretion in detennining the duration of the presentation of a point of order differs from your lack of discretion in detennining the duration of an answer by a Minister to a question?",18
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the right honourable member for New England would know better than other members in the House, the position is that when the Speaker rises members shall resume their seats. I asked the honourable member for Deakin on a number of occasions to resume his seat. He defied the Chair and he has been named. The bells continuing to be rung",18
111,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: while I acknowledg- the point you have just made in tenns of your ruling, I ask: on what basis and under what standing order have you the capacity to detennine the length of time an honourable member takes in raising a point of order when you have no capacity to detennine the length of time a Minister takes when responding to a question?",18
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because of the long standing attitudes that Speakers have taken, and as the right honourable member for New England wo.uld know more than most, having participated in many of, those exchanges himself, I am sure that some of what he has said is tongue in cheek. Mr MCGauran-You like a bit of tradition, do you?",18
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Gippsland might just restrain himself or he Jones, B. O. might find himself in the same position. Mr Thckey-On the point of order: would it be that you gave that ruling on the precedent of Speaker Cope when he said, 'It is my duty to see that back benchers on both sides of the House are able to ask as many questions as possible', or was it in fact what happened to Speaker Cope?",18
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for O'Connor will withdraw the implication in that remark. Mr Thckey-I will withdraw, Mr Speaker, but I asked you a question. Mr SPEAKEIt-I thank the honourable member for withdrawing. Of course, he and his colleagues might realise that there might be more chances for honourable members to ask questions if there were fewer interjections. The bells continuing to be rung",18
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members might note that, when the bells are ringing, sometimes the defamations laws do not hold. We should be a little wary. The House divided.

In that case, why is it that the acoustical problem. only goes one way and the honourable member now being voted on cannot get the benefit of the doubt for not having heard, too?",18
116,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,"The honourable member for Cowper knows there is no point of order involved there. Mr Nehl-I cannot hear you, Mr Speaker.",19
117,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,"There is no point of order. Mr Nehl-Thank you, Mr Speaker.",19
118,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,I would be quite happy to raise my voice to the same volume as the honourable member for Cowper if he desires me to. Question so resolved in the affirmative.,19
119,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,Order! The honourable member is suspended from the service of the House for 24 hours. The honourable member for Deakin thereupon withdrew from the chamber. Opposition members-Shame! Mr Reith-Haven't you finished yet?,19
120,Mr WILLIS,AYES,I have not started yet.·,19
121,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,The Minister will get to answering the question.,19
122,Mr WILLIS,AYES,"I was attempting to say that, in the context of the introduction of a goods and services tax, the assumption of a reduction in real wages is a quite crucial one. But subsequent studies have shown that, if this assumption does not hold-that is, if money wages move up with the increased inflationthen the economic outcomes will be quite disastrous. One such study was conducted by the same Dr Murphy who modelled scenario C. He showed that if wage increases were obtained to compensate for the inflationary effects of the GST then ODP would be 4 per cent lower in five years time than it would be otherwise. In making that calculation, he was using only part of the package-that is, a 3 per cent inflation impact not the more like 5 per cent figure. If he had included the rest of the package, obviously he would have had an even greater fall in GDP. Furthermore, as the Treasurer pointed out yesterday, the study by Dr Michael Porter and Andrew Chisholm shows that if real wages are maintained in the face of the inflation stemming from a GST, then GOP actually declines. So the wage behaviour in the context of a GST is clearly quite crucial to the economic outcome. But it is most unlikely that the wage and salary earners will act benignly in the face of a large inflationary surge stemming from the GST and just accept reduced real wages. Firstly, this is because the compensation package is far from adequate. We have already shown, through the Treasury analysis of the distributional effects of the GST, that something like 70 to 80 per cent of wage and salary earners would be worse off under the package. In those circumstances, they would not sit by and idly cop it sweet; they would take strong action for compensating wage increases. Secondly, the ACTU, which has some say in wages policy in this country in deciding how unions pursue their claims, has said that following the release of the Opposition package there would be further wage claims. I quote from the Australian Financial Review of 25 November last year, in which Mr Kelty said: . . . unions would continue to base their wage claims on the movement in the Consumer Price Index seeking wage rises to living standards and compensate for the effect of the GST on prices. It is quite clear that the union movement, in its first look at this, was concerned to make sure that real wages were maintained and it would adjust wage claims according to the GST effect on prices. What it has seen since, from the distributional analysis, would not have changed that view very much, if at all. Thirdly, the Opposition parties would have no mechanism for restraining any wage claims other than to contract the economy further by severely tightening monetary policy. Of course, if it did that we would have more economic contraction and higher unemployment. Fourthly, complete deregulation of the labour market, which of course. is the thing that those opposite hold up as some sort of saviour, would do absolutely nothing in these circumstances to restrain wage claims. If there is complete deregulation, what is to stop people making wage claims to catch up for the inflation impost of the GST. You have no accord and there would be no trade union agreement, as there is at present, to keep wage increases to a level which would give us a price outcome comparable to that of our major trading partners, or less. All that would be lost with the GST. There is no reason at all to believe the Opposition assumption that there would be a reduction in real wages; that there would simply be an acceptance in the context of the GST by those who make wage claims and that they would not pursue higher wage claims. In those circumstances, the effects on GOP and unemployment would be quite disastrous. However, there is one impact that would certainly come from this proposal, and that is industrial disputation. With the additional wage claims would undoubtedly come some resistance from employers. We would be back to the old system of high levels of industrial disputation. The 60 per cent reduction in industrial disputes under this Government would be a thing of the past. In other words, under your package, Fightbackl would mean that everybody starts fighting and we all go maintain workers' real backwards. One Nation Package",19
123,Mr REITH,AYES,"I ask the Prime Minister whether Senator Walsh is correct: is it true that the data and projections in the 'One Nation, One Job' statement were actually cooked up in your office and are not the product of considered Treasury analysis-yes or no? And, if your own supporters do not believe you, why should anybody else?",20
124,Mr KEATING,AYES,"Of course the forecasts have been prepared by the Treasury. I did not think that I needed to make that clear, as I have made it clear already. But I know all about your forecast-Or Murphy's-lam just trying to scrub them up here. We know all about your forecasts. Mr Reith-That is not the question. What do you say to Walsh?",20
125,Mr KEATING,AYES,About what? Mr Reith-What he reckons about your package.,20
126,Mr KEATING,AYES,I gave you that in the last answer. Were you not listening about the 4 states: per cent? Mr Reith-So yo- are saying he is lying. from,21

128,Mr KEATING,AYES,"We find though that Australia's under the Opposition's policies-modelled by an econometric model, modelling a shift from income tax to a consumption taxafter quarters, GDP declines by 0.2 per cent under the base case scenario. Under wages up-that is the condition which the Minister for Finance has just referred to, that is, of payers not accepting the decline in living standards from the consumption tax and seeking it in the marketplace-we find the GDP declines by 4 per cent. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I rise on a expert advice? point of order. Can you explain to me how, understanding order 145, an answer to a question that seeks no comparison and asks about the position of the Government's figures, can be relevant when it simply talks about the Opposition's package.",21
129,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,"The Prime Minister was bodies, asked a question. He will get to the question.",21
130,Mr KEATING,AYES,"Under the wages up case, the GDP actually declines by 4 per cent the period-that is, after 20 quarters or five years. So it is a great little change you have in mind. Yet you keep asking questions about the Government's forecast. Mr Fife- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister has not yet started to answer the question put to him. You directed him to answer the question. The question relates to the Government's figures, not the Opposition's figures. I ask you to require the Prime Minister to follow your instructions.",21

134,Mr KEATING,AYES,"Page 120 of One Nation As part of the preparation for this Statement, the Government established a Task Force of officials the Treasury, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Departments of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Finance, along with representatives from the Prime Minister's Office and the Office. Bearing in mind the uncertainty about economic conditions beyond 1992-93, the Task Force was commissioned to examine medium-term economic outlook and to produce a medium-term scenario for the economy. And that is what has happened. So why ask 20 the question when it is there in print? Family Diet",21

138,Mr STAPLES,AYES,"According to advice from the National Food Authority and other expert an Australian family of two adults and two young children would require about 35 megajoules or about 8,000 kilo-calories of over food energy per day, which would include about 142 grams of protein from items such as meat or from 3,200 milligrams of calcium such as in milk. But this would have to be balanced with other essential carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals for a healthy diet over a sustained period. Obviously, this level of family food intake would increase dramatically if there were older children or more active families. We all appreciate that a family'S ability to maintain good health, growth and development for its children is obviously very dependent upon its ability to .afford healthy food. I sure. the honourable member for Banks was alarmed at the survey conducted in support of the Opposition last December with the so-called representative food basket of groceries for a family for a fortnight. That basket of groceries contained 61 household items, including some cheese, a bit of chocolate, some carrots and a whole lot of pet food, as we know. We are all expected to believe with the addition of a few top ups, that a fat'nily lead a normal healthy life with a minimal price impact of only 4.8 per cent on their household budget.

144,Mr STAPLES,AYES,"The National Food Authority has advised me that the purchase of food would have to be doubled before the recommended dietary intakes of a family were met over that fortnight. Even then there would be serious deficiencies. In other words there is not enough food to meet the energy' needs of a family over a two-week period, nor are there the necessary vitamins and minerals to prevent diet related diseases.

146,Mr STAPLES,AYES,"The Opposition's original shopping list contained no milk, one chicken, a packet of bacon, and very little in the way of fresh fruit and vegetables. What it did contain, obviously, was a disproportionate range of products such as pet foods and household cleaners. According to the National could Food Authority what would be required as 'top ups' by the Opposition would amount to an extra 13 loaves of bread, 21litres of milk, bananas, grapes, oranges, sweet corn pumpkin, zucchini, pears, sausages, a bit of steak, some chops, some minced steak, some fish fingers, pork chops and about 15 other items-30 add.itional items, 'top ups', before people could hve a normal healthy life.",22

149,Mr STAPLES,AYES,"Obviously, anyone in the community who has done any shopping and pushed a shopping trolley-the wheels are falling off your GST cart very quickly!...,.... knows that you cannot go and pick up those extra 30 'top up' items out of the small change at the bottom of mum's purse. That is what you expect people to believe. You cannot have it both ways. Either the supermarket survey that you put forward to people as representative represents a genuine family shopping basket sufficient for the family's normal fortnightly food and household needs or it does not. If it does represent those needs: acc?rding to .you, then it imposes a dietary regIme of Third World status on Australians with only enough meat for one or two dayper fortnight and serious health risks. If the survey is not a genuinely representative shopping basket, the 4.8 per cent increase that you have cited balloons out into double digit figures and impacts on the ordinary families' household food budgets. I issue. a challenge to the Leader of the Opposition, and indeed his health spokesman, to clearly demonstrate to us that the health of Australians, and particularly Australian children, would not suffer under their consumption tax and that people would be able to afford aheaIthy diet.

Coronation Hill Mr TIM F1SCHER-The Minister should practise what he 'preaches. I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that the reason mining 'at Coronation Hill has not gone ahead is, as stated by Sehator Walsh, that you gave an undertaking to some Caucus members in return for leadership votes? To whom in Caucus did you promise not to give the goahead on Coronation Hill? Did the number of votes from Caucus members on the basis that 'you would not give the go-ahead to mine Coronation Hill exceed the number of votes , from Caucus members who 'supported mining? Why did you mislead and say to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that you would give the go-ahead for mining at Coronation Hill? If you are not honest with ,your own, what hope Australia? Mr KEATING'-I made my position clear on Coronation Hill on television in'June 1991. I said that, were I to be present at the Cabinet meeting, I would vote in favour of allowing an arrangement for mining to obtain between the Aboriginal community in the area and the mining company. Mr Tim Fischer-And you wimped out.",23
154,Mr KEATING,AYES,"No. I resigned as Treasurer. I left the Cabinet. That is what happened. In the meantime, the Government made a decision about it and"" the decision stands. I am just trying to find the quote from the mining company itself. It says that it is a very small deposit. It is a small deposit. I made no commitment whatsoever to anybody about mining of Coronation Hill. Mr MCGauran-Campbell said you did.",23
155,Mr KEATING,AYES,"I do not know why you keep coming back to it. The fact of the matter is it is not a large deposit. In the great scheme of things in terms of mining it would not have a major impact upon the mining industry of this country. Mr Ruddock interjecting Mr Snowdon-Oh, what a lot of nonsense, Ruddock; you don't know what you are talking about.",23
156,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory and the honourable member for Dundas.,23
157,Mr KEATING,AYES,"The' Government looked at all these issues and decided as it did. As Prime Minister I had the option of opening the issue, and I decided I should not do so because the Government carefully and sensibly came to a decision about it, and that decision should stand. But on a major deposit like Marandoo we are finding now that the exploratory drilling to quantify the ore body is going ahead. There is no ,major mining project being held up at the moment. It had - pecial features about it, as indeed did the Jabiluka deposit in the Alligator Rivers Region which you held up for seven years in office. You allowed Ranger to be developed, ,but not the Pancontinental mine, for exactly the same reasons. , Housing'",23
158,Mr KERR,AYES,"Can the Minister for Health, Housing' and Community Services tell the House about the present levels of' housing affordabiIity, and can he advise on the significance of these levels for the state of the housing industry?",23
159,Mr HOWE,AYES,"Members of the House may have noticed reports, ,citing the Real Estate Institute of Australia, that in the December quarter 1991 the national affordability ratio was at its best level since the March quarter 1988. 1;he report confirmed the results of the Commonwealth Bank-Housing Industry are Association index, which showed affordability at its highest level for over three years. These improvements in affordability result largely from cuts in official interest rates flowing through into substantial reductions mortgage interest rates. The significant improvement in affordability has underpinned the recovery in the housing sector. That recovery is now very well esMelbourne tablished. f!:ousing starts have risen for three consecutive quarters and are at their highest levels since September 1989. The major contributor to this growth has been the private sector. Leading indicators create a, picture of further growth in the March quarter 1992. Dwelling approvals for the three months to February are up 3.7 per cent, despite the of 7.4 per cent for February reported today. The fall in February was due to a sharp decline in public and other private approvals after very strong growth in the preceding two months. Private houses, which represent around three-quarters of the total approvals, rose by 4.7 per cent. That is consistent the Government strategy, which was to bring forward public sector approvals and commenJeremiahs cements in the course of last' year when the recession was very strong, and that allows now, as private sector approvals are getting much stronger, to begin the process ding back the contribution being made by the public sector. Reports from builders and lenders also add Paper. to our confidence in the upward trend in the housing sector. A. V. Jennings, Australia's largest home builder, claimed a' sales record in February 1992, beating its previous high of two years ago by 10 per cent. The Commonwealth Bank and the New South Wales, St George Building Society have reported increases of over 60 per cent in home lending in the first two months of this year. The latest survey of volume builders shows that , ,new house sales rose by 15 per cent in misleading February. All the factors, then, are in place for the recovery to continue. The impact of the cut in official interest rates in January 1992 is yet to be fully reflected in housing demand. The conditions there for a restoration of confidence. Indeed, the Australian newspaper on 17 March reported that lending institutions said that affordability had restored .consumer confidence. The Real Estate Institute reports in that there was a marked improvement in confidence and outlook during February amongst buyers and vendors. The Institute noted that first time home buyers activity in . was at its highest level on record. At this stage the recovery is simply a matter of confidence. The evidence is there that the recovery is under way. .As that recovery grows we can expect, as the Master Builders Association indicated today, that we will , achieve the target of the Indicative Planning Council of 137,000 starts this year. Against that situation, all we hear from the Opposition fall is whingeing, whining, negativism, and talking down any sign of recovery-in fact, talking down the industry. The problem of those opposite' is that, rather than seeking the good, rather than seeing what is best for the Australian people, rather than contributing to the growth of confidence and stability of the with housing industry, all we get is a negative approach, an approach which is about the rather than about seeing the strong recovery that is occurring and is so important us for new home buyers who are now, I am pleased to say, strongly back and present of winwithin the housing industry.",23
160,Mr KEATING,AYES,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice . NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",24
161,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"I move: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader RIA of the Opposition moving forthwith-That this House censures the Prime Minister for consistently the Australian people about Australia's economic circumstances, and his economic policies, as exposed by the former Finance Minister, Senator Walsh.",24
162,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Reith-I second the motion. Question resolved in the affinnative, with an absolute majority. Motion of Censure",24
163,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"I move: That this House censures the Prime Minister for consistently misleading the Australian people about Australia's economic circumstances, and his economic policies, as exposed by the former Finance Minister, Senator Walsh. . ' In the past several days in this Parliament and elsewhere, we have had a succession of examples of how this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will say or do anything for short tenn political gain. He will deliberately set out to misrepresent the circumstances to satisfy his particular needs at any point in time, irrespective of the .consequences of those statements or those actions for the people of Australia. We saw it most recently last week in his backdown on the protection position that we understood his Government had supported for a large part of the latter half of the 1980s. Of course, today we have clear evidence from one of the ex-senior members of this Government, the ex-Finance Minister, Senator Walsh, in an interview reported in an Australian magazine which clearly demonstrates the extent to which on many occasions this particular Prime Minister has deliberately sought to misrepresent the situation. I guess the Prime Minister is in the tradition of Australian Labor Party leaders, as was summarised by Senator Richardson last year-when the Kirribilli conspiracy was exposed-when on Sydney radio he said that Mr Hawke had been justified in breaking his promise because it helped keep the Liberals out of power: All I know is that the betterment of Australia justify almost anything. This is the principle on which those in the Government work: what is in their political interests at any point in time, irrespective of the consequences, is justified. The end, their political survival,' justifies the means-any statement, any action, any statement, anywhere, at any time-in order to deal with an argument or a pressure. I thought the remarks made by Senator Walsh today were particularly telling when he referred to the actions of this Prime Minister. When asked about the Prime Minister's behaviour, he said: But this is one thing about Paul. Sometimes what politicians say in public is not what they believe. It's not uncommon for there to be a divergence betwee.!1 the two. But leaving that possibility aside, if he does believe all the different things he has said, he has the capacity for self-delusion. Either he was deliberately deluding and misleading the people of Australia or he was deliberately deluding himself in terms of the statements that he has made in the last several years. It is instructive to take some of the specific points made by Senator Walsh in this' interview to demonstrate just how far this man will go to deliberately misrepresent the circumstances that we have seen come to fever pitch in the last few weeks as he has panicked under pressure in the Wills by-election. We might start, for example, with a point which was the basis of a question to the Prime Minister today about whether or not the Budget numbers. in this One Nation document, that is, the numbers on page 149, are in fact Treasury numbers. Senator Walsh very carefully says: ... the table in the recent Economic Statement which shows the budget coming back into surplus is definitely not a Treasury table. This is very important because this is the",25
164,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,Which document?,25
165,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"It is an official's table. This is a Treasury table, an official's table. I know what you referred to earlier on page 120; but does that cover what is on page 149, attachment B? Is it or is it not a Treasury will table? Is Senator Walsh right, or is Senator Walsh wrong? The fact is that Senator Walsh is right. Treasury would not sign off on this table. This table is a deliberate misrepresentation of the likely course of events in this country in the next few years. You produced this table in your office, to make things look better than they are, to mislead the people of Australia, and that deception has been exposed very clearly by Senator Walsh in his comment today that it is definitely not a Treasury table. Senator Walsh would know, having had so many years as the Minister for Finance in this country. The Prime Minister has gone out of his way, even in Question Time today, to obfuscate on that particular point, trying to distract attention from the fact that this was produced in his office for his particular political ends. As a consequence, the tax cuts promised in this document are undeliverable. He knows it, Senator Walsh knows it, and Senator Walsh has now exposed it. The second area that we can take out of this statement by Senator Walsh today which demonstrates the extent to which this Prime Minister will go to misrepresent the circumstances relates to his continuing assessments of the shape of the economy. We have seen many examples of how he has deliberately misrepresented our economic circumstances for his own political ends. Remember how many times he denied that there would be a recession before the last election campaign. He kept denying it and he kept denying it, and then finally, of course, it became apparent in the data that there was a recession. Then, of course, it was a recession we 'had to have'. Senator Walsh has given us a number of other examples of this sort of deliberate deception on the part of this Prime Minister. One of the most telling examples relates to the period in 1986 to which Senator Walsh is referring, when in relation to the conduct of fiscal policy he says: Keating has argued publicly that we ran a tight fiscal policy throughout the 19808 because the private economy was going along well and there was no need for compensatory government spending. .. . The historical truth, of course, is that we started tightening fiscal policy seriously in 1986and this is the crucial pointat the very time ,that the private sector was going into a shallow recession-and we knew it was going into a shallow recession. Yet in mid-1986 this Prime Minister, then as Treasurer, was asked a specific question: 'Are we close to a recession?', to which he replied on 30 May 1986, 'No, not within cooee of it'. That is a classic example of where Senator Walsh has clearly exposed the extent to which in 1985-86 this man deliberately went out to mislead Australians in the course",25
166,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"No, it does not.",26
167,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"You think it is funny. You do not think it matters, but people out there have a certain respect. They used to have a certain respect for the office of Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister used to conduct himself in a way in which he actually made responsible statements, not played around with the lives and expectations of average Australians.",26
168,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"Rubbish, rubbish.",26
169,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"You may not care about it, but your deception has cost one million Australians their jobs. Your deception, your inability to face reality, has cost one million Australians their jobs, and is again clearly exposed by Senator Walsh in this particular passage that I have taken from his reference to the middle 1980s and the statements you were making on the record, knowing full well at the time that a' shallow recession was in prospect. A third example of the Prime Minister's deception and misrepresentation has to do with the recession itself and the reason we had a recession. Senator Walsh goes to great lengths to explain precisely how the excessive reliance on monetary policy was the principal reason we had a recession.",26
170,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"Monetary! M-O-N-EI)r BEWSON-I do not care how I speak. I will get the point across. I could talk about the gross malaise of the epoch, but I would not be prepared to pick on the way you speak. How we speak is irrelevant. The substance of the point is that the Prime Minister has gone out of his way to blame everybody else but himself for this recession. There are some telling examples that we can take from the past. On 5 February 1991, the Prime Minister said: The performance of the Victorian economy is, I think, basically the cause of why we saw these negative growths in GDP, why we have the word recession in our newspapers. On 5 February 1991, it was Victoria's fault. On 8 February 1991, the Prime Minister said: Victoria is not to 'blame' for the recession. the recession Victoria's 'fault'. The Government did not want a recession, it wanted a slowdown. These examples show that, within just a few days of each other- he has completely changed his explanation of what has happened. It is little wonder that in an article in March 1991, Peter Smark pointed out, very accurately: Paul Keating has blamed the Fraser Government, entrepreneurs, the banks and a cast of thousands for causing the recession. This week he added real estate agents and the Wool Corporation, and reached back through 25 years of pre-1983 governments in his relentless hunt for the culprits. That is an example of the extent to which there are now so many explanations on the record; yet only one explanation is right-the one that Senator Walsh gives as to why there is a recession: the excessive reliance on monetary policy. Senator Walsh said: . . . the 'recession we had to have' was in fact the recession we didn't have to have. The recession is a function of the over-reliance on monetary policy. He spells out why that process could have been avoided. This man, deliberately and knowingly misleading the people of Australia, stuck to his high interest rate policy way beyond the point he was advised to do so, pitched this economy into recession, thIew one million Australians out of work and inflicted the worse pain and hardship on average Australians since the 1930s. Similarly, we can go to some specific issues. We had another example in the Parliament today of where this Prime Minister has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented the circumstances. One example of classic leadership weakness is CoronatiQn Hill. If ever there was a mine or project that had been cleared on every conceivable ground and should have gone ahead, it was that project. Mr Tim Fischer-The litmus test.",26
171,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"It is a litmus test of leadership in recent days. The previous Prime Minister failed that test of leadership and the current Prime Minister also failed that test of leadership. I think his handling of this issue is a very clear example of the type of person he really is and the sorts of arguments he Nor is puts. In Question Time today he referred to the fact that he put his position on the record in 1991-on television, I think he said in his answer-that he supported it but, of course, he lost the job of Treasurer and could not carry it through. If we look at the Hansard for March this year we see that he said: The Government considered all the issues, including the Aboriginal heritage issues, and decided against it. He gave his imprimatur to that position in relation to Coronation Hill. As we read Senator Walsh's document we find the true reason for the position that has been taken by this man on Coronation Hill. He stated: The only way in which I can account for the Coronation Hill decision, or non-decision if you like, is that hethat is, the Prime Ministergave an undertaking to some caucus members in return for leadership votes . The fact is that it is one stage worse than that. The Prime Minister did deals with Caucus members for votes, but he did that on both sides of the issue. He told some members, in order to get their votes, that he would not let it go ahead; he told some members, such as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), that he would let it go ahead. On 23 December the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said: I'll be watching Mr Keating like a hawkinteresting use ·of the termto see if he delivers on overturning the ban on mining on Coronation Hill. Of course, there is another part to the deal of that particular honourable member. He is looking for the cuts in immigration, and they have not come yet either. What does the Prime Minister say when he is asked about deals? On 21 January 1992 on the John Laws program again, where all the major policy statements in this country are made. I will have to be careful because, if I keep saying John Laws, every other radio announcer in the country will get into me for giving him a free advertisement, but this man has made a lot of major statements on John Laws-he said: I do not do any deals with anybodyyou can just imagine him saying thisI mean you make alliances, friendships and things, but they are not deals. Deals go to people getting positions and policies and what have you. Half of the Party of the Prime Minister was told of the policy of no mining at Coronation Hill, and the other half of his Party was told of the other policy of definitely letting mining at Coronation Hill go ahead. The only person who benefited from those deals was the Prime Minister. One job was saved-his job. He got the top job, and we lost about 630 jobs in Coronation Hill because that project did not go ahead. That is indicative of the type of person that this man is. He will take anyone of those circumstances or issues and he will say or do anything; he will deal with anyone; he will even deal with his colleagues on both sides of the issue to get what he wants, irrespective of the consequences for the average Australian. Another example in this document from Senator Walsh today is a very important one which is to do with the Accord .. Senator Walsh refers to that fact in his assessment. He stated: We ran a pretty permissive wages policy through the 19808. True, we didn't.have a wages explosion. . . but year after year, the government said all right to have nominal wage increases of 7 per cent. Given that there was minimal productivity growth and that wages drift guaranteed an inflation rate of the same level, the drift of government policy was against the advice of the economic rationalists, people like me and the Treasury and Finance economists. It is a clear-cut, damning statement of the wages policy that the Prime Minister has boasted about and misrepresented for .the course of the whole of the 1980s. Indeed, we can just go to his One Nation statement and pick up some of thedoozeys. Page 44 states: The Accord between the Government and the ACTU has delivered unprecedented wage restraint since 1983 ... It is repeated again on page 13 of that statement: . . . unprecedented wage restraint. The fact is, as Senator Walsh correctly said in endorsing the arguments that we have put for years, that you ran a pretty pennissive wages policy-and why? Because you were locked into a deal with the ACTU on wages and you were forced to deliver, irrespective of the consequences for the worker-their real wages fell in the end because you did not control inflation-and irrespective of the consequences for Australia, because we lost any hope of being internationally competitive when our wage increases and nominal unit labour costs were roughly double those of our trading partners right through your time as Treasurer. A final area that we can pick out-and a very politically sensitive area that Senator Walsh dwells on-is the issue of the tax cuts that have been promised. Separate to the issue that they are unfunded and that their delivery has not been not based on any figuring by Treasury, Senator Walsh goes out of his way. to warn us that we are about to see the same mistakes made that were made in 1989. He said: If the new tax scales are to be taken seriously, they show we've learned nothing fro- 1989. He goes on to say: But if it is going to be taken seriously, that's a formula for very largely repeating the mistakes of 1989. it was He is arguing here that the Government should not have delivered the 1989 tax cuts. It did not need to deliver them to get inflation down because the Prime Minister just pitched the economy into the deepest recession in 60 years. Inflation was going to fall like a stone anyway, but he delivered them because he had done a deal with the ACTU. We go back to that statement. I made about 'no deals'. He does not do deals with anybody because deals imply that somebody gets privileged access to government; somebody gets a privileged position in government. This is a man of privilege looking after a few key mates such as union leaders and a couple of backbenchers whose support he needs in relation to Coronation Hill. Hang the consequences for the average Australian! You could not care less. Senator Walsh is very revealing because he goes on and criticises this Prime Minister in two other respects in relation to tax. Firstly, he says that in essence these proposals are, in effect, a flat tax. Just to show this man's view of flat tax in the past, before he came to having to try to buy his way back into government, I remind the House that when he criticised us when we talked about imposing a flat tax, or a flatter tax system, and using consumption tax, he said that that would blow our society to pieces. You are not going to blow our society to pieces? Of course, the argument does not matter; the circumstances are what matter. He needed a point against us, so he used it. He said, 'If you would believe that it would not blow our society apart, then you are more naive than I thought'. Mr Rocher-Who said that?",27
172,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"He did, the Prime Minister. It is a classic example again of how he distorts the circumstances to make a point. He knows the sensitivity on this point, because in the One Nation statement on page 42 he tries to head off that criticism by saying: The Government is committed to maintaining a progressive tax system, whereby those in the community with a higher capacity to pay tax bear a higher share of the taxation task. The point is very simple. This man has a record of blatant dishonesty, irrespective of the consequences for the average Australian. The pain and hardship in Wills and all over Australia today is the direct result of blatant misrepresentation by this man: manipulation of events, manipulation of circumstances, manipulation of arguments-manipulation of almost anything to save his political skin at the expense of every other person in Australia. It is a national disgrace that this, man has got to the position he has attained, and he will prove to be the most dangerous Prime Minister we have ever seen in this country.

173,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"The device of the censure motion has been used more by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in this session of Parliament than in the last decade in this chamber. The standing order has been abused and such a motion now has no status in terms of prioritising issues or of requiring the Government to answer a case. The ,device is now being used simply like a matter of public importance. We see censure motions moved' during Question Time or immediately after Question Time. They are moved willy-nillywhatever takes the Leader of the Opposition's a fancy. Not only that, they are simply a device to bring forth the vitriol that I am 'blatantly dishonest' or 'it is indicative of the type of person this man is'-all of this highly personal invective which the Leader of the Opposition specialises in. What is the opening case? That the Budget numbers are not Treasury numbers, he says. I quoted to him the medium term forecasting framework and all the appropriate references.

After all, the statement was a statement by the Prime compiled in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, not in the Treasury. It is not a budget; it does not purport to be a budget.

203,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,I tell the truth.,30
204,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"It is just massive dison your part to be doing this sort of thing. He then goes on to talk about how he Senator Walsh has argued about how we run policy. and a flat tax. Understand this about Senator Walsh: he believes in 60 per cent marginal tax rates. He opposed me when I cut the rates to 49 per cent in 1986. wanted the top personal rate left at 60 per cent, with relatively low thresholds. If you endorsing high marginal rates of tax at those rates, say so. But do not quote Senator Walsh attacking me for reducing the tax rates of Australians. Senator Walsh will attack anyinflation. body who reduces the tax rates of Australians because he is basically concerned with a high nominally progressive tax scale-not effectively progressive, but nominally progressive. The fact that people do not pay it and did not pay it always escaped him. Nobody paid the 60 per cent rate other than PAYE taxpayers. We made the system more effectively progressive by removing the free lunches, the credit cards, and cars, and imposing capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. We made the system more effectively progressive, and I do not apologise to anybody for it. I do not think the social compact ought to apply with penal rates of tax as we see in some of these countries which are often lauded by people-countries such as Sweden with 80 per cent and 90 per cent marginal tax rates. Who would want to live in a country where 80 per cent or 90 per cent is taken-a confiswere catory tax regime? What liberty is there for people with that sort of tax policy? So we made the clear, distinct and philoin sophical point that the rate was 49 per centit was just under half and the state did not collect more than half; Senator Walsh always failure. objected to that and his objections were dismissed by the Government. He is still running that argument today. In your silliness, you want to quote him. What do you· want to do? After all, they were your rates, pal-60 per cent. I had to bring them down. But here is your former adviser wanting to go back them and quoting Senator Walsh about high and marginal tax rates. The Leader of the Opposition then goes about the permissive wages policy through the the event. 1980s and he quotes Senator Walsh on that. I remember distinctly having a conversation with Senator Walsh in 1989 when he was mistake. complaining about the tax cuts then. I. said, 'Okay Peter, wages will take off at 12 to 15 per cent in this quarter. What do you think should do about it?'. He said, 'Oh, I don't He know, but we shouldn't pay the tax cuts'. I said, 'Yes, but that blows the whole inflation are rate to pieces'. He said, 'Oh well, that's the unions; they've got to pull their head in'. The fact is that it would not have happened. The market would have driven us to double· digit Those of us who had responsibility for policy had to make judgments about these things. There is no point Peter Walsh or anybody else raking over old coals. The fact is we are sitting here today with a Ilh per cent inflation rate-game, set and match. The fact is that wages did hold in the recession. He calls a wages outcome of 6 to 7. per cent in a boom when inflation was running at 7 to 7.5 per cent-that is, travelling at the inflation rate or just below it-permissive. What does Senator Walsh require of us-further massive real wage cuts in a boom? Really! And you want to go and quote it.",30
205,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,Productivity.,31
206,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"There he goes-productivity. We saw your productivity rates. They about 0.8 per cent and 0.9 per cent all left the way through the 1970s. We know how good you were. So I am supposed to be blatantly dishonest for not exposing this drift wages policy, so-called, through the 1980s.",31
207,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,The Accord has been a,31
208,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"There he goes again. He says the Accord has been a failure. We broke the dismal legacy of double digit wages growth in a boom fot the first time ever, we have cut strikes by 60 per cent-and you still have the gall to say that the Accord is a to failure. We have inflation at IIh per centyou left us to flit off to the private sector with a 101f2 per cent inflation rate in 1983. We next found you in Business Review on Weekly with a column trying to be wise after Senator Walsh says that the tax cuts are a That is his view; he is entitled to a view. But I do not believe that handing - ack the incidence of inflation on the tax system is we a mistake; it is not a mistake. They will not be tax cuts for a flat tax because we are not going back to 60 per cent marginal tax rates. That is the simple fact. As far as Coronation Hill is concerned; I was asked a question about this by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). I will make these points about it. The value of the gold production over the life of the Coronation Hill mine is only about $285m-that is, if you do not rehabilitate the mine. That is not profits; that is' the value of the production. The mine was estimated to have a net present value of $82m. If it pad to be rehabilitated-as itwo-ld have. to be, given its position on the South Alligator River-how much of that net present value of $82m would be left upon that rehabilitation? The fact is that this mi-e was a small mine. If we look at Marandoo, it is estimated to be worth $25Om per year in exports-not overall, not $285m over its life; \:>ut $250m per year. Newcrest minipg itself admitted tl:lat the Coronation Hill mine was not big. On 30 May 1991, Mr John Quinn said: We have never suggested that Coronation Hill, on the basis of present knowledge, is other than a modest scale mining operation. He went on. to say: The proposed Coronation Hill goldmine, which in itself is not a large project, has .become a totem issue for Australia. Newcrest may well have been a totem issue for the mining company; the fact is that it is a small mine, as that executive officer of the company so describes it.",31
209,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,You did deals on both sides.,32
210,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"The fact is that Senator Walsh has a bee in his bonnet about Coronation Hill and he thinks the Government should have overturned the decision. That is fair enough; it is a view. Good on him for his view. But much of the criticism of subsequent Government policy comes from the fact that the Government seemingly has not taken his advice in relation to Coronation Hill. I just heard the I.eader of the Opposition interjecting that I did deals on both sides. I made my position clear about Coronation Hill in June 1991. That is how I would have voted when the matter came to Cabinet; I would have voted for an arrangement to be made between the Aboriginal community and the . . mining company to work it out. Cabinet, in its wisdom, decided otherwise. The Labor Government decided otherwise. A decision was made and, as far as I am concerned, the decision should stand. It is as simple as that. But the Opposition has picked this up and come in today with this hotchpotch under the guise, again, of a censure motion. What has the Government done to deserve a censure from the Leader of the Opposition on this matter? References by a senator and former Minister' on issues of policy over the last couple of years and contemporary opinions apparently deserve from you a censure motion. It is an abuse of the Standing Orders. You do not understand what you are doing over there; that comes from your relative inexperience in the Parliament. You have never been around when issues of substance have been subject to censure motions; and you throw them around like confetti every day of the week. One day you will be like the· boy who cried wolf: when you want to get up on a censure motion one day we - i11 treat it with the contempt that most of these censures that you move deserve. The fact is that Senator Walsh had a few things to say about you. In the same article he ' said this about your GST: The transition costs will be extremely high and there will be a big boost for the CPI arid, therefore, there will be'a further prolonged and deep recession coming from that response. So if you want to quote Senator Walsh, quote him on everything. The Leader of the Opposition has again gone over the top; he has tried. to, find issues where. issues do .not exist and has simply showed the fact that he is not up to it in the House of Representatives and not up to it in Question Time. He hides behind this device and, while doing so, gets his backhenchers to take frivolous points of order to stop the Government replying. So I reject absolutely as rubbish this censure motion. It is arrant nonsense. If you want to keep moving censures like that, we will treat them with· the contempt that they deserve. (TIme expired)",32
211,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"If you treat the forms of the House like that, you will cop the contempt that you deserve from the Australian people and the contempt with which you treat this Parliament. The fact is that at the heart of this censure motion is a very simple issue-the issue of credibility. Senator Walsh is not sitting on this side of the Parliament. Senator Walsh is not a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party. Senator Walsh has been one of your supporters. He is not one of the enemies of the Prime Minister and honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating); he is one of the people who, with the Prime Minister, had blood on his hands when they deposed Bob Hawke to put this Prime Minister into the Lodge at the end of last year. He is one of the people who voted for the honourable member for Blaxland. He and his criticisms deserve and form the basis of this censure motion which goes to the credibility of the Prime Minister. The Government cannot laugh off and dismiss the criticisms of Senator Walsh. For six or seven years he was the Minister for Finance, a person with whom this Prime Minister, as Treasurer, worked closely, who was at the centre of the management of this 'economy-the mismanagement of this economy-by this Government. He has served as Finance Minister and his criticisms sharply undermine the credibility of Government policy under the former Treasurer and now Prime Minister. This is one of the most severe criticisms of the Government that we have Seen from within its own ranks in the whole term of this Government. In nine years this is one of the most critical' appraisals of the failure of Labor's economic policy. Let me go through what I think, are 10 points in Senator Walsh's discussions with the Australian Left Review which go to the heart of mismanagement and which reveal the misleading and deceptive nature of so much of what this, Government has said over recent years. Not only is an examination of the past relevant, but an analysis of the future is relevant, as is the likely conduct we can expect from this Government as we go through to the next election. And from the Prime Minister who, wnen he was elected as Prime Minister, said he was not going to tell any lies any more-which says a lot about what he said before he got into the Lodge-I have absolutely no doubt that, as we go to the next polling day, we will have lies like that from go to whoa-just straight, unadulterated lies right through to the next election. Mr Wright-You are a dishonest person.",33
212,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The honourable member for Capricornia!,33
213,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"I say to the Australian public: analyse carefully what these people say because they will do anything and say anything to get themselves into office. The purport of what Senator Walsh represents today is a warning to the Australian public that in the last few years the Government has ' been prepared to do anything and say anything. Let me ,run through the 10 points which form the basis of Senator Walsh's remarks. Firstly, he just explodes as a myth this claim that the relationship between the Labor Government and the trade union movement and the resulting accord have been of benefit to this country. The truth of the matter is that at the heart of many of our economic problems has been Labor's accord with the trade union movement. Here you have got it in black and white. Senator Walsh stated: True, we didn't have a wages explosion like 198182 or 1974-75, but year after year, the government said it was alright to have nominal wage increases of 7%. Given that there was minimal productivity growth, and that wages drift guaranteed an inflation rate of the same level, the drift of government policy was against the advice of the economic rationalists, people like me and the Treasury and Finance economists. . In other words, that policy, contrary to what those opposite have been saying, has been an absolute and dismal failure; that is point one. Point two is that the way in which the Government put' together its, numbers in its recent bit of catch-up politics, the One Nation statement, was very revealing. We have been saying publicly that the numbers are shonky. Today we have proof from Senator Walsh who says, for instance: ... the table in the recent Economic Statement which shows the budget coming back into surplus is definitely not a Treasury table. Game, set and match! And the Prime Minister confirmed it in what he said following Question Time in response to the censure. The truth is that these numbers are just being cooked up so that the Government can go on and say anything and do anything to substantiate its case. . Point three is a classic. It is just a statement from Senator Walsh that when the· Government said in 1986 that the private sector was going pretty well it in fact privately knew that we were headed towards a recession. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr it Hewson) showed in a quote that, when the of Prime Minister, then as Treasurer, was asked, 'Are we heading towards a recession?', he said, 'We are not within cooee of it'. The interesting thing about· Senator Walsh is that he has shown that the Government knew that statement was in fact false. It was in fact just a straight, bald faced lie. It is as clear as that.",33

220,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"Point four is a critical point again from Senator Walsh. First, we· now know that some of the numbers the nificant Government used were shonky, and that Treasury further substantiates our case that this pack-a house of cards if you likeconstructed for the tax cuts, to substantiate the question of where the money is coming from, is not true. It is built on quicksand, paid for on my bankcard-that is, the One Nation statement-and you have got it here from Senator Walsh in black and white telling you so. I quote him exactly: If the new tax scales are to be taken seriously, they show we've learned nothing from 1989. In the time since the 'One Nation, One Job' statement has come down, we have had an clear absolute avalanche of independent commentators on the question of whether or not this scenario, these forecasts, was accurate. This week the National Australia Bank said: While this scenario may be a desirable objective, is, in our view, unlikely to be met in the first half the 1990s because of inherent sluggishness in the domestic economy, following the spending binge of the late 1980s. It goes on to raise the question and its concerns about the fall off in economic activity in Japan and the state of the world economy. So the scenarios on the basis of the National Australia Bank are clearly overoptimistic with clearly shonky numbers. But it is more than that. Look at Richard Blandy in the Independent Monthly that came out today. He said: effect, One Nation offers ""blue-sky"" tax cuts. That is not bad-blue sky tax cuts, basically plucked from thin air to make a case. The numbers are shonky, as Senator Walsh says. Professor Blandy then went on to say: The ""fistful of dollars"", on this occasion, comes from One Nation, not Fightback. is another endorsement of the critical point made by Senator Walsh-that there has been an avalanche. One can go to the Treasury's own document, which was released under the Freedom of Information Act, in of the coalition's Fightback package. When asked about the possibility of a 4 per call. cent growth rate-and remember the Government's projections are 4.75 and then an average of 4.5 per cent-Treasury said in respect of 4 per cent, 'This would be a sigchallenge'. That is a very nice subtle statement but, in other words, whole 'You haven't got a ghost of a chance of making your forecast'. They are your numbers. Look at what the CAl says. It refers to the forecasts, et cetera as 'the unrealistic nature of the forecasts', and it goes on to say: The Statement is a product·of what ought to be by now the discredited Keynesian formula for growth. I will not read all of the quotes, but they damn the statement from start to finish. One can then read what Ross Gittins said yesterday. He is not exactly a card carrying member of the Liberal Party, but I think he sums it up rather well. On the protection debate-but it has a broader meaning-he says: Paul Keating's. amazing attempt to portray himself as an Old Protectionist shows he's so desperate to stay Prime Minister he's prepared to say anything. The real question is whether he is prepared to do anything. Catch this: Anyone interested in distinguishing between rhetoric and reality will need to keep his bulldust detector going full blast in the long, ear-battering haul to the election. Syntech, professional economists advising on matters economic in Australia, say about the Government's forecasts: The Government's own forecasts depict an external deficit that would leave us still at the bottom of the barrel in the international balance-of-payments .ranking over the next five years. But, like too much of the rest of this obliging official framework,that is referring to the forecaststhe official external deficit projections are far too optimistic for the scenario they accompany. There could not be a more damning indictment of the basis upon which the Government has proceeded. Lastly, one can look at the responses of the business community to One Nation. Let us remember that this was a statement directed to kick-starting the economy and giving people a sense of confidence about the future so that we could overcome the appalling fall off in investment in recent years. The whole thing is built on assumptions that suddenly, as at 1 July, people are going to wake up that morning and reckon the recovery is going to be here and they are going to go out and invest. When a survey was done by ABM magazine this year, people were asked: Do you believe that the economic statement has created an environment to stimulate capital investment by your company in 1992-93? What were the responses? Seventy-nine per cent said no. Another question asked was this: How would you rate the chances of the initiatives creating 800,000 new jobs over four years? Given the choice between 'Realistic' and 'Unrealistic', 90 per cent said it was unrealistic. Then there was the question: Given the current international economic environment do you believe that sufficient initiatives have been taken to generate a growth forecast of 4.75% in 1992-931 The noes were 84 per cent. Lastly: The economic statement combines capital works expenditure with tax and other concessions. Will thecombined effect be sufficient to kickstart the economy? The noes made up 48 per cent and those undecided 37 per cent. So the whole thing is built on a pack of cards, built on quicksand, and is simply not going to happen. Senator Walsh's comments today finally blow away any pretence of credibility this Government has, based on its One Nation statement and its expectations for the future. But that is only point No.4. Point No. 5 goes to tax scales and the design of Labor's One Nation tax scales . Honourable members will remember that ACOSS, again not card-carrying members of the Liberal Party, said that Labor's policy was regressive. It said it because half of Australia's taxpayers, those on the lowest incomes, those on less than $20,700, will not get one cent out of Labor's tax policy. Senator Walsh goes further, because he says that it is taking the tax system closer towards a flat tax. That really blows apart the credibility of the Government and of the Prime Minister particularly, because he has railed against flat taxes claiming that they are likely to blow society apart, yet here is Senator Walsh saying that that is the sort of tax policy introduced in One Nation. Point No.6 goes back to what happen:ed in 1989. Senator Walsh simply makes the point that in 1989 the Government should have cancelled the tax cuts that were then projected. Its failure to do so led to very high interest rates. There is a warning here for every Australian: high interest rates are way back again under the One Nation statement outlined by this Government. In point No. 7 Senator Walsh admits the importance of getting marginal tax rates down, and this is a critical point of the coalition's tax policy. Point No.8, of course, blows away the Prime Minister's credibility on Coronation Hill. Point No. 9 talks about the Prime Minister's lack of honesty in dealing with the public. Lastly, in point No. 10, Senator Walsh admits that the person responsible for this recession is in fact the current Prime Minister, which is why he is entitled to be called Mr Recession. In conclusion, this document pulls away the last vestiges of the Government's credibility. The Prime Minister deserves to be censured. (TIme expired)",34
221,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"We have just heard from the Liberal punching bag, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), who wheels up here time and time again, essentially to make the same kind of speech, a speech not worthy of a censure debate. Censure debates used to be taken seriously in this place. Censure debates were about whether a government still had the confidence of the House. Yet we have had two quite derisory speeches in the context of a censure debate, first of all from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and then from this joker who waddles into present the second supporting speech on behalf of the Opposition. Let us understand that we are talking about one thing and one thing only: an interview given by a Labor senator and produced in a journal which for years was the official intellectual outpouring of the Communist Party of Australia. This is the journal which decided to carry an interview with Senator Walsh. This is Peter Alexander Walsh, not to be confused with Maximilian Walshalthough I must say that when one looks at their two views, one finds them reinforcing each other, one finds them becoming increasingly the dismal duo of economic commentary in Australia. One finds that both Maximilian and Peter Alexander are essentially talking each other into a defeatist view of on the Australia. One might call Senator Walsh Pessimistic Pete, because basically Walshie is a fellow of a pessimistic frame of mind. Walshie is my friend. I must say he occasionally tests the friendship, but he is my friend. I know Peter Walsh probably better than most other people do and infinitely better than anyone on that side of the House does. If honourable members on that side actually knew him, they would never call on him in support of anything they were proposing, because he is a great enemy of the Liberal Party, an unrelenting enemy of the Liberal Party and of almost 'everything the Liberal Party stands for. And I have not even started on the National Party. When Walshie was going around in increasingly diminishing concentric circles ploughing his paddocks in bloody Doodlakine, he was working out ways to vent his spleen on the Country Party, which then became the National Party of Australia. So Walshie's whole reason for living and his whole reason for being in politics is to oppose conservatism, and particularly that conservatism represented by the Country Party, now the National Party, and the modem-day Liberal Party. For a long time it has been very hard to get Walshie to feel up-beat about anything, even when the economy has been going well. Mr Downer interjecting Mr Beazley interjecting",36
222,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The honourable member for Mayo and the Minister!,36
223,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"I do not want to interrupt these two sons of former members, but maybe they can carryon their conversation elsewhere.",36
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"The honourable member for Mayo will cease interjecting, and so will the Leader of the House. Mr Beale interjecting",36
225,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,You are another sun of a former member. The' place is full of them! I am sure it is enhanced by the presence of at least one of them. Mr Downer interjecting,36
226,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,I warn the honourable member for Mayo.,37
227,Mr DAWKINS,PRIME MINISTER,"The point is that Walshie has a mind set, and even facts will not get in his way if he wants to continue with a particular line of argument. I might say that intrigues me about this debate is that it is about Walshie's bucket on One Nation. What surprises me is how long it took for Walshie to produce it. A week before One Nation was produced, before it was released to the public, Walshie said to me, 'If you jokers don't reverse the Coronation Hill decision, I am going to bucket the economic statement'. That was before he had even seen it. He had decided he would judge it on the basis of one issue alone, and that was whether we reversed the Coronation Hill statement. I said, 'Well, Walshie, if that is what you want to do, far be it from me to try to stop you. If you want to take that judgment, if you want to say that this whole document, which is about restoring the Australian economy to growth, about trying to .produce jobs for Australian workers, should be judged only on the question of Coronation Hill, then go for it. If that is what you want to do, if that is what you want to say about this Government, if that is what you want to say about your Party, and if that is what you want to say about the Prime Minister, well, do it'. I could not stop him. Honourable members ought to realise that Walshie's position on this was made up a week before he even read it. He said he was going to bucket it-and bucket it he has. But let us understand one thing about Walshie: he has never been able to avoid particular obses- point. sions, and Coronation Hill is one of his obsessions. There are others I would just like to refer to. One might imagine for a moment why it was the Australian Left Review, the former organ of the Communist Party of Australia, that decided to carry Walshie in this way. n is basically an issue about the accord. The communists have never liked the accord, the Liberals have never liked the accord, and Walshie has never liked the accord. So there is this trifecta of the communists, or what is left of them, Walshie and the Liberals. They are united on one view and one view only: that the accord is no good. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) indicated, Walshie is entitled to that view. I doubt, however, whether the Leader of the what Opposition is being entirely candid when he says he thinks the accord has been a failure as well. We only have to go back a few years to when he said: An accord is essential. . . The economic achilles heel of the Fraser Government (and of the Whitlam Government) was its failure to develop a viable and relevant wages and incomes policy of that sort. This is Dr Hewson in his pre-leadership mode. He went on: . . . the Liberals really need to recognise the wages area as their achilles heel and to come up with an alternative. At risk of being accused"" of heresy, might I suggest that it may be desirable for them to accept the concept of an accord-type agreement. .. Here is the Leader of the Opposition making these outrageous suggestions about the Prime Minister's veracity, calling him a liar whenever he can get away with it; yet he is the one who is prepared to fashion any argument, any policy, to suit his purpose. A few years ago an accord was essential, not just for the Government, but for a Liberal government, . and it was the absence of it that was the Achilles heel of the Fraser Government. One has to judge the Leader of the Opposition not just in terms of what he says today. We know that he will resort to anything in order to make a cheap political point. He will even rely on the organ of the Communist Party, or what is left of it, in order to substantiate his The point here is that Peter Walsh has always doubted whether the accord would work. Walshie surprises me in this regard. This morning when I told him over the phone what I was going to say - bout his view, I said, 'Walshie, if we had not had those tax cuts of which you now so strenuously complain, of which you used to complain, we would not have had the wages outcome we have had, we would not have been able to contain wages during a period of very strong growth and we would not now be seeing underlying inflation rates of between 3 and 4 per cent'. He did acknowledge that point. Once Walshie gets a bone-his bone was the accord and the tax cuts that we provided - it takes a long time to wrestle it from the grip of his vice-like jaws. Walshie has been wrestling with this bone notwithstanding the fact that the record is in, the runs are on the board, if you like, and the accord has been a great success for all Australia. Australia has never lived through a period of such strong growth without also having a wages explosion feeding into inflation and then having to grind down the economy on the basis of trying to snuff out the inflation induced by the wages growth. This is Walshie's view. Therefore, the Opposition has to be terribly careful about the way in which it decides to invoke Senator Walsh in support of its argument,regardless of the nature of the publication which decides to carry his views. I want to make another point. The Leader of the Opposition started off by saying that the figures of which Peter Walsh complains do not come from a Treasury table. This is breathtaking. In the past month in here we have been hearing the Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy blackguarding the Treasury, taking to bits the Treasury documents, saying that they are not worth the paper they are printed on; that they are produced by some group of propagandists in the Treasury building; that they cannot be relied on; that they do not tell the truth. Yet, on the flimsiest of evidence, those opposite say that because Peter Walsh says that a table is not a Treasury table it is be believed; in other words, that if it were a Treasury document they would believe it. If we could convince those opposite that it was a Treasury document, they would then say that they did not believe it because it had been put together by that group of propagandists in the Treasury. The point is that the Prime Minister has indicated that the Treasury puts together the forecast for the year out-the year immediately ahead-the Budget Papers for the year immediately ahead and the Forward Estimates of outlays only for a few years ahead. The Treasury does not, in the context of the normal budgetary process, put together years of forecasts for both sides of the Budget. But on this occasion we wanted to do that for the very good reason that we could demonstrate that, with the kind of growth that one can anticipate in Australia in the near future, we can provide a stimulus, get the Budget back to balance and at the same time deliver tax cuts that will produce a marginal rate of 30 per cent in that crucial area that has been focused on by the Opposition. In order to do that, as the Prime Minister said, a group of officials, chaired by a Treasury official and including other officials from the Treasury, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance and econometricians from my office and from the Prime Minister's office, was tasked with this job of putting together these estimates. That was the pUrpose of doing it. We have to take with handfuls of salt this new-found enthusiasm for Treasury authen- . ticity on the part of the Opposition when it has for the past four weeks been misrepresen:ting the Treasury, quoting its documents out of context and abusing the authors of the documents on every occasion. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did it once again. He quoted from a document and said that the Treasury had said that something would be a significant challenge, given that OECD growth averaged only 3 per cent in the 19-Os. He was talking about the prospect of growing at 4 per cent during the years ahead. The document that the Deputy Leader of not to the Opposition was quoting from was not a commentary on us; it was a commentary on him, a commentary on Fightback. What the Treasury said was that a significant challenge was producing growth rates of that order after the introduction of a tax change, after all the inflationary consequences of that and after the . interest rate hike necessary to snuff the inflationary consequences of Fightback out of the system. Treasury was saying that under the Opposition we could not grow because of its wrong-headed policies, policies which are about high inflation, not low inflation; about no growth, not growth; about no employment, not strong employment growth of the kind that we are talking about. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, out of his own mouth, has condemned his own proposition by relying on Treasury documents which were a criticism of his proposals, not ours. This debate has been Ii bit of a joke in the sense that it has been all about what a Labor senator, a former Minister, has' had to say about some of his own obsessions, gathered up over the years, from which he has never been able to relent. But he has more contemMorris, P. F. porary views, particularly about the OpNewell, N. 1. position. I just remind the Opposition what Punch, G. F. Senator Walsh had to say. The Prime Minister Scholes, G. G. D. quoted him. He. said that he has always Scott,1. L. opposed the idea of a GST type tax. He Snow, J. H. opposes it now, at the very least because its Staples, P. R. transition costs. are high and because of the Tickner, R. E. consequences for a big boost to the the way in which the Opposition would deal. with that, by producing a credit squeeze and, Aldred, K. 1. therefote,a long term recession in this Andrew, J.

235,Mr TICKNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I thank the House. These historic documents include three volumes of detailed responses by Commonwealth, State Mr and Territory governments to each of the the Royal Commission's 339 recommendations. that, They include an overview supported by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers on behalf of their respective governments and a report, entitled The First Step, of initial consultations, carried out through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, ATSIC, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait as to Islander people across Australia. On 9 May last year, I tabled the final report . of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal in Custody. I indicated then that it was one of the most significant Australian social documents of our time. The report painted a picture of the lives and the deaths of 99 Aboriginal people and in so doing it showed us something of the harshness and that characterise daily life for so many of the first Australians. On the occasion of tabling the Royal Commission report, I spoke of the Royal Commission findings about the lives of those who had in custody. These statistics provide a graphic insight into the lives of Aboriginal people and should be again placed on the public record. Of the 99 who died between 1 that January 1980 and 31 May 1989: 88 were men and 11 were women; Their approximate average age at death was 32; 83 were unemployed at the date of their last detention; 43 had experienced childhood separation from their natural families through intervention by State authorities, missions or other institutions; ) Only 2 of the 99 had completed secondary , schooling; 43 had been charged with an offence at or before age 15; 43 were taken into custody in the period immediately before their deaths on matters directly related to the over-use of alcohol. The Royal Commission concluded that in the remaining cases alcohol was a contributing factor in their being taken into custody for the last time; The standard of health of the 99 varied from poor to very bad, with the average age of those dying from natural causes being a little over 30 years; and 63 of the d-aths occurred in police custody, 33 in prison custody and 3 in juvenile detention facilities. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are over-represented in custody at a ratecalculated nationally-of 29 times that of the general community. In some States the rate is considerably higher and has escalated during the very time of the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission found this grossly unacceptable, as does every fair-minded Australian and I believe every political party represented in this Parliament. If non-Aboriginal people had been imprisoned at the same rate over the period of the Royal Commission and then died in custody at the same rate, over 8,500 non-Aboriginal people would have died. This comparison' gives some idea of the enonnity of the tragedy of wasted young Aboriginal lives. Further, the Royal Commission found the most significant factor in this deeply disturbing over-representation was the 'disadvantaged and unequal position' of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in all aspects of Australian society-social and economic. These conclusions impel governments to act to redress the disadvantage that is the fundamental cause of Aboriginal deaths in custody. I would now like to say something to those most immediately affected-the families, relatives and friends of those who died in custody. I know that many of those people still feel grief, anger and irreparable loss. I understand their anguish that the Royal Commission did not find any death to be the result of deliberate unlawful violence or brutality. I know that for them this finding is difficult to accept. It may be of little comfort to them to read that the Royal Commission found that in many cases death was contributed to by systems failures or absence of due care. The Royal Commission, however, made a finding of much deeper significance. Those who died were not victims of isolated acts of violence or brutality. Rather, they were victims of entrenched and institutionalised racism and discrimination. Their deaths were the tragic consequence of two centuries of dispossession, dispersal and appalling disadvantage. That is an unpalatable finding, but one which must be tackled head on. There is a moral and political obligation on those in positions of political leadership, to bring about genuine, lasting change in the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We must work so that the injustices documented by the Royal Commission become truly a thing of the past. I hope that every member of this Parliament supports the role of .he Commonwealth in providing' national leadership on this issue. The unanimous parliamentary support for the reconciliation process must now be further translated into ongoing action to give effect to the Royal Commission recommendations. The Australian Government is proud to announce support for 338 of the 339 Royal Commission recommendations and will fund specific first stage initiatives which I will announce today. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has foreshadowed, the Government will make a second major announcement responding to the underlying issues highlighted by the Royal Commission within three months of today's tabling and I will later indicate the thrust of this response . Since the Royal Commission investigated the lives and deaths of those 99 men and women, 25 more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians have died in custody. We also owe it to them to make a just, effective and sustained response to the report of the Royal Commission. Aboriginal people and the wider Australian community are looking to all governments to ensure that we do not waste the historic opportunity presented by the Royal Commission report to deliver justice to Aboriginal people. As a result of this increase in' public concern, governments around Australia have recognised the importance of working together on a national response to this unique national investigation. Each government designated a Minister to coordinate its response. These Ministers met as a joint ministerial forum and a Commonwealth-StateTerritory working group of senior officials met regularly. All mainland States and Territories have participated in the response by governments that I have tabled today. Following the recent election in Tasmania, that State Government has undertaken to examine its position as expeditiously as possible and no doubt its response will be the focus of considerable attention. The responses to the 339 recommendations contained in the documents I have tabled are not confined to the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, nor were they ever intended to be so. The Royal Commission's recommendations involve an enormous range of Commonwealth, State and Territory responsibilities. Each Government has responded on a whole of government basis. At a time of change in the relationship between Commonwealth, State and Territory governments, the cooperation that has led to this response is an achievement of governments not to be dismissed even by the more cynical of public commentators. It is an achievement for the nation. Even more significant has been the involvement in this process of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, through nationwide consultations organised by ATSIC, and through the negotiation of the Commonwealth's response with the elected representatives of Aboriginal an- Torres Strait Islander people, ATSIC's Board of Commissioners, whom you, Mr Speaker, have so graciously acknowledged as being in the public gallery today. We now have a coherent and comprehensive statement of government policy arising directly from negotiation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves. At the Commonwealth level, the ATSIC Board of Commissioners approved all 339 of the Commonwealth responses following those nationwide consultations before they were approved by the Federal Cabinet. I am sure all members of the House will agree that this is a landmark in relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia. I thank the many members, from both sides of the House, who have come to witness the tabling of this report. The Government is committed to this process of negotiation and consultation in the development and delivery of all Commonwealth policies and programs in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. This approach to our nation's relations with indigenous people underpins the process of reconciliation which was recognised by the Royal Commission as 'the fundamental backdrop to reform and change in Aboriginal affairs'. As part of that process the Government has sought an ongoing national commitment to address Aboriginal disadvantage. As I have said, this is the key to reversing the over-representation of Aboriginal people in custody. Just as the Royal Commission was established by the Commonwealth Government and the States and the Northern Territory with the support of the Federal Opposition, which I willingly acknowledge, and as the direct result of concern by Aboriginal and nonAboriginal people, so too the response by governments transcends boundaries of jurisdiction and political parties. The Royal Commission's report is of major significance for Australia's international human rights record. Internationally, Australia's human rights record is, I am proud to say, an open book. We are determined to maintain our commitment to ensuring the highest standards in our observance of human rights in Australia. Australia's accession to the first optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights IS a very real demonstration of that commitment, as it provides an international right of appeal for all Australians on human rights issues. The United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations, the Human Rights Commission and the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination are some of the international bodies vitally interested in the responses of Australian governments to the report. Amnesty International and other international nongovernment organisations will monitor the implementation of the Royal Commission's recommendations. The declaration of 1993 as the International Year of the World's Indigenous Peoples also puts a spotlight on responses by governments to the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission confirmed that the principles of empowerment and self-determination are fundamental to change for Aboriginal people. The Royal Commission described the 'pinpricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference' that confronts Aboriginal people every day of their lives. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aspire to control their lives and communities, in the same way that other Australians expect to control their lives and communities. It is for this reason that the Commonwealth seeks to ensure that to the greatest extent possible, and consistent with recommendation 192 of the Royal Commission, funding initiatives to respond to the Commission are directed towards Aboriginal community controlled organisations. This approach is supported by all States and Territories in their responses to the 'Royal Commission. Such is the complex and comprehensive nature of the Royal Commission's report that the Government has decided on a two-stage approach to its response, which I have already referred to. I now tum to the detail of the stage of that response. The fact that responsibility for implementing the Royal Commission's detailed proposals for coronia I, justice, police and custody reform lies largely with State and Territory governments does not mean that the Commonwealth will abdicate its very significant responsibilities in this very important area. Indeed, as I will outline, we intend to act on the basis of the Commonwealth's commitment to the national interest and our clear direct responsibilities for human rights, the Australian Federal Police and the provision of legal assistance. The Commonwealth will also work to ensure essential Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander involvement in criminal justice issues, operations and reform. An examination of the detailed documents· I have tabled will show overwhelming support by all goV'ernments for the law and justice reforms recommended by the Royal Commission. I believe all governments want to turn that support into action. To facilitate this objective the Commonwealth will take a key role in the critical area of Aboriginal-police relations and will give further support to the initiatives already under way in the States and Territories. Before I tum to the details of the Commonwealth's response on this issue, I want to make it clear that Governments are not singling out police for special criticism. As I said on the occasion of the tabling of the Royal Commission report 10 months ago, that report was not some police-bashing exercise. The truth is that the police, like the rest of the community, have a range of attitudes and opinions. It is true that many non-Aboriginal Australians have a stereotyped view of Aboriginal people, values and culture. It is also true that Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians are already working together to bust these baseless stereotypes and to improve community relations. Commonwealth, State and Territory governments intend to build on the valuable work already being done and to strive for a change in attitudes. We will also continue to insist on the highest operating standards for police and custody systems. Society will not and cannot first tolerate anything less. The Commonwealth will set in train action to improve the operation of the courts, police and custody systems and to provide better legal services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Commonwealth is prepared to allocate $5m to the States and Territories to develop and enhance Aboriginal employment strategies in police services, custodial and court systems; the further training of police in awareness of Aboriginal history, culture and disadvantage; and to assist in implementing the recommendations of the Royal Commission directed to improving Aboriginal-police relations. These resources will be allocated following consultation with State and Territory governments. There is now an agreed national agenda for reform and improvement in Aboriginal-police relations following the unanimous support of Commonwealth, State and Territory governments for the practical proposals for reform proposed by the Royal Commission in this area. We will work with the States, the Territories and the legal profession to develop a cultural awareness program for judges, magistrates and court officers and staff. We will support and fund a national conference, involving Aboriginal community leaders and police, on Aboriginal-police relations. One of the strong recommendations of the Royal Commission was that jurisdictions would greatly benefit from the exchange of experiences. We will also act in our own jurisdiction. We will ensure that the Australian Federal Police will introduce new procedures and initiatives to give effect to the recommenAboriginal dations of the Royal Commission. We will provide $50.4m over five through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission for additional support to Aboriginal Legal Services to carry out their crucial responsibilities arising from recommendations of the Royal Commission. ATSIC will invite Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to establish supervised youth bail hostels as an alternative to police custody, to reduce the incidence of young people being taken into custody and provide scope for counselling and for consNorthern tructive education, training and rehabilitation activity. Funding for this innovative program totals nearly $7m over a five-year period. Consultations will be held with State Territory governments on the most effective lo-ation and operation of these hostels. We will substantially strengthen the capacity of the Human Rights and Equal small Opportunity Commission to inform Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities about human rights issues and legislation. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Comrole mission will also work with the National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Services Secretariat to develop an accredited national Aboriginal Legal Service field officer training course. These initiatives involve $1.97m over five years. We will continue initiatives ready announced in the 1991-92 Budget. These include: mechanisms for the handling of complaints by Australians under the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; better interpreter services for Aboriginal people in Commonwealth courts; developing options for Commonwealth racial vilification legislation; and improved cultural awareness training for the Australian Federal Police. I again remind honourable members that 43 of the 99 people whose deaths the Royal Commission investigated were separated, as children, from their families through intervention by State authorities, missions or other institutions, as were thousands of other children-until the late 1960s. It is difficult to think of a more damaging experience in the life of a child than to be years separated from his or her family. Through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission we will provide funding of $1.9m over five years to enhance the capacity of Link Up services to address unmet demands by Aboriginal and Torres Strait . Islander people for assistance in locating and reuniting with their families. The new funding will establish Link Up to services in each of the States and the Territory. Their work will be greatly assisted by the commitment of State and Territory governments to allow access to records to assist Aboriginal people to .be and reunited with their families. If I can be permitted one partisan note in this speech, I say that I cannot think of one other initiative-although in some ways it is in nature-that goes to the very heart of the commitment of my Party to principles of social justice. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute, in a very forthright way, to the played by the Prime Minister since he has assumed that high office, in giving support to me in bringing forward this national response to the Royal Commission today. The Royal Commission found that alcohol was a factor in the final detention of all of the al99 who died in custody. It is a major factor in family and community breakdown, domestic violence and unacceptably high incarceration rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Commonwealth will act now to support the efforts of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves to defeat the devastation caused by alcohol and substance abuse. Through ATSIC and in cooperation with the States and Territories we will provide resources for innovative, community-based action to prevent and counter alcohol and substance abuse, especially by young people. Locally initiated and controlled programs will strike at the powerlessness that is at the root of the tragedy being experienced by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. More than $70m over five years will be provided for this purpose. These funds will be for specific initiatives which are designed to encourage and support the development of culturally appropriate and community driven solutions to problems resulting from alcohol and substance abuse through: programs which empower Aboriginal people to address their substance abuse problems; an accessible setting in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women, especially the young, with substance abuse problems can receive treatment, rehabilitation and after-care; a capacity to provide trained staff to Aboriginal Health Services and substance abuse organisations which will allow early intervention therapy for clients with substance abuse related problems; and community based training for substance abuse workers. A good illustration of the determination of Aboriginal people to tackle this major social issue is the Central Australian grog strategy developed by Aboriginal people themselves and which draws on models of treatment developed by Canadian Indians. Accurate data is essential for monitoring progress. The Commonwealth, through the Australian Bureau of Statistics, will carry out for the time a national survey of Aboriginal people. The survey will complement information from the census and from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing needs and infrastructure survey and provide a much improved basis for policy and program decisions by governments and by Aboriginal organisations themselves. In cooperation with the States and Territories, we will also support the continuation of data collection and analysis of deaths in custody by the Australian Institute of Criminology. The total cost of this first package of additional funding measures to tackle the immediate causes of deaths in custody is $15Om over a five year period. The fact that three-quarters of this funding will be channelled to community controlled Aboriginal organisations through ATSIC is testimony to the Government's commitment to ATSIC as the vehicle for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander empowerment and self determination. As I said earlier, Mr Speaker, the Royal Commission found that the fundamental cause of the over-representation of Aboriginal people in custody is their unequal and disadvantaged place in Australian life. This is the second level at which deaths in custody must be tackled. It is not good enough to simply change only law practice and criminal justice areas. We must also make a real attack on the economic and social disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Governments agree that the Royal Commission's recommendations constitute a charter for action in Aboriginal affairs for years to come. It is the Commonwealth's intention, following further negotiations with the States and Territories and further discussion with ATSIC, to announce substantial program initiatives in areas such as education, youth issues, employment and economic development in a second major statement within three months. This second package will have a strong focus on economic development, self-reliance and self-sufficiency in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities through measures which will produce sustained improvement in first economic and social well-being. It should be stressed that if, as a result of these and other measures, the rate of imprisonment of Aboriginal people can be reduced to the rate of non-Aboriginal imprisonment, in addition to saving human lives, there will be a saving to governments around this country of $80m per annum based on the current costs of maintaining a person in prison. It is an extraordinary statistic. This second major initiative will require further intergovernmental cooperation. The Commonwealth has already given a commitment to high level and urgent discussions with State and Territory governments on the need for a national response to the underlying issues. To give effect to this commitment a Commonwealth delegation, led by officials of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, will initiate discussions on these issues over the coming weeks. Because of the importance of this second stage of the National.Response to the Royal Commission and the necessity for cooperative government action, the Commonwealth believes that the underlying issues identified by the Royal Commission ought to be the subject of discussion at the forthcoming meeting of Heads of Government, as the Prime Minister foreshadowed some weeks ago. As the Prime Minister also said-and I think this is put on the record with deep viction-history will judge all governments on their reSponse to the Royal Commission. At the Commonwealth level, we will be proposing, again following close consultation with the ATSIC Board of Commissioners, a carefully targeted, cost-effective approach drawing on the outcome of consultations conducted by ATSIC with Aboriginal people across the country. The report of the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council on· Achieving Greater Coordination of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Programs and Services is a basis for further intergovernmental cooperation in redressing Aboriginal disadvantage. I reaffIrm the Commonwealth's aim to continue to work within this agreed framework, although I acknowledge that it will take time for detailed arrangements to be put in place, again following extensive consultation and support by Aboriginal people for the initiative. Mr Speaker, the documents I have tabled show that governments have overwhelmingly supported the recommendations of the Royal Commission .. Governmenu: must be held to the undertakings detailed in their responses. This necessarily involves the creation of mechanisms for monitoring implementation. The Royal Commission emphasised effective monitoring arrangements. Indeed, they are the subject of its very first recommendation. The Commonwealth will fund ATSIC to carry out this . monitoring role, in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and to coordinate Commonwealth monitoring arrangements and consultation with State and Territory governments. From the moment this report was tabled, I have been determined to ensure the most open and comprehensive reporting of progress in implementing the Royal Commission's recommendations. I am also committed to involving this Parliament in that process. I am therefore pleased to announce that, at the Commonwealth level, there will be an annual consolidated report to parliament on. the implementation of the Government's undertakings given in response to the Royal Commission recommendations. ATSIC will be asked to give an account of con- the extent to whick all Commonwealth agencies are meeting their obligations to give effect to Commonwealth support for the recommendations of the Royal Commission. I understand that the States and Territories intend to· make similar arrangements. Crosstabling arrangements in Commonwealth, State and Territory parliaments will ensure the greatest public access to this valuable information. If the House of Representatives Standing Committee 011. Aboriginal Affairs supports the initiative, and the Parliament supports it, it will be my hope that that report could be referred to the p-liamentary Committee on an annual basis. The Commonwealth will work with States and Territories to ensure that all relevant ministerial and senior officials' forums will give ongoing consideration to the progress of implementation of all Royal Commission recommendations falling within their spheres of interest, maintaining the commitment to the whole of government approach to the Royal Co-ission report. ATSIC's role will be complemented by an annual state of the nation report on the human rights situation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to be prepared by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Unit headed by a commissioner will be established within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to undertake that task. This annual state of the nation report assumes further importance because of the unanimous endorsement by the Commonwealth Parliament of the preamble of the legislation to establish the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation as an essential element in the reconciliation process. The preamble makes the following commitment: As a part of the reconciliation process, the Commonwealth will seek an ongoing national commitment from Governments at all levels to cooperate and to ;coordinate with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as appropriate to address progressively Aboriginal disadvantage and aspirations in relation to land, housing, law and Justice, cultural heritage, education, employment, health, infrastructure, economic development and any other relevant matters in the decade leading the centenary of Federation, 2001. The monitoring mechanism and data collection processes established in response to the Royal Coqunission will be of crucial importance in the preparation of the state of the nation report and will be supplemented by the extensive ffiformation already available to the Human - ghts and Equal Opportunity Commission. By providing the annual state of the nation report on Aboriginal social justice, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be. acting as a watchdog over the nation in its achievement of the social justice objective of the process of reconciliation over the coming nine years leading to the centenary of Federation. I turn to the Royal Commission's support for the reconciliation process which it described as 'the fundamental backdrop to reform and change' and for this. reason wish to speak about the objectives of the reconciliation process and its integral relationship to government action to give effect to the Royal Commission response. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation chaired by Mr Patrick Dodson, former Royal Commissioner, was appointed in 1991, following consultation and agreement with the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and the Board of Commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. The Council will drive the process of reconciliation at the national level, backed by local and community based initiatives across the country. It will develop. strategies for the reconciliation process, and will use the information in the annual state of the nation report of the Human.Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on Aboriginal human rights and social justice, as part of its obligation to foster an ongoing national commitment to rydress Aboriginal disadvantage. In their responses to the Royal Commission all State and Territory governments have given their support to the process of reconciliation and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will be seeking to initiate their active participation in this process over the coming months. In addition to the social justice objective I have already referred to, the process of to reconciliation has two other important objectives which seek to keep faith absolutely with Aboriginal aspirations. First, the process seeks to promote an understanding - y all Australians of the history, cultures, past dispossession and continuing disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and of the need ,to redress that disadvantagy. Second, as a part of the reconciliation process the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will consult with Aboriginal people and the wider community on whether the process of reconciliation would be advanced by a formal document or documents and to make recommendations on the nature and content of any such document. The Council has emphasised that this consultation process must not be rushed and that there are many important issues to be worked through with both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. While the name of any document has yet to be determined there are far more complex and substantive issues to be addressed. The results of recent public opinion polls show that a very large majority of Australians support a document as one of the outcomes of the reconciliation process. The unanimous support of the Commonwealth Parliament for the process and now the support of State and Territory governments gives us time, as someone else said in December, to address these important public policy issues for our nation. I conclude this statement by expressing the Government's and my own personal gratitude to the Chairperson of ATSIC, Miss Lois O'Donoghue, CBE, AM, and to the commissioners for their untiring efforts. All commissioners-and they are present today in the gallery-were involved in the community consultations and the negotiations which have shaped the Commonwealth's response.' The fact that the Chairperson with commisimportance sioners Alf Bamblett and Steve Gordon I discussion, namely: addressed the Cabinet before Ministers considered the submission on the Government's statement response-Aboriginal people speaking their minds to the highest decision-making body the Government-was of great symbolic importance for this country. It, reflected the seriousness of both the challenge and the task the Government and ATSIC face together. I cannot at this point do better than quote Commissioner Johnston in the national report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody: In the end, and perhaps together, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, the situation can be reached where this ancient, subtly creative Aboriginal culture exists in friendship alongside the non-Aboriginal culture. Such an achievement would be a matter of pride not only for all Australians but for all humankind. The families of those who have died, and indeed all Australians, have the right to expect that governments at all levels and of all political persuasions will act together to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission. We must not be allowed to fail. Mr Speaker, I reaffirm, this Government's commitment to fulfil the undertakings set out in these documents and commend them to the House. I present the following paper: Aboriginal Deaths in Custody-Ministerial Statement, 31 March 1992. ' Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the papers; Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Chisholm speaking for a period not exceeding 38 minutes when the debate is resumed.

238,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the first, second and third reports of the Committee for 1992, relating to the following proposed works: CSIRO Development, North Ryde, New South Wales; Construction of New Permanent Repository for Australian Archives, East Burwood, Victoria; Installation of Fire Sprinklers to the International Terminal Building, Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, New South Wales Ordered that the reports be printed.",49
239,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"by leave- Mr Deputy Speaker, the first report I have just tabled relates to the proposed redevelopment by the CSIRO of its facilities at North Ryde, New South Wales. The main elements of the proposal are: a rationalisation and consolidation of the CSIRO accommodation at North Ryde; a progressive release of approximately 15.8 hectares of identified surplus land and up to 11 development lots to create a science and technology park; the retention of principal CSIRO buildings in good condition; and the provision for all of CSIRO's anticipated accommodation needs for the foreseeable future in existing buildings, upgraded as necessary, and state-of-the-art new buildings. The estimated out-turn cost of the work is $98m, to be funded from the sale and/or lease of surplus land at North Ryde. The Committee found that the standard of facilities at North Ryde restricts the conworking tinuing development of industrially significant research initiatives with a high national priority for the biotechnology, mining and minerals, energy exploration and food inoverriding dustries as well as work of major environmenthat tal significance. Each of the divisions at North Ryde plays a major role in providing research vital to its industry sector. These sectors represent major components of the Australian economy and include: coal, with exports of billion; minerals, with exports of $16 billion; manufactured goods, with exports of $17 billion; and pharmaceutical and diagnostic products, currently imported at a cost of billion. In recommending that the proposal proceed, the Committee has concluded that the development of a prestige science and techRiverina nology park by the CSIRO at North Ryde the most cost effective method available to of providing the funds necessary for the development of high quality research mended facilities. As the proposal has been referred a very advanced conceptual stage, the Comadjacent mittee has recommended that CSIRO provide it with detailed plans of each aspect of the - picr to the 00Il1Il1eIXr0le of CXJl<lII'octioo The Committee is also satisfied, following assurances from CSIRO, that adequate provision has been made for additional expansion of facilities at North Ryde should this be necessary in the future, and that the redevelopment strategy developed by CSIRO is realistic in current market conditions. Mr Deputy Speaker, there is one aspect of the proposal which the Committee believes should not remain at North Ryde but should be relocated to the Riverina region of New South Wales. I refer to the food research laboratory of the Division of Food Processing. The Committee believes that the food research laboratory can operate efficiently from the Riverina. region as it has good transport links and an existing scientific base on which CSIRO could build. At the same time it would provide a stimulus to the scientific and industrial sectors in an important food growing and processing area. The Committee strongly disagrees with the party set up to examine the future structure of the Division of Food Processing which rejected non-capital locations, with the professional needs of scientists being an criteria. The Committee believes CSIRO should be taking a national view when it examines such issues. In this situation it has a perfect opportunity to assist regional development, allow closer interaction with both food producers and. processors and $6 ·provide opportunities for contact with other scientists working in these industries. Having considered the evidence presented $3 by CSIRO and from the Riverina region, and taking into account the views of the sectional committee which visited the area, the Committee has recommended that the food research laboratory be transferred to the region and that the Minister for is Science and Technology (Mr Free) do all it within his power to ensure that that transfer takes place. The Committee has not recoma particular site, although the secat tional committee did inspect a number of sites to the Charles Sturt University at Wagga Wagga. The Committee believes that the question of a particular site should be a matter for discussion between the CSIRO and the relevant authorities in the Riverina region. The second report which I have tabled deals with the proposed construction of a new permanent repository for the Australian Archives at East Burwood, Victoria. This new building will provide up-to-date, climate controlled storage facilities for pennanent value Commonwealth records in the custody of Archives in Victoria. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $6.5m at October 1991 prices. The Committee has recommended the construction of the proposed repository. At present, pennanent value Commonwealth records are stored in a former dry-cleaning factory in the suburb of Brighton. The Committee concluded, after inspecting the Brighton repository, that, if pennanent value Commonwealth records remain stored there, many irreplaceable records will be lost. In fact, some have already been lost and others severely damaged. There is, therefore, an urgent need for Archives to be provided with a modem facility in which to store pennanent value records in Victoria. Constructing a new repository at the existing site was considered impractical. After an exhaustive site selection process for a new site, Archives settled on a site at East Burwood for the new repository. The site is eminently suited, being in a designated technology park and not excessively distant from Melbourne's central business district. A larger site could have been purchased but more distant from the main users of archival materials. The building itself will provide office accommodation, an area for conservation and a large storage area. The storage area will be on three levels. It will have a curved roof to accelerate water run off, an essential. requirement for buildings of this type. Although the design is somewhat austere, it nevertheless reflects a need for functionality and a need for the building to be constructed of materials reflecting some cost-consciousness. The Committee questioned Archives about the ability of the building to be expanded. Archives advised the Committee that once all permanent value records are transferred to the new building, the building will have adequate capacity for another 10 to 12 years growth. If by then there is a need to expand further, the site is large enough for extensions to the building to be provided. These extensions will provide additional storage area for another 10 to 12 years. The building will be provided with a number of special features, including strengthened floors, special air-conditioning and fire protection measures. The need for these features was justified. One thing I would like to mention in conclusion is that the Committee questioned - chives about its involvement in the centenary of Federation. As honourable members will know, Archives is the custodian of an extensive collection of papers relating to Federation. Archives advised the Committee that it will be looking to increasing publicity about its activities and holdings of material relating to Federation which are in its custody. I am sure all honourable members will join me in supporting this nationally important endeavour. The third report I have tabled relates to the installation of fire sprinklers at the international tenninal building at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. I should say at the outset that during its investigations the Committee took the view that this project should be examined on its merits and in isolation from issues relating to the third runway at Sydney Airport. Construction of the third runway was exempted from the scrutiny of the Committee, on the grounds of urgency, by the House on 14 November 1991-and we had something to say about that. The international tenninal building was opened in 1970 and met all the then relevant codes. Airport tenninal buildings are not expressly covered by codes, but they need to have adequate protection. A number of fire hazard reports have recommended the installation of fire sprinklers to provide safety for the occupants of the building and to protect the property. Other improvements to provide smoke isolation, an emergency evacuation system and additional fire exits wererecommended. Since the Federal Airports Corporation assumed responsibility for Sydney Airport on 1 January 1988, additional fire exits have been constructed as part of a project which entailed a number of improvements to the international terminal building. These were completed in 1989. Smoke isolation measures have been substantially completed on existing stairwells and escalators. The Federal Airports Corporation has installed fire sprinklers in the international terminal complex at Sydney Airport, which is scheduled for commissioning in 1992. The design of this building was based on the assumption that the international terminal building would be upgraded by the provision of a sprinkler system so that a fire originating in the international terminal building would be contained within that building. The provision of a fire sprinkler system has been evaluated by the FAC as being necessary for the protection of the occupl\,nts and the building and to achieve Building Code of Australia compliance. The building is vast, and firefighting after detection has been evaluated as very difficult. While the Committee has recommended that the work proceed, there are a number of issues in the report on which I should comment. The continued absence of a master plan for Sydney Airport is a matter of serious concern. In fact, in 1988, in reporting on the construction of the international terminal complex, the Committee recommended that the ·FAC prepare a master plan as expeditiously as possible to ensure the overall orderly development and operation of the airport. While the FAC has appointed a consultant to finalise the master plan, the Committee has recommended that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins) direct the FAC to complete the master plan as a matter of extreme urgency. I should add that, in the absence of a master plan, the Committee is loath to recommend further work at Sydney Airport. In fact, it is my personal view that the Committee should not recommend any further work at Sydney Airport until a master plan is completed. However, as this project concerns an issue of public safety, the Committee has no option but to agree to the work proceeding. The Committee is concerned about the cost of the project-$14.6m-and has recommended that the FAC review all aspects of the proposal in order to determine areas of possible cost savings. In relation to cost, the Committee has also recommended that the FAC commission a fire safety study to determine whether savings can be made in the provision of fire sprinklers. Evidence was given to the Committee which indicated that savings may be possible by limiting sprinklers to areas where they are required for life safety reasons or as cost-effective fire protection. I thank the House.",50
240,Mr HAWKER,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"by leave-In speaking to this motion concerning the installation· of fire sprinklers in the international terminal building at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, I would like, first of all, to commend the Joint Committee on Public Works for its diligence. It is obvious that it has been very thorough in looking at this matter. I am very concerned, however, about some of the comments of the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). In particular, he mentioned that there is evidence that savings are to be made with the installation of these sprinklers, It seems that there are moves afoot to spend some $15m to upgrade the sprinkler system in the existing terminal. The Committee has now come forward with a recommendation that the work proceed, but has then added the caveat that there is evidence of some savings to be made. I feel that this is a matter of some concern and, frankly, it is a matter to which the Government ought to be made to respond and on which it should explain why those savings are not being examined further. I would like to follow up on a couple of other points from the report. One involves the question of disability allowances which may be sought while these sprinklers are being ins taIled. I understand that one of the unions involved is seeking a disability allowance of some $50 a day. Again, this raises a lot of questions, such as: who would be bearing the cost? Is $50 disability allowance a day a reasonable claim? I think we should have some answers. Who will have to pay it? Will it be the Australian Customs Service or the Federal Airports Corporation? I think that before the work is to proceed, not after it has commenced, we should receive some answers to these questions. After all, I think all honourable members have vivid memories of what happened with the construction of this Parliament House and how there were some enonnous blow-outs in costs because some of the unions involved used their muscle during the construction to exploit the situation to their benefit. In fact, many honourable members would recall that the Federal coalition parties highlighted in their rorts report some· worse extremes that went on during the construction of this place. It really was little short of a national scandal. I also note the point that the Chainnall made about the need for a master plan Mascot Airport. It seems extraordinary that despite the fact that the Federal Airports Corporation did promise this as long ago 1988-some four years ago-we still have seen it done. I think the Committee is to commended for having emphasised this point. The fact that the Chairman has had to he believes it is a matter of 'extreme urgency' that such a master plan be developed, highlights the fact that insufficient supervision being given to this whole matter by this current Government. I believe if the Government continues to ignore that recomthe mendation by the Committee, then further questions should be raised. Obviously, this is a very important facility. We have a massive investment there. The Government's record to date has been one of some considerable embarrassment, not only the Government but also to the nation, in way the argument about the third runway has gone on and on-bearing in mind that the decision was taken as early as 1982 to that third runway, but even today we still have not seen it built. I wonder whether question of the master plan might be facing a similar delay. Really, when one thinks about it, there are very large sums of money involved here. If there is no master plan it is hard to believe that every decision taken will necessarily be in the long tenn interests of improving that facility. For that reason and for many others, it should be, as the Chairinan has pointed out, a matter of urgency; it should have been done some years ago and, clearly, the FAC should be brought to task over it and made to respond by putting together a master plan thoroughly, responsibly and in a professional manner. I commend the Committee again. With those questions, to which I trust we will receive some responses in due course, I leave own financial my remarks there.",52
241,Mr FIFE,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"by leave-At the outset, I wish to of the acknowledge my strong support for the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Public Works for the relocation of the food research laboratory to the Riverina region. The Committee Chainnan, the honourable for member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), accompanied by.the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gonnan), the honourable member as for Grey (Mr O'Neil), and the Secretary, Mr not Peter Roberts, visited Wagga Wagga in be January as part of the Committee's inquiry into the redevelopment of the CSIRO facilities say that at North Ryde in New South Wales. I take this opportunity to thank the Chair. man and the other members of the Committee is not only for their courtesy while they were in the Wagga Wagga area but also for the very thorough manner in which they investigated matter and the consideration they gave to the representations. Obviously, I would like to congratulate them on their findings. As part of that overall redevelopment, the proposal was put forward that the CSIRO's food research laboratory might be relocated, to to its advantage, in a rural area. With the the support of the Wagga Wagga City Council, the Riverina Regional Development Board has been central to the bid to have the CSIRO build division relocated in Wagga Wagga or another Riverina centre. However, it was this considered that Wagga Wagga would be the most appropriate because of a site being available adjacent to the Charles Sturt University-Riverina campus. Other factors in favour of Wagga Wagga are that it is the centre of one of Australia's richest agricultural areas and has a significantfood processing industry. While in Wagga Wagga, the Committee took time to visit the university, where discussions took place with the pean of the Faculty of Science and Agriculture, Professor Jim Pratley. The Committee also inspected the possible site for the Division of Food Processing as well as calling at the nearby Wagga Agriculture Research Institute. It also inspected the operations of Murrumbidgee Dairy Products together with the Murrumbidgee Flour Mill, which is a division of the Goodman Fielder group. There were also discussions with the Mayor of Wagga Wagga, Alderman Pat Brassil, and with representatives of the Riverina Regional Development Board. It was a comprehensive coverage and, as reported at the time, the Committee members were impressed with what Wagga Wagga had to offer. They saw distinct advantages in the city as an agricultural centre as well as having Charles Sturt University, the Agriculture Research Institute and viable food processing industries. The proximity of the Horticultural Research Centre and the CSIRO Water Resources Division at Griffith was another advantage. It is my view that the relocation of the CSIRO's Food Processing Division to a region with a strong agricultural industry makes sense because it offers real benefits to both the industry and the CSIRO. Such a move would strengthen the area's existing agricultural enterprises, provide for expansion and assist economic diversification. A major consideration in favour of the Riverina proposal for the siting of the division is the substantial cost savings with the initial design and construction as well as ongoing savings compared with other options. Construction times will also be considerably reduced. Another factor that needs to be taken into consideration by the Government and the CSIRO is that Wagga Wagga is ideally located in the centre of the Murray-Darling basin food bowl, Some 125 processing companies are currently in operation in the Riverina area, and there is a developing trend for metropolitan plants to relocate to rural food growing centres. Most large metropolitan companies are multinational with overseas ownership, and there is a need to strengthen support for new Australian owned rural based companies in the national interest. Communications with Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne universities and research centres are easily provided from Wagga Wagga. Experience at Charles Sturt University and other organisations indicated that the Wagga Wagga environment was 'Very attractive to professional staff. The city also provided good opportunities for employment, education and sporting and other social activities for staff and families. The Minister has indicated that the decision on relocation will be made by the CSIRO Board and that he will have no say in it. I understand and I accept that bodies, particularly those that have statutory responsibilities, should, as far as practicable, be left to manage the instrumentalities for which they have been given responsibility, but I agree with th- Committee and with what the Chairman of the Committee has said in this House this afternoon, that the Minister should do all within his power to ensure that the recommendation of the Committee to relocate the food research laboratory to the Riverina region is approved. It is also desirable that boards are made aware of owners' policies and objectives,and that is where the Minister comes in. That is what the Committee obviously had in mind when it said that the Minister should do all within his power to ensure that this recommendation is approved. The Minister must make sure that the policies and objectives of the owner-in this case, the Australian Government-are well known to the board. In this instance, I would have thought it perfectly reasonable for the Government to convey a view to the CSIRO Board that, provided there are no significant financial or operational disadvantages to the CSIRO, it should relocate its food research laboratory in an appropriate rural region. If the Government does not make such an assessment and advises the CSIRO of its view, then it must accept that it will be seen to be negligent in the discharge of its responsibilities to the taxpayers. Again, to borrow a phrase from the speech of the Chairman of the Committee, the Government itself should insist that the CSIRO take a national view. I have no doubt that the best long term benefits for the CSIRO would be achieved by relocating the Food Processing Division in the ,Wagga Wagga area. I conClude by reiterating my support for recommendation' of the Committee. I again thank the members of the Committee for their consideration of the representations and submissions that· were made' by people from Wagga Wagga, Griffith and other parts of the Riverina. Mr mCKS (Riverina-Darling)-by leave I wish to second the remarks of the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) and congratulate him on the part he played in putting information before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works when it went down to the Riverina. I think most of what should be said has been said by the honourable member for Hume, except that I do not know whether all members of this Parliament know this-the area being considered in the Riverina is probably one of the most prolific food producing areas in Australia, taking in the area around Wagga Wagga, up through Leeton, Griffith and Narrandera, and including the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area and the Coleambally Irrigation Area. I think those irrigation areas grow . everything except tropical fruits. One can see what a tremendous food bowl that is. There are a number of food processing plants in the atea, particularly in Wagga Wagga and out towards the MIA and the CIA, and I think it would be a natural move for the Division of Food Processing at North Ryde to move into the Riverina region. The Charles Sturt University would ensure that there could be scientific assistance for the CSIRO in that area. Earlier this week the Federal Government announced that the natural gas pipeline would be extended into the Riverina region through Leeton; Griffith and Narrandera, and of course that will have a further effect on the food processing industryin those areas. As members of this Parliament we think we know our areas but I was surprised, as, I imagine, was ,the honourable member for Hume, at what we saw. When a parliamentary committee comes into our areas and we start to look around, we are astounded at the entrepreneurial skills of the people in our areas as well as the number of qrganisations that are getting started but w-ich need some the extra impetus to get them gomg. Of course, the natural gas in my area will do that. As did the honourable member for Hume, I would like to congratulate those representatives of the various city councils, the shire presidents, the mayors and also the Riverina Regional Development Board on the work they have done. Like the honourable member for Hume, I would like to say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  he could do no better than to resettle this Division of Food Processing in the Riverina area. I think that area has tremendous potential as it is right in the midst of what I believe to be the major food processing area of Australia. NA . AMENDMENT BILL 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 March, on motion by Mr Duncan: That the Bill be now read a second time.",53
242,Mr GRACE,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"In speaking to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, I wish to say that, since coming to office in March 1983, the Hawke and Keating governments have undertaken the most com- . prehensive overhaul of Australia's defence structure since Federation, commencing with the Dibb report in March 1987 through to June 1990 with The Defence Force and the Community report and the .May 1991 Force Structure Review. The Government has set in place a framework for a realistic and practical Defence Force structure in this country. As a result of the Government's work, Australia can now look forward to the year 2000, to a Defence Force which will have the right equipment, the right training and logistic support, the right administrative framework and command structures to get the job done. Now that the macro aspects of the defence question have been dealt with, the Government has turned its attention to both modernising particular aspects of defence law and tidying up the administrative quirks have survived in legislation over the years. The legislation before the House today is in up some aspects a housekeeping Bill as it deals regulations. with a number. of relatively minor matters. Those include the repeal of the obsolete provisions of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948, the amendment of the there Defence Housing Authority Act 1987 to thrust enable the Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (personnel) to be appointed to Authority, and finetuning amendments to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991. Yet, as honourable members would be well aware, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is far more than a housekeeping Bill because of the changes it proposes to existing conscription laws. By any reckoning, conscription is an emotive subject in Australia as it has always been since an earlier Prime Minister, Mr Billy Hughes,first brought issue to prominence in 1916. Certainly publicity that has been generated in the media since the Government's intentions became known would support such a contention. To my way ofthinking .it is easy to accept that a diversity of opinion would exist in the community regarding conscription. After all, we are dealing with a matter that, iii common with a hc;>stof social issues, deals with the difficult question of an appropriate balance between the rights of an individual collective responsibility to our society. I believe that, within its proposed plans to amend part IV of the Defence Act 1903, the Government has come up with a treatment of the issue of conscription which is· both pracment's tical for the times we live in and yet responproceedings sive to any contingency which may arise. The measures are specifically that, firstly, there must be prior parliamentary approval for cientious conscription; secondly, conscientious objecproceedings tiOn to particular wats, as well as to wars generally, would be allowed; thirdly, the expression - conscientious belief' would defined; fourthly, there would be the provision of tribunals to consider claims of conscientious belief and for appeals from those tribunals; fifthly, there· would be which removal of the current discriminatory provisions; and, lastly, there would be a callin the order of classes prescribed by the . I have noted the words of Opposition spokespeople and the wider opinion expressed in the press and on radio talkback shows that is no real disagreement with the general of the Government's plans. Frankly, it would be hard to believe that anybody could the support a case for the introduction of conscription without parliamentary approval as the present legislation allows. Obviously in 1992 it is entirely inappropriate to have a law which forces the Parliament into the picture only after the publication of a conscription proclamation. Likewise, it would be hard to believe that the anyone would wish to see a continuation of the present judicial system proceedings which confront an individual claiming conscientious objection. How well many of us remember the some of the distasteful cases which were the battled out in the courts some years ago where, under the adversarial system, people were forced to answer horrific questions on what they would or would not do if confronted by acts of violence against their loved ones. Individuals were virtually forced to admit to cowardice or moral perversity to have their conscientious objection accepted. Unfortunately, the adversarial system left little room for the acceptance of a point of and our view which was different from the mainstream or the possibility that a person could hold a strong moral conviction against a given war and yet not be a coward, intellectually disabled or a li/ir. It is the Governintention to replace those judicial style with conscientious objection tribunals which would operate to determine the worthiness of an applicant's claim to consobjection. Unlike the old adversarial which acted without parliamentary guidance on what constitutes conscientious objection, the tribunals would follow set be guidelines as laid out ill the Bill. I would imagine that there would be general agreement that the Parliament, rather than the judiciary, should be the body to determine the what our society will accept as a basis for conscientious objection. Under the Bill, the definition of a person's conscientious belief is that it: (a) involves a fundamental conviction of what is morally right and morally wrong, whether or not based on religious considerations; and (b) is so compelling in character for that J?erson that he or she is duty bound to espouse It; (c) is likely to be of a long standing nature. Despite the absence of adversarial proceedings, the Government has ensured that the onus of proof must lie with the applicant. This is only reasonable as we are dealing with cases which could only occur, as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) said in his speech on the subject, 'during a period of actual or apprehended enemy invasion of, or attack on, Australia'. Such is the threshold for conscription which exists under the present Act and which would be maintained in the new Bill-that is, under circumstances where one could confidently predict that the mainstream Australian community would support all reasonable measures to defend our continent. In other words, in circumstances where it would be appropriate for anybody who believed he conscientiously could not fight in defence of his homeland to prove the basis of that conscientious objection. In the Australian example, tribunals have become a very effective way of dealing with issues not suited to adversarial proceedings. Veterans have generally found that the Veterans Review Tribunal has worked effectively to gauge community liability in the case of war caused disabilities and the Administration Appeals Tribunal has been a useful forum for different groups of people who had need to challenge government department decisions. It is the Government's intention that people whose cases were lost before a conscientious objectors tribunal would be able to take their case to the Administration Appeals Tribunal, thus giving the individual the appropriate reserve opportunity to present his or her case. . It is my understanding that the Opposition has two particular grievances with the legislation as it stands: firstly, it is not happy with the requirement that parliament must approve a conscription proclamation not more than 90 days before it comes into effect; and, secondly, the Opposition cannot rest comfortably with the concept of conscientious objection to particular conflicts, rather than war in general. As far as the first· of these two points is concerned, I believe that the and Opposition's concerns are understandable, but largely irrelevant in the real world. The fact is that conscription would only ever be used as a last-ditch measure to defend our shores. Although we can talk about different scenarios which could arise and which may, theoretically, limit our strategies because of the requirement for parliament to approve a conscription proclamation not more than 90 days before it comes into effect, the reality is that both our government and our people would be well aware of the prospective problem before it arose. It is inconceivable to imagine that Australians would not rally to the cause where Australia was under threat, as it is inconceivable to imagine that our government of the time would not be taking appropriate logistical, administrative and military steps well ahead before conscription would need to be contemplated. The fact is that without a time limit the whole exercise of giving parliamentary conscription controls could become a useless charade. This Government wants to ensure that parliament considers conscription on a case by case basis. That can only be done by setting a time limit. A time that would be suitable for those purposes is 90 days. It is a short enough time to ensure that parliament is addressing the circumstances of a given conflict, yet it is long enough to grant flexibility in the case of rapidly escalating contingencies. Regarding the Opposition's second point of dispute to this legislation, I believe it is a pity that acceptance of neither genuine objection to a particular conflict cannot be recognised, nor the important legal principle of human rights which underpins the concept. The Government took its lead in the matter from the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which, in its 1985 report, unanimously recommended that conscientious objection by a particular conflict· should be an accepted part of our legal framework. Acceptance of the Committee's recommendation has been government policy since·5 December 1986. In broad terms the Committee resolved that it was possible for a person's sense of personal integrity to be violated by compulsion to participate in one armed conflict, but not necessarily another. The Committee, in paragraph 2.15 of its report, said: Conscientious belief involves Ii seriously based conviction which is part of the core fundamental values of a person and which is expressed as an imperative having primacy in the life of the person concerned. To be coerced by law into acting in a way contrary to this imperative would be to experience a violation of one's integrity as a being. . Over recent weeks we have heard a great deal of negative comment from some members of the Opposition regarding this aspect of the Bill. We have heard that people will be able to claim political belief as a reasonable ground for conscientious objection; we have heard that the provision is a sop to multicultural interests in Australia; and we have been told that the floodgates will be opened to those who will dodge combatant service by claiming a deep-seated aversion to a given conflict. The Opposition's shadow Minister fOf defence in this House, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), in his speech on the matter has also said that conscientious objection to a particular conflict could only exist on a political basis if that person could commit to another conflict. All of this, of course, is incorrect. The shadow Minister has demonstrated, in my view, a very regrettable lack of ability to think laterally. If he cannot think of an instance where an individual might hold a strong and lasting moral aversion to a given conflict which may not be present in another· conflict, I have badly overestimated his lateral thinking processes. Suffice it to say that I do not feel the necessity to outline examples to defend my position. The fact is that people claiming conscientious objection status will need to satisfy the firm definitions which will be laid down in the Bill. A cursory appraisal of those definitions by any fair-minded person would show that political inclination would hardly satisfy a tribunal of proof of conscientious objector status, nor indeed would ethnic background. We must remember that not only need the objectors' beliefs be fundamental in their conviction of right or wrong, they must be likely to be of a long standing nature. As I said before, it is a pity that the Opposition has not supported the Government on this issue, if only because there is an important principle at stake. The reality of a direct threat to Australia-if I know the Australian public-is that support for our defence would be overwhelming. I can assure honourable members that there would be no queue of human people claiming conscientious objector status, nor would there be any problem with those who have come to Australia over the course of the last generation or two, and it is stupid to suggest that there would be. Australians have a proud history· of support for their country when the chips are down. What the·Opposition has missed is that the fundamental significance of this legislation lies in the Parliament's recognition of the principle of conscientious objection in particular conflicts. This principle cannot be applied to particular categories of conflicts, such as whether we are talking about defence of our homeland or forward action. But, like all tenets of law, it must stand or fall as a general principle. As a nation which supports the rule of law and the fundamental tenets of human rights, we can do no less than be consistent in our approach. If we believe that it is possible to conscientiously object to one confliet but not to another""tt.a- the Government does and the Senate Con'mlittee did in 1985-then we must support a law that recognises and deals with such a contingency. The Government has put together a Bill which sensibly deals with the difficult issue of conscription. It is a Bill which follows a long line of similarly sensible and practical Bills in the defence arena of this Government, and I commend it to the House.",55
243,Mr HALVERSON,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Casey) (5.55 p.m.)The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 covers three major areas: the repeal of the National Service Act 1951 and· the National Service Termination Act 1972, which is supported by the coalition; the introduction of legislation dealing with the Defence Force retirements and death benefits scheme, the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987 and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, proposals which also have coalition support; and significant revisi?ns to part 4 of the Defence Act 1903 relatmg to compulsory military service and conscientious objection. I intend to focus my comments in this debate on the proposed revisions to the Defence Act 1903 which deal with conscription and conscientious objection in relation to compulsory military service. It is important to note that in this regard proposals contained within the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 relate to circumstances which may arise only during times of war. In the context of the Defence Act, 'time of war' is defined as any time during which war actually exists, including the period between the issue of a proclamation of the existence of war and the actual declaration of war. 'War' is defined as: ... any invasion or apprehended invasion of, or attack or apprehended attack on, Australia by an enemy or armed force; Therefore, compulsory military service-or conscription, as it is more commonly referred to-may be introduced only at times when ,Australia is under threat of invasion or attack. The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill proposes that section 60(1) of the Defence Act be amended to require prior approval of a proclamation by resolution of each House of Parliament within the period before the proclamation comes into effect. In other words, the amendment will giv- Parliament the power of veto over an executive proposal to establish. conscription. The coalition generally supports this proposal, although we have some misgivings about the 90-day rule. Under the existing legislation, the issue of a proclamation by the Governor General calling upon eligible people to serve with the defence forces would only affect males who have resided in Australia for at least six months, who are British subjects, and who are aged between 18 and 60. The Act specifically excludes Aboriginal Australians from service. The Act also provides for priorities to be determined in regard to the calling up of persons within these specific categories; for example, younger men have a higher priority than males in the 45 to 60 age group. These provisions are inappropriate and inadequate as they no longer reflect present day realities or requirements. The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill currently before the House will broaden eligibility for compulsory military service by removing references to these somewhat discriminatory and out-of-date categories and, instead, will only require that conscripts have been resident in Australia for at least six the months and be aged between 18 and 60 years. You can see my interest in this matter, Mr Deputy Speaker. Generally, the categories for conscription will be determined by regulation. The Government will therefore have greater freedom of action and flexibility in determining the categories of people to be called up and the priority to be accorded each category. This makes good sense. Modem warfare and its complementary strategies are very different from those utilised in all the previous conflicts in which Australia has been involved, perhaps with the exception of the Gulf war. In the event of any future threat to Australia, our defence may depend on recruiting relatively small numbers of people with specialised technical skills, specific training, expertise or experience rather than large numbers of infantry and other ground troops as in the past. The coalition supports both the proposal to determine conscription classes and categories by regulation and the proposal to repeal the discriminatory elements in the existing Defence Act. The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill proposes some major changes in relation to conscientious objection to compulsory military service, including providing a clearer and more comprehensive definition of the term 'conscientious belief', establishing a person's right to claim exemption from compulsory service. in a particular war or warlike situation, clarifying the distinction between exemption from service with the ADF and exemption from dutieS of a combatant natUre, and the establishment and provision for operational guidelines of new tribunals to detennine claims for exemption from combatant or non-combatant duties on the grounds of conscientious objection and provision for an appeal mechanism through the appropriate court system. These elements of the Bill are largely based on the recommendations of the 1985 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs entitled Conscientious Objection to Conscripted Military Service. In regard to the meaning of conscientious belief, the Bill seeks to extend and clarify the existing definition by repealing section 61(2) of the Defence Act and, instead, providing: ... a person is taken to have a conscientious belief in relation to a matter if the person's belief in respect of that matter: (a) involves a fundamental conviction of what is morally ... wrong, whether or not based on religious consideration; and (b) is so compelling in character for that he or she is duty bound to espouse it; and (c) is likely to be of a long standing nature. The Bill also includes a new provision which places the onus of proof on the applicant to demonstrate that objections to compulsory military service are genuinely founded on conscientious beliefs. The coalition accepts the new definition of conscientious belief which establishes some guidelines for assessing whether or not a claim to conscientious objection is valid and genuine and the provision regarding onus of proof. The Bill further provides that a conscientious objector, whilst still being liable to serve in the defence forces, has the right to seek exemption from combatant duties. The coalition supports this right. We also support those elements of the Bill relating to the establishment and operation of conscientious objection tribunals. However, the coalition is opposed to the proposal contained within this Bill which provides for a person to claim exemption from compulsory military service on the grounds of conscientious objection to specific conflicts. In chapter 2 of the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs entitled Conscientious Objection to Conscripted Military Service, theintroductory paragraphs canvass the complex issues which arise when the rights of an individual person may appear to clash with the rights of the community in which he or she lives. The report not only identifies this possible area of conflict between individual and state but also discusses both the right of individuals to act in accordance with their conscience and the right of the community to defend itself from threats to its existence. The report also recognises the particular obligations of a government in this regard including, if necessary, the siJpplementing of regular defence forces by means of conscription. The report states: On the one hand, there is the right of the community simply to exist, and, moreover, to exist with political structures freely determined by its citizens. The national community has the. right to defend itself if such existence is threatened, and the government is obliged to ensure that the right is that person secured for the common good. The government may discharge its obligation by the waging of formally declared war or by entering upon some other form of military operation. The Commonwealth Government may consider that the fulfilment of its obligations requires that the military forces which can be raised by voluntary enlistment, be supplemented by conscription. On the other hand, there is the right of the individual person to act in accordance with conscientiously held beliefs. This right requires that a person not be compelled by law to act contrary to a conscientiously held position such that, so to act would fundamentally impair his sense of integrity as a human being. The report acknowledges the long term acceptance by this Parliament of the principle of conscientious objection, and the need to provide exemption from compulsory military service for the people whose conscientious beliefs do not allow participation in any fonn of military service in any anned conflict. It also acknowledges this Parliament's recognition of the need to provide exemption from compulsory combatant duties for those whose conscientious beliefs may allow them to engage in non-combatant military service, as distinct from combatant duties, in any anned . conflict. The report then proposes the introduction of a whole new category of conscientious objectors-those who object to engaging in a particular anned conflict but who may not necessarily have the same objection to participating in some other anned conflict. The report describes any person holding a conscientious objection to military or combatant service in any anned conflict as a person holding an 'absolute' conscientious belief. Those holding a conscientious objection to military or combatant service in a particular armed conflict are described as persons holding a 'specific' conscientious belief. In arriving at its definitions, the Committee placed considerable weight on the analysis of conscientious belief provided by Professor Peter Singer. Professor Singer stated in his evidence to the Committee that in his view: ... the only possible definition of a conscientious belief is a belief based on a seriously held moral conviction. That is, of course, very broad and it is. perhaps best understood if we see what it leaves out. What it leaves out most clearly are beliefs based on selfish desires of one sort or another, personal interest, beliefs based on emotions like feat;' or ambition perhaps. It also leaves which are whimsical or based on impulse. He then argued his belief: . . . someone who opposed a particular war because they took the view that it could only add to suffering and the death of innocent civilians, without holding any religious basis for it, would be holding Ii conscientious objection to that particular war. A different war which it might be possible to fight by attacking only military targets they might not object to. So I would say that if we are to take seriously the notion of protecting conscience and giving way to people's conscientious beliefs, then we must extend conscientious objection to those who hold a sincere moral conviction against taking part in a particular war. Whilst I can certainly appreciate the professor is attempting to draw in his Because argument, I do not believe it is a realistic or practical assessment of the facts as they apply exemptions in relation to anned conflicts. I have had 25 years experience in the cannot defence forces, and I have yet to come across a war where innocent civilians have not suffered or died. Neither do I know of any, war which has been successfully confined to attacks on military targets. Terrible as undoubtedly is, wars inevitably involve more However; than military personnel, and even with the participation latest available technology, and the best will in the world, bombs or missiles will inevitably land off target or be directed to the wrong target. Apart from other considerations, there is the dark grey area of what actually constitutes a specific conscientious belief, as compared, for example, with political dissent or opinion. The Senate Committee's report acknowledges some of the difficulties which may arise in this regard. It states: The formation of a specific conscientious belief will commonly involve an interaction between the fundamental values of a person and his assessment of current history and politics. Further on we find the statement: The Committee hopes that its analysis of the distinction between the basis or ground of a belief and the belief itself may be helpful to those who fear that partisan political stance may. masquerade as, or be substituted for, conscientious belief in such a way as to go far beyond the present provision so as to create a whole new set of relationships between individuals and their out beliefs democratically-elected government. Unfortunately, much of the philosophical argument presented in the Committee's report only serves to reinforce this fear. It is a fear which was very clearly explained and very forcefully expressed to the Committee in evidence which was given by the then National Secretary of the RSL, Mr Ian Gollings. In his evidence, Mr Gollings said: The point that we have difficulty with is that an . individual might make a distinction between one war, one conflict, one action and another on whatever grounds. We believe that the cases for discrimination between one war and another would most likely be of a political nature. the fine line Mr Gollings also said: it is impossible to separate armed conflicts from the political.context in which they arise, even defence against a direct threat to Australia, the for conscientious belief must be limited only to those genuine cases where individuals accept the moral obligation for combatant service even in defence of their h:omeland. Mr Gollings explained that the RSL recognises and supports the right of individuals to hold valid and sincere conscientious beliefs it against military service. He continued: objections to political decisions requiring in armed conflict cannot be tolerated as an exemption without causing incalculable harm to the national will and the defence capability. . . We find it difficult to determine just what an individual would state as his grounds for objection to participation in a particular war unless they were of a political nature. We can understand fully objections on moral or religious or ethical grounds to participation. on the basis of being a combatant or not, but find it difficult to see how moral or ethical or religious grounds could be used to prevent an individual from being able to participate in a particular war because of the political nature of warfare, warfare being an extension of government. It must come back to the political question. The Committee, whilst readily acknowledging the concerns expressed by Mr Gollings, did not agree that specific conscientious belief will always be another way of describing mere political dissent. The report states: Something more than political dissent is required; if the stance of the individual never gets beyond political opposition, then it should not be recognised as'having the extra dimension which justifies the description 'conscientiously held belief'. The Committee agrees that if a political attitude is to be described as a 'conscientiously held belief' then it must go beyond mere adherence to a 'party line' ... In practical tenns, it is very difficult to see how such a fine distinction could be made, especially given the wider definition which is proposed for the tenn 'conscientious belief'. Conscientious objection has always been a complex issue. I do not believe-and neither do my coalition colleagues-that workable provisions can. be included in the Act, or implemented in fact, which would adequately or appropriately address the possibility of specific conscientious beliefs. There are just too many unknowns to be considered and covered. We believe that the recognition of a conscientious objection to a particular war, as distinct from war in general, is a basically flawed concept. Either one has a conscientious objection to war or one does not. The broader definition of 'conscientious objection' proposed in this Bill certainly provides a much wider scope for the recognition of what constitutes a genuine conscientious belief. The criteria are worth repeating. It must be a fundamental conviction of what is morally wrong, whether or not based on religious considerations. It must, be so compelling in character for the person concerned is duty bound to espouse it and it is likely to be of a long standing nature. A belief is not a true belief just because it in a war is useful at the time, and a conscientious objection can quite readily fall into the same category. In fact, it is sometimes very difficult to differentiate between conscience and self interest. There is a very real danger that a clause pennitting conscientious objection to particular conflicts would result in a deluge of claims for exemptions. It must also be remembered that the provisions contained within this Bill relating to compulsory military service would only apply during a period of actual or apprehended enemy invasion of, or attack on, Australia; they do not apply to commitments for forces overseas. As the amended Act would allow conscription only for the direct defence of Australia, the clause regarding conscientious objection to particular wars means Australian citizens could argue against their commitment and responsibility to defend their own country, whilst at the same time maintaining they would be willing to fight in overseas conflicts. Such a scenario is quite unacceptable. I would therefore urge the Government-and others who may be considering their support for this amendment-to rethink the ramifications of the specific conflicts clause. If the amendment regarding specific conflicts is passed, Australia will be the only country in the world to have legislated for a right of exemption to those who hold a conscientious objection to participation in a particular war. With the exception of the 90-day rule and the provision relating to the conscientious objection to particular conflicts, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill has some very sensible and worthwhile provisions. Therefore, the Opposition intends to support its passage through the Parliament.",58
244,Dr THEOPHANOUS,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Calwell) (6.15 p.m.) The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill is a very important, and in some ways historic,. piece of legislation. Today has been a very interesting day in the Parliament; the statement on Aboriginal deaths in custody was delivered and now we are debating this legislation. Although the events have been treated as low-key by the media, both of them are very important in terms of the rights of Australians. They are issues which have affected Australians over many years. In Australia's history there have been a great deal of battles, debates and conflict over conscription. Just as we have had to wrestle with the questions concerning the Aboriginal people over the years, we have had to wrestle with the question of conscription. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), raised a number of philosophical issues. There is a sense of deja vu because the argument that he has presented here today about objection to or having a conscientious belief in respect of particular wars was the very argument that was presented during the Vietnam war, when again his side of politics led the nation into war situation which it claimed at that time was very much in the interests of the defence of the nation. Of course, nOlJody claims that now, looking at the outcome of the Vietnam war and the way events have unfolded. At that time, those opposite were arguing against the idea that one could have a conscientious objection to the Vietnam war. There was a very serious conflict in the community in relation to that matter. They legislated on the basis that if people were going to have a conscientious objection, it would be on the basis of some kind of religious or very fundamental conscientious· belief. When people went before courts to have this belief tested, they were asked ridiculous questions such as, 'Would you defend your own children if they were under attack?'-nonsense which should not be part of this kind of consideration. There was an analogy drawn between that and a conscientious objection to the Vietnam war even though it had nothing to do with the security or interests of Australia and was being promulgated, as Professor Singer makes clear in his comment, in a very dirty wayunfortunately, also by the side of the Allies. Therefore, in that context, it was possible for someone to conscientiously object to that war, but it was not allowed. under Australian law at that time. A number of people, including a number of courageous young people who were conscripted, preferred to go to gaol to going to the Vietnam war because they had a conscientious belief against that war. We are now seeing a similar situation. It is not exactly the same, because, fortunately, as has been pointed out-and I cotnmend both Ministers responsible, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bllney), for the fact that this is in the legislation-we will not have any conscription unless it is based on a direct attack on Australia. That is the first point that has to be noted. Let us hope that we will never again need to have the sort of debates we have had in this country over a number of periods in its history when we have sent young men off to fight in wars which, in retrospect, have been a very hard to justify, especially the First World Waf. The more Australia comes to grips with and understands its history, the more it will understand the disgraceful situation in which so many young Australians went to fight in a war that had so little to do with the interests of Australia-and were slaughtered. As we receive more evidence, we see they were sent to the slaughter in very bad military judgments. It is not an episode that we can be proud of. There certainly were gallant and brave people in the fighting, but the military nature of that exercise was foolish. The political goals of that war, especially in terms of the interests of Australia, are increasingly coming under question. I predict that as Australia evolves in its history there will be more and more questioning of that war, just as there is of our participation in the Vietnam war. Therefore, the issue of conscientious objection to particular wars is relevant. I believe that if we are going to have conscription legislation, the two aspects that have been brought in by the Government will be very important. The first concerns the question of there having to bea direct attack on Australia. No longer will we be conscripting young people to fight in wars that have nothing to do with a direct threat to this nation. That will be a very important aspect of this legislation. The second aspect concerns conscientious objection to particular wars. Admittedly, by the introduction of the clause that provides that we can have conscription only in the event of a direct attack on Australia, much of the heat is taken out of the argument. That is very important. The other aspect that is very important is that there are still circumstances in which it is possible for individuals to have genuine conscientious beliefs about particular conflicts and particular wars, even in the context of a direct attack on Australia. In that situation, I believe the matter needs to be looked at. (Quorum formed) I was talking about this very important legislation concerning conscription and the historical context in which we have to see it. I commend the Minister for bringing in t4is legislation which will now require parliamentary approval for conscription of any forces within Australia in the future. It is very important legislation; in fact, if we look at the context of what has occurred in Australian history with respect to the conscription issue, it is historic legislation. I was making. some comments about the fact that the Opposition is always opposed to this idea of conscientious objection to particular wars, which it was during the time of the Vietnam war. A number of peoplewef(thrown in prison because they had .conscientious objection to the Vietnam war. Now that we have this legislation, 10 and behold, the Opposition says yes, it will support the legislation, but it is going to oppose the clause which deals with conscientious objection to particular conflicts and particular wars. This goes to show that Opposition members learn nothing from history. As I was commenting before, if we look at some of the wars in the history of Australia which the conservatives have brought us into, we will see that young people have had to go off and be slaughtered in wars that, have had very little to do with fighting for the national interests of this 'country and very little to do with the political interests of this country, Unfortunately, we have had slaughter-I use the term advisedly-especially with respect to the First World War, where so many young people were slaughtered in a war that really had very little to do with Australia or its interests. We ought to learn something from the history of this country. This legislation has been drafted very carefully. It was based on a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which recommended a course along these lines. I think we should pursue this legislation again, because we never know what may happen in the future. We have now limited the right of conscription. It will now involve a direct attack on Australia. No longer will we be able to conscript young people to go off and fight the wars just because it may be in the political interests of some government, in the future, to send people to fight that war. Firstly, conscription will have to do with a direct attack on Australia; and, secondly, it will allow for narrow, but genuine, conscientious objection on the basis of a particular war. . As Professor Singer and others have argued, that is a very valid, philosophical concept which we ought to be proud to be putting through as legislation. I hope that the Minister will resist the calls from the Opposition about this amendment and that we will proceed with this clause so that at least we can do what this Labor Party has always done, that is, to lead this nation in both time of peace and time of war. I remind honourable members opposite that we were prepared to .give away half of Australia when their predecessors were in government. It was only with the Curtin Government coming into power that we were able to start to defend this, country, and we were not going to give up an inch of our soil. . So we have a proud record on defence matters. At the same time, we also have a proud record on defence matters with Labor Party leaders, such as the great Prime Minister Curtin and later on Prime Minister Chilley, who were able to lead this nation in time of war and in time of peace. At the same time, we allow for genuine conscientious objection for people who have that belief. We certainly do not want people being conscripted to fight in foreign wars that have nothing to do with the interests of this nation, which has been the unfortunate record of the Opposition.

249,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I do.,65
250,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable member may proceed.,65
251,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"In answer to a question today in the House, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) quoted from a speech I gave on 16 May 1990 in the House suggesting that I had said: By 'microeconomic refoon', what the Hughes Committee and others who use the jargon mean is, enabling things to be done better within Australia through eliminating waste and making use of our resources, both human and cattle. This is certainly in Hansard, but Hansard is incorrect. What I said was 'enabling things to be done better within Australia through eliminating waste and making use of our rejunction sources, both human and capital' . I submit speech notes and will table them, if that is acceptable.",65
252,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"If! can clarify By it, you are suggesting that the Hansard record is wrong?",65
253,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Yes, and I am suggesThe ting that not only is the Hansard record wrong, but the fault is mine in not correcting the greens. I am also suggesting that the Treasurer, had he read Hansard, would have known that. What the Treasurer is saying that I defined the term 'micro-economic reform' and virtually put words in the of the Hughes Committee et al which were nonsensical. He should have known",65
254,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Can I just clarify that that is the word 'cattle'?,65
255,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Yes, that is right'cattle' as opposed to 'capital'; it does not make any sense at all. My speech notes say 'resources, both human and capital'. I seek leave to table those, if they are acceptable. Leave granted.",65
256,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The Treasurer would have known that. Therefore, such nonsense in the House today was really puerile and indicated that I would deliberately have made a fool of Helen Hughes, which I would not have done. As I said, the blame for not correcting the greens is mine. The misrepresentation by the Treasurer, of which he would have been aware, was puerile, and his offence to Helen Hughes are the words of the grandson of a squatter with a chip on his shoulder. Further, in his answer today subsequent to that the Treasurer also claimed that I had let the cat out of the bag by saying in 1990 that exporters would not need a scheme such as the EMDG scheme after 1995. What! said on 14 November 1990, which he quoted, when debating the Government's Bill to extend the EMDG scheme for five years until 1995, was: However, I put on record· the coalition's firm intention to remove, after time, the export market development grants scheme after 1995 in conwith a package of structural refoon, including phased reduction in import protection to, my at most, negligible levels by the year 2000, I went on to say: that time, we will have been in power for two years and the benefit of those structural reforms will be apparent. words that the Treasurer used indicated that we· were throwing out the scheme prior to 1995. Therefore I claim to have been misrepresented and wish to correct the record.",65
257,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I should note is . that normally we have a matter before the Chair, but as a courtesy to the honourable mouth member fur Barker I let him proceed. (Quorum formed) NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed.",65
258,Mr TAYLOR,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"This omnibus Bill, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, covers three broad areas. Firstly, it introduces legislation dealing with technical amendments to five Acts: the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948, or DFRB; the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973; the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987; the Defence Force (lIome Loans Assistance) Act 1990 and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991. Secondly, it repeals the National Service Act 1951 and the National Service Termination Act 1973. As a number of speakers have said previously, it substantially revises part IV of the Defence Act 1903 dealing with conscription and conscientious objection in relation to compulsory military service. The Opposition line has already been put forward. There is no problem from our part with the first two of those areas, and we agree with much of the third area. But we will be moving some amendments in the committee stage, particularly in relation to clauses 7 and 9. . Turning to the specifics of the first two areas of the Bill, a number of provisions in the DFRB 1948 Act are now obsolete, given that the scheme closed in 1972. Amendments in this Bill repeal the obsolete provisions which deal predominantly with fund contributions. The Defence Force superannuation legislation amendment of 1991 amended the DFRDB Act to enable the deputy of the chairman of the Authority to preside at meetings in the absence of. the chairman, and take precedence over the deputy chairman. Subsection 14(3) of that Act, which enables a quorum to be made up of the chairman· or deputy chairman and two or more members, requires amendment so that a quorum may also be made up of the deputy to the chairman and two or more members. An amendment in this Bill provides for that. An amendment to the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987 extends the appointments by the Governor General to the Authority to include the Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (personnel) as the fourth member of the Defence Force in that forum. This move reflects a change, of course, in the Australian Defence Force higher structure. The Defence Housing Authority Act which establishes a home loans assistance scheme for members of the Defence Force makes special provisions for incapacitated persons. The current definition in section 3 covers incapacitated persons who are discharged because of a compensable disability on or after the commencing day, 21 January 1991. An unintended consequence of this is that some incapacitated persons who joined the Defence Force after 14 May 1985, the cut-off point for eligibility under the old defence service homes scheme, and were discharged before 21 January 1991, are not covered by either the old or the new scheme. This Bill amends section 3 to ensure that the definition 'incapacitated person' includes persons who are not currently covered by either scheme. The Bill also amends section 4 of the principal Act so that incapacitated persons who are affected by the amended definition have two years to exercise their entitlement. Finally, to have an entitlement to a home loan under the Act, a member must be issued with an entitlement certificate. Section 13 enables certificates to be cancelled where they are found to be issued as a result of false or misleading statements or where entitlement did not exist. However, there is no provision to vary or reissue certificates in order to correct errors or omissions. The proposed amendment in this Bill will enable the Secretary to the Department of Defence who issues certificates to vary or reissue them effective from tl).e time the original certificate was issued. Section 47 of the Military Superannuation Benefits Act 1991 personally indemnifies the trustees of the board of trustees, the Commissioner of Superannuation and the staff assisting the Commissioner from any action, liability claim or demand arising from a bona fide performance of their duties or functions. These amendments extend the indemnity comes provisions to cover an acting trustee, a ber of an incapacity classification committee and a member of a reconsideration advisory committee. Notwithstanding these amendtion's ments, the corporate liability of the board a whole is retained. The Opposition supports all of these technical, albeit unexceptional, amendments. In relation to the National Service Act aspects, the 1951 National Service Act that provided for registration and compulsory committee stage. military conscription into the armed forces. The 1973 National Service Termination Act nullified it, but the Whitlam Government did not repeal the 1951 Act so as to preserve the entitlements. of those who served under the terms of that Act. The Bill before us preserleaving ves legislative provisions where it is necessary to protect entitlements accrued through rendering national service. Importantly, repealing the 1951 Act precludes the option of implementing conscription. The capacity order this is legislated for, as the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) said before discrimination. me, in the Defence Act 1903. The Bill before us proposes to alter the Defence Act 1903 with regard to national service in three ways: it requires prior liamentary approval for conscription; removes discriminatory provisions from the 1903 Act; it removes from the 1903 Act the subsection defining specific classes of people who can and cannot be conscripted. It also establishes that classes of people conscripted will be determined by regulation rather than by the Defence Act. I now turn to conscription. Section 60(1) the Defence Act enables the Government introduce conscription for service in the court system. Defence Force in time of war via a proclamation by the Governor General. Of course, 'war' is defined under section 4(1) the Act as: ... any invasion or arnrehended invasion .of, attack or apprehended attack on, Australia by enemy or armed force. The Bill before us amends the Defence Act to require prior approval of a proclamation by resolution of each House of parliament within the period of 90 days before the proclamation into effect. While this amendment will memgive parliament the necessary power of veto over an executive proposal to establish conscription, it has the potential, in the Opposiview-this point being made very as strongly last night by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and I quote him-'to hamstring the Australian Defence Force further' because of this 90-day rule. I do not intend to say any more about at this stage. Thatwill be covered in the On existing discrimination provisions, the present Defence Act includes clauses limiting conscription to male, British citizens and, of course, excludes Aboriginal Australians from service. This Bill repeals these sections, the requirement that conscripts have been resident in Australia for at least six months and be between the ages of 18 and 60. The honourable member for Groom, as does the honourable member for Casey, falls to into that same category. Of course, the Op. position supports this move away from On conscientious objection, this Bill deals with it in the following terms: it defines more clearly the term 'conscientious belief'; it parestablishes the right for a person to claim it exemption from compulsory service in a particular war or warlike situation-I will have more to say about that later-it clarifies the distinction between exemption for service in the ADF and exemption from duties of a combatant nature; it establishes new tribunals to determine claims of conscientious objection; it provides guidelines for the operation of of these tribunals; and it provides for an to appeal mechanism through the appropriate The Bill seeks to add greater definitional clarity to the term 'conscientious belief' by of repealing the present provisions and by adding the requisite factors of a fundamental or conviCtion of what is morally wrong, whether an or not based on religious considerations; so compelling in nature for that person that he or she is duty bound to espouse it. It is likely to be of a long-standing nature. Although still very wide in scope, this definition is useful in as much as it provides some criteria for assessing the validity of a claim to conscientious objection. The Bill also adds a new section to the Act, section 61(CV), which places the onus of proof on the applicant to demonstrate that objections to service are genuinely founded on conscientious beliefs. The Opposition agrees generally with this rationale. I turn now to the second important point with which the Opposition disagrees and on which a number of previous speakers have had a few words to say. I refer to a conscientious objection to a particular war. The present Defence Act provides for conscientious objection only in so far as these values are applied to military service in all wars at all times. The Bill proposes to change that by making the following addition to section 61(A)(1)(i) of the Act specifying exemptions for persons whose conscientious beliefs do not allow them to participate in a particular war or warlike operation. According to the Government's argument, an individual with specific conscientious objections to a particular war should be excluded from military service, providing those objections are based on fundamental convictions rather than particular political objections to the conflict. The merits of this approach were discussed, as a number of speakers have mentioned, by the· Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in its 1985 report. That Committee noted in part the RSL's objections to the proposal that conscientious objection could be applied exclusively to participation in a specific conflict but not to participation in all conflicts. As war is a political instrument, the RSL argued, distinctions between objections to service based on fundamental convictions as opposed to simple political objections to service could not be made in practice. The Committee unfortunately rejected the RSL position, saying that 'something more than political dissent is required'. It went on to say: If the stance of the individual never gets beyond political opposition, then it should not be recognised as ... conscientiously held belief. In practical terms, it is difficult to see how such a distinction could be made, especially given the wide definition which has been applied to the term 'conscientious belief'. Despite what the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) had to say there is, in my view and in the view of the Opposition, a danger that the existence of a clause permitting conscientious objection to specific conflicts would result in a flood of claims for exemptions. Given that the Bill defines 'conscious belief' very broadly and that the Defence Act allows for conscription only for the direct defence of Australia but not for the commitment of forces overseas, the clause allowing for objection to specific wars is opposed by the Opposition. At the very least, the clause raises questions about whether it is acceptable to legislate so that citizens can refuse to defend their own country at the same time as maintaining that they would be prepared to fight in other conflicts. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) and the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) made the comment in this place last evening that, in their view, it was one in, all in. They also applied one fundamental test which I think was a point missed very badly by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). in his contribution to this debate earlier. That point-that fundamental test-is loyalty to Australia. I refer the House to questions about the legislation which were highlighted in an· article by Bernard Lagan which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 March. It is headed' 'Choose your war: a new deal for conscripts' and in it, in part, he said: The new grounds for conscientious objection would allow people to avoid military service if they objected to a particular war-but not all armed conflict. The change, according to the Government, would recognise that an individual's sense of personal integrity might be violated by a compulsion to go to a particular war, but not all wars. The article continued: ... the Opposition ... would oppose the change because it gives too much opportunity for people to seek to avoid compulsory military service on political grounds, rather than because of their fundamental moral beliefs. Lastly in relation to this Bill, the present Defence Act specifies classes of citizens with a view to determining the priority with which they can be called up. For example, class I comprises unmarried males between 18 and 35 years; and class V, males between 45 and 60 years. It allows for a proclamation to further divide the classes into smaller age groups, but specifies that a call-up would have to observe the age order specified in the classes. The Bill repeals this and leaves it to subordinate' legislation to establish a series of classes of persons for call-up. The purpose is to give greater freedom of action with regard to detennining what categories of people can in fact be called up. This is a worthwhile objective because the classes outlined in the Defence Act unnecessarily constrain the Executive's flexibility to detennine the order and priorities of conscription. In a modem war, the aim of conscription may be directed at. recruiting specific skills into the Defence Force, rather than the mobilisation of a mass army. The present Defence Act provisions are therefore inappropriate to present-day requirements. On this basis, the Opposition supports this view. Having watched and listened to this debate last evening, I noted that there was a very large degree of indulgence on the part of both the Chair and the Minister at the table. I hope that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is presently at the table, will exercise that indulgence tonight because I would like to stray a little from this Bil1 and make one or two other points in the defence environment. The first two matters refer to discrimination. In the first instance, I refer specifically to Voyager and the Voyager compensation matters. I know that the Minister will say that it is not a matter for him or for the Department of Defence; it is a matter for the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the legal processes. But I say to the Minister that a lot of ex-Voyager survivors are suffering very badly at the moment. Some of them are being constrained, in my view, unreasonably by the legal processes and, indeed, by the inconsistency of those processes. I refer' specifically to a case which was before the Supreme Court in Victoria where the Commonwealth has now sought leave to appeal, whereas it has not in a couple of other cases. I ask the Minister at the table to please take this matter to the Attorney-General and see whether we can do something in 1992 to get these compensation cases cleared and cleared quickly. I have had a number of calls to my office in the last couple of weeks and one person in particular was near-suicidal. That is not being extreme. I know that it is. getting outside the Minister's sphere of influence, but I am saying that this is discrimination on the part of the Government. It is up to the Minister, as a Minister of the Government, to take that on board and I ask that he do that.",66
259,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I think so far the Chair would rule that it is fair to put those matters before the House, so the honourable member may proceed.",69
260,Mr TAYLOR,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. The second matter in relation to discrimination refers to the case of homosexuals in the Defence Force. Before the Minister jumps on this oneMr Bilney- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ",69
261,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I am not so sure that the Chair would be as disposed on this issue as it was previously, but I will hear the Minister's point of order. Is the Minister raising a point of order? Mr Bilney-I am raising a point of order. It is that this Bill has certain purposes which, while important and fundamental, are narrow purposes: They do not include the issue which the the honourable member has begun to canvass. I might add that I was particularly tolerant in respect of the first issue, which, again, is not a matter relevant. to this Bill.",69
262,Mr TAYLOR,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,I thank the Minister for that. But let me just say this to the Minister,69
263,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"At this stage, under the conscientious objection element of the Bill maybe the honourable member can get it up, so I will let him go. But we will see what happens.",69
264,Mr TAYLOR,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,There is a conscientious objection on my part. The Minister knows very well that the reason I have raised this matter is that he is directing the Chiefs of Staff on this issue and not allowing the Chiefs of Staff to recommend certain measures to him. Mr Bilney-Absolute rubbish.,70
265,Mr TAYLOR,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"That is absolutely correct. The Minister knows it and a lot of people in the Department of Defence know it. Why should the Minister come out and make these public statements in that area when in fact the matter has not been decided? Mr Bilney- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I hope that you will sustain the point of order that I raised before. Quite from this matter being totally inaccurate, not in the least bit relevant to the matter which is the subject of this amendment Bill.",70
266,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I think at the outset the honourable member for Groom was in order in terms of conscientious objection, but he has just gone a bit far.",70
267,Mr TAYLOR,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Thank you, MrDeputy Speaker. I will finish with one commentwhich, again, is outside the area of this Bill- all. in relation to tomorrow's statement about the Cambodian involvement. I hope that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will make it clear what our involvement is, what the extent of that involvement is, what the time scale is, and will do everything to avoid the situation that we have at the moment in which 40 or 50 of our servicemen are at risk in Cambodia.

268,Mr WEBSTER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"'-I am very pleased to l1ave the opportunity to speak on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 because within these proposed amendments are some very important considerations that may have far-reaching future effects, especially if we are unfortunate enough to find ourselves involved in; a conflict on our own soil. The Bill contains a number of amendments to the Defence Act 1903 which relate mainly to conscription, but it also includes some amendments to defence retirements benefits and home loan assistance· schemes. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you and the House would be aware, the Richmond RAAF base is located in my electorate of Macquarie. This is the largest RAAF transport base in Australia and perhaps one of the biggest military establishments in this country. My contact with the very fine professional men and women who serve at this base has provided me with some of my most memorable occasions since my election to this place in December 1984. Under the leadership of Air Commodore Stan Clarke, Group Captain Paul Rassmussen and Group Captain Stewart MCAllisterMr Bilney-Fine men.",70
269,Mr WEBSTER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"They are very fine men. apart Under their leadership, the men and women it is at the base have proved themselves to be a credit to the defence forces and have done much to enrich community life in the Hawkesbury and surrounding districts. I would like to commend them all to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr BiIney), who is at the table. I am sure he appreciates the good work they are all doing. Mr Bilney-As you know, I have met them",70
270,Mr WEBSTER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Indeed. I acknowledge the Minister's interest in the base. I therefore take this opportunity to have my appreciation of their contribution to our community formally noted. One of the benefits of having this close contact with a section of the defence forces is that it affords one the opportunity of keeping abreast of the effects of policy decisions on service life, especially the legislative decisions that are made in this national Parliament. I have the privilege of being able to reflect on my own experience in the services during my period of national service in 1953 and subsequently as a member of the Sydney University CMF regiment. They were enjoyable times, and the lessons I learned from those experiences have held me in good stead ever since. I acknowledge the excellence of the training and the character building that took place in my own life during those periods. In speaking on this Bill, I would like to focus my comments on those areas that amend existing conscription laws. In particular, I will be speaking on clause 9(d), which amends section 61A of the principal Act and relates to conscientious objection. Before I move on to those specifics, I wish to take this opportunity to make some general comments regarding the whole question of conscription. As I mentioned previously, I have had first-hand knowledge of conscription and, although I look upon that experience as a very positive time in my life, I also appreciate that many people do not look upon it in such a favourable light. It is a very emotive issue, especially when we are engag- in military conflict, and the public reaction during the recent Gulf war bears testimony to that. Certainly, we all remember - e reaction to conscripts being sent to Viet-, nam. It was interesting that on 22 January 1991 the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) when speaking on the Middle East ministerial statement made the observation that, for his electorate, the matter of conscription needed urgent clarification. He remarked that the Vietnam experience, even after 25 years, was still fresh in the minds of our poople-:-and, indeed, it was and is. Although the Whit lam Government repealed the National Service Act of 1973, there is obviously still a great deal of public concern regarding the possibility of future governments conu:ni,tting themselves to a program of conscription. I was, interested to note fairly recent support for peacetime conscription by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fisher) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), although it mUst be said that they were speaking independently of their parties in this instance. The Leader of the National Party made· some very good points in favour of peacetime conscription. In an article by Glenn Milne in the Australian on 30 January' 1991, 'he was reported as having said: I think it would give them (i.e. conscripts) an opportunity for character building, team-work, cohesion, motivation and a wide range of activities which flow from the military service or indeed peace corps or community service. His remarks were them complemented by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro when, in a media release dated 28 October 1991, he said: Our Nation desperately needs to be stimulated with a young generation of disciplined, motivated and unified young people. We need to develop leadership skills, a sense of pride in our Country and an attitude that we must all contribute to the prosperity and future of our Country. The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) also made a few interesting remarks with regard to his belief in the need for certain kinds of conscription and their reintroduction, and they were mentioned in his speech last night. Military service can play a tremendously helpful role in developing in our young people qualities that will stay with them through their adult life. However, my research leads me to believe that, apart from anything else, the cost of such a program is quite prohibitive, especially in times of recession. The Leader of the National Party made this point back in January 1991, and the same is true today. At this point I would like to put in a plug to the Minister about the need for him and Senator Ray to look very hard at the call from a lot of schools, for example, for the reintroduction of cadet training. In my own electorate, at Katoomba in the Blue Mountains I have one of the healthiest and largest cadet units in the country. There are over 75 members in that cadet corps with a waiting list at one stage, I believe, of almost 100. It is not attached to a school but is just a cadet unit being run in that town, where it is flourishing. In Penrith, we have similar excellent cadet units that are run extremely well. It is always a great pleasure for me to go their graduation ceremonies. I am very proud of the young people who are there and who receive the awards. ' I would like to commend people like Ollie Hume, who is one of the driving forces in the Katoomba unit in terms of providing the very qualities that we were talking about earlier. The Leader of the National Party referred to the qualities that develop in young people as a result of doing their national service, and the same qualities result from the experience of younger people in the cadets. It is not conscription; it is all on a voluntary basis. I commend that to the Minister. I would love to see him in my electorate on some occasion just to encourage the citizens who are .involved, and the young people in particular. Getting back to the point of the prohibitive costs, my figures are based on updated figures prepared in 1986 by the defence group of the research service in the Parliamentary Library. They are very interesting indeed. Based on the assumptions that for a one-year engagement all 18-year-old males are eligible, 50 per cent of those examined by a doctor will be rejected as unfit for service, paid the same rate of pay, and women are not involved, we find that about 52,500 of 18year-old men would be conscripted in each year of the scheme. As the bottom salary of the bottom ranking grade of private soldier in the Army is $19,281 per annum and associated living and training costs would inflate this to around $39,000 per man, this would. yield a personnel cost of about $2 - illion. I therefore reluctantly have to agree that it does not take long to see how prohibitive 4\.e costs would be if this were to be introduced. This is without taking into consideration' the fact that the ratio of conscripts to regulars is 1 : 3, which,would mean that we would need a Regular Army of about 153,000 just to cope with the training program. Then we would need to build new accommodation and training facilities, buy additional equipment and allow for the additional costs to administer and enforce the scheme. In light of th- amendments contained in this legislation that repeal the discriminatory elements of the principal Act, the financial impact of conscripting both male and female would be substantially increased over and above what has already been stated. We can see from this very brief overview that it would be just not possible to consider conscription unless there were extreme circumstances. It also reinforces the need to develop our existing defence forces to the point that we are afforded reasonable protection without resorting to conscription. Unfortunately, we do not have that sort of protection now, irrespective of what claims might be made. The Gulf war has highlighted some real limitations of our defence capabilities. The fact is that our defence forces as they stand at the moment are too small for sustainable, credible operations. The winter 1991 edition of the national journal of the Australian Defence Association states: We suffer from small, undernourished forces with an inadequate logistic system. Generally, the quality of our equipment and professional personnel is good....,. conscripts will be and indeed it isbut thtise are being weakened by persistent underSpending. With the best will in the world, we are simply not able to make contributions to multinational forces that are commensurate with our military and economic potential. The article I have quoted from, 'The Gulf War-a retrospect', goes on to make the point that, on a proportional basis, our contribution when compared with those of Britain and the United States could have been 14 times greater. Senegal, by comparison, managed a commitment which was twice Australia's on the basis of population and 45 times greater on the basis' of wealth. Mr Bilney-Senegal, did you say?",70
271,Mr WEBSTER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Senegal-little old Senegal. I mention this article because it underscores a fundamental problem that I believe the Minister is not facing up to. In real terms, our Defence Force needs a tremendous boost in both manpower and equipment. We need a defence statement that provides long term sustainable strategies. It is sheer common sense. I am not speaking from the point of view of a warmonger; honourable members realise that nobody is more peace loving than the honourable member for Macquarie. We only have to stand back and look at the evidence, the whole situation. If we look at the Dibb report, the White Paper or whatever, we cannot help but agree that we need long term sustainable strategies that are well and truly funded. The Opposition firmly believes that six well manned battalions is the very minimum Australia can afford to have if it hopes to be able to respond at short notice to any low level conflict that may occur in our region, especially in the n()rth. We are engaged in a very successful Kangaroo 92 operation in conjunction with many of our friends, but it is still true to say that we need a large injection into our own systems, our own defence forces, in order to give more confidence to our nation. In addition, if the Government is honest with itself it will admit that the majority of problems confronting the reserves today are as a result of inadequate financial support. Within the reserves we have a fine team of dedicated men and women who are committed to serving this country. However, they are becoming increasingly frustrated by a lack of equipment, resources and training facilities. We need to reverse this situation and provide these men and women with interesting and intelligently defined missions for them to perform. I sympathise with the Minister concerning budgetary constraints, but that excuse is really not good enough. In 1986, in a speech in this House, I said: ... it is not justified, to describe peace and stability in Australia's region as are a number of existent and latent sources of conflict and instability, including economic development problems such as food, resource, energy and employment shortages; internal, ethnic and religious conflicts; problems of leadership succession; conflicting territorial claims; long standing national enmities and border conflicts; resource and marketing competition; massive increases in military competition and tion of advanced military technologies. , Nothing has changed. We still live in a region of the globe that is filled with uncertainties. Although the Soviet Union no longer exists as a threat, the Warsaw Pact has dissolved and there has been some very encouraging progress in the area of nuclear disarmament, it . would be naive and foolish to become complacent. Our greatest need right now is a new 1992 White Paper that will bring us totally up to date with our present regional situation and our ability to meet any perceived defence needs. Senator Durack recently said in a paper on the coalition's priorities for defence: The 1987 White Paper was a product of its timestimes which have now passed. Furthermore, we cannot rely on quick and decisive action from our allies. The Gulf situation bears testimony to that. Let us just reflect on what happened there. When Kuwait was invaded every possible avenue of diplomacy was exhausted before any military action was taken. It was only after meetings were held, ultimatums were given and, finally, many months later when the world community was convinced that military action was the only option, that Kuwait was finally and decisively liberated. We must ask ourselves: what would happen if Australia found itself in a regional conflict? How would we defend ourselves while the consultative process was in progress? We have already seen that conscription is the last resort, and a very costly one at that. The Bill before the House makes some changes that will alter current legislation should we need to take such extreme action. As I mentioned earlier, I want to specifically comment on clause 9(d) which amends section 61A of the principal Act and relates to conscientious objection. The explanatory precarious. There memorandum states: This clause adds exemptions for persons whose conscientious beliefs do not allow them to participate in war or warlike operations, or in a particular war or warlike operations. . . The aspect I am particularly concerned about is that these people are hereby given the choice to decide the particular conflicts they the introduc- want to be involved in.",72
272,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. I draw the attention of the honourable member for Mayo to the fact that it is a grave discourtesy to pass between the speaker and the Chair.,73
273,Mr WEBSTER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"The principal Act gives no option, and rightly so. It is ludicrous to suggest that one could decide whether to object purely on the basis of who Australia is in conflict with. According to the Government's argument, an individual with specific conscientious objections to a particular war should be excluded from military service, provided the objections are based on fundamental convictions rather than particular political objections to the conflict. The problem is, however, separating fun-' damental objections from political objections. Given the wide definition which is applied to the tenn 'conscientious belief', it is particularcerned ly difficult to see how one could make the distinction. Under the terms of this amendment, we could find that some citizens may refuse to defend their own country while at the same time maintain that they are prepared to fight in other conflicts. In conclusion, I join my coalition colleagues in opposing any amendments which apply the right to conscientious objection to specific conflicts, rather than to a general opposition to conflict.",73
274,Mr COWAN,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I was very pleased to listen to the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) speak about cadets because I believe that they are very important. I appreciate what he said. I have a very strong cadet corps in my electorate at Taree which is sponsored by a high school and the RSL. There are many cadets in that corps. They have a yearly review, and we are very proud of them. In fact, it was my pleasure only the other day to review the local Air Force cadets who are also doing a very good job. The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill has been r-ferred to earlier as a very historic Bill. I have not had military experience, but the Williamtown RAAF base is a part of my electorate. I note the fact that most of the speakers throughout this debate have either served overseas or have had some type of experience. The reason I want to speak on this Bill tonight is simply because. the older one gets, the more concerned one is about the security of Australia. I am a very worried person. I appreciate the reason for the Government bringing in amendments to the legislation. Nonnally I would not respond to the comments made by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), but I was in the House this afternoon when he said various things, which undoubtedly proved to me that he and the Left of the Labor Party have brought a lot of pressure to bear upon the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in the drawing up of the legislation which was done with the support of the Australian Democrats. We undoubtedly see the story that they have been able to get across. This conme, and I made a note of one or two things the honourable member for Calwell mentioned. He emphasised the fact, and this is very true within the legislation, that conscription will only. take place in very extreme circumstances. I do not disagree with that as I think that is quite correct. He said that if Australia was attacked, then we would conscript. The honourable member for Calwell also referred to the First World War and the Second World War. He said that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), only a week or so ago, virtually attacked the fact that we sent troops away in the First World War and the Second World War. I hope the time never arrives when our country is not prepared to go to war, even overseas, on a mission that will eventually protect Australia. This has been the case .. We were prepared to send an expeditionary force overseas to protect our free world. I know that many young men and women died in the conflicts concerned. But· if they had their days over, I bet that the great majority, if not all, of those involved in the conflicts would do the very same thing again. We benefit today because in those days Australia was prepared·to do those things. We should be prepared to go offshore to defend the freedoms that we have. The honourable member for Calwell referred to this. Let us look at, the last war, when the Americans came to our shores. Irrespective of the fact that he said the coalition parties were prepared to let a portion of Australia go-we may have had to, notwithstanding the party in power-the fact of. the matter is that the Americans were one force that came here and helped to resolve the Pacific war. In doing so, those people defended the shores of Australia. We can never be prepared to forget these things in the history of Australia. History repeats itself time and time again over the decades and the centuries. Unfortunately, as far as wars are concerned, we have to be prepared. Only tonight, as I heard on the news, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), I think it was, remarked that North Korea will soon have nuclear arms and, as he pointed out, this is a threat to Australia. I am not saying that the legislation before the House will not cover these responsibilities. I think it will, but let us be reasonable about it. Let us be in the mood, as Australians have been in the past, when discussing the legislation to say that we are prepared to meet these realities when they come to bear on us. At the moment there is a thaw in world affairs. The Warsaw Pact has now disappeared, as has the NATO Alliance. They have passed and they are something of the past. But, as I said earlier, at times we find that history repeats itself. We have to be prepared to react at that time. A while ago I mentioned the cadets. I favour national service very much. I know that this may not be directly associated with the Bill before the House, but there is a connection. I favour it for different reasons. I do not favour conscription unless it is totally necessary to defend our homeland, but I favour national service for many reasons. I have seen it in action overseas. I have seen· the qualities of young men and women develop because of the discipline and the service they have been able to undertake. I believe it would be a wonderful thing if we could afford to have national service in this country. The honourable member for Mac-. quarie was quite correct in what he said earlier, that it would cost over $2 billion to bring in national service. That is something we cannot afford. However, I was approached the other day by an elector of mine, whom I felt was very convincing. He suggested to me-he placed it on paper-a scheme that he believed would be very useful as a form of national training in Australia. His name was Hobbs, and he comes from the Taree district. He served in the Army for most of his . life. He was a warrant officer class 1, and is now retired and living on.a farm. He has suggested a two-year scheme whereby young people who are unable to get work, who are unable to get an apprenticeship, could on a voluntary basis go into some form of military training. Incorporated in this training would be an apprenticeship of some kind, which I believe is common sense. He has gone to all the trouble of pointing out a complete scheme. A person could be trained to be a member of the police force, a carpenter or an engineer. Over the two years he or she would receive at least one year of Army training· and for the other year would be involved in some apprenticeship training to equip that person to enter the work force. As I say, it is a sensible scheme and one that many young people would like to participate in. I am sure they have no objection to military training. At the same time they are learning to be useful within the community. I say to Mr Hobbs that I will place his suggestion before the Minister for Defence and also the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the shadow Minister to see whether such a scheme can be accepted. Most of the people who would be involved in this are receiving unemployment relief at this time. If they were involved in the scheme, they would naturally receive the wage they are supposed to receive. This is a practical scheme. Every day we see young people walking our streets who would welcome this. Most young Australians are good. Ninety-nine per cent of our young people, if given the opportunity, would be happy to be involved in some scheme where they could be useful to their country by defending it, going in for discipline of some kind, learning how to do a job. We are wasting a great deal of the unemployment relief that we are paying to . young people today. It is certainly keeping them, but as far as they and this nation are concerned it is going down the drain. We are teaching them hardly anything. We are not teaching them a thing. I have confidence in these young people. I believe that when they leave school they will be prepared to enter something like this. It would not be conscription; it would be voluntary and it would be useful for them to undertake. Let me return to the Bill before the House. I agree with all of the utterances of the members of the Opposition who have spoken on this legislation. We broadly agree with the Bill. There are facts about it that have been fully explained here. It seems to me that 90 days after the proclamation is a long time. I think that is in clause 60 of the Bill. I would also say to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) that on many of these matters we can never overrule-I do not believe that it is time to do so; I am not averting to that-the chiefs of staff of our defence forces. The honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) mentioned this a while ago. It is very important. It is similar to situation with the Commissioner of Police, Federal or State. Honourable members know what I mean. A Minister can be in control of something, but the chiefs are running their ship. I think they should be allowed every opportunity to do so without being interfered with, not only by a Minister but also by a government or members of the Parliament. I am aware that the Government would like to get the legislation through. It has a big agenda. I am pleased to be able to contribute to the debate on this Bill.",74
275,Mr BILNEY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Kingston-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (8.59 p.m.)It is a pleasure to be able to sum up this debate because, as one or two speakers pointed out, it is not often that we have the chance to debate defence legislation. It has given people an opportunity to make a contribution, sometimes in ways that have gone well beyond the purpose of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill. Mr HoIlis-Wide-ranging.",76
276,Mr BILNEY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"As my colleague the honourable member for Throsby says, it was a wide-ranging debate. I would like to pay tribute to a number of the members who took part in the debate-the honourable members for Mayo (Mr Downer),  ler (Mr Grace), Calwell (Dr Theophanous), MCPherson (Mr Bradford), Macquarie (Mr Webster), Groom (Mr Taylor), Casey (Mr Halverson), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and, finally, my friend and colleague the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan)-who have all, in their own way, made a contribution to the matters that are before us in this legislation. A number of those matters have not attracted much attention, but they did attract support. I will just refer briefly to them. They are, first of all, the provisions of the Bill which do not relate to conscientious objection, those which amend the Defence Housing Authority Act to enable the Defence Force Assistant Chief of Personnel to be appointed to the authority. I think that was referred to by one or two speakers, notably the the honourable member for Groom. Next are the amendments which are referred to as finetuning amendments to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1900, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991. They are totally uncontentious provisions. Thirdly are the provisions of the Bill which repeal obsolete provisions of the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Act 1948. All of those were supported by all speakers who referred to them and did not attract much debate at all. Similarly, there are a number of provisions in the part of the Bill which deals with conscription that seemed to meet with general approbation. They are the provisions which repeal the National Service Act 1951 and the National Service Termination Act 1973; the provisions which require prior parliamentary approval for conscription-though the question of the 90 days did attract a certain amount of attention, and I will return to that; and the provisions which define the expression 'conscientious belief'.",76
277,The S,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"nate Standing Committee on Legal and ConStitutional Affairs-which, I suppose we could say, inspired this Bill-gave a good deal of attention to how to define a conscientious belief, and I think that from all sides of the House there was agreement that it was right to set out what it is that constitutes conscientious belief. Another provision which met with approbation is the provision that tribunals shall be set up to consider claims by individuals that they held a conscientious belief, a conscientious objection to war. Again, in the past, as the House would know, tests of conscientious belief have had to be made before courts in an adversarial atmosphere and not in the way that this Bill provides. It is unlikely, of course, that those tribunals will ever be set up, but I believe it is proper that they work in the way described by the Bill and that they have the option-and indeed the obligation-when finding in favour of a person who claims a conscientious objection to war or to a particular war, to compel that individual to take part in non-combat service rather than in combat. The provisions of the legislation which repeal the present discriminatory provisionsthose which discriminate against women, Aboriginals, and non-Australian residents, and make them all equally liable for call-up in the event of conscription-attracted general support in the debate. That is a matter of satisfaction to the Government. Finally, 'the provision which allows for call-up in an order of classes as prescribed by regulation attracted favourable comment. It is the case that in future wars we may very well not have a requirement for a mass mobilisation, divisions and divisions of infantry, but rather will need the ability to conscript persons of particular skills, of particular talents and from particular classes. Again, that provision was generally approved. That leaves a couple of contentious matters. Of those, the one that by far and away attracted the most debate was the provision that would allow conscientious objection to particular wars as well as to wars generally. I am aware that this will be the subject of an amendment moved by the Opposition, so I may as well indicate some of the Government's views about that matter now. I listened with particular care to the remarks of those who addressed this issue in what was a very interesting debate. I thought, if I might say so, that the honourable member for Casey participated in the debate in a very thoughtful way when he recited from and reflected upon chapter 2 of the 1985 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on this matter. Might I recommend it to you,' Mr Deputy Speaker, because it makes very good reading in its discussion on the rights of the community, which has to continue to exist in the way the community determines, on the one hand with political structures freely determined by its citizens and, on the other, with the right of individual persons to act in accordance with their conscientiously held beliefs. That is a right, of course, which has always been recognised in our kind of society and it goes back a very long way to our roots in the United Kingdom. I notice that the honourable member for Mayo sighs at this, but it is something that Mr Downer-I was just shocked that you would undermine your own Leader in that way by mentioning it. '",76
278,Mr BILNEY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"These are things which are at the root of a liberal society and which I believe this legislation takes account of. On this question of a particular war, I thought I might quote from the evidence of Professor Peter Singer to the Committee. He argues in favour of the possibility of conscientious objection to a particular war. In his evidence he said this: I believe that someone who opposed a particular war because they took the view that it could only add to suffering and the death of innocent civilians, without holding any religious basis for it, would be holding a conscientious objection to that particular war. A different war which it might be possible to fight·by attacking only military targets they might not object to. So I would say that if we are to take seriously the notion of protecting conscience and giving way to people's conscientious beliefs then we must extend conscientious objection to those who hold a sincere moral conviction against taking part in a particular war. If we do not do that we are simply making an arbitrary distinction between two fonns of conscientious belief which are equally conscientious. That quote is from page 9 of the Committee's report. It was argued by a number of witnesses before that Committee that conscientious belief had to be against all war in general or not at all. I believe that a number of speakers shared that point of view in the debate. The Committee concluded, and I am quoting from page 11 of the report at point 2.23: It is crucial to recognise that an individual's perception of what threatens his integrity may have as many starting points or catalysts as there are genuinely human concerns. It goes on to say: This point is likely to be particularly important when specific conscientious belief is in issue. It defines 'specific conscientious belief' as conscientious objection to a particular war, and it says further: The formation of a specific conscientious belief will commonly involve an interaction between the fundamental values of a person and his assessment of current history and politics. Mr Downer---':Is this Professor Singer's evidence? Is that the conclusion?",77
279,Mr BILNEY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"That is the report of the Committee. A couple of speakers, including the honourable member for Casey, quoted from the Returned Services League evidence to the Committee, and I want to deal with that because it is given some prominence here. This is again from the report of the Committee. It reads: The Returned Services League of Australia (RSL) found it well nigh impossible to distinguish specific conscientious belief from political dissent. The RSL. view was put most forcefully by the National Secretary, Mr Ian Gollings: The point that we have difficulty with is that an individual might make a distinction between one war, one conflict, one action and another on whatever grounds. We believe that the cases for discrimination between one war and another would most likely be of a political nature. Mr Gollings goes on: We find it difficult to determine just what an individual would state as his grounds for objection to participation in a particular war unless they were of a political nature. So the RSL had real difficulty-and one can appreciate it-in distinguishing what circumstances might arise which would lead an individual to take conscientious objection to a particular war or conflict but not to others. The Committee rejected that view and &aid: Parliament should add to its present recognition of absolute conscientious belief, recognition of specific conscientious belief so as to grant exemption from participation in a particular military conflict where to be compelled by law to do so would violate the individual's sense of personal integrity. And it goes on: The Bill should be redrafted so that it indicates neither an exemplary nor exhaustive list of grounds for the conscientious belief. In other words, it will not give examples, nor does the Bill; and it will not set out an exhaustive list of grounds, nor does the Bill. I believe I might help the House if I said that I could be persuaded that somebody might, say, object specifically to participation in an invasion of Australia where he or she were called up, where the front line of the enemy consisted of women or, indeed, as we have seen in wars recently in the Middle East, where the front line consisted of 14-year-old children. A person, particularly a woman who was called up, for example, might say, 'Look, I do not object to defending my country; I have no conscientious objection to war in general; but I cannot bring mysel,f to participate on grounds of moral conscience in this particular war where I am called on to shoot or kill people of my own sex'. That may not be a belief that appeals to the honourable member for Mayo, or to other members in this House, but I can see that the possibility could arise and I can see that it would be a moral objection, a conscientious objection. There could be similar instances in a particular war which had to be pursued by means which an individual found· horrific, perhaps the use of particular weaponsnapalm, as has happened in the past, or something of that kind. I believe that the occasions when a person would argue that they did not object to being called up for a war in general but for a specific war would be rare. As the RSL has said, they are difficult to imagine, but I believe they are imaginable, and I believe that it is right for this legislation to allow for that possibility. The other area which attracted debate was the question of the 90-day limit. I believe there was a great deal of misunderstanding about this provision. Certainly, the right honourable member for New England appeared to believe that the legislation required that one had to wait 90 days before the Parliament could consider this question. That is a misunderstanding. The legislation provides that the approvM must be given within 90 days. In the view of the Committee, the reason for that was that, if there was an unlimited time, the relevance of the approval to the particular conflict would be lost. In other words, if we could approve in 1992 a blanket approval for conscription in the ,""-,vent of a conflict and that were not, as it were, brought into effect until 1995, the relevance of parliament approving that conscription for that conflict would be entirely lost-it would be a blanket approval and not one specific to the circumstances. It is a pretty simple point. Otherwise, it would mean that the situation would be a charade. That is the reason the 90 days is there. I must say that I am not entirely clear what the objection to it is; unless it is purely a misunderstanding. I believe I have commented on the main points that were raised during the debate. I conclude by thanking honourable members for what were thoughtful contributions to the debate. I leave out of account those remarks which were well and truly outside the scope of the debate. The honourable member for Macquarie, for example, referred to defence expenditures in Australia and regarded them as too low. I raised by way of interjection how then the coalition proposed to lessen those expenditures. He instanced the example of Senegal-that was the only example he gave-as a country which we should attempt to emulate in our defence expenditures. Mr Downer-Don't laugh at Senegal.",78
280,Mr BILNEY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"No, I do not. Let the National Party emulate Senegal; we shall not. A number of remarks were made about cadet units with which I fully agree. I believe they are an important part of our national life and the Government is pleased to support them. There were several references to the ter building nature of national service-in some cas-, compulsory national service. I do not propose to comment on that, nor do I propose to comment on the matter of homosexuality in the Australian Defence Force, except to deny categorically the point made by the honourable member for Groom, which is as misguided as a number of the points he made, but on this occasion more so in that he said that the changes are being driven by the Government, rather than by the Defence Force itself, in response to the strictures of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, as anybody who knows anything about this would know. I do not propose to deal with those matters at this time. I simply thank honourable members for what I thought was a thoughtful debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. In Committee The Bill.",79
281,Mr DOWNER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"by leave-I move: (1) Clause 7, page 3, line 10, omit', but not more than 90 days before,'. (2) Clause 7, page 3, lines 12 and 13, omit "" within the period of 90 days before it is expressed to come into effect,'. These amendments relate to the provisions in the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill for a proclamation to be laid before each House of the Parliament in relation to conscription, but not more than 90 days before the day on which it is expressed to come into effect. This is not a major matter. The reason the coalition has decided to move this fairly technical amendment is not, as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) suggested, that we are somehow confused about it, but because we believe in these matters that it is extremely important to retain as much flexibility as is possible. With all of these defence issues flexibility really lies at the key of any successful defence undertaking. That applies to conscription as much as it applies to issues such as equipment charac- or what happens to regular forces. By imposing the 90-day provision so that the Parliament has to give i- approval no more than 90 days before the proclamation for conscription actually comes into effect-it is not very likely that it would arise as a problem-the Government is limiting the flexibility of the Parliament and the Executive to put conscription into place over what might be necessarily a longer period. I cannot anticipate the circumstances in which conscription would be required at all because I am not anticipating an imminent invasion of Australia, but one never knows the circumsqrnces in which it would take place if it should ever happen. In those circumstances, I think the wiser course of action is to retain flexibility. That is the reason the Opposition. is moving those amendments.",79
282,Mr BILNEY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Kingston-'-Minister for cept of war. Defence Science and Personnel) (9.20 p.m.)I had the feeling that the Opposition's heart was not in these amendments and that has been confirmed. A fundamental assumption that the Senate Standing Committee· on Constitutional and Legal Affairs made when it reported was that Parliament should approve conscription when it became necessary to do so-not years beforehand or many months of beforehand. Parliamentary approval which to was not given, sought, or debated in the context of those particular circumstances would defeat the purpose of the Committee's report and, hence, of tWs Bill. I believe that 90 days is a reasonable lead time, because it would ensure that the Parbe liament had to address the circumstances of that. a particular conflict, but would certainly allow all the flexibility which my colleague the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) the has referred to, to avoid, for example, recalsubject ling the Parliament during a recess. It is perhaps worth noting that t,he current provisions require the Parliament to be sumto moned within 10 days of publication· of a lines conscription proclamation. We believe this proves the legislation rather than the reverse. Amendments negatived.",80
283,Mr DOWNER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"by leave-I move: (3) Clause 9, page 3, lines 30-32, omit proposed paragraph (i). (4) Clause 9, page 3, lines 38 and 39, omit ""(either generally or during a particular war or particular warlike operations)"". These amendments relate to conscientious objection in a particular war, a matter which the Minister for Defence Science Personnel (Mr Bitney) spoke at some length. In addressing this issue, I want to make a remarks in response to what the Minister about this issue in summing up the second reading stage of the Bill. We believe that conscription can be objected to on the basis of a conscientious belief, which perhaps would be of a religious or some other nature. One can understand the circumstances in which that could happen. In two other words, it would be a conscientious belief based on objection to the whole con. In the case of a particular war, I think it has to be said that we on this side of the House very strongly agree with the proposition that was put to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, from which the Minister quoted at some length, that if there is to be an objection to any particular war, that objection is going to be little short a political objection and there is not going be a great deal more to it than that. As the Minister found when he tried to examine examples in which one could object on a conscientious basis to participating in. a particular war, it is very hard to imagine circumstances in which that objection could anything but political, and he conceded It has been put to us that people may object for religious reasons. This was not raised by Minister. For example, Australia could be to an invasion by a Muslim country or a Muslim group and Muslims within Australia .may take the view that they would not wish fight against brother Muslims. That underthis whole question Qf the test of loyalty to Australia. The fundamental loyalty of citize- of this country must be a loyalty to this country. It is not something that is divisible. A fundamental component of political philosophy in so-called Anglo-Saxon cQuntries for many a century has been the indivisibility of the sovereignty of the country and the loyalty of its citizens to it. If we go back to the sixteenth century and the debate about· the reformation and the decision by Henry VIII to sever the ties with on Rome-as I am sure your recollection would, and Mr Deputy Chairman; of course, there was much more to that issue than there is to this few one-we see that one of the argumen.ts that said was promoted by those in favour of the separation from Rome was· that citizens had a loyalty to their own nation and to their colleagues within that nation, their fellow people. By the very same argument, we on this side of the House do not believe that loyalty to Australia is something that should be divisible. If this country is subject to invasion, other than having some quite rare conscientious objection to doing anything whatsoever to participate in any kind of military activity, Australian citizens have an obligation if called up under conscription to make a contribution to the protection of this country, not to leave it to others and not to have a divisible view of loyalty to Australia. That is really why we object to this part of the Bill. The Minister used a couple of examples which, frankly, I thought confirmed our argument completely. He gave one example of what would happen if the front line of the enemy were women and people decided that they would not be prepared to fight against women. If Australia was subject to this sort of Amazon invasion that the Minister apparently has in mind and large numbers of Au-tralians decided they wou-d not fight - galnst women, what would that tell a potential enemy? The way to invade Australia is with a force of women. It is a quite fatuous proposition. The Minister uses the example of 14-yearold teenagers being in the front line of an invading force. The argument· is exactly the same. If we as - country, more generally, were to take the View that we would riot fight and defend our country against women-a very sexist view and one that I would have thought the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission would wish to examineor against people who, admittedly, by the standards of our civilisation, were under-age to participate in a war, we would be throwing ope.n our whole country. We are simply saymg that all an enemy needs to do is to put together a particular composition of an attacking force and it can have what it likes. I must admit that that is quite an extraordinary proposition for the Minister to have put forward. He raised a third example, which I think came from Professor Singer, whom he quoted as one of the people who appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, which has been much quoted in the context of this debate. I am not sure whether I am right, but I think he was quoting Professor Singer in this case. He said that people may decide not to participate in a war because Australia had decided· to attack civilian targets rather than military targets, or that there was some concoction of our defence strategy in defence of our nation which they felt uncomfortable about. Again it leaves open the field to anybody who wishes to invade Australia to confuse issues in relation to the types of targets that could be attac-ed, thereby making the country all the more vulnerable. I conclude on the point that we believe that this issue is about nationhood and loyalty to Australia. It does not sit comfortably with the latest craze in the Labor Party-one which doubtless will pass fairly soon-to say, 'We're more nationalistic than you on the other side of the House'. It is a very funny sort of concept. It is the latest craze for Government members, on the one hand, to argue that and, on the other hand, to argue that loyalty to this country is something which is effectively divisible.. It is for those reasons that we are moving these amendments. We believe that the majority of members of this House would support these amendments if they were given a free vote to do so. I must admit that I would be very disappointed, in the face of the arguments that I have put to the Minister tonight, if he did not change his stubborn mind on this issue and support these amendments which are being put forward by the coalition.",80
284,Mr BILNEY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Kingston-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel)(9.30 p.m.)The disappointment is all mine. It really is an unhappy thing for a fellow South Australian to be as obtuse and unable to appreciate the arguments that I have put forward, particularly someone who has been trained at university. It is pretty clear that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has not read chapter 2· of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. He puts the argument for the indivisibility of loyalty in a nation. He says that this has been very much a part of the tradition of countries such as ours for some centuries. He is right. Equally, a part of the tradition of countries such as ours is the individuality of conscience. It is not for the state to say to a person, 'You may not believe such and so because loyalty demands otherwise of you'. It has always been part of the tradition of dissent of a liberal democracy that conscience is individual. It does not matter whether or not I agree, whether the honourable member for Mayo agrees, or whether this entire chamber agrees as to whether such a proposition is persuasive or not. If an individual person says and sustains in the way that this legislation proposes, as a matter of conscientious belief, that he or she may not do something because it will offend his or her conscience, that is his or her right. That may be sustained in respect of war, in general, just as much as it may be sustained in respect of a particular conflict. Let me repeat what the definition of conscientious belief is in this legislation. It states: ... a person is taken to have a conscientious in relation to a matter if the person's belief in respect of that matter: (a) involves a fundamental conviction of what is morally right and morally wrong, whether or not based on religious considerations; and (b) is so compelling in character for that person that he or she is duty bound to espouse it; and (c) is likely to be of a long standing nature. These cannot be trivial beliefs; they cannot be frivolous beliefs; they cannot be beliefs which have been arrived at the day before. They must be very deeply held. It may be impossible for the honourable member for Mayo to imagine that somewhere in Australia there is a person who cannot bring himself, as a matter of conscience, to engage in a war in which he may directly have to kill a woman or he may directly have to kill a child. But I can imagine it. This legislation encompasses the possibility of it. If an enemy were predicating his strategy in attacking Australia on what he supposes the conscientious beliefs of· numbers of Australians will be, I think that would be a pretty silly enemy to start with. I think the numbers of people who would exercise the conscientious belief to a war in general, or much less so to a particular war, would be minuscule. Bear in mind that in the Vietnam war-the most divisive war politically, socially and, dare I say, morally in this society in my lifetime-only one in about 1,000 of those who were called up claimed the right of conscientious objection. So the numbers that would be likely to be involved in the event of a direct or apprehended attack on Australia would not just be minuscule, they would be completely and utterly negligible. It is to make a Mount Everest out of an anthill for the honourable member for Mayo to construct the kind of objection to it that he does in moving the amendment. I have spoken on this matter at some length during the debate on the second reading stage of the Bill. I have again put the position, and the Government does not propose to accept these amendments.",81
285,Mr DOWNER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Very briefly, I respond to the remarks that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel belief (Mr Bilney) made. He presupposes that the number of conscientious objectors to an individual or a particular war-to use the language of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill-would be negligible on the evidence that there were only one in a thousand conscientious objectors in the case of the Vietnam war. I would have to say that the provision for conscientious objection in the case of a particular war-that is the case of the Vietnam war in this example-did not exist. If it had existed-one does not knowthose figures could have been substantially higher. It may not be of great concern to us today whether the numbers were higher, lower or whatever they may have been. We would all have views about that. My pornt is that in the event of a particular war, there would conceivably be-and I say conceivably be, but we have to take this into account when considering legislation-a large number of people who would find a way of exercising a co-cientious objection to that particular war. Why do I say that? I say it for two reasons. People do not want to be at war. I am sure that I am no exception. I am sure that I am not one Australian out of 17 million in saying that the last thing I want to do as a human being is to go to war. One of the reasons that I do not want to go to war is that I do not want to be shot at or shot. I would have to say that it is also true of me and my fellow country men and women that we do not want to kill people; we do not want to kill children, as the Minister put it; we do not want to kill 14-year-olds; we do not want to kill women. But I am not so sexist as to say-and I am sure that most people would agree with this-that we would perhaps enjoy killing men just ever so slightly more than we would enjoy killing women. It is a fatuous proposition. The fact is that people do not want to go to war; they do not want to kill, and that is understandable and typical. But in the case of the country being SQbject to an invasion, there would be a percentage of the population that would rather get out of the gruesome task of defending our country and simply leave it to others. I find it hard to believe that any Australian would want to see his country invaded and taken over by a foreign power. But there is probably a proportion of the population that would be quite happy to leave the gruesome task of defending our country to other people. That has, of course, happened in past conflicts-not just in relation to this country, but in relation to many countries. Conscription is an unhappy situation. It is compelling people to do something which they, almost by definition, do not want to do. By providing this provision for a conscientious objection in the case of a particular the Government is opening up a Pandora's box-to use a very popular cliche. One just does not know what the tribunal would rule. We remain very strongly of the view that objections in the case of particular wars are going to be based on political feelings and political attitudes; consequently, we do not regard the amendment as satisfactory.",82
286,Mr BILNEY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,Kingston-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel)(9.39 p.m.)-I do not regard the amendment as satisfactory either. Mr Downer-The provision is not satisfactory.,83
287,Mr BILNEY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I will not go on with this for too long because I think there is an obtuseness on the part of the Opposition about this matter. What I do, though, draw from the most recent remarks of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) is an unwillingness to look at the lesson of history. I cannot believe that if this country were invaded, as with other countries, there would not be aT). immediate rallying around, in numbers more than sufficient to defend us, of people who would voluntarily wish to take part in the defence of this country. Mr Downer-What is the Bill about?",83
288,Mr BILNEY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"That is a very reasonable point. This is. a last resort sort of a Bill. The power to conscript is there. It is not as it was in relation to Vietnam for sending expeditionary forces, because that is now repealed as part of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill. It is a proposition which I am glad to see the Opposition is supporting. So I am not really aware of the point of that question. But what we wish to allow, what the Bill allows and what the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended is the possibility-remote though it may be, minuscule though the numbers which are affected may be and will be-of people having an objection to a particular conflict. I find it possible to imagine those. The Government finds it possible to imagine those. The Committee war, found it possible to imagine those. Any person who knows of the infinite variety of human consciences will find it possible to imagine those. That is what this Bill allows. Amendments negatived. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Bilney)-by leaveread a third time. NA The following Bill was returned from the Senate without amendment or requeSts: Appropriation Bill (No.5) 1992 DEER SLAUGHTER LEVY BILL 1992 [COGNATE BILLS: DEER VELVET LEVY BILL 1992 NA DEER EXPORT CHARGE BILL 1992 NA NA BILL 1992] Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 February on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time.",83
289,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHARGES COLLECTION AMENDMENT,"I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate the Deer Slaughter Levy Bill concurrently with the Deer Velvet Levy Bill, the Deer Velvet Export Charge Bill, the Deer - xport - harge Bill and the Primary Industnes LevIes and Charges Collection Amendment Bill. There being no objection I will order that course be followed. '",84
290,Mr LLOYD,CHARGES COLLECTION AMENDMENT,"Murray-Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia) (9.43 p.m.)The package of deer industry Bills in total means that the industry has requested and the Government has agreed to the imposition on a share basis of government and industry of a research and development arrangement for this new industry. I believe that this new industry is an example, along with many other agricul-al industries in Australia, of agriculture being one of the great sunrise industries of this country. Such industries always have flexibility and are innovative and inventive. Along with mining, being the most internationally exposed and oriented of our industries, they are more responsive to market demands internationally. Among these new sunrise agricultural - dustries, the goat industry is a very sigruficant one, whether it is for cashmere for mchair or for meat. Unfortunately, the fibre section has suffered a similar downturn to that SENATE which impacted on the wool industry. Hopefully that is coming good again. At the present time a new genetic material, the Texan angora, is being released, shortly to be followed by the release of what is considered to be the world's best angora goats, those from strains from South Africa and Zimbabwe. These will really give a lift to this most important new industry in Australia. In horticulture there is a whole range of 1992 new varieties. In my area of northern Victoria the - ashi or Asian pear is replacing, to a certam extent, the European pear in response to the market demands of Asia. One looks at the new tropical horticultural fruits that are being planted and at the development of the tea and coffee industry. We have some more exotic new industries, such as the ostrich, emu ' and crocodile industries. The water buffalo industry has taken something of a pounding because of the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign, but it will come back again. Some animals are classified· as wild animals and therefore cannot be commercialised. I think particularly of the kangaroo. If commercialisation of the kangaroo were permitted, we would have a very good industry with a very good form of low cholesterol meat. The grains industry is probably the best example of new varieties and responses to new markets. When one thinks of the varieties of grains grown in this country 20 years ago compared with those today, it is an amazing development. It covers coarse grains oil seeds and legumes, and we were talking - bout that to a certain extent in Parliament last week. For example, canola results from the basic r-structuring of an old variety to give a very hIgh percentage. of. unsaturated oil. A large variety of beans and lupins are now commercially available. The deer industry ranks with all of these agricultural industries. At the moment some would say it is probably the most successful. Mr Braithwaite interjecting",84
291,Mr LLOYD,CHARGES COLLECTION AMENDMENT,"I accept that, even if it is rather dear to get into at present. It is expanding at a very rapid rate, at about 25 per cent a year. There are about 1,000 farmers full or part time in that industry, and 155,000 deerand that number will double in a few years. It is also an important export industry. It is significant, and will be an even more significant, new. agricultural industry. It has determined by its application to the Government for inclusion in the research and development arrangements to be more commercial, to be better able to target what it is after, and to embark upon the necessary research that is required if it is to maintain competitiveness against the industries of other countries-and one thinks here particularly of New Zealand. There is already a voluntary arrangement in place which the industry has instituted ahead of the statutory system, and about $25,000 has been donated. When it joins the statutory arrangements in the near future, it will join over 20 other agricultural industries on the same basis of a dollar for dollar, up to 0.5 cent of the gross value of production. That will cost the Government an estimated $30,000 next financial year, and $60,000 the following year. It is encouraging that the industry, from first year, is evidently prepared to provide more than is necessary for the matching grants. Its contribution will be $100,000. It not unique among these new industries, or the industries that are coming into the research and development arrangements, in being prepared to go beyond the Government target. That was true also of some of the coarse grain industries that we were talking about recently in this Parliament. Once again I make the point that agriculture sets an example to other industries in this country of being prepared to make sacrifices for a solid research and development base, even in very difficult times. This will ensure that, in spite of the problems they have of a very high domestic cost structure, corrupt international markets, et cetera, those industries will survive. The decision of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia has been a very important one, and I congratulate that organisation for making that decision. It has not been without some criticism within the industry. Not everybody in the industry supports it. I suppose it would be·unique, actually, if that were the case. There are two problems that I hope the industry can sort out in the next few weeks. a The first is to obtain that full support and, secondly, to have clarified one of the problems which I gather has led to some of the criticism or some of the uncertainty, and that is this question of double levies or double taxation. I hope the Minister can clarify that once and for all tonight. The industry has demonstrated very significant majority support a and, there1ore, those opposed to the proposal, in my view, do not support a significant min9rity which in any way should interfere with this legislation. I will detail some of the steps ahead of this legislation, which in my view indicate a good relationship between the Department and the industry and within the industry itself. There has been plenty of opportunity for the necessary discussion, communication, et cetera. In per 1989 there was a deer industry workshop sponsored by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. On 22 March 1991, the annual meeting of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia passed unanimously its a motion to proceed with the statutory levy requirement. The Tasmanian section of the industry was a member at that time and is participated in that unanimous vote. In August 1991 at a national conference at Albury, attended by over 300 deer breeders, once again there was a unanimous vote for a voluntary levy until the statutory levy commenced. On 9 October 1991 the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia formally requested a statutory levy to begin from 1 July 1992. On 21 November 1991 the Deer Farmers Council of Tasmania advised the Minister of its withdrawal from the national organisation. , ' Since then there has been that conflict, letter writing campaign and so forth. However, of recent days strong support for the proposal has emerged. For example, the Victorian Deer Farmers Association-and Victoria has the biggest number of deer breeders in the Commonwealth-at its meeting on 19 March passed a vote by 59 to 2 in favour of all of the levies. Also, at an earlier time, in February 1991, at a special meeting of over 200 deer breeders, it support- the proposal. At the same time, 20 March, Mr John Andrews, the President of the New South Wales association, also confirmed that the New South Wales industry supported the proposal and rejected comments by the Junior Vice President of that association. The Australian Fallow Deer Society Inc. at the same time indicated that it had over 50 per cent of the national herd. It gave strong support in a letter of 19 March from its President, John Holder. On the same day the Red Deer Society of Australia, the second largest of the three commercial deer varieties, also gave strong support. It made the point that as its deer produce all of the leviable products-venison, velvet and export livestock;-it will be the largest contributor. Therefore, there is that support there also. Overall I believe that there has been stronger support for the proposal here than has been the case with many other industries and therefore the proposal should be supported. I do hope that the two problems I referred to earlier can be solved. The first of those concerns Tasmania, which constitutes 8 per cent of the industry. It withdrew from the association because it had been critical of the deer industry development group, which is a deer advisory body to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. The point has been made by none other than the Minister for Primary Industry in Tasmania, Mr Robin Gray, that that State feels that it has an adequate State development arrangement for the industry, and there is a request to delay the Bill to allow time for more discussions. The industry does recognise that it has a challenge to bring the Tasmanians back into the fold. I understand that they have been invited to the next annual general meeting of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia this month, and hopefully that will be accepted by them. At that meeting there will be a review of the memberShip of the deer industry development group. The second problem mentioned in the correspondence and in the phone calls received is. this potential problem of double charging or double levies, namely, a levy both on an animal with regard to, say, velvet and as a live export. I believe that this is a matter of misunderstanding. I do ask the Minister to clarify the situation about double levying. There should not be any, and I anticipate there is no need for there to be any. That would then remove one of the criticisms that have been apparent from some of the dissidents. Mr Crean-Does not section 6(2) cover that?",84
292,Mr LLOYD,CHARGES COLLECTION AMENDMENT,"lam asking the Minister, when he replies, to make it clear that there is no way in which there could be double charging, and then it will be on the record so that, when any further inquiries are received or arguments are raised by people who may want to say that they do not like the proposal because that could happen, one can definitely say it will not happen. My understanding is that this matter will be referred briefly to a Senate committee, which will provide some opportunity to further clarify the situation and encourage negotiations between the sections of the industry. This should not be used as any reason to basically delay or impede the legislation. Therefore, the coalition supports the legislation and commends the industry for making that very important step to be part of the overall rural industries research and development arrangements. .",86
293,Mr COURTICE,CHARGES COLLECTION AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill forms part of a package of five Bills to institute levies and charges on the· deer industry in order to fund a research and development program. As the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said, it is pleasing to see so many smaller, newer and, one may say, exotic primary industries come into line with the larger primary industries in regard to research and development, which is the key for the future. It is the case, as the honourable member for Murray says, that agriculture is going to be one of the sunrise industries. It certainly does lead the way in many aspects in regard to the recognition of research and development. The proposed levies and charges have been requested by the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia which represents the majority of deer farmers in Australia. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on the slaughter of deer in Australia. . There are four other Bills in this package. Three provide for a charge on the export of deer produced in Australia, a levy on the sale of deer velvet produced and sold in Australia or used in the production of other goods in Australia and a charge on the export of deer velvet produced in Australia. The fifth Bill in this package makes provision for consequential amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. As I said, it is good to see so many innovative industries. I fully concur with the honourable member for Murray in regard to kangaroos. There is a massive potential there to utilise and farm a natural resource. As technology improves, we will be able to do that. It does make sense to value. add in regard to kangaroos. In my area emus and ostriches are now being introduced and farmed because of their potential. Marron, fibre goats and fresh water fish are also now coming to the fore. It was pleasing to see the goat fibre levy Bills come through-I think it was only last year or the year before-as well as the course grains legislation which came through last week. As the honourable member for Murray also said-in fact, he has clearly covered the major background to this Bill-there are approximately 1,000 deer farmers in Australia with something like 155,000 to 160,000 deer. The majority-something like half-do reside in Victoria. I guess that, while we in Queensland do have the best climate in the world, it is not as conducive to deer breeding as is the climate in the southern States. So I guess we do have to let the south have some industries to itself. The Deer Farmers. Federation of Australia is the sole industry representative organisation, other than specific breed-that is, fallow, red, or rusa-societies. It has about 550 members, which is a high percentage of farms in comparison with any rural industry. At a deer industry workshop in 1989, which was sponsored by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, the research priorities for the industry were considered and it was decided that, although farm based production research was important, it was not the priority. The RIRDC, in consultation with the DFFA, commissioned Australian Agricultural Consulting and Marketing Co, Pty Ltd to conduct a deer marketing and production study, the results of which were released in June 1991. The study looked at the strategic priorities for research into the production, marketing and processing aspects of the deer industry. At an annual general meeting of the DFFA held on 22 March 1991, the following resolution was.passed unanimously: ... that a slaughter levy and velvet levy be accepted and working within the time frame for it to be finalised by the end of June 1992. The Deer Farrn'ers Council of Tasmania was a member of the DFFA at the time. As the honourable member for Murray has also pointed out, the Tasmanian deer industry has about 85 deer farmers and accounts for about 8 per cent of the national herd. At an open meeting of the DFFA in August 1991, which was attended by approximately 300 people, the meeting voted unanimously for a voluntary levy on deer slaughterings and on deer numbers behind wire to raise revenue for the RIRDC until the statutory levy was available. On 23 September 1991 the managing director of the RIRDC wrote to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) informing him that the RIRDC and the DFFA had reached an agreement whereby the RIRDC had offered to finance an industry development program up to $200,000 for each of the next three years, dependent upon an industry commitment of at least $1 i for each $2 from the RIRDC in 1990-91 and rising to donar for dollar in 1993-94. Ifl summary, the program is expected to include: evaluation of livestock marketing systems; market development, with initial focus on the domestic food services sector, then export; information systems on livestock supply and product markets; livestock and meat trading and training; velvet trading. language - d training; production studies with a focus on nutrition, carcass quality and evaluation of production systems; animal health studies, including quarantine; communication with industry practitioners; and program management. At least two-thirds of available funds in the first year are to be directed. to market development activity. The focus will be on product standards adding value to the product and extension and training on the use of the products, especially venison. Good links with the food services sector are being developed and product handling, user information and training packages are expected to be key components of the market development project. The program is not expected to include product advertising and the Corporation considers there would be diseconomies in trying to separate the research, development and promotional elements for such a small industry at this stage. On 9 October 1991 the DFFA wrote to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy formally requesting the introductionl of statutory levy arrangements from 1 July 1992. Tasmania was a member of the DFFA at that time. On 21 November 1991, the Deer Fanners Council of Tasmania wrote to the Minister advising that the Council had withdrawn membership from the DFFA, citing the following reasons: . . . members do not want to be burdened with further levies. Our members consider the deer industry Action Plan to be inappropriate to Tasmanian circumstances. The Minister replied to that letter, indicating that the proposed statutory levies were going to replace the existing voluntary levy arrangements and would be a more equitable arrangement; that there is no power under the Constitution to grant exemption to a State from a Commonwealth charge, levy or excise, and nor should there be; that Tasmanians cannot isolate themselves from developments in the industry, particularly as the mainland States already fonn a significant market for that State's deer and deer products; and that it is clear that it is the will of the majority the deer industry to· have statutory· levy arrangements introduced and that the Minister would be introducing legislation to give effect to such. The Minister recommended that the Deer Fanners Council of Tasmania should have further discussions with the DFFA and RIRDC to resolve the differences. The Tasmanian concerns are not unanimous, as four producers are contributing to a voluntary levy on deer slaughterings and deer behind wire until statutory levy arrangements are in place. Further, the Fallow Deer Society and the Red Deer Society-which represent deer breeds that account fQr 90 per cent qf deer in Australia and which include Tasmanian members-have endorsed the full levy package. . During the drafting of the deer industry legislation, a number of potential loopholes were identified which also had the. potential of undennining the levy base. At a telephone conference of the DFFA and State delegates in February 1992, there was unanimous support for an export charge on deer velvet and live deer. This was subsequently conveyed to the Minister. The conference stated that, contrary to some misconceptions in the deer industry, the proposed deer velvet export charge would be imposed only in cases when, at the time of export, velvet had not been previously sold and therefore was not subject to levy under the proposed velvet sale levy. It stated that, prior to 1992, there had been only small ad hoc shipments of live deer. However-and it is good news-the prospect of an expanding live deer export market to Korea would divert deer from slaughter and seriously undennine the·deer slaughter levy base. I agree with the honourable member for Murray: it would be good if it were possible for the Tasmanian industry to see the common sense of coming into line and being part of the whole industry. I think that will happen over time. We have seen in almost all other cases concerning research and development that, even if there has been some small amount of disagreement irutially, people have seen the advantage of a unified approach to of research and development. We are one nation; one country. Whether it be Tasmania, Victoria or Queensland, R&D· is equally important to the whole industry. I am very pleased to support the Bill and I am pleaSed that the Opposition is doing so as well.",86
294,Mr ANDREW,CHARGES COLLECTION AMENDMENT,"Wakefield) (10.07 p.m.)I, too, am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in this debate and I rise to support the D-r Slaughter Levy Bill, Deer Velvet Levy Bill, Deer Velvet Export Charge Bill, Deer Export Charge Bill and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amen'clment Bill which are before the House. As previous speakers have indicated, the legislation will establish a deer industry res-arch development fund through industry leVies and government contributions. I think it would be unnecessarily repetitious for me to retrace the already detailed history of the industry given by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) and the background to the legislation which has already been covered more than adequately by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in the magnanimous way for which you are well known, you will forgive me if! pause now to observe that this legislation will give the facilities so that levies can in fact be charged against the industry to raise the dough needed for research and development in the industry. As the Minister for Primary Industries and - nergy. (Mr Crean) will be aware, the funding IS. reqUITed to buck up the industry, because without this sort of legislation there IS a real danger that it may stagnate. I know that the industry did not go fawning to the Minister in orde- t- have this legislation passed, but in fact Indicated that it thought the participation in those sorts of research and development arrangements which already exist for other industries would be a good idea. I do not want to be frivolous about the legislation.",89
295,Mr LLOYD,CHARGES COLLECTION AMENDMENT,You could have fooled us so far.,89
296,Mr ANDREW,CHARGES COLLECTION AMENDMENT,"No, I genuinely do not want to be frivolous about the legislation because, as has been pointed out by previous speakers, .this is an industry of which Australia ought to be proud. The Australian deer population has been expanding by 25 per cent a year. It is currentlr. estimated that are 1,000 farms carrying something like 155,000 deer. These figures have been largely derived from the industry itself and not from the normal sources applying to primary industry, such as ABARE. This is a sunrise industry, and much of the innovation and much of the adventurous approach to new industries that characterise Australian agriculture can be seen in the development of the Australian deer industry. The significance of this legislation and this opportunity to raise funds through these Bills is pronounced when one considers that until now the deer breeders have been receiving funds through the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation which is financed by the Government through the special rural research fund and voluntary levies. In order to raise sufficient funds to implement an effective research and development program, the industry has chosen this statutory levy on all producers. I think it is a credit to the enthusiasm that deer producers have for their industry that they have chosen to take this particular course, as has been clearly outlined by the honourable member for Murray. A measure of the commitment that the industry has to research and development can be gleaned simply by comparing the figure that has been rai-ed as .a result of the voluntary levies, which was about $25,000 last year, with the money that is anticipated as a result of the statutory l-vy, which will be in the vicinity of $100,000 In 1992-93. That $100,000 provides a real opportunity for the deer industry to be involved in the sort of research and development that characterises primary industries around Australia. As previous speakers have indicated, the legislation before the House will set an operative rate of 18c a kilogram on a hot dressed carcass with a maximum rate of 30c on venison, an operative rate of $10 a head of live deer exported and a maximum rate of $20 a head, and a 5 percent operative rate on velvet, where there will also be a maximum rate of 7 per cent. As I said in my opening remarks I do not think I should delay the House by running through the history of the industry, but may there I ?ri?g in a synopsis of the industry by pOIntIng out to the House. that deer were introduced into Australia in the early nineteenth century from Europe, Asia and North America. As we now know, there are fallow deer, which make up the majority of farmed deer, and red deer, which represent the largest number of deer currently being farmed in Queensland. Of the venison currently being produced on Australian deer farms, much of it is consumed locally, and that consumption meets about a third of the Australian demand. The remainder of the venison to meet the demand in Australia is imported from New Zealand. Under the operation of CER, Australian venison producers are finding themselves under some pressure from New Zealand producers. In fact, the collapse of communism in eastern Europe has meant that the once lucrative West German market, which was open to New Zealand producers, has now been largely minimised. As a result of that, the New Zealanders, having been denied the West German market or portions thereof, are looking for alternative markets and, increasingly, making venison available to Australia. This puts real pressure on Australia's venison producers. There is something of an irony there in in an electorate such as mine, a large number of the venison producers are in areas that were formerly used for dairy farms. The very problems that the dairy farmers faced are now being faced by the venison producers with the competition that they have to contend with from across the Tasman. We might tonight ask ourselves the question: why does New Zealand succeed and Australia fail in this sort of competitive cise? It is fair to make three brief observations. First, it is fair to say that the New Zealanders have been much more market oriented than we have in the past and in a number of areas-Kiwi fruit is a classic one - we have actually seen the New Zealanders as quite aggressive marketers and they have become a role model for Australians. But it is also fair to make two other observations. The cost of production has fallen in New Zealand-despite popular opinion, largely as a result of its industrial relations and transport reform, and as a result of the adoption of a GST there, an adoption which has been endorsed by the New Zealand Farmers Federation. So we might confidently expect that a tax which reduces the tax burden borne by producers could advantage Australian producers just as it has advantaged New Zealand producers. It is true that the deer industry in Australia but three or four years ago was an industry going through a great deal of speculation. Stock was coming in from New Zealand that was expensive. It was being bought up by Australian producers who thought they saw in this stock an opportunity to raise the profile and the genetic material available in the Australian industry. In fact, that balloon burst and, in many ways, unkind though that has been to deer producers, that has been a good thing because some of the ridiculous speculation that existed in the industry has now evaporated and we find the industry now focusing on what is an economically viable and sensible course open to it. That only highlights the need for effective research and development in the Australian deer industry if we are not only going to match our New Zealand counterparts but also preferably outthat, perform them with Australian innovation, Australian adventure and the enthusiasm that Australians have for new product. This debate tonight is valuable, not because there is any controversy in the House but because it focuses attention on an industry which has been largely ignored by the rest Of Australia. As previous speakers have said, we have a great deal to be excited about in terms of sunrise industries in Australian agriculture exerand horticulture. Even in the traditional Australian wheat and wool industries new enterprises are being developed which make them the sorts of places where people may well want to place some risk capital. We will see that, no doubt, on Thursday in the National Wool Day display that is going to be held here in Parliament House. It is not only in the wheat and wool industries but also in horticulture, meat marketing, the ostrich industry and all the others named by previous speakers where we see the opportunity .for sunrise industry resulting from Australian innovation in agriculture. I support the comments made by the honourable member for Murray and the honourable member for Hinkler. I hope honourable members will forgive me if I conclude my remarks in this debate as I began them, by indicating that the only thing inappropriate about this legislation is that we are debating it at Easter eve when we should be debating it at yuletide. I would like to indicate that the legislation before the House is good news for Rudolph, Dasher, Dancer, Comet, Prancer and Blitzen, and for all of the Santa Clauses dependent on the .deer industry in Australia.",89
297,Mr FITZGIBBON,CHARGES COLLECTION AMENDMENT,"Hllllter) (10.18 p.m.)I will not try to match the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) in the wit and pun department, but I must say to him that I did appreciate his jokes. I thought he summed up the whole situation very cleverly. I must commend and congratulate the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) and the honourable member for Wakefield for their wisdom and good common sense in supporting this Deer Slaughter Levy Bill which has been brought before the House by the Government. I am going to make an admission-which is somewhat rare for a politician-and tell honourable members here and now that I am no expert on deer farming matters, so I will not try to dazzle them with science; I will just sum up this legislation in simple terms. Briefly, the package of five Bills before us seeks to institute levies and charges on the deer industry in order to fund a research and development program. We so often hear from some people on the other side that we are bad guys. Are we nasty? Are we doing the wrong thing by the deer farmers? Well, let us look at the situation. We are imposing these levies and charges for the development of a program for one reason only. The reason-as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), who is at the table, has just advised me-is that the industry requested the very thing that we are providing. I have about 10 minutes, so I will not take too long on the machinery parts of the Bills. I will, however, make some references to the deer farming operations in my electorate of Hunter. In 1986 I had the pleasure of accompanying the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, when he officially opened the first abattoir to process deer meat in Australia. The abattoir, Mirrabooka Meats, is owned and operated by Mr Michael Scarfe. In the early years of operation of the abattoir, Michael Scarfe suffered the ups and downs that seem to abound when one is trying to get a new industry established. But I would like to think that the worse is now behind Michael. The recession, of course, has affected Mirrabooka Meats, but Michael Scarfe remains confident of the future and is very supportive of the Bills now being debated. Michael is in favour of the legislation because he believes that it is the only way that the deer industry will have a voice in Federal Parliament. He is delighted to have the support of the Government in its agreeing to the recommendations made by the industry. 'We are going about it in the right way' j Ilaid Michael Scarfe. 'It is the only fair way the industry is going to support itself and be supported by the Government'. Mirrabooka Meats processes all varieties of deer including red, fallow, chital and rusa, et cetera. Last year Mirrabooka slaughtered 2,000 head, and 98 per cent was exported to Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, the Pacific islands including Fiji, New Guinea and America. Michael Scarfe is in favour of the levy that will promote research in the industry. He was fortunate to win a guernsey froni the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation to study in Japan and Singapore, so he says that he knows the value that the Corporation can have for the deer industry. Michael commented that the legislation widely covers what is needed in the industry. For too long the industry has been fragmented; trying to go it alone and not realising its full potential. In Michael Scarfe's words, the industry not only needs to support itself but also needs the support of the government body to stop illegal slaughtering and similar styles of operation. Mr Scarfe strongly concurs with the statement of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy that the deer industry is emerging as another facet of the rural industry with enormous potential to broaden the base of agriculture. Mr Scarfe's only concern, of course, is New Zealand competition. It is hard to compete with New Zealand when that country has a herd of 1.2 million deer behind wire and Australia has only 155,000. This affects the cost of the end product and is the reason why venison is more highly priced than other meats, Mr Scarfe told me. Mr Scarfe is also very pleased that legislation will provide for a professional approach to be taken to the production, slaughter and promotion of deer meat. As he says, because of its extremely low fat content it should be promoted as a health food. However, it is true to say that to date there has been little promotion of venison and it appears only rarely on restaurant menus. Anyone who has tasted venison steaks or venison sausages will know that it is a delicious alternative to other meats. The DFFA, which represents the majority of deer farmers in Australia, has Mr Bob Coombs as its Executive Director. Mr Coombs is supportive of the proposed legislation. He said that the deer industry needs to change from being production driven to serving the needs of consumers first. The DFFA also identified the need to develop an industry information base, a need highlighted by the recently released study into the deer industry by the Australian Agricultural Consulting and Management Co. In the five minutes remaining to me I will not repeat information which has already been conveyed to the House by previous speakers. I will make a couple of suggestions, though, including that more up to date information about the industry should be circulated to deer farmers by an efficient method. I think dairy farmers do it very well with their magazine which keeps dairy fanners very well informed about what is happening in their industry. Mr Coombs also stresses that the industry must make wise use of government development initiatives, such as the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. Deer farming is very capital intensive. Not only are the animals themselves very expensive to buy, but the intensive use of high wire fencing, pasture improvement, veterinary charges and so on is very costly. Therefore, the deer farmer; like any other farmer, has to get the best return for his or her outlays and endeavours. One of the best means of doing this is by industry research, and this has been proven many times. Where would our agricultural industry be without the research that is continually being carried out? Where would the cattle industry be without the eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis, without research into the effect of chemical residues and without the latest vaccinations for worm control? Where would the dairy industry and our great wool industry be without pasture improvement techniques and land care management plans? Where would the. wine industry be without viticulture research for wine improvement and improved grape production? The list is endless. Research and development are important not only to our agricultu(al industry but to any other industry as well. . It is very pleasing that the powerful lobby of Tasmanian deer farmers, which was initially opposed to the introduction of a compulsory slaughter levy and velvet levy, has not influenced members of the Opposition, who have been sufficiently generous to support this Bill. I am pleased that the arrangement which this Bill sets in place will meet with industry approval. In last Saturday's Newcastle Herald there was an interesting article on deer farming in the Hunter Valley which centred on the Holder family's efforts on the Allyn River in my electorate of Hunter. It gives a good outline of the difficulties being faced by Mr Holder. The reason for the difficulties which all deer farmers in Australia face is that the New Zealand industry has several advantages: the number of deer compared with what we have in Australia, and the fact that New Zealanders eat 400 tonnes of venison each year, whereas our much larger population in Australia eats the same quantity of venison. As well, up to 65 per cent of the venison consumed in Australia is venison which is imported from New Zealand. I know that the New Zealand industry is about 10 years older than the Australian industry, and I know that the New Zealanders spend a lot of money on public awareness and consumption campaigns; but is it not crazy that we should eat New Zealand rather than Australian venison? The New Zealand industry has actually gone out and promoted its meat as being low in fat with virtually no cholesterol, and it has conveyed the message that venison has tremendous potential as a health food. 'But is not Australian venison low in fat with virtually no cholesterol? We have to get our act together, and we must do that if we are to sell our product. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) and the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) will welcome the health benefits of venison. And it may be that the Opposition, while it is in a generous mood tonight, will be prepared to include a few kilos of venison in its GST typical shopping basket. Venison is certainly better eating than dog food and detergents! I have other deer farms in my electorate, those of Mr Darren Heslop and Mr Beresford Smith. I would like to make brief mention of the contribution that these folk in the Hunter are making to the Australian deer farming industry. I am afraid that my time has expired, Mr Deputy Speaker, so I will leave it at that. NA",91
298,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted. I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Professor von Hayek",93
299,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I would like to pay tribute to Professor Friedrich August von Hayek, one of the greatest individuals of the twentieth century, who died on Tuesday, 24 March at the grand age of 92. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) and Senator Kemp have already alerted the Parliament to his passing. Professor von Hayek, along with Dr Ludwig von Mises, was one of the great economists and political philosophers of the Austrian school who took forward and refined to an exact degree the earlier works of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill and others. In doing so, they established in concrete for time immemorial the absolute principles of free market capitalism. The contribution of people such as von Hayek cannot be judged too highly. The latter day disciples, such as the Americans, Henry Hazlitt and Milton Friedman, owed their all to the pioneering courage and thoroughness of the Austrians. I say 'courage' because people such as von Hayek stood largely alone for long periods against the rest of the world throughout some of its most difficult history. Von Hayek established with incredible clarity that undeniable link between personal liberty and economic freedom. He demonstrated that we cannot ever have the former, unless we also have the latter. Any serious student of economics, politics or philosophy who has not given adequate time and consideration to understanding this link will always have a yawning gap in his education. Regrettably, the simple lesson of that link has tragically been ignored numerous times throughout history, including the history of the twentieth century. This has resulted in the suppression and death of many millions of people with the misery endured in recent decades, by the peoples of eastern Europe being the classic example. Von Hayek warned not only of the evils of communism, socialism, fascism and, indeed, all forms of totalitarianism, but also of the 'softer' forms of socialism that were manifesting themselves at the time in countries such as Sweden and Britain. His book The Road to Serfdom published in 1944 informed many, for the first time, of the ultimate evils of interventionism in government, however wellintentioned such intervention might be at the time. Whether it be communism in Russia, Keynesianism in Britain or even the accord in Australia, there is an indelible message in von Hayek's writing that we ignore at our peril. 'Those who ignore history are condemned to repeat it' is a most apt saying in this regard. Friedrich von Hayek was born in Vienna in 1899 and became a naturalised British citizen in 1938 during Hitler's rise to power. He had published more than 25 books and some 250 papers and shared the Nobel Prize for economics in 1974. Australia was honoured with a visit by von Hayek in 1976. I well recall the impressive performance he gave on the television program Monday Conference during that trip. It has been said that his ideas did more for Europe's freedom than any other individual. The clear logic of the principles he championed touched so many people in so many countries. I clearly remember when I first read his monumental work, The Constitution of Liberty, nearly 20 years ago, that it had a profound effect in shaping my life. I am forever grateful to this extraordinary man for instilling in me the true worth of personal liberty. Not a day goes by when the concepts that he espoused do not influence my actions in some way. I have no doubt that von Hayek saw the collapse of communism in Europe more clearly than anyone else. It certainly would have been no surprise to him. It is somehow fitting that, on the day of his death, the last of Europe's communist dictatorships, Albania, finally embraced democracy. Let us hope that the communism and totalitarianism that still clings on in China, Cuba and other parts of the world can be largely swept aside before this century is out. If that happens, it is something that Friedrich von Hayek not only would have approved of, but would have predicted. Long live the ideas that he developed, believed in and shared with us. The world has lost one of its greatest scholars. Employment of New Zealand Shearers",93
300,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"This Thursday, 2 April, will be national wool day, a day on which much emphasis will be placed on developing and promoting Australian wool. I especially congratulate members of this House who are associated with national wool day and the promotion that we will have in Parliament House. I hope the day will be a great successMr Deputy Speaker, do you realise that over 42 per cent of the Australian wool clip is shorn by New Zealand shearers? Unless action is taken, in a few years the total Australian wool clip will be shorn by New Zealand shearers. Australia will have lost yet another skill. Honourable members may have noticed tents outside .the front of Parliament House. Australian shearers have come to Parliament House to highlight to politicians and to the general. public the plight of Australian shearers. Today, more than 50 per cent of Australian shearers are out of work. I am not anti-New Zealand and I do not necessarily believe that New Zealanders should not be allowed to work in Australia; but I do believe that it should not be open slather, as it is at the moment. I believe that New Zealanders should have work visas. In that way we would control the industries that they go into. If there already is unemployment in Australia in a particular industry, as there is in the shearing industry, common sense and logic must surely dictate that work visas should be issued. In that way a quota system can be implemented and the work loads regulated. As there is no requirement for visiting New Zealanders to acquire visas or work permits, which is required of any other visitor to Australia, this unregulated, open access policy is leaving the shearing industry and other industries open to abuse by visitors from New Zealand. There is evidence of New Zealand shearers working in breach of awards and employers setting out deliberately to recruit New Zealand labour at the expense of Australian shearers. In effect, Australian workers and the Australian economy are carrying the burden of New Zealand being an economic basket case under the GST and privatisation-driven Bolger Government. I suspect that in the coming weeks an announcement will· be made indicating a reduction in migration to Australia; indeed, a statement was made by the ACTU last weekend. I think the argument will be used that it is because of the unemployment situation in Australia. I do not want to get into a debate on migration, but I make the point that up to 150,000 Australian jobs are being filled by New Zealanders in the shearing industry, the hospitality industry, the construction industry, as well as others. An incident having occurred in the gallery",94
301,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! Those people in the gallery will cease.,95
302,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I have been told that New Zealanders receive between $NZ1.35 and $NZ1.40 for every Australian dollar when returning home. If visiting New Zealanders have worked here .for less than six months, they receive a 100 per cent refund on all income tax paid in Australia. Mr Ronald Edwards-A tax rort.",95
303,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"It is a tax rort. The sum taken out of Australia by visiting New Zealand shearers each year is approximately $130m. I am not opposed to long term residents from New Zealand, but I· am opposed to temporary visiting shearers. I know that we have a two-way open door policy, that we are coming out of a recession and that many Australians are out of work, but too many Australian shearers do not have jobs, so I think a work visa for New Zealand shearers should be a requirement. I admit that things are tough in New Zealand, but too many Kiwis are packing their bags for Oz, as is illustrated in an advertisement in a New Zealand paper. Surely our first duty is to protect employment in Australia. The wool industry is important to us, as are Australian jobs. Even if only as a temporary measure, I believe that work permits for New Zealand shearers should be introduced and those who are here must abide by the award. It would be a tragedy and a disgrace if the wool industry, of which most Australians are proud, were totally dependent on New Zealand shearers; If something is not done, and done quickly, that will be the case. An incident having occurred in the gallery",95
304,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! Ifthose people in the gallery continue to make noiseS like that, I will have the gallery cleared. Wheat",95
305,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"The future of the Australian Wheat Board's ability to successfully market the nation's wheat crop is at serious risk. The 1993-94 season looms as a deadline for a decision by the Government on whether Australia should retain the AWB as a singledesk wheat seller. Major multinational grain traders operating in Australia have recently begun a campaign against the Australian Wheat Board's monopoly under the guise of the Australian Grain Exporters Association, the AGEA. Ironically, the AGEA's eight members include subsidiaries of North American and European traders, namely, Continental Grain, Cargill, ConAgra Inc. and Louis Dreyfus Ltd. There is absolutely nothing Australian about this group whatsoever. Replacing the Australian Wheat Board with such organisations would not be in the interests of the Australian wheat grower. Recently, Taiwan signed a contract for Australian wheat after a seven-year campaign by the board to enter its lucrative market. Taiwan is expected to buy 50,000 tonnes of grain from Australia this year. Foreign grain companies would not have bothered putting in this effort on behalf of the Australian wheat grower. Instead, private grain traders would have simply shipped wheat from other sources-in many cases, subsidised sources. Given ABARE's recent prediction that average farm income will bea negative $30,000 this financial year, taking the time to source new markets and ensure benefits for growers is paramount to the continued viability of· an important export earning industry. The Australian Wheat Board has successfully marketed Australian wheat since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Today Australia is within the top five wheat exporting countries in the world. The Australian Wheat Board has maintained this position· against all odds; that is, against the escalating subsidy war of the European Community and the United States of America. In excess of 80 per cent of annual world wheat trade goes to markets which have single-desk buyers, including Japan, China, Egypt, Iraq, Iran and the Federation of Russian States. A single-desk seller in these circumstances is more strongly placed to hold its negotiating position. The majority of our competitors have the benefit of a 100 per cent Government guarantee on credit sales. Further, the Australian Wheat Board cover for sales through the Export Finance Insurance Corporation is usually around 80 per cent. Only in Australia is the residual risk borne the growers. The Australian Wheat Board has for 60 years looked after the interests of the Australian wheat farmer. The domestic market, which accounts for about three million tonnes or more than· 20 per cent of the average harvest, is now totally deregulated. The Australian Wheat Board separates wheat into 40 classes based on protein levels and other qualities, and pays farmers accordingly. Massive savings have been passed on to growers through port and rail reforms initiated and followed through by the Australian Wheat Board. Growers are guaranteed payment within 21 days of delivery. The Australian Wheat Board does not shy from marketing efforts in more difficult countries, as the Taiwanese example illustrates. I challenge the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to support the National and Liberal Party policy of singledesk selling. I further challenge the Minister to get out from underneath his own desk and support the National and Liberal Party policy to underwrite 95 per cent of the Australian wheat crop based on a harvest price. While ever the Minister procrastinates, he is undermining customer confidence and risking another protracted debate of the wool controversy proportions. This must be avoided at all costs. The fact that in excess of 80 per cent of annual world wheat trade is conducted through single-desk selling to single-desk buying should be a major consideration for the Minister, and I challenge the Minister to take a position sooner and not later. It is far too important an industry for the Minister to procrastinate on this issue. Employment of New Zealand ShearersAboriginal Legal Service",95
306,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,ADJOURNMENT,"I join the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) in his speech concerning the Australian Workers Union members and shearers who currently find themselves unemployed. The concern that I have is precisely the concern that he has, that with the current open-door policy between by Australia and New Zealand a significant number of New Zealand shearers are coming over here and taking the work away from Australian shearers. That is one aspect, which is the immigration aspect. The other aspect is clearly the question of tax evasion whereby they do not reach the tax threshold and simply move off without reaching it. I believe that on two counts we have a difficulty we have to adqress. I know that it is not in the interests of any of the Australian farmers, either, to be supporting a situation in which· Australian workers are being denied work and well-trained people are being kept out of work, and at the same time· there is a tax rort going on. I am sure that many people would support that view. I thank the honourable member for Throsby for his remarks about Wool Day, because I think that will be a very important day for us. This is an issue that we will keep going on with, and I want to assure people who are interested in it that it is not a matter to which we will give just brief attention. It underpins a real concern that a number of us have. The honourable member for Throsby articulated that very well. I know that his remarks draw support from a number of people. I as() want to mention another matter. Towards the end of last year in Geraldton in Western Australia. I opened the Community Legal Service Centre. The Community Legal Service Centre has a staff of a full time solicitor, a full time legal secretary, a full time financial counsellor and a full time coordinator and child support adviser. The Community Legal Service Centre is designed to provide legal advice, effectively, and legal support to people on low incomes. The difficulty that that centre has had is that it has been opposed, and to some extent given an embargo, by three people in the town of Geraldton-a Mr Duncan Armstrong, a Mr George Giudice and a Mr Robert Glenn-who have been trying to make life very difficult for the centre. I represented Senator Michael Tate, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, in opening the centre. The other thing that concerns me is that not only have these people opposed the establishment of this centre, which breaks the legal stranglehold that they had over the availability of legal services in the town; but, further to that, they have also been attacking a lawyer with the Aboriginal Legal Service, a Mr Terry Malone. They have, in effect, been quite political about it because they persuaded Mr Eric Charlton, the National Party shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, to claim that Mr Malone is not doing his work because he is engaging in outside practice. I just want to put the record straight on this: Mr Malone was given the right of private practice because at the time he went there the· only way that the Aboriginal Legal Service could retain someone of his stature was to allow him to supplement his income. This was an arrangement entered into quite properly and quite freely. Similar arrangements are entered into in Queensland with the Aboriginal Legal Service. So in effect the Aboriginal Legal Service and the Community Legal Service Centre in Geraldton have had Mr Malone working particularly for them. Also, additionally, he has been able, quite properly, to make extra income. I might point out that the Aboriginals themselves have not complained about this. In fact, they rather take some pride in the fact that Mr Malone is not an inferior lawyer but one who is able to make his mark in the community at large. I have been concerned about that because more recently there was a case involving a Mr Ken Dan, a young Aboriginal who was arrested by a policeman for wearing a pair of surfer's sunglasses. Unfortunately, the policeman at the time did not understand that Ken Dan is a very successful surfer in Western Australia, be it that he is Aboriginal. The reason he had the pair of sunglasses was that it was one of those things that people like him are often offered as a result of their success in surfing. Had it not been for Mr Malone and the Aboriginal Legal Service, Mr Dan would not have been properly represented. I will not comment further on the outcome of the trial-that would not be proper-except to say that Mr Dan won the case and was properly represented by Mr Malone. The point I want to get on record here is that I am concerned about these attacks on the Community Legal Service Centre and the Aboriginal Legal Service and Mr Malone because I believe that he is doing a good job. There is nothing wrong with his taking outside practice, and I believe that the town of Geraldton is better served by having proper legal representation. I appreciate the opportunity to put this on the record in the House tonight. Mr Michael Kroger Mr ,MCARTHUR (Corangamite) (10.50 p.m.)-I wish to raise the issue of the very strong attack by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) on the Victorian Liberal Party President, Mr Kroger. Mr Kroger was qefending the rights of contract workers tQ work in the Camperdown abattoir. He was ably defended by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) for his role in defending the right of these workers to participate in work at Camperdown. The key issues before the Parliament and before Australia are: the industrial relations system, and in this situation there is the possibility for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to create jobs for some of those one million unemployed whom he has created; the role of picket lines; the role of enterprise agreements; productivity; and the role of the courts in relation to these issues. The abattoir at Camperdown is .in the heartland of Corangamite. It has a very poor track record in terms of its profitability, its operations and its previous owners. There has been an abysmal industrial relations record between the owners and the work force over the past 10 years. As I mentioned, in Australia we have this terrible situation of one million people unemployed. The track record of Mr Wally Curran, a very influential figure in the Labor movement and the Secretary of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, in creating jobs for his workers has been that 10 years ago there were 7,500 meatworkers employed in the export processing industry and now there are 1,700. In view of his record, how could he be an adviser to the Prime Minister on job creation? What would his contribution be in view of his great ability to reduce the number of jobs available? I offered the Prime Minister a formal invitation to come to. Camperdown to have a look at the job that Mr Curran had done and the way in which he had stopped this particular works operating and reduced jobs in the meat processing industry. I invited the Prime Minister to come and talk to management, to talk to the unionists and to talk to the picketers on the job. As usual, the Prime Minister did not take up my invitation to come to Camperdown; he took up a number of invitations to go to other businesses around Australia, but he did not come to one of the key industries in Victoria and have a look at what was actually going on. Mr Fami, the new owner, purchased the works in 1991 on the basis that he wanted to introduce some new work practices, get more productivity, make a change to the infamous tally system and introduce contract labour. On that basis he employed Troubleshooters, which was able to provide contract labour to .. work efficiently, get paid for the work that . they did and, in fact, work five days a week, which. is not always the norm in the meat industry, to get the tasks done. Mr Fami was following the example at Wodonga, where MCPhee's had 82 days of strike which cost $3m, but at the end of that they were able to employ contract meatworkers. There are now 325 jobs at that works and a 40 per cent improvement in productivity. Just think about it-a 40 per cent improvement in productivity by those contract workers. That is a far cry from what was suggested at Camperdown. The Camperdown owner wanted to repeat the exercise down there, but, of course, the AMIEU set up a picket line, so much so that to get to the job, the contract workers had to travel in a furniture van, leaving at 7 protected by a police force of between 40 and 80 men, along with police horses. The picket line was pretty rough; there was intimidation of the contract workers and standover tactics were adopted. All that is on the public record. Does the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) really defend the tactics of those picketers on that line during these fairly tough times? The town of Camperdown was divided and there were abusive telephone calls. This matter has been raised in this Parliament and also in the Victorian Parliament, where there has been false information and misrepresentation of the situation. The farmers have not been able to process their cattle, 40 jobs have not been created and, of course, the 170 jobs that used to be there are no longer available. The works are closed and the basic reasons are the outdated industrial relations practices going back to the nineteenth century, the luddite attitude of Secretary Wally Curran and also, of course, the leniency of the courts in interpreting the picket line situation. (TIme expired) Meat Industry: Industrial RelationsFightback!  p.m.)-I do not know the circumstances of the mater raised by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), but I do know enough about industrial relations and about the meat industry to know that that will not be all of the story. In all of these situationsDr Bob Woods-You said you did not know anything about it; now you are commenting.",96
307,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Lowe will cease interjecting.  enough about it, but I do know enough about the industry. I do not know the specific situation, but I do know the version presented to this chamber from the other side of the House will not be all of the story. The conditions at that abattoir are conditions that all were happy with over a long period and they took a long time to achieve. So, before I pass· a.m, and judgment, I would want to hear the other version, the other side of the story, to get a comprehensive picture. Tonight I want to talk about this shabby document, Fightback! The honourable member for Corangamite has just presented what appears to be the truth. Let us have a look at this shabby and deceitful document-the false presentation and the failure of those who sit opposite to come clean and explain the inaccuracies and the falsities that it contains. At the moment they are distributing information around Australia, trying to tell people that they are all going to be better off by having 'a 15 per cent tax imposed on the food they put in their mouths, on the clothes they put on their backs, on the shoes they put on their feet and on the fruit and vegetables they buy. The Opposition is saying to everybody, 'Don't you worry about that; you are all going to finish up with more money in your pocket'. But when Treasury does the analysis and we get a detailed examination, we find beyond doubt that 70 per cent of households of full time wage and salary earners and about 60 per cent of self-employed and farmer households will be worse off. That is indisputable fact. Then we find the truth is exposed about this document. The imposition of a 15 per cent tax on all those goods and services that are not taxable is about shifting the tax burden from the higher income groups down the line to the lower income groups. It is the old ideology; back to the old class society-it is as simple as that. The Treasury examination exposes that wage and salary earners and self-employed and farm households on $90,000 per year and more will be better off by between $15 and $105 per week. Each of the honourable members opposite has constituents trying to live on $105 per week, trying to survive on that, yet honourable members opposite say that is too much. This document also says there are too many people on welfare and those who are on welfare are being paid ,too much. That is the real essence of what the Opposition is about. I want to remind those opposite of page 116 and the dishonesty of this document, and the failure of those who sit opposite to stand up in this place and explain it. Page 116 states: ... we will continue to provide preferred tax ment to the family home-in other words, we will not tax the family home. Page 225, obviously written by another author at another time, without regard to the truth or consistency, states: In the case of an average home the net Goods and Services Tax impact is $2856 after discounting the effect of abolishing wholesale sales tax and petrol tax. Which version is true? Or are not new homes not family homes? Are new homes not classified as family homes? Is that what Opposition members are saying? Why have they not got up in this place and explained themselves? Why the mute response over there? This has been raised for several weeksMr Andrew-That's not building.",98
308,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable member for Wakefield! '  they sit mute, nobody responds to it. Which version is true-116 or 225? Or shall we tum to page 3? Page 3 is really the clanger. It states: Third, we aim to make the operation of the taxation system transparent and simple to the taxpayer. But page 225 says that the impact of a goods and services tax on a new home is $2,856not levied at the time of sale but levied on the inputs to the construction of the house. That is transparent taxation, is it? That is putting it out where people can see it? Would it not be better to put it out and say to the public, 'We will be taxing all homes, but new homes are not family homes. '? Mr Andrew-What about wholesale sales tax?",99
309,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Wakefield will cease inJerjecting. Mr Downer interjecting,99
310,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I warn the honourable member for Mayo.  bers should explain themselves. The clear message out of all of this is that people are waking up to them. People are awake to the fact that this is a package of lies, it is a treatpackage of misinformation, and they know that they cannot have a tax of 15 per cent levied on the food they eat, the clothes they wear, the shoes they put on their feet and still have more money in their pockets. So I say to those opposite that it is time they got up, explained themselves, told the truth, came clean on which version is true. Tomorrow evening I will talk to them some more about the effect on small business and how they are going to hammer small business into the ground with the financial burden the Opposition is going to impose on them.

312,Mr RUDDOCK,PAPERS,"the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 6 November 1991: (1) Did he claim within the Budget and in his press release MPS 51/91 that there would be a 37 per cent cost recovery of outlays within his Department; if so, will he provide a detailed breakdown of (a) where the recovery is expected to be made and (b) what sum will be recovered. (2) Did he announce within the Budget and in his press release MPS 51/91 the introduction of a new fee which is to apply to visas of all visitors other than tourists; if so, will visa class 660 and 661 remain exempt; if not, why not. (3) Will any fees be introduced or increased with respect to any visa classes not referred to in his press release MPS 51/91; if so, (a) which visa classes, (b) what sum will be raised and (c) what will be the (i) capital and (ii) recurrent costs associated with the charges. (4) Did he announce that the changes to fee structures referred to in part (2) would be implemented on 1 October 1991; if so, have all increases taken effect; if not, why not. (5) What will be the (a) capital costs associated with implementing the announced visitor visa changes and (c) revenue raised by the changes. (6) Do overseas visa issuing posts have the facilities to recover the new fees. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I did claim in my media release MPS 51/91 that there would be a 37% cost recovery of outlays within my portfolio. (a),(b) A detailed breakdown of categories of receipts, and sums to be recovered by my portfolio in 199192 is contained in Table 5 ""Other Estimates of Receipts"", Budget Paper No.2 ""The Commonwealth Public Account 1991-92"" at pages 33 and 34. (2) I did announce in my media release MPS 51/91 that a new fee of $20 would be introduced NA on 1 October 1991 on applications from visitors other than tourists. That announcement did not refer to any visa class. However, I received advice and representations that the implementation of that decision would not be workable and may adversely affect tourism. The Government recently decided that, with the exception of applications made in visa class 661, a processing fee of $30 will apply to applications by visitors proposing to remain in Australia for ' more than three months or where they want a multiple journey visa valid for four years or the remaining validity of the passport, whichever is the lesser. These fees were introduced on 1 February 1992. Provision has been made for a limited number of exemptions from the fees. (3) Yes. (a) With effect from 1 February 1992: (i) the Government introduced an application processing fee of $200 for applications lodged by visitors who have entered Australia by means of a visitor visa for which there was no application processing fee payable. Persons who enter in these circumstances are only permitted to stay to a maximum of three months in this category and applications for further temporary entry permits have to be and (b) recurrent considered afresh. (ii) the application processing fee for temporary residence visas was increased from $100 to $130. 1991-92 Outyears $m $m (b) Revenue: Visitors N/E N/E Temp Res 1.50 3.68 N/B = no estimate possible (c) (i) Capital Costs Nil Nil (c) (ii) Recurrent Costs Nil Nil (4) See answer (2) (5) The visitor visa application processing fee is a new fee and there is no historical operational data upon which revenue estimates can be based. Bureau of Immigration Research data on the stated intentions of arriving visitors was used as the basis for estimates of revenue. It was estimated that additional costs and revenues from implementing visitor visa changes would be: (a) Capital Costs 0.07 (b) Recurrent Costs 0.13 (c) Revenue (Visitors) 1.85 (6) Yes. Advice from posts is that collection of visitor visa fees will not significantly affect existing fee collection arrangements. Sunderland Flying Boat (Question No. 1282) Dr Harry Edwards asked the Minister for the Arts and Territories, upon notice, on 25 February 1992: Has her attention been drawn to a campaign to bring to Australia the last flyable Sunderland flying boat in the world; if so, (a) is the flying boat for sale; (b) Is it beached in the south of England, (c) What is the historic significance of the flying boat to Australia, (d) Has she been approached to assist in a project to acquire the flying boat and fly it to Australia, (e) Is there a plan to maintain the flying boat in a proposed national aviation museum, (f) Is there any attempt to have the flying boat displayed in the National Maritime Museum, and (g) What role will the Government play in the project. Ms Fatin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Government does not know if the flying boat is for sale. (b) The Government is not aware of the flying boat's present location. (c) Sunderland aircraft have a record of historic importance and relevance to Australian military and civil aviation. (d) No. The last approach to the Government about the possibility of assistance was in 1987. (e) No. The Government has no plans to establish· a national aviation museum. (f) No. (g) None. Defence Service Home Loans (Question No. 1287) 1991-92 Outyears Mr Filing asked the Minister for Veterans' $m $m Affairs, upon notice, on 25 February 1992: .Nil Was it part of the initial Defence Service Homes 0.30 Loan (DSHL) agreement with Westpac that (a) 4.25 Westpac could extract legal fees from a DSHL account held at Westpac and (b) in the case of a loan comprising components set at two different interest rates, repayment could be arranged so that more of the repayment was directed to one component than the other. Mr Humphreys-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Agreement between the Commonwealth and Westpac provides that an entitled applicant and/or a borrower would pay no other fees and no more in fees with respect to applications for DSH benefits than the Bank's other housing loan customers. There has been no change to the Agreement between the Commonwealth and Westpac since it was passed by the Parliament in December 1988. There is no specific reference in the Agreement to charging of legal fees directly to a DSH loan account. However, it is standard banking practice to charge legal fees such as those associated with exercising the Bank's power of sale as mortgagee to a person's loan account, regardless of whether it is a DSH loan account. This was also the practice by the Defence Service Homes Corporation prior to the sale to Westpac. (b) The Agreement provides that monthly repayments are calculated to ensure that each interest rate component of the loan is repaid at the same time (that is, if only the scheduled repayment is made each month, at the end of the term of the loan). Prior to the sale to Westpac, any amount paid in excess of the scheduled monthly instalment would go towards repaying the lowest interest rate component first. Under the present arrangements any excess payment is apportioned to each of the various interest rate components. For example, if the balance of the loan for one of the interest rates represents 25% of the total loan, then 25% of the excess payment would be deducted from this interest rate component. Each interest rate component is treated in the same way. In this regard the position of clients under the Westpac arrangement is better than it was when DSH was the direct lender. Aviation Fees and Charges: Domestic (Question No. 1288) Mr J ull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation, upon notice, on 25 February 1992: What total sum was paid to the (a) Civil Aviation Authority and (b) Federal Airports Corporation by (i) Ansett Airlines and its subsidiaries, (ii) Eastwest Airlines, (iii) Australian Airlines and (iv) Compass Airlines in'fees and charges in month since August 1989.",101

Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme: Drugs (Question No. 1309) Dr Bob Woods asked the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, upon notice, on 25 February 1992: (1) Are: (a) maxolon amps, 10 mg, 10; (b) maxolon tabs, 10 mg, 1000; (c) stelazine tabs, 2 mg, 100; (d) stelazine tabs, 5mg, 100; (e) cartia tabs, 100 mg, 28; (f) cartia tabs, 100 mg, 84; (g) parentrovite, 1 m, 3s; (h) parentrovite, 1 m, 12s; to and (i) parentrovite, 1 v, 12s; (j) ecotrin 650 mg, 100; (k) compazine amps, 12.5 mg, 10; (I) stelazine span/cap, 15 mg, 50; (m) dyazide tabs, 100; (n) euglucon tabs, 5 mg, 100; (0) stelazine liquid; (P) amoxil cap, 500 mg, 20; (q) fespan span/cap, 30; (r) tagamet amps, 2 ml, 10; (s) ridaura, 3 mg, 60; (t) tarcil, 3 g, 5; (u) pevaryl foaming solution; (v) parentrovite, 1 v, 3s; (w) fefol ISOs; (x) fefol 60s; (y) polio sabin 20 dose; and (z) honovan tabs/amps listed under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme . (PBS); if not, in each case why not. (2) Is he able to (a) explain the indications for which each of the pharmaceuticals listed in part (1) is prescribed and (b) identify the drugs which are listed under the PBS for those indications. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Of the drugs nominated, the following are listed in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits: (a) Maxolon (metoc\opramide hydrochloride) injection 10mg in 2mL (b) Maxolon (metoc\opramide hydrochloride) tablet IOmg (c) Stelazine (trifluoperazine hydrochloride) tablet 2mg (d) Stelazine (trifluoperazine hydrochloride) tablet Smg U) Ecotrin (aspirin) tablet 6S0mg (sustained release) (k) Compazine (prochlorperazine) injection I2.5mg in ImL (m) Dyazide (hydrochlorothiazide with triamterene) tablet 2Smg-SOmg (n) Euglucon (glibenc\amide) tablet Smg (P) Amoxil (amoxycillin) capsule Soomg (q) Fespan (ferrous sulphate dried) capsule 320mg (delayed release) (s) Ridaura (auranofin) tablet 3mg (t) Tarcil (ticarcillin) injection 3g (w) Fefol (ferrous sulphate dried with folic acid) capsule 270mg-3OOmicrogram (x) Fefol (ferrous sulphate dried with folic acid) capsule 270mg-3OOmicrogram (z) Honvan (fosfestrol sodium) tablet I20mg and injection 2SOmg in SmL. [The listed maximum quantity under the PBS for Maxolon tablet IOmg is 2S (not 1000), and for Fefol it is 30 (not 60 or ISO).] The following drugs are not available under the PBS as they have not received a recommendation to that effect by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) (under the National Health Act 19S3, a drug may not be listed on the PBS without a recommendation by the PBAC)(e) Cartia tabs, l00mg (f) Cartia tabs, IOOmg (g) Parentrovite, Lm. (h) Parentrovite, i.m. (i) Parentrovite, Lv. (I) Stelazine span/cap, ISmg (r) Tagamet amps, 2mL (v) Parentrovite, Lv. (y) Polio Sabin 20 dose. The following drug is not available under the PBS as the manufacturer declined to accept the price offered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Bureau (recommended by the PBAC in 1987 and subsequently rescinded in 1988)(u) Pevaryl foaming solution. The following drug is no longer listed under the PBS as it was discontinued by the manufacturer (deleted April 1983)(0) Stelazine liquid (Img per SmL). (2) I am unable to give a detailed or comprehensive response to this part of the question. In relation to (a)-except for drugs which need authority prescriptions under the PBS (Tarcil is the only one in part (1», prescriptions do not normally include the indications for which the drugs are being prescribed. The Department of Health, Housing and Community Services thus holds no information which would enable a complete answer to this question. Details of the indications for which drugs are approved for use in Australia are included in the product information for each drug and publications which include these are the Prescription Products Guide and MIMS Annual. However, doctors often prescribe drugs for use outside of the approved indications and thus the approved indications will not be a complete list of the indications for which the drugs are actually being used in Australia. Concerning part (b)-as I am unable to give a complete and comprehensive answer to (a), it follows that a similar situation applies to (b). However, even to list all of the approved indications for all of the drugs in (1) and then give all other drugs listed on the PBS which could be used for any of those indications would be a considerable task. Current resources are' not available for such a task. Register of the National Estate (Question No. 1315) Mrs Bailey asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, upon notice, on 26 February 1992: (1) What criteria does the Australian Heritage Conunission use to determine selection of buildings for the Registt(r of the National Estate. (2) What is the Register of the National Estate and what are its purpose, goals and functions. (3) How many buildings or places are listed on the Register. (4) Are funds allocated to help restore buildings which are listed on the Register; if so, (a) where does the funding come from, (b) what sum was spent in 1991 and (c) what criteria are used to determine which sites or buildings are eligible for funding. (5) If funding is not provided, is the local community expected to restore and maintain buildings and sites on the Register. (6) Does placing a building or site on the Register give the (a) federal Government or (b) Australian Heritage Commission any legal or special rights to the building or site.",103
315,Mrs KELLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable p-;rmber's question is as follows: (1) The criteria used by the Australian Heritage Conunission to determine eligibility for registration are set out in section 4 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. (2) The Register is an inventory of those places, being components of the natural or cultural environments of Australia, that have aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance or other special value for future generatioris as well as for the present community. The purpose, goals and functions of the Register are for it: to be a comprehensive of places in Australia which have significant heritage value, to alert Australians to the presence of places of heritage significance, to give all makers objective information about places of heritage significance to help them make better informed decisions, to educate Australians about the natural and cultural history of their country, to ensure that due consideration is given to the national estate values of listed places before Commonwealth decisions and actions are taken, and to provide a focus and direction. for the National Estate Grants Program and the Australian Heritage Research Program. (3) There are 10,018 places in the Register, of which 7,681 are historic places, mainly buildings. (4) Yes. (a) Under the National Estate Grants Program the Commonwealth provides funds for heritage surveys and the conservation of places recorded in the Register. The Program is administered by the Australian Heritage Commission and relevant State and Territory agencies. (b) The sum of $4,352,000 was provided for the Program in the 1991-92 Budget. (c) Places must be recorded in the Register or on the Interim List to be eligible for conservation works under the Program. Grantees must be a Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government body, or a body corporate constituted for purposes other than the acquisition of gain by its members. Applications are assessed by the relevant State or Territory and the Australian Heritage Commission on the basis of need.

316,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Shipping decisionand Aviation has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: The following information on coal loader labour productivity for the year 1930-91 was supplied by the New South Wales Coal Association for New South Wales coal ports and derived from data supplied by the Queensland Mining Council and operators of coal loaders for Queensland coal ports: Loader (Tonnes/man-year) Port Kembla Newcastle Abbot Point Brisbane Dalrymple Bay Barney Point (Gladstone) Auckland Point + Clinton (Gladstone)(a) 75,000 Hay Point (a) Auckland Point and Clinton are both operated by the Gladstone Port Authority. Labour productivity is not a complete measure of efficiency. There can be good reasons for variation among ports. For example, different loader capacities, different demand patterns and different coal receival technologies can· affect labour productivities. However, other measures of efficiency are not easy to establish. The Bureau has not included a study of coal loader efficiency in its current work program. There are two reasons for this. First, the Queensland Mining Council advised the Bureau that its members had not reported any problems with efficiency in Queensland coal loader operations. Secondly, labour productivities of New South Wales coal loaders more than doubled between 1989-90 and 1990-91. In view of the absence of perceived problems with Queensland coal loaders and the substantial improvements in labour productivity achieved by New South Wales coal loaders, there does not appear to be any current need for a Bureau coal loader study. International Airports: Movements (Question No. 1330) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation, upon notice, on 26 February 1992: What was the number of (a) inbound aircraft movements and (b) passengers arriving from overseas at each international airport in 1991.",105

National Film and Sound Archives: Storage of Film (Question No. 1337) Mr Ferguson asked the Minister for the Arts and Territories, upon notice, on 26 February 1992: (1) Are any measures being undertaken to centralise the storage of films procured during the 206 National Film and Sound Archives' (NFSA) 158 ""Operation Newsreel""; if so, what measures. (2) What assessment has the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories made of the impact of humidity and dangers to colour acetate film on some of the material. (3) Did the renovation of NFSA premises at Mitchell in 1989 include the insufficient provision of silicone sealant which resulted in differing temperatures and humidity within rooms at the premises; if so, has the Department urged the NFSA to take any action against the responsible contractors. (4) Is it a fact that the contractors referred to part (3) could not be prosecuted because the firm was undergoing liquidation; if so, what tendering process led to the awarding of the contract. (5) Have the premises referred to in part (3) been used since 1986; if not, what action is being taken to rectify the situation. (6) Have there been prolonged negotiations concerning the aisle widths at the premises; if so, what progress has been made to overcome the problem. (7) Have certain constraints prevented the expenditure. of funds on the recommendations of a report by the Collective Management Team; if so, what constraints. (8) What progress is being made in accessioning material presented to the NFSA and what is the resulting impact on the overall deterioration of material because of inadequate storage facilities. (9) How many items were (a) accessioned and (b) deselected in (i) 1990 and (ii) 1991. Ms Fatin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) All of the films acquired by the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) under ""Operation Newsreel"" are centralised in high quality storage. (2) The NFSA, which is part of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, has almost completed the technical assessment of its complete colour film collection. A project to rectify damage to film caused by conditions of unduly high temperature and relative humidity is well advanced. (3) A problem encountered in 1989 in the sealing of cold rooms in the NFSA's new repository at Mitchell was that the silicone sealant specified for the task was found to shrink in conditions of low relative humidity that are required in the rooms. An alternative sealant was found to be successful.· Since the choice of the initial sealant was not the responsibility of the contractor, but was included in the building specifications, the question of legal action against the contractor did not arise. (4) See (3) above. Normal Commonwealth Government tendering procedures were undertaken. (5) The Mitchell repository was commissioned for service in December 1991 and has been in continual use since then. (6) Negotiations with relevant unions regarding aisle widths and associated matters were conducted in during the latter part of 1991, and were concluded satisfactorily in December of that year. (7) There have been a number of reports relating to the collection management project within the NFSA. Within global limits of NFSA's budget, there have been no particular constraints on the expenditure of funds on collection management activities. (8) During the two-year period April 1991 to March 1993, the NFSA is undertaking a special collection management project, one of the objects of which is to accession as much of its Australian collection material as possible. Progress is reported under (9) below. Concurrently the NFSA is consolidating some previously scattered parts of the collection into its new high quality storage facility at Mitchell. The effect of previously inadequate storage facilities on the collection is not known. (9) Statistics of accessioning anddeselection during 1990 and 1991, based on entry into the computer system (but not including those that did not conform to the NFSA's current accessioning standard) are as follows: 1990 1991 Accessioning (items) 18,369 26,824 Deselection/disposal 35 876 Collins Class Submarine Project (Question No. 1389)",106
318,Mr CONNOLLY,TOTAL INBOUND PASSENGERS ARRIVING,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 4 March 1992: (l) Did the Program Performance Statements 1991-92, Budget Related Paper No. 8.5, for the Defence portfolio state at page 275 that production of some major assemblies for the Collins Class submarine project, including the fire control system, periscopes and software, was behind schedule. (2) Are the assemblies referred to in part (1) or any other major assemblies behind schedule; if so, in each case, (a) by how many months and (b) what is the estimated cost of the slippage. ' (3) What expenditure was originally approved for the Collins CI- project. (4) Has the sum referred to in part (3) been varied; if so, (a) when, (b) by how much on each occasion and (c) why on each occasion. (5) Allowing for inflation indicated by the CPI, is the project on budget; if not, (a) by what sum is it over or under budget and (b) why not. (6) Is the project still on schedule; if not, how many months has it slipped and (b) what is the estimated cost of the slippage. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. Some elements of the combat system including the fire control system, periscopes and software were some six months behind the schedule agreed at the time of contract award. The contractor has now re-scheduled work So that these items will not delay the contract schedule for delivery of the submarines and there will be no additional cost to the Commonwealth. (3) The original approved project cost was $3,892 million in June 1986 prices. (4) Yes; the estimate has been varied as follows: 1988 plus $427 million to $4,319 million. 1989 plus $68 million to $4,387 million. 1990 plus $233 million to $4,620 million. 1991 plus $212 million to $4,832 million. On each occasion' the variation was to provide for, variations in indexes for the price of materials and labour and currency exchange rates; (5) Yes. (6) Yes. Defence Funding (Question No. 1394)",110
319,Mr CONNOLLY,TOTAL INBOUND PASSENGERS ARRIVING,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 4 March 1992: (1) Does the Force Structure Review (FSR), presented to the House on 30 May 1991, state at paragraph 1.10 that at a zero real growth level of defence funding only about three quarters of the program in the White Paper Defence of Australia, presented to the House on B March 1987, could be funded by the end of the decade. (2) Does the FSR state at paragraph 3.2 that a zero real growth defence program has been put in place until the end of the decade. (3) Will the Minister state which programs and projects announced in the White Paper (a) have been (i) deferred until the next century, (ii) dropped entirely or (iii) reduced in scope because of funding reductions arising from the FSR and (b) remain unaffected by decisions in the FSR; if not, why not. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Defence has (a) by provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) No. A basic program has been developed as a basis to allow forward planning to proceed. Actual implementation of this program will depend upon the level of Defence Outlays approved by the Parliament in the context of the Budget and the Additional Estimates for each year. (3) (a) The full White Paper program included a large number of individual initiatives. Some had significant facilities and operational implications (such as the basing of a brigade sized force in the north) and others involved major capital investment in new equipment. I do not wish to comment in detail on the proposed forward acquisition program, both to avoid raising expectations unduly, and to maintain commercial competitiveness. Nor would it be practicable to list all of the detailed changes which have been made. The more significant changes however, include deferral of a decision on the construction of a third over-the-horizon radar until later in this decade, cancellation of the inshore minehunter program in favour of the acquisition of coastal minehunters of proven design, cancellation of acquisition of a craft of opportunity minesweeping core force, and deferral of acquisition of a second company group lift of Blackhawk helicopters for Army. (b) Significant elements of the White Paper program which remain unaffected by decisions in the Force Structure Review include upgrade of the P3CS, planning to expand the major surface combatant force, acquisition of a new class of submarine to replace the Oberons, further development of 1\vo Ocean Basing, acquisition of wheeled light armoured fighting vehicles and the intention to move significant ground force elements to the north.",111
