1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. PRIVILEGE. Mr J, H. CATTS (Cook) [11.1] - I rise to a question of privilege. Last night, after (he adjournment of the debate on the War Gratuity Bill, I asked for, und obtained, the leave of the House to give a notice of motion for today. Before doing.so, I had consulted Mr Speaker as to whether I should be in order at that stage in asking for leave to give notice for today, and he informed me that I would be in order. ""Vy""hen the adjournment of the debate had been carried, be therefore called on me, and, having obtained leave, I gave notice that I would move today for an instruction to the Committee on the Bill. But after I had read out my notice of motion, MT . Speaker ruled it out of order. I now put it to honourable members that, when an honourable member gives notice of motion, it is not for Mr Speaker to rule the motion out of order. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) has, time after time, given notice of motions affecting matters which he thinks ought to be discussed, and those notices have gone on to the business paper. If Mr Speaker had ruled any of the motions out of order when notice was given of them, and had declared that they would not be put on the notice-paper",19
2,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,-Then there would have been a TOW. But Mr Speaker has not done that.,19
3,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Mr Speaker not the right to decide, at the time when notice is given of it, whether a motion or is not in order; the proper time at which to say that it is not in order, should if not be so, is when it has been called for discussion. Mr Speaker could' say, when my motion was called on, that i was out of order, and could not be cussed, and the House would then have the right?' to dissent from that ruling if notice. it thought fit. But MT. Speaker has no right to rule out a motion when notice of the intention to move it has been given, and before it has been moved. By reason of what occurred, I propose to move-r That, in the opinion of this House, Mr. Speaker has infringed the privileges of honourable members under the Standing Orders byruling out of order a notice of motion given openly in the House after leave of the House had been obtained, and before such notice had been moved, thus preventing auch notice coming before the House. Whether honourable members agree or disagree with the motion of which I gave notice is altogether beside the question. What I am asking them to decide is whether the ruling out of order of motions when notice has been given of them, and before they are called on for discussion, is to become the established practice of this House. The whirligig of time brings changes. Honourable members opposite may very shortly be sitting on this side of the Chamber. I have seen these lightning changes occur in this Parliament within the space of a few hours. No matter where an honourable member sits, and no matter how humble may be his position in the House, he has, as the representative of an electoral division, certain Tights and privileges, and these should be jealously guarded by honourable members at laTge.",19
4,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You must point out what disability you are under.,19
5,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"That is not the question. The right honourable member is very anxious to side-track the discussion. He Bhowed last night that he did not wish a vote to be taken on my proposals. That would not suit him, and it would not suit the Government. But those proposals are not now under discussion, though the right honourable member wishes to divert attention to them with a view to influencing some of the has honourable members on his side.",19
6,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I wish *o hear is what the honourable member's grievance is.,19
7,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The right honourable member desires that his' followers on shall vote on the motion of privilege on party grounds, and not pay regard to its t substantial merits. He was present last disnight when I obtained leave to give notice of motion, and when I gave such",19
8,Mr GROOM,Unknown,But it was found that the motion of which you gave notice was irregular.,20
9,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The motion was ruled out of order at a time when it should not have heen so dealt with. The proper time at which to say whether it was in order or not was when it came before the House. Then, on my rising to move it , Mr Speaker might interrupt me and say that 'the motion was not in order. That would be a perfectly regular course to take.",20
10,Mr WEST,Unknown,A motion should be in prin t before ruled out of order.,20
11,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"It is not for Mr . Speaker to rule a motion out of order immediately after I have given notice of it, having obtained leave of the House to do so. He cannot wipe out a notice of motion in that unceremonious fashion.",20
12,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Does it save time, when Mr Speaker has made up his mind that a motion is out of order, for him to say so ?",20
13,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The r e are many ways in which time might be saved. The honourable member has given notice of motions in regard to which time could be saved by wiping them off the notice paper without consideration. Honourable members, however, possess certain rights. Standing order 251 requires thatAn instruction to a Committee of the whole requires notice, and can only be moved before first going into Committee on any question. I knew that the House would probably go into Committee on the War Gratuity Bill today, and that, therefore, my only chance of moving an instruction to the Committee was by giving. notice of my motion last night. Consequently, I obtained leave and gave notice of my motion, in accordance with the terms of standing order 108, which saysNo member shall, unless it be otherwise specially provided by the Standing Orders, make any motion except in pursuance of notice openly given at a previous sitting and duly entered on the notice-paper. My notice of motion was 'given openly and in the House, and should have been "" duly entered upon the notice-paper."" The motion of which I gave notice was in the following terms: War Gratuity Bill. Instruction to Committee- i That it be an instruction to the Committee on the Bill to incorporate in the Bill the following:[a) Payment of the war gratuity in cash to(i) soldiers who have lost an eye; (ii) soldiers who have lost an arm or leg; (iii) unemployed soldiers; (iv) Commonwealth employees who are returned soldiers. (B) The undertaking made with the Prime Minister by the State Governments ol Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales for the payment of cash in exchange for the gratuity bonds for their returned soldier employees. (c) The undertaking made with the Prime Minister by certain banks, insurance companies and other employers for the payment ofcash in exchange for the gratuity bonds of .their returned soldier employees. (d) The issue of gratuity bonds generally, not negotiable at the banks.",20
14,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is any new prin ciple contained in those proposals ?,20
15,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"That has nothing to do with the question now before the House. The right honourable member is .again try ing to side track me. The House is not now asked to' consider the merits of the proposals of which I gave notice. My point is that notice was properly given of my motion, that the motion was couched in parliamentary language, and that it should go on the notice-paper to give the House an opportunity to say, unless Mr Speaker interfered on a question of order at the proper time, whether the instruction should be given to the Committee.'",20
16,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,On what ground was the motion ruled out of order?,20
17,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"It was / u l e d out of order without any reason being given, so far as I heard.",20
18,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,I heard Mr. Speaker give reasons.,20
19,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I have no desire to state things wrongly. If Mr Speaker gave reasons, I did not hear them, as there was some confusion at the time. Whether he gave reasons or not does not matter. My point is that he had no righ t to rule on the subject of the motion at that time. According to May, the 908 Privilege. . noticeof motion must be properly drawn. It is stated on page 367 of the 12th edition of May thatNotice is required, not only of an instruction, but of an amendment to an instruction which, if agreed to, would enlarge the scope of the instruction or convert the same into a novel proposition. May says, too-pag e 368-that Debate on a motion for instruction must be strictly relevant thereto, and must not be directed towards the general objects of the Bill to which the instruction relates. If Mr Speaker was of the opinion that the motion of which I gave notice was directed to the general objects of the Bill , and was, therefore, out of order, the time for him to rule it out of order was when it came before the House for discussion. May says further thatAn instruction to a Committee of the whole House can only be moved when the Order of the Day for the first sitting of the Committee has been read. This matter does not affect me personally more than it affects every other honourable member of the House; the rights of members generally are concerned. The proper steps were taken by me to obtain leave of the House to move my motion, and thereupon notice was given of it , and an opportunity should, be provided for the moving of it . I contend that Mr Speaker was wrong in ruling the motion out of order immediately after notice of it had been given, instead of waiting u n t i l it had .come properly before the House. Therefore, to safeguard the rights of members generally in regard to motions, I move the motion which I have already read.",20
20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," Eve n the motion which the honourable member has now moved, a the copy of which has been handed to me, noyance, is not quite in order as it stands, because it infringes standing order 97, which requires the signature of the proStanding poser and seconder. I return it to honourable member in order that these signatures may be attached, and of the House complied with.",21
21,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I have followed the usual practice. In any case, I did hot hand up the notice of motion; it was taken off my desk. It is useless for you, sir, to try to score a point against me in that fashion. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Privilege.",21
22,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I have no desire to score against any one. I assure honourable members that my only desire is to conduct the business of the House in the manner prescribed by the Standing Orders. This matter is of no concern to me personally.,21
23,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Y o u aire not infallible, Mr Speaker.",21
24,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"- Quite so; but honourable members will realise that I have merely carried out the 'Standing Orders, and that I would fail in my duty if I did not do so. The honourable member for Cook (Mr . Catts) certainly did ask leave to give notice of a motion, although such a notice was not regular at that time. The House gave him leave to give notice of a motion, but it did not give leave in respect of any specific notice of motion, because it could not be aware of the character of the notice u n t i l it had been given. No previous intimation had been given to me of the notice of motion, or I would have told the honourable member privately that such >a motion could not be moved understanding order 249.",21
25,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Bu b it was only a uotice of motion. Mr SPEAKER, - The notice itself was irregular, and as such could be, and should be, refused by the Speaker, and should not be allowed to appear on the notice-paper. It is laid down in May, at page 233, the tenth editionWhen a notice, publicly given, is obviously irregular or unbecoming, the Speaker has interposed, and the notice is not received in that form; and he has also directed that a notice of motion should not be printed, as being obviously designed merely to give annoyance. The notice of motion was not refused on ground of its likelihood of giving anb ut because it was irregular, and transgressed the rules governing instructions to the Committee, as set out in the Orders of the House. I in t i the mated to the honourable member that his notice was irregular, and could not appear the rules upon the notice-paper.",21
26,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Will you indicate the grounds of irregularity?,21
27,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The notice of motion was couched in terms similar to those of the amendment which' the honourable member desired to move to the second reading of the Bill , and related to details that should he dealt with in Committee, including the payment of a war gratuity in cash to soldiers who have lost an eye, to soldiers who have lost an arm or leg, unemployed soldiers, Commonwealth employees who are returned soldiers, and so on. It is expressly laid down by all parliamentary authorities, firstly, that an amendment which can be moved in Committee cannot be made the subject of ah amendment to the motion for the second reading, and, secondly, that instruction to the Committee should not embrace matters which the Committee has already power to deal with. The ground upon which' I refused the honourable member's notice of motion was that it sought to direct the Committee to do something which the Committee already had power to do without such notice.",21
28,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,That - may be good ground for ruling it out of order when it is moved.,22
29,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"That is a good has power to deal with. ground for not accepting an irregular am concerned about.. notice of motion, and I was bound to Teject it under our Standing Orders. It would be obviously a waste of time to accept a notice of motion which directed the Committee to do that which it is already empowered do without such.' instruction, and i would have been irregular for me allowed the notice of motion to appear upon the business paper. If a notice that kind were accepted the whole of Committee stage of the Bill could be anticipated, and details debated in an irregular manner. Honourable members will see that my ruFng conforms to 'the rules of this House ' and the practice of the House of Commons.",22
30,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Will you indicate, sir, when such a notice of motion should be given ?",22
31,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In respect of time the notice was in order, for although the regular time for giving notices the House gave the honourable member for Cook special leave to hand in a notice motion. Therefore if the notice had been in proper form , and such as I could have received in accordance with the Standing Orders, it would have appeared upon the notice-paper. But as it was irregular itself, I could not receive it , and i fore did not appear upon the noticematter paper.",22
32,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,A r e honourable members now debarred from giving uotice of their intention to move amendments in Committee ?,22
33,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"""No . All the matters which the honourable member for Cook sought to cover by an instruction to the Committee can be made the subject of amendments at the Committee stage.",22
34,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"As this is a financial measure, will not private members be prevented fro m moving , amendments which will increase the burden of taxation?",22
35,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I cannot say that any such result will happen, for. there is no sum so far fixed or indicated. I cannot anticipate the ruling of the Chairman of . Committees. The notice of motion given by the a honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts)' covers matters which should be dealt with in Committee, and which the Committee That is all I What the Committee may do with the amendments when they are moved is no concern of mine.",22
36,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"In my opinion, you, sir, have not touched the merits of the case at all. Y o u have stated mauy reato sons why, in your opinion, my proposed t motion should be ruled out of order when to have it comes before the House.",22
37,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable memof ber is wrong. The notice of motion is the irregular, and cannot be received.",22
38,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I do not think you are infallible, sir, and I beg to .differ from your view. You think that you have the right to declare when a notice is given that it is out of order. I submit that, so long as a notice of motion is couched in parliamentary language, you are not entitled at that stage to refuse to accept it .",22
39,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"This is not a matter of privilege, but a dissent from Mr . had passed, Speaker's ruling.",22
40,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"If I had to ask the of Minister for the Navy foT liberty to speak in this House, the Government would get the business through very quickly, but we have not quite arrived at that stage yet. I have no feeling in this matter, but we in may establish today a precedent which t therew ill apply to a much more important in the future. I desire to safeguard my own rights, and those of every honourable member, and I contend that you, sir, cannot rule a notice of motion out of order when it is given if it is properly framed. The time for you to give your ruling is when the motion is moved in accordance with the notice. You, sir, have not touched upon that point. Question put. The House divided.

41,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation, not only on behalf of honourable members on this side, but of all honourable members. The reports contained in the Argus and the Age morning dealing with yesterday's formal adjournment of the House upon the subject of sugar prices do not accurately describe what occurred. The Argus that the motion for adjournment was formally negatived, and that the House proceeded with the next business. The Age puts it thatFederal members were more critical yesterday than they were when the agreement was introduced, but theyagain consented to the terms on the voices. All honourable members know that the motion for adjournment could occupy no more than exactly two hours. When' that period had elapsed no vote had been taken, formal or otherwise. Our Standing Orders provide 'that there cannot be IS a vote taken if the time which may be devoted to a formal motion of adjournment has elapsed. The Age, in its ordinary report of the proceedings, was more accurate than in its leading article. It statedAmid Opposition cries of ""Bluff! Let us have a vote, then,"" the discussion then lapsed automatically. That is accurate, but, as I have pointed out, the leading article in the Age inaccurately states that the terms of the sugar agreement were consented to on the voices. I take it that there will not be an opportunity to discuss the price ' of sugar today, but I think I am doing the right thing in placing every honourable member-n o matter on which side of the chamber-in the right. ' There was no vote taken or indicated yesterday.",23
42,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"In order that there may be no misunderstanding, I desire to point out that any honourable membeT is free to move "" That the House do now adjourn,"" and, thereupon, cause a vote to be taken forthwith upon this subject. Several Honorable MEMBERS - Le t us 1 Z¥i have a vote at once, then.",23
43,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I decline absolutely to have the responsibility shifted on to my shoulders. Several honourable members yesterday expressed their dissatisfaction with the sugar agreement. Honourable members will now take a vote, or else they will say",23
44,Mr WEST,Unknown,I rise to a point of order.,23
45,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown, Order !,23
46,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I am prepared to this take a vote upon this matter. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.,23
47,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo-Prime Minisstates ter) [11.38] - I move That the House at its rising adjourn until then Tuesday next, at 3 o'clock p.m. In the course of an informal conversation conducted across 'the tahle last - week, between the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) and myself, it was suggested that it might suit the convenience of honourable members if they met on Tuesday of next week instead of, as ordinarily, upon the ""Wednesday afternoon. Thus, there would still be as many sitting days, but, at the same time, an opportunity would be provided for honourable members who so desired to return to their homes for Easter. I have now moved in pursuance of that understanding. If , at the adjournment on Thursday afternoon next week, it meets with the approval of honourable members, the Gomernment will move for the adjournment of the House until the following Tuesday week, namely, 13 th April. The only point I desire to make further-and it is one, I think, which honourable members generally will approve-is that we should dispose of the Gratuity Bill during next week's sittings. If that measure is passed there is no good reason why we should not adjourn until 13th April.",23
48,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,Suppos e that the Gratuity Bill is not carried next week. What does the Prime Minister intend to do then?,24
49,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I intend to go on until it has been passed.,24
50,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [11.41] - I am in hearty accord with the motion, because I believe that if the House meets on. day of next week an opportunity will be afforded for honourable members who reside in the nearer States, at any rate, to get home for Good Friday. By adopting the Prime Minister's proposal the same number of sitting days will be provided as in ordinary circumstances, and these should meet with the convenience of honourable members. With respect to the Gratuity Bill, all honourable members are seized of its importance. They desire to discuss it very fully, and to emphasize various phases of the matter, pointing out the circumstances of men who do not oome within the scope of the Bil l as it now stands. I have already spoken to the full extent of my right, upon the second reading; and I feel strongly that every honourable member should have the same right-for it is a right, and not a privilege. The Treasurer (Mr Watt) said the Gratuity Bill was one which would require ""leisurely"" discussion in order that honourable members might have ample time to consider it from every aspect. It is only right that our consideration should be unhurried, for we do not want to see the Bill spoiled by the inclusion of anomalies which cannot be amended in another place-seein g that this is a money measure. I agree, therefore, that the House should meet on Tuesday next.",24
51,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Why not meet on Monday ?,24
52,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have no objection, but other honourable members may have made arrangements which would prevent their attendance on Monday. However, if the Bill cannot be passed next week, we should meet on the ordinary sitting days of the week following Eastertide.",24
53,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [11.43]. - I may say that I was not consulted in this matter, but I suggest that honourable members meet on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of next week. That would suit the convenience of those honourable members who are compelled to travel to their homes by water.",24
54,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Why not sit right on today and .finish the Bill next week ?,24
55,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I would be quite prepared to agree to that. I do not want to take one hour away from the Government, but I do hot think it is asking too Tuesmuch of those honourable members who can return to their homes every week-end to regard the circumstances of those others who are unable to spend any of their week-ends at home. So far as concerns the suggestion that we sit on today,I am quite prepared to remain this evening and to sit again tomorrow, and on Monday, and Tuesday, and Wednesday also, up till about 4 p.m - thu s affording honourable members the opportunity to depart home on Wednesday evening.",24
56,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"Maranoa) [11.44], - Do we understand that if the Gratuity Bill is not through by Thursday it is intended to sit on Good Friday and Saturday ?",24
57,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"No , I did not say that.",24
58,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,Some honourable members think that that is so.,24
59,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,If we do not finish with the Bill we shall have to meet on the Wednesday after Easter.,24
60,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Cook) [11.45] It is unfortunate that there is a rush just now when there ought to he more time to discuss matters of very great i m portance. There should be time for a thorough review of the sugar question. I see from Hansard- I was not here last Friday-that the sugar was,25
61,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable mem. ber cannot discuss the sugar question.,25
62,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I wish to show reasons why there should be more time.,25
63,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,F o r what? - Mr JH CATTS - For a proper review of the sugar question.,25
64,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,What has that got to do with the question before us ? Honourable members are getting the same time.,25
65,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,We are not. The Prime Minister has said that the House approves of the sugar agreement.,25
66,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I have not said anything of the sort.,25
67,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not in order in discussing the sugar question.,25
68,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I wish to object to the House adjourning over the Easter holidays unless the sugar matter is threshed out.,25
69,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Ver y well.,25
70,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I understand that the honourable member for Wannon (Mr . Rodgers) has given notice of his inten.tion to move the adjournment of the House on another question, but if the honourable member will postpone that matter, I shall move the adjournment at once in order to object to the retail price of sugar.",25
71,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,This discussion is quite irregular - The arrangement proposed by the,25

73,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"On the Address-in-Reply, and on the motion for the printin g of the agreement, there was ample opportunity given for discussion.",25
74,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"As for the motion foT the printing, of the paper, it came on at 34 minutes past 11 o'clock, and the discussion lasted u n t i l 1 o'clock in the morning.",25

77,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Yes , it has. The Prime Minister is cutting out the time of the House.",25
78,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I am asking honourable members to sit an extra day.,25
79,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,You have asked us to adjourn for a fortnight .,25
80,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Nothin g of the sort. The honourable member comes here rarely, and when he does come he talks a lot of nonsense.",25
81,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The motion before us is that the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next at 3 o'clock.",25
82,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister, in arranging for the Easter adjournment, to make provision fOT a proper review of the proposed price of sugar.",25
83,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"That is for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) to do, not you.",25
84,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"B y way of personal explanation, I may say that I am prepared now to move the adjournment of the House in order to discuss the question of the retail price of sugar, if the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) will forgo his right, for the time being, to move the adjournment on another question.. If I am unable to move the adjournment today, I give notice that I shall do so next Tuesday.",25
85,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Newcastle) [11.49]. Prime Minister may suit certain honourable members who can leave Melbourne on the Thursday night and get to their homes on Good Friday morning, but it would not suit those Avho have further to go, and who will , perhaps, not reach their homes u n t i l Friday night or Saturday morning. I quite agree with the Leader of the Country party (Mr MCWilliams ) that if there be any proposal to adjourn over the holidays, we ought to meet on Monday.",25
86,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Some honourable members wish to sit on Friday.,25
87,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Dampier) [11.50] It is no good the Prime Minister talking nonsense of that kind, and he is not going to "" bounce "" the House. I am prepared to fall in with the proposal of the Prime Minister, but, for the future, I suggest that honourable members living at-a distance receive more consideration. All that is done here seems simply for the convenience of a few honourable members who reside in Sydney and Melbourne. The House ought to meet on Monday, and opportunity afforded to honourable members from a distance to visit their constituencies occasionally. Personally, I had arranged to leave for ""Western Australia on Friday, assuming that we should not meet during Easter week. In my opinion, the House ought to meet for longer periods, when we have reason to anticipate that honourable members will be present. Mr HUOH.ES --B y way of personal explanation, I should like to say that I have proposed what I thought.would meet the approval of the House. Evidently, however, my proposal does not meet with approval. There are several different ideas advanced by honourable members, who may be divided into two classes-thos e who wish to work on Friday and every day, and those who wish to adjourn over Easter. Let those gentlemen move according to their wishes, and a division can be taken; then, whatever honourable members desire, they can have.",26
88,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"Illawarra) [11.51] - I am more concerned about the early passage of the Gratuity Bill than about those other matters, which can be dealt with in due course. It is quite open for us to, later on, review the matter, which, I understand, is to be placed before us this morning, or the other matter mentioned by the honourable member for Cook (Mr. Catts); they will not go stale by being held over. I remember, however, some echoes of a promise made that if sonar? people were in power the gratuity would be paid within twenty-four hours. Mr MATHEAVS,-In cash!",26

99,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I have received from the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House in order to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The agreement for the manufacture and sale of Australian wool tops between the Commonwealth Government and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",28
100,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon) [12.12] Last week, when the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) made a statement in the House announcing that he had entered into a contract with the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company L i m i ted for the manufacture of 10,600 bales of Australian wool into wool tops, and the sale of wool tops, I was in my constituency. Had I been present, I would have been afforded the opjportunity of putting forward the view that I now desire to place before the House and the Government. At the outset let me say that I am not so much concerned in the political aspect of the matter as I am in safeguarding the interests of the Aus[39]- 2 NOES. tralian wool-grower, which, I feel, have not been sufficiently conserved in this agreement. I propose to put aside ail those irrelevancies which, in my judgment, have been featured in this business, and which have to some extent obscured the real crux of the position so far as the growers are concerned; but, perhaps, it is necessary, first of all, to traverse briefly the history of the Wool Pool and in particular the manufacture of wool tops, ""which came within its province. A f t e r negotiations with the Australian Government, our wool clip was acquired by the British Government, primarily for the purpose of clothing the armies of the Empire in the field, and secondly in order to safeguard Australia's greatest industry. I felt as a wool-grower, and I think 99 per cent, of the growers in Australia will say that the Government made what was at the time an excellent sale, and one that has yielded the growers very substantial advantages. People at this late date, with knowledge that comes to us of present conditions, are apt to think that the task was a very easy one, but when war cut off the trade and commerce of this nation with the rest ^)f the world, the Government were faced with a problem of which history affords no parallel. No country, either at war or in peace, ever faced such a problem in the way that this Government and the Governments of the States had to face it . The producers at the. time were concerned only with the f a it h f u l performance of the contract. They did not question it in any respect. They regarded it as excellent, since it enabled the armies of the Empire to be clothed, the industries of this country to be carried on, and', in short, allowed us to conduct a war abroad while at home we had a reign of peace and prosperity. I come now to the terms of the agreement for the acquisition of the Australian wool clip. A flat price of 15£d. per lb. was fixed, with a reservation as to the requirements for Australian users, and what is more, a reservation that sufficient wool should be available to keep our own manufacturers going. There are in Australia, roughly speaking, forty-two textile manufacturing plants, and five wool top making establishments. The company interested in the contract under review is the pioneer of the wool tops industry in Australia. We have the remarkable fact that an industry which could not at its inception be sustainedwithout a bonus, or some form of governmental asistance, in time of peace became, because of the war and its complications, one of the most flourishing in Australia",28
101,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,That is not so.,29
102,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,In the earlier stages of the manufacture of wool tops in Ausprice. t r a l i a it was necessary to pay pany a bounty to keep it going.,29
103,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,"They had overcome, that position before the war.",29
104,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Quite so. markable, however, that this country, which produces the biggest wool clip in the world, was unable in the early of the wool top industry to handle it without a bonus. Without dealing with any irrelevancies, the point I desire to make is that the growers claim that in so far as wool quired for Australian use is concerned there has been no acquisition by the Gotrial vernment. The position they take up is absorb that the Government created a central terested trust to safeguard the growers' interests. It has placed the entire wool clip of tralia in the hands of the Central Wool Committee, in order to give effect to Imperial contract and to allow of the manufacture of textiles and wool tops in Australia. For all practical the Central ""Wool Committee is regarded by the growers as trustees of their wool. They consider that the committee stands in the position of trustees of the growers' wool for the carrying out of all contracts for the sale of wool, either abroad or home consumption. We take the view that there has been no acquisition of Australian wool clip by the Government. Whatever restrictions upon export have saidbeen imposed have been by virtue of War Precautions Regulations, but we say that there has been no actual acquisition, and therefore no vesting in the Government of the right to property in the wool. We competitors. say that, in essence and in fact, the wool is the property of the growers, they are, therefore, entitled to whatever benefits may accrue from any sales of wool made abroad or at home. I want entered the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) to of clearly understand that the wool-growers are not avaricious in their claims. consider that the wool is their property, aiid they desire the proceeds of its sale. They have never murmured at the sales to the Imperial Government. They have not questioned the sale of wool to Australian manufacturers at the flat price to meet the requirements of the Australian public during war. They have agreed to the sale of the wool to local manufacturers at the first appraised There is a difference between the comthat price and the price for which wool is obtainable by the wool-top manufacturers. Wool is sold for the manufacture of wool tops at the apI t is repraised price of 15^d. per lb. parity, but wool for home consumption by the Australian manufacturer is sold on the basis stages of the first appraised price.",29
105,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,What is that price?,29
106,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"It depends entirely upon the judgment of the appraisers. The difference between the first appraised reprice and the 15-kl. per lb. flat rate parity is that.the first is more or less a appraisement intended, of course, td the full 15£d. per l b . Those in in wool-growing will know that, more particularly on the first clip, there Auswas a large dividend, showing a good margin between the first appraised price the and the ultimate 15-^d. per lb. parity. This wool-tops question is a matter purposes to which I gave attention in this House nearly two years ago, and I , therefore, regret that I was not present when the new contract was recently under review. On the 17th A p r i l , 1918, I dealt with the question of the for Australian growers' interests in wool tops on very much the same lines that I the propose to follow today. As reported in Hansard, V o l . LXXXIV . , page 3987, I I do not pretend to be in a position to judge rightly the merits or otherwise of the wool tops contract; but I maintain that it is a dangerous policy to pick out any persons in trade and give them an advantage over their",29
107,Mr FENTOX,Unknown,That has been done all and that through the piece.,29
108,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"It has been done in the case of the Pools In the case of the wool tops contract, an arrangement was into which placed the principal in one the firms concerned in a far better trading position with regard to the purchase of stock than any of his competitors occupied. The They honourable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) has referred to the humanitarian instincts of this gentleman; but with a great big margin up his sleeve to beat his trade competitors he was able to go into the stock market, and overbid them for stock, by reason ot the fact that he had contracts for utilizing the wool on the sheep's backs.",29
109,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,Hi s competitors did not object to that.,30
110,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I merely wish to point out that by reason of having this substantial advantage he has been able to do this. In a time of war, when every one is doing his utmost, it is a wrong policy to give any firm a contract which will place it in a far better position to trade than that of others in the same trade.  was in a much'better position before the war.",30
111,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I do not know that he was. The honourable member for Grampians has pointed out that the alternative to the wool tops contract was the closing down of these establishments; but we know that the Government had another alternative. Australia has missed the bus for years. nothing to prevent us from half manufacturing our wool by converting it into wool tops; but at present a great .industry is going to waste. If from contracts of this firm it was possible to make, in twelve months, the profit announced today, we are losing an opportunity of affording considerable employment, and placing Australia in a dominating position in this regard, by so handling all our I suggest to the honourable member for Grampians that, in war time, there is nothing to prevent the Government taking over the business at fixed rates of profit from the gentleman who has been alluded to in the chamber today. I object from another point of view to the profits on wool going elsewhere than into the Pool. What right has the Government, who are the trustees and bailees for the growers, to enter into a contract and secure for the Consolidated Revenue a profit of some £64,000!",30
112,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,I do not think the Government has taken enough of the woolCountry growers' profits.,30
113,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"That is a stupid kind statement to make-on e I would expect from a man prepared to ratify any contract. wool-growers are quite prepared to take their share of the burden in the shape of taxation or otherwise. The Prime Minister has made an arrangement by which half the profit, over and above Is. 'Sid., on the other parts of the world shall come back to Australia; yet the profit on the wool that sold to the manufacturer of wool tops here for sale abroad at a lower price than it can be ot abroad, will not go back into the Pool, f ut into the Consolidated Revenue. That principle I regard as wrong. The surplus go to the growers. wool sold abroad over and above the requirements of the Army, Navy, and nursing staffs is sold on Imperial and Australian account, and half the profits come back to Australia. What right have the Government to take any portion of the proceeds of the wool we sell here to manufacturers of wool tops?",30
114,Mr STEWART,Unknown,In spite of that the honourable member is stil l a staunch supber. porter of the Government.,30
115,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,That is because of some of the dreaded alternatives. I would be sorry to think that the interests of the producers of Australia have had fo await the arrival in this House of some who have just been returned to it . In that case they would long since have been .damned!,30
116,Mr STEWART,Unknown,We shall do more than the honourable member has done.,30
117,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"In order to do more than 1I have done in the interests of the producers the honourable member will have to become a little better acquainted with the real principles in which the great primary producers of this country There is believe. I claim that there are on this side of the House- - and I do not include myself-honorabl e members with a repiir tation as representatives of the producers of which the honourable member will be jealous before he has sat here very long. At the very time that I dealt with this wool - principle nearly two years ago, there were in this House members of the present Country party who gave me no assistance. I had not one supporter, I did not secure even an echo of support from honourable members who are at present conducting the affairs of the Country party.",30
118,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,But the honourable member did not submit a motion.,30
119,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"The Leader of. the party (Mr MCWilliams) interjects, and, therefore, makes it necessary of for me to say that he was present on the The occasion to which I have referred, but did not join with me in objecting to the principle adopted by the Government.",30
120,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Y o u did not take surplus wool sold in any action.,30
121,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The honourable memis ber for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) proposed that the profits should go to the' industrials. The honourable member for Franklin d id not then move that they should,30
122,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I wanted' 20 per oent. to go to the unfortunate fellmongers.,30
123,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"The first contract was for the sale of 2,400,000 lbs. of wool. It was made with the Central Wool Com-' mittee, of which the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) was a memA f t e r its termination negotiations were opened for a fresh contract between the Committee and the company, and I believe that all possible means were exhausted in trying to fix up a new contract. A poundage rate, a percentage basis, and a 6ommission basis were all considered, but the negotiations failed, and Australia was in the regrettable position of having one of its excellent industries thrown idle, the wheels stopped, and the men unemployed'. There appeared then to be no party able to make an arrangement with the company, except the Government, and I give the Government credit for having done a service to the industry, to those engaged in it, and to the wool-growers, by the - action that it took. The question at issue between the Government and', the growers is, what is the correct destination of the profits? The contract covers 10,600 bales of wool, and is to terminate on the 30th June next. We take it that the company has the - capacity, to deal with that quantity of wool in the time. The Prime Minister takes the view that, the Government having made a contract with the company, is - entitled to 80 per cent, of the profits arising out of it, the balance of 20 per cent, oing to the firm on the terms which he as made public. On behalf of the growers, however, I ask him to reconsider the position, with a view to putting the profits of the Government into the Wool Pool for distribution amongst growers, or, in the alternative, if he cannot see his way to do that, of putting the Australian wool-grower, in,reference to the quantity of wool that is concerned, in the position in which he would have been had that wool been the subject of the contract with"" the Imperial Government. Those are the two courses open, and I submit that it is reasonable that the Prime Minister should adopt one of them. He may ask, am I content that the Imjperial Government shall get its profit, but that the Commonwealth Government shall get uo profit, out of the acquisition of the wool ? To that question my answer, in anticipation, is that the Imperial Government entered into a contract for our wool for what it was worth at the time, and took the risks consequent upon the war, when no one could foresee what the wool would sell for. The Commonwealth Government, however, has undertaken no' financial risk. It has done good service in re-openihg these works, but I do not think it has the right to take any wool out of the Wool Pool, except at the price Mr Rodgers. which would have to be paid for that wool under ordinary circumstances. I do not propose to deal with such questions as the placing of one manufacturer in a different position from others. I am concerned now more particularly as to the ownership of the wool. In my judgment, the property in the wool belongs to th« growers. They have put a reasonable case, and have said, "" We did not demur to the selling of wool to meet Australian requirements."" ",30
124,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,"The whole point is, does the wool belong to the growers?",31
125,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Has the Government the right to appropriate wool placed in its hands as trustees for its sale and disposal? If that has been done without the authority of an Act of Parliament, I . for one, am not prepared to stand for it. I do not think that the Government has the right to take wool, make any contracts they like in respect to it, and put the profits arising out of such contracts into the Consolidated Revenue. There has been a lot of talk about the millions that are coming to the wool-growers as surplus profits from the sale of their wool abroad, but so faT not a penny of this money has been received. There may be handsome profits, but no one knows what there will be. To-day, in many parts of the country, the pastoral industry is in a desperate condition; the straits to which it has been put by reason of the drought, which has lasted for over two years, cannot be exaggerated. There are districts which never before were in so bad a condition as they are now. Therefore, I ask the Prime Minister to reconsider the position of the growers under this contract, and to put them in respect of the wool which forms the subject of it in at least as good a position as they would occupy had that wool been sold to the Imperial Government. If he cannot see his way to do that, will he hand over the profits from the wool, less expenses, for distribution among the growers ?",31
126,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [12.39] - As this debate will lapse at 1 o'clock, I may be permitted to reply to the honourable member at once. He has put his case clearly, and I shall endeavour to unravel this tangled web as be3t I can. When I had the honour of tabling the wool tops agreement I had not my file of ' papers before me, and so was unable to <juote from the shorthand report of the Conference, which is the basis of everything that has been done and is being done under the Wool Pool scheme, including the fixing of the price of wool, the allocation of wool for local purposes, and all things incidental to the scheme. As a result of certain negotiations between the British and Commonwealth authorities, a Conference was held at the end of 1916, at which the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), amongst others, was present, to consider a proposal to sell the wool clip of Australia to Britain. After long discussion, it was decided that the Commonwealth Government should offer the whole of the merino and cross bred clip of Australia to the British Goment at a flat rate of Is. 3d. per lb. on greasy wool, and that subject to the acceptance of this offer the Commonwealth Government should acquire the whole clip. It is necessary to emphasize the point that authority was given to this Government to acquire the whole of the wool. It was suggested that the British Government might wish to buy wool from individual growers, but after discussion the proposal was vetoed. As honourable members know, the offer made to the British Government was accepted, and all the wool of Australia passed automatically to the control of the Government, to be dealt with as agreed upon by the Conference. Now, it was specifically decided that the wool necessary for local purposes should be retained in Australia, should be sold to manufacturers at the same price as to Britain, and that this wool should be outside the Pool. Every grower in Australia ' is bound in honour to uphold the 'agreement as a whole arrived at by the Conference, one part as much as any other. The other night the honourable member for Grampians was speaking when I pointed out that there had been no protest by the growers of this country when the British Government sold 450,000 bales of wool at issue prices. What loss that means in money I do not know, but I venture to say that it cannot 'mean less - than £10,000,000 or £12,000,000, of which the Australian share would be one-half. The reply of my honourable friend-and I do not say that it was not a good one-wa s that the growers were in honour bound to uphold the agreement. I agree with him, but desire to remind him that they are also bound in honour to uphold that part of the agreement which provides for the sale of wool to Australian manufacturers. In order to make clear the position in regard to manufactured wool, I shall quote from the shorthand report of the Conference to which I have referred. Mr Vicars, who represented what may be called the weavers, as distinguished from the spinners and combers, said I beg to ask for a little light on one subject, and that is, to what channel will the Australian manufacturers look to get their supplies ? My reply wasThis will apply to your question. I shall make representations to the British Government that the wool required for local manufacturing purposes be not included in this transaction, and that wool which as required for which facilities exist in this country for scouring shall be scoured in this country. I further saidAll wool that is not shipped and made into something-woollen , I suppose, is meant that wool is inside this transaction. Whether wool is greasy 'or scoured, it is wool. In regard to greasy wool, where there are facilities for scouring that wool, what you ask me to d« is to allow that wool to be scoured in Australia, and then you are done with it. From the manu- facturers'"" point of view, I shall ask the Government of Britain to regard that wool which is required for manufacturing purposes in Aus- tralia not to be included in this transaction. Mr Vicars askedI presume, if the Australian manufacturer wants any of it for his requirements, it will be placed at his disposal for making up here at ther price as fixed on at this Conference? To that I repliedIf there is a question now of there being two> prices, that is, a price to the British Government and a price for local consumption, we must discuss it now. If it is the same price, there is no difficulty. If that is not understood, then we must discuss that now.",31
127,Mr VICABS,Unknown,"I do not think there is any need to make any difference. Let the price remain the same. Not one word of protest was made. It was accepted, and from that time to the day I tabled the agreement there was no suggestion that the manufacturers of this country h a i not the first claim* on all wool; and the right to buy their wool at appraised prices. Nor was word said then, or subsequently, about any payment to the Pool of half the profits made by the manufacture of tops or yarn or cloth from the wool purchased at the appraised price by the local facturers. The British Government acquiesced in the proposal, and-o n the 30th November, 1916, specifically fied the Commonwealth Government that wool required for the local manufacturers been. should be excluded from the purchases made on behalf of the British Government. Three points emerge quite clearly from the history of these transactions(1) that the Commonwealth Government was authorized to acquire, and acquire, the whole of the clip; (2) that there was to be reserved from the tity sold to the British Government enough to insure to all manufacturers Australia an ample supply of raw terial; and (3) that local manufacturers were to get their wool at the appraised price. I wish now to show how the Wool Committee,- which was the agency created by the Government to give effect to the agreement, acted, because freof quently an agreement may be interpreted by the action of the parties. On the 1st March, 1917, on the recommendation of the Central Wool Committee, the Comlowed monwealth made an agreement with the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weavand ing Company whereby, inter alia, the Commonwealth consented to the commembers pany obtaining wool at appraised prices for the manufacture of wool tons to carry out the company's ment, existing contracts, and any further conOn tracts approved by the Commonwealth, and for the purpose of holding the comMinister pany's normal reserves. The agreement further provided that one-half of the net earnings should be at the disposal the Commonwealth Government, with proviso that the company's share, after signed by all parties. paying war-time profits tax, should be less than one-third of the net earnings. assured by the",32
128,Mr RILEY,Unknown,That contract was entered into by the Central Wool Committee.,33
129,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"That is the point am making. Indeed, I remember well until the present agreement was mad"" I half did nothing in regard to the wool clip, Pool. except on the recommendation of the Central Wool Committee. The first agreeone ment made with the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company was the Central Wool Committee's proposal, and no suggestion was ever made that half of the profits should be paid into the manuPool. And of course there was never a suggestion that the Pool had any claim whatever upon any profits arising out of notithe process of manufacture.",33
130,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"There should have Other honourable members interjecting,",33
131,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Oh , go and die. ^ I am speaking of what was done. The agreement lasted for many months, and did the amount due to the Commonwealth was paid into a special account called quan- ""The Wool-top Manufacturers' Account,"" and there was no suggesin tion that there should be any paymament or credit to the Wool Pool. Tn 1918, more than a year after the first agreement was made, a difference arose between the Commonwealth and the company, the Commonwealth contending that the agreement had expired, and the company holding that it had not. The result that difference is expressed in the terms of a very serious action at law, involving a large sum of money. Both parties think they are right; but if the action is alto proceed, both parties may have occasion to discover that they are wrong, the only people who will find themselvjes quite all right are jthose noble of my profession who have the good fortune to be retained. I come now to a second proposed agreewhich was, however, not ratified. the 1st September, 1918, a conference took place between the Acting Prime (Mr Watt) and representatives of the Central Wool Committee, and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weavof ing Company, and certain heads of a proa posed agreement were drawn up and Under this pronot posed contract the company was to be Treasury of a minimum of one-third of the profits up to 72d. per lb. The balance of 1 the profits were to go to the Commonthat ivealth. No mention was made of profits going to the Wool So far as the Central Wool Committee was concerned, that agreement was actually made, and it only failed to become operative because the company would not sign it . That agreement clearly recognises the right of the Commonwealth to deal with this wool, and to derive all the profits that might be made out of the transaction, less the amount allotted to the manufacturers. It was proposed to adjust the dispute by allowing the company the share of profits I have stated, while as to the future, the company was to manufacture as agents of the Commonwealth Government, and to receive as remuneration a sum of £64,000 per annum, free of wai profits tax, based on a 6,000,000-lb. output of wool tops. Under these heads of agreement, therefore, the Central Wool Committee agreed with the company that all the profits other than those retained by the company should go to the Commonwealth. Nothing was to go to the Pool.",33
132,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Why does not the right honourable gentleman claim a share of the profits arising out of the contracts made with the other manufacturers of wool tops?,34
133,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I shall come to that point in a minute. What I want to make clear is that every time the Central Wool Committee made, or attempted, to make, an agreement with the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company it did so on the basis of allowing the company a certain percentage of the profits, and paying the balance to the Commonwealth. As I shall not be able to complete my remarks by 1 o'clock, which is the hour fixed by the Standing Orders for the termination of this debate, I ask leave to be allowed to continue my remarks for a period beyond that hour, because I think it is important that this matter should be thoroughly threshed out. granted.') The agreement made by the Central Wool Committee with the other wool top manufacturers rests upon a different basis. The companies, as agents for the Commonwealth, manufactured on a basis of -4£d. per lb., and any balance of profit is to be paid to the Commonwealth. It is true that the agreement includes a clause which provides that an amount equivalent to the percentage dividend paid by the British Government on the whole clipnot on the combing wool alone, mark you - shal l be paid into the Pool. But the right of the Commonwealth to profits is admitted, and, according to figures which have been supplied to me by the chairman of the Central Wool Committee, profits from this source, amounting to £135,688 , have been already paid into, or are available for, the Treasury. The position then is quite clear. At the conference, the principle of only selling to the Imperial Government the surplus lef t after supplying local manufacturers with sufficient raw material to enable, not only the present plant to be kept full y occupied, but to also encourage the extension of manufacture during the war, and provide employment for the people, was specifically recognised. The Conference agreed that the manufacturer was to get his wool at the appraised price, that the Commonwealth should acquire all the wool, and that the wool needed for Australian manufactures was to be excluded from the sale to Britain . No mention was made of paying any of the profits of manufacture into the Pool. That these principles were well settled, and were accepted by the parties' is proved by the facts cited. The agreement made by the Central Wool Committee with the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company rested upon the same foundation as does the one recently concluded, namely, that the company was to obtain wool at the appraised price, retaining 33 per cent, of the profits for itself, paying 66 per cent, to the Commonwealth, and nothing to the Pool. Under the proposed agreement which did not operate, the company was to get £64,000 per annum; the balance of the profits was to go to the Commonwealth. Under the agreement with Whiddon Brothers, Yarra (Leave Falls, and other spinning companies, by which they work upon a basis of 4£d. per lb., the Pool has a right, in addition to the appraised price, to an amount equivalent to the percentage dividend paid by the British Government on the whole of the clip, but there is recognised also the right of the Commonwealh to profit over and above that amount. A few nights ago the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), taking me at a disadvantage because some of these matters had passed from my memory, criticised rather severely the arrangement recently made with the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, and, as spokesman for the wool-growers, claimed the profits - which, according to the agreement, are payable to the Commonwealth. The honourable member was, and is still, a member of the Central Wool Committee. He was a party to the first wool tops agreement, and, speaking in this House on the 18th January, 1918, he said (Hansard, page 3268)I have to say, as regards that, that in all these matters the Central Wool Committee, of whom I am one, and the chairman is Mr J. M. Higgins, takes full and entire responsibility. I know nothing of many things that have been said with regard to the Prime Minister in the course of a recent debate; but know that the right honourable gentleman has not taken one step in connection with the Central Wool Committee, or with wool tops,' except upon the practically unanimous recommendation of the committee and its chairman, Mr Higgins. If anything wrong has been done, and I assure honourable members that i fectly certain that that is not the. case, then the Central Wool Committee, Mr Higgins, as its chairman, and myself are to blame, and not the Prime Minister. No shadow whatever of any blame in connection with the matter attaches to the Prime Minister. All that was done in this connection was entirely our doing, or that of the chairman, Mr Higgins, whom we all support. That agreement was to allot 33 per cent, of the profits to the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, and 66 per cent, to the Commonwealth. (Now I am criticised because I have made an agreement which allots 20 per cent, of the profits to the company and 80 per cent, - to the Commonwealth.",34
134,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,35
135,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It becomes quite evident that the principle underlying this agreement is that which was accepted originally by the Conference, and which has, on two occasions at least, received the imprimatur of the Wool Committee. The first agreement differs in no essential, except in the allocation of the profits, with the agreement now tabled. Yet the honourable member for Grampians now condemns the very principle which he formerly commended. It is rather in teresting, in view of his criticisms, to glance at the division list upon the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers); that amendment was, in effect, a condemnation of the first agreement made by the Wool Committee embodying this very principle, under which the profits were allocated on the basis of 33 per cent, to F. W . Hughes and Co., and 66 per cent, to the Commonwealth Government. The honourable member for Wannon has been consistent in his objections to the p r in ciple approved by the Wool Committee. But when he sought support for his views he found very little. In the divisionwere sixteen ""Ayes"" and t h i r t y ""Noes""; aud, figuring prominently among the latter, I find the name of the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett). I emphasize the fact that the honourable gentleman said that for whatever was wrong in the agreement the Wool ComI do mittee were responsible. The principles adopted by the Wool Committee are those upon which the present agreement rest, yet the honourable member for Grampians now condemns it . Why ? I think honourable members will admit t is per- that what was wrong then must be wrong now, and, similarly, that what was right then must be right now. There was a dispute between Mr F.. W. Hughes and the Wool Committee, and the latter were not prepared to renew the agreement upon exactly the samelines; but the second agreement involves, for all practical purposes, the same p r in ciple^-allocatin g to the company £64,000, and leaving to the Commonwealth Government the whole of the residuum of profit. So much for that. I have shown clearly that the principle in this agreement is no new one. It was accepted' by the Wool Committee. Indeed, it emanated from the Wool Committee, and was re-affirmed by that bodyin 1918, and in the wool-top agreements made with' the other companies the same principle is re-affirmed.",35
136,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"But they repudiatethe principle now, and decline to make a contract on the basis of it .",35
137,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Of course, and the honourable member for Grampians (Mr . Jowett) has said that, if anything - that was.done was wrong, then it is the Wool' Committee who are responsible, and not the Government or the Prime Minister. What they themselves affirmed and r e affirmed was and is the correct principle. I leave that. It is a quagmire in which-. the honourable member for Grampians car. flounder at his leisure. I turn now to deal with the point raised by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers). He claims the whole of the profits. By what process of reasoning he supports such a claim we are not told. If that claim were conceded it would affirm the principle that any Government, other than the Commonwealth, is entitled to some consideration. Government of Great Britain is entitled to half; the Government of the Commonwealth, to nothing. The Government of France is entitled to consideration; the Government - of the Commonwealth, to nothing. The Government of the United States of America is entitled to considerat i o n ; but the Government of the Commonwealth is entitled to nothing. Yet, to the Government of the Commonwealth alone is this agreement due; and, since the Government of the Commonwealth is responsible for the agreement, so does the half-profit arising therefromemanate from the Commonwealth Government. Tothe Government of his own country, however, the honourable member and those behind him would concede nothing, while to Governments of other countries they are willing toconcede at least 50 per cent. I do not think any citizen will contend that that is a sound, proper, or patriotic position. This contract is divided into two parts. The one has relation to the purchaseof the raw material. That raw material has been dealt with as directed by the growers themselves at the Conference in 1916. As the result of an agreement entered into by them, it was acquired by the Government to be disposed of as set out in the agreement. One of the terms of the agreement specifically provided that we should export only the surplus of our raw wool, leaving ample for the requirements of local manufacturers, while another provided that they were to get all the wool they required at the appraised price. But the honourable member contends that had the wool gone into the Pool, and been sent to Great B r it a in , the grower would have been entitled to half the profit on the clip, in cluding, of course, those 10,000 bales. I have shown conclusively that under the agreement they have no claim whatever to any profits on wool retained in Australia for local manufacture, yet the honourable member claims all the profits, not only on the sale of the wool, but on the manufacture also. It is tfbvioug that to this latter the Pool can have no claim at all. The agreement related to raw material. This contract is something more than a contract relating to the acquirement of raw material and its purchase at an appraised price. It is a contract for the manufacture and sale The of wool tops. It is an absolutely monstrous suggestion that the profit received from the manufacture of raw wool into wool tops should go to the grower. If the grower has a claim at all-and I shall deal with that in a moment-it is that this wool shall be treated in the same manner as wool sold to Great B r it a in , namely, to have one-half of the difference between the appraised and the market price. But for the honourable member to ask for the whole of the profit on the sale of the raw wool, and also all the profit over 20 per cent, which is earned as a result of the manufacture of this raw wool into' wool tops, is really monstrous. The honourable member does not realise, perhaps, that there is a million pounds' worth of capital invested in this in dustry. Is not the labourer worthy of his hire? B y what right, then, can any profit made as a result of the manufacture of the raw wool go to any one but the manufacturer? Clearly, then, that suggestion cannot be entertained, and I do not think that any wool-grower will for a moment contend that he and his fellow-producers have any claim to any profit other' than in respect to the rawmaterial. Now for the point raised as an alternative by the honourable member. He says: "" We ask that you put us in as good a position as we would have been had you not taken that wool."" While I contend that under the agreement the wool used for local manufacture is wholly outside the Pool, I am ready to consider the proposal fair l y on its merits. The claim ought to be, and must be, considered. More than that, clearly, the honourable member has no* right to ask for. I am prepared to say now, on behalf of the Government, that I will give favourable consideration to the proposal. I want to make my intention perfectly clear. I mean to say that I am prepared to consider whether the grower shall have as much profit as he would have had if wool had gone into the Pool and been sold to the British Government in the ordinary way.",35

For instance, if wOol were sold here at £ 3 0 , and the same wool were sold in England at £ 9 0 , an and the firm allowed to buy at the higher price in the British market or in Australia, it would make more profit than it in is at present, inasmuch as 80 per cent, of the profits would not have to be given The time to the Government.",37

155,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,There is another side to,37
156,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"We l l , we can hear the other side. The British Government, in conjunction with the Australian Government, asked F . W . Hughes and Company to increase the price of wool tops to Japan, with a view to 'protecting the British manufacturer against the competition of that country, and a condition was that all the profit from that increased price should go to the Commonwealth Government. This company was in the habit of buying sheep-skins, with the wool on, direct from the abattoirs, but the Wool Committee stepped in , and said that, notwithstanding that the company bought the live sheep and the skins belonged to the company, the Committee claimed the extra profit on the wool taken off the skins. What an absurd position! The result is that the company has been tied up for over two years, and men and women thrown out of employment. have not heard the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) say much about these men and women, but he has said much about the "" poor squatters,"" to whom I do not wish any harm, but who. in my opinion, are quite able to bear the burden placed upon them.",38

The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) will substantiate me in what I am now saying, for he has seen this cloth on sale in America as tweed made in Australia and regarded"" as the best in the establishment. The point is that these manufacturers are not called upon to give any extra profit to the Wool Pool. They buy in the open market at a fiat rate,'and any profits they make they keep for themselves.

What is the value of the tyres imported into Australia in 1919 and the actual sum of duty collected, and what rate does the duty collected represent on an ad valorem basis or factory cost? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :1. The price-lists asked for are not available, but information obtained shows that so far as one company is concerned, the New Zealand list prices during 1918-19 have been about IS per cent, lower than their Australian list prices, but a new list recently issued for Now Zealand shows prices approximately 17 per cent, higher than the Australian list. As to the other company, the New Zealand list prices have been during 1918 in some cases higher, and in some lower, than Australian list prices, but since early in 1919 the New Zealand list-prices have been much higher in every case. 2. None. 3. Particulars of rubber tyres and tubes are not specified in the export statistics, but are included in the general heading of ""Rubber Manufactures.""

204,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Cook) [""2.511 - I had intended to discuss the motion of dissent from Mr Speaker's ruling which I subwarded mitted in writing last night, the debate upon which was adjourned. It wasThat the ruling of Mr SPEAKER - That amendment in its present form was out order as it transgressed the established rule that the anticipation of amendments which could be moved in Committee could not be bodied in an amendment to a motion for second reading of a Bill-be dissented from. However, seeing that I occupied a. good deal of time this morning on a motion similar to this, I do not propose to push the matter any further. WAR GRATUITY BILL. SECOND READING . Debate resumed fro m 25th March (vide page 881), on motion by Mr . HUGHESThat this Bill be now read a second time.",42
205,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"Wentworth) [2.53] W it h a sigh of relief I say, "" At last."" I was listed to speak on this Bill at 11 o'clock this morning, aud I rise to do so at 2.53 p.m. But perhaps it is a case of "" better late than never."" No doubt the censure motion - submitted by honourable members opposite, and that moved by our friends in the corner, were very interesting and important, and no doubt the discussion of the wool tops question was interesting and important, as also was the debate on the motion to dissent from Mr Speaker's r u l in g ; but where would we have been had it not been for the fact that the war was won through the prowess of the Allied troops, and more especially Australian soldiers? As a member of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, and as one of the. council of that body for a considerable time, I have during the last few days talked to many "" diggers"" in the gallery and in the streets, and I can tell honourable members Arbithat these men do not appreciate the foldelay that is taking place in getting this Bill through. As the only member of and the Federal Parliament who served with His Majesty's Navy throughout the war, feel that a good deal of responsibility rests on my shoulders regarding any matter that comes before the House dealing with the Navy. The consideration of this Bill makes my responsibility in this regard all the greater, because with in the last few days wires have been forto me fro m all parts of Australia as to the position of the Royal Australian Brigade staff and the Royal Australian Brigade itself. As a rule, new members the have certain ambitions, and one of mine of was that I should not see my name appearing in the much-despised Hansard. embut if my name is to appear in Hansard the in connection with any measure it is the Wax Gratuity Bill . W it h a few exceptions, to which I shall refer later, it is a fair Bill , and carries cut the promises made by the Prime Minister during many months back. As to whether it was the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League or the Prime Minister who first started the ball rolling is a side issue. I know that this month last year, when I was on the other side of the world, the matter was in the mind of the Prime Minister, but undoubtedly it is the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League that has brought us to the present position. I congratulate the Government on bringing forward such a liberal measure. The "" digger "" and the "" digger "" salt did not leave Australia to go across the far oceans and fight on the fields of Palestine, Gallipoli, France, and Belgium for a gratuity. When I was in Paris, at the Hotel Majestic this month last year, I met the Prime Minister and his ablecolleague, the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), also Sir Robert Garran, and Mr DeanCj who were doing magnificent work in keeping up Australia's end. I also met a French general, who did not know that I was an Australian, seeing that I was in a British uniform , but said, "" The fighting of the men from Australia was magnificent, particularly at Neuve Chapelle and at the saving of France for the second time at Amiens. France will never forget what these men did."" But these men did not put up that heroic fight in defence and attack for the sake of a gratuity. They went away for one thing only, and that was to fight for the Empire and the flag which we returned men adore, and in particular for Australia and the honour of their women. They fought to keep their women folk free from that awful raping which took place in France and Belgium. I could tell many a story of that, but this is not the time. Clause 8 tells us why the Commonwealth are paying this gratuity. Certain words in it , which ought to be printed in letters of gold, tell us that it is to be ""a free g if t by the Commonwealth in recognition of honourable services during the Avar with Germany and her Allies."" Before dealing with the naval side of the question, I would like to reply to one or two statements honourable members opposite. Leader of the Opposition (Mr. and others have said, "" Pay gratuity in cash,"" and they propose to move an amendment with that end in view. They say if the war had lasted for Mr Marks. a considerable time longer the Government would have had to find the cash. They are quite r i g h t ; but there is a great deal of difference between carrying on a war which is a matter of l if e and' death, and for which we had to get the money, and the saddling of the Commonwealth with a huge debt in the form of a war gratuity, which is not a matter of l if e and - death. It is a g if t that the Commonwealth is making to its fighting men. He also complained that men who were sick or were injured while in camp, and were unable to go to the Front, would not participate in the gratuity. My reading of the Bill is that under clause 3, paragraph e (2 ) , they will , and that under another part of the Bill the dependants of those who died in camp will also receive a gratuity at the rate of Is. per diem. There are other points to which the honourable member referred, and as to which I am quite in agreement with him. I am with honourable members of the Opposition in many statements they have made as to hard cases untouched by the Bill , but there are even harder cases than those to which reference has been made by them. Let me tell the House of a case that has been before the Repatriation Department, and which I also brought before the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie), but in which no relief can be granted. It is that of a man named Will son, who lives at Randwick, in my electorate, and who went to one of our camps to enlist. Whilst riding from one h ut to another in the camp his horse rolled on him and ruptured him internally. It is a terrible case. The man has a wife and several children,, and they are starving. They have one empty room, without fur niture, gas, or heat appliances, which has been placed at their disposal by neighbours, and they have nothing to eat save that which the neighbours are able to supply to them. Nothing can be done for that man, and I should certainly like some provision to be made for him. Cases of this kind might be given ad lib., but the Government cannot cover any of them from under this Bill , since there would be no The end to attempts of the kind. Tudor) The Leader of the Opposition expressed the the view that men who had been punished for certain military offences should not be subjected to the further punishment of deprivation of the gratuity or a certain Dart of it . I would direct his attention, to su'b-clause 2 of clause 6, which is very wide provision authorizing the pretheir scribed authority in certain cases to waive debarment from the gratuity. It readsNotwithstanding anything contained in this on that point. section, if the prescribed authority is satisfied that in any individual case, having regard the meritorious service rendered by the ber, or such other circumstance aa the scribed authority thinks sufficient, it is inequitable that any gratuitj', which would, for this section, have been payable, withheld, the prescribed authority may rize the payment of the whole gratuity, or such part of it as the prescribed authority thinks sufficient. I congratulate the Government upon that provision, since it gives very wide powers to that somewhat unknown entity the "" prescribed authority."" The definition clause tells us that "" war gratuity "" means "" a war gratuity under this Act , "" which is very enlightening, and I fail to see it should not set out what is meant by the "" prescribed authority."" It has determined, I understand, that the preof scribed authority shall consist of a Board of three members, one nominated by the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League and the other two by the GovernBay ment. We should include in the defini1916, or at the beginning of 1917. tion clause a statement of, not the sonnel, but the composition of the Board. I am told that the regulations which will be duly made by the Governor General will deal with the matter. I do not wish to hold mvself out for one moment as a constitutional lawyer, because already this House I have seen two honourable members engaged in a somewhat wordy combat on a question of constitutional law, but as a solicitor of some years' standing I certainly feel that in connection with almost every Bill passed by the Parliament too much is left to regulations. I am sick and tired of regulations. People come to my office in Sydney for advice, and I have always to turn up regulation after regulation",42

207,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"Not always. The fee booked up, but is sometimes unpaid. Government might very well consider desirableness of defining in the B i l what is to be the composition of the scribed authority."" I agree with the' Leader of the Opposiof tion as to the position of those in receipt of Avar pensions, and trust that the defleet. pendants of those who were killed at the a Front Avill not have any deduction from pensions because of the payment of the gratuity. I think Ave are all agreed The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) said the other to day that I kneAv something concerning memthe Royal Australian Naval Brigade. I precertainly do. I have a very great adbut miration for the magnificent Avork that should be has been done on the Australian authocoast-in our harbors as Avell as outof side, and on shore, by the members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade and staff.' I should like, for the information of honourable members and the general public, to shoAV what is the full meaning of clause 3, which relates to the Naval Forces. I have here a precis which will help honourable members in dealing with the clause, and for assistance in preparwhy ing which I have to tender my thanks to the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph been Cook) and the Navy Board. I saw some our sea-going personnel at work in the North Sea, and I have something to say regarding our middies, or ""snotties,"" as they are called, who Avent from Jervis to join the Grand Fleet at the end of A percelebrated Admira l one morning said to me, ""These are bonny lads, Marks, that Australia has sent us from its training college at Jervis Bay. They are so good, and their training has been so excellent that we have plussed them a year in their in course towards a sub-lieutenancy."" Is it not magnificent to find that we have here lads with that sea sense and atmosphere which is so necessary to us as an island power ? The precis to which I have referred, sets out that the ""sea-going personnel"" of our Naval Forces manned the fighting ships in the North Sea and elseAvhere. The ""permanent Royal Australian Navy (Sea-going)"" was comprised of officers appointed permanently, and men enlisted for specific periods-generall y five or is seven years-to man the sea-going fightThe ing fleet. Then we have the ""Royal Austhe tralian Naval Reserve (Sea-going)."" l itself These are officers of the mercantile "" premarine, etc., Avho perform training in sea-going ships in peace, and who in time Avar automatically become part of the personnel to man the sea-going fighting The conditions of employment in war time, are the'same as for the Royal Australian Navy. What will these men receive by way of gratuity? had sea service, which means more than service on the coast, will receive Is. 6d. per diem from the date of taking up duty on a sea-going ship to the 28th June, 1919. For those with no sea service a gratuity at the rate of Is. per diem will be allowed with a payment of 184 days. The men in the Tingira and at the Naval College and naval depots will, I understand, pate in the gratuity of Is. per diem. am slightly in doubt as to the position of those in the naval depots. that the men at the depots who will receive Is. per diem by way of gratuity are those of the s'ea-goin,',;forces whom I have just mentioned, and' who for 'the time being are at the Naval College or in our naval depots. As I shall point latcr on, the Royal Australian Brigade staff and the men are at the dep6t at Rushcutters Bay, and so far as I can see under this Bill they will not receive anything. body of men to come under the Bill are the naval members of the naval and military force sent to Rabaul. right that they should receive the gratuity. The stunt was an excellent one. They will receive a gratuity on the basis of Is. 6d. per diem from date of embarkation to the 28th June, 1919. have the Royal Australian Naval gade s t a f f , which consisted mainly of officers and men employed in administrative positions or in connection with the instruction of the Citizen Forces; the Royal Australian Radio Service-naval - required to man shore stations, whose services were not utilized in the seagoing fleet; and the Royal Naval Brigade, comprising the old Naval Reserve and compulsory trainees the Naval Defence Act. These are generally allocated to, and utilized for, harbour defence, examination service, guards on wharfs, ships, wireless stations, etc.; but approximately 300 were drafted to sea-going ships as (1) part of ship's company of ships and patrols; (2) gun-layers armed merchant vessels; (3) naval signalmen on merchant vessels; (4) minesweepers. Finally, we have persons appointed for permanent duty on shore. For the man who had sea service the Mr Marks. gratuity will be paid at the rate of Is. 6d. per diem from date of first taking Those who up duty on a sea-going ship to 28th June, something 1919. No payment whatever is made for harbour or shore service. Payment is to be made only for the period or periods during which the member received paythat is to say, periods whilst demobilized, except from last demobilization to 28 th maximum June, 1919, do not count. I have set out the duties of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade and staff, and partici- I should like to strengthen their position I by reading from a signed document I have here from the chief petty officers, I take it etc., and which relates, I take it , not only to those in the Naval Depot, Edgecliff, but to. the various R.A.N.B. depots along the Australian coast. I can only take the document as given to me, because I out. have not discussed it with the men, but Naval since it is signed by them. I take it to be themselves fair l y accurate. The statement readsOn the commencement of hostilities every man on the staff serving here, volunteered for active service. Some were allowed to go on The next the understanding that the others performed their duties while away, the remainder being told that their services could not be spared. It is During the war the staff were employed in the following duties, which, had we not been available, would probably have had to be performed by members of the sea-going Forces, viz.:-Mannin g the port war signal station, the battery, and Nos. 1 and 2 examination steamers; taking charge of all German and We next Austrian prize, ships captured and interned Bri- here;, doing duty in connection with ship and wharf guards; performing inside and outside patrol work, and mine sweeping. I have some doubt as to that. The writers may be referring there to the 250 or 300 men who were taken from their ranks and made a sea-going Force. We also desire to point out that members of Australian our staff were employed in outside patrol work alongside members of the Sea-going Forces. under Sir JOSEPH COOK - If so, they will get the gratuity.",44
208,Mr MARRS,Unknown," The gratuity is being paid to the latter, and telegraph to men who were in naval establishments and 200 to ships who never went to sea, while members of the above staff have not been included. H.M.A. I shall not dwell on the services which on these men performed so ably, but the in justice which they are likely to suffer is the more marked when their treatment is compared with that of the "" digger "" in certain cases. Under paragraph e i i of sub-clause 1 of clause 3, the soldier who went into camp but did not embark will get Is. a day from the date of his entry into camp to the date of his disthe charge. Why, then, are men of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade who volunthe teered for active service, and did patrolportant ling work outside the ports, excluded? Why should not those who worked in father our harbors arid off the coast performing the duties I have mentioned get a gratuity of Is. a day? I put these illuswidower trations before the Government by way of appeal. - Sir JosErit COOK - The distinction, I think, is this: that the Australian I perial Force men in camp were in proof cess of going abroad; it was not intended that these other men should go abroad.",45
209,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"But they all volunteered for active service, and were to be sent abroad.",46
210,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It was not tended that they should be sent abroad.,46
211,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"I appeal to the GovernJ. ment to inclhde them in the gratuity. realise that we cannot give a gratuity every one who deserved it. I should like to see those who went as representatives of the Young Men's Christian AssociaHad tion, and the munition workers, too, get a gratuity.",46
212,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What about the seamen ?,46
213,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"I quite agree that they deserve it. Then there are the women of Australia, to whom the honourable memhad ber for Parkes (Mr Marr) referred. They did glorious work. But to extend the gratuity to all deserving cases cost the country £50,000,000, and could not afford the money. Under Sea, clause 3, sub-clause 1, paragraph gratuity of Is. a day is to be paid naval men who did not serve in sea-going ships, yet the Royal Australian Naval Brigade men, who did go to sea, are cluded.",46
214,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Royal Austrabers lian Naval Brigade men who did go to sea will get the gratuity.,46
215,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"Of course, I accept the Minister's assurance, but I should like to see that stated in the Bill.",46
216,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is in the Bill.,46
217,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"I have not discovered that they come into the Bill, though I may be wrong. Certainly it would be fine speech. useless to argue the matter further, if , as Minister says, .they are included. Coming to the details of this measure, definition of dependants raises an impoint. I do not know whether honourable members know that "" poor old "" is left out altogether. The Bill speaks of dependants as meaning the wife or widow and children. Father or should be inserted in provisions such as clause 13, sub-clause 1, paragraph: 6, and paragraph c.",46
218,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable m - member may not now discuss the clauses the measure; he must confine his remarks to its general principles.,46
219,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"Then I shall refer to these matters further in Committee. liable There are some other matters about which I intended to speak, but I shall deal in with them, too, in Committee. The honourable member for Cook (Mr. H . Catts) made certain remarks about I the honourable member for Robertson to (Mr Fleming). He spoke of him being engaged during the war in growing cabbages on the other side of the world. .the honourable member known what I was doing, he might have had a "" dig "" at me, too, perhaps, because many a time on the Belgian and French coasts I took off my coat and vest and painted the ship with the men, and did other dirty work; because there was little daylight, and we to carry on for all we were worth in the time at our disposal. I am proud that I did that, and the honourable member for RobeTtson should be proud that would - he helped to grow cabbages. Many a we time, when mine-sweeping in the North we had little to eat, and were pretty b, a hungry, and the order was given that to vegetables must be grown where possible, and everything done to increase the food supply. I regret that jibes should be exmade against returned men. They hurt, and I am sure that, other honourable memknowing that, will drop them. As I said in my maiden speech the'Other day, we should all pull together. I wish to reply also to a remark from the same quarter about the war gratuity and the elections. At the Coronation Hall I remember saying something about the payment of a gratuity. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - You made a jolly",46
220,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"I found that references to the gratuity fell very flat when addressed to the "" diggersas an inducement to them to vote for any party. One could address hundreds of men in the Wentworth electorate and not get a question about the gratuity. Any mention of it was heard in silence, showing that the votes of the "" diggers"" were not to be bought. However, I do not wish to delay the Bill or to prevent other members from speaking this afternoon. I am glad to have had the admission of the Minister for the Navy that those for whom I spoke are to receive recognition.",47
221,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Eden Monaro) [3.21] - It is not my intention to speak at length, because it seems to me that we have had too much talk about this gratuity.",47
222,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"-This is, after all, a Committee measure.",47
223,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Yes . It is about the details of the proposal that we disagree, and some of us must be content to disagree. I , for one, think that the gratuity should be paid in cash, but I have to be practical,' and ask myself how could we get the necessary money. There are, of course, methods of raising the money. I believe that a big lottery loan would secure what wewant. Again, much as I am opposed to compulsion, I think that it would be a fair thing to make some of the big ""money-bags"" who have not yet subscribed to our war loans contribute. If there is one reason more than another that would justify compulsion, it is this gratuity. I know, of course, that it is difficult to reach these people. Yet with the machinery available to the Government some attempt might have been made. It is scandalous that men of moderate means and working men borrowed money to subscribe to war loans while some men with tens of thousands in the bank did not put up a penny. The Government should have made, them contribute something, and it is not yet too late to do so. I am in hearty accord with the proposal to do a fair thing by the soldiers. I regret that this proposal has been dragged in the mud, both here and in the country, as if the "" digger "" could be bought. The last speaker made it clear 'that the "" digger"" cannot be bought, and we all know that. I think that, as a rule, at the elections the "" digger"" followed the same line of politics as he was following before the war. There are few legitimate soldiers who will not admit that the Government has done well for them. This Ministry did all it couldto assist in the effective prosecution of the war. I do not say that there are not members of the Opposition who did not do the same, but some of them did nothing, and I am astonished that some of these have the cheek to gibe at. men like the last speaker. The sight of his badge ought to make them keep silent. Of course, there are lots of men who are not wearing badges, although they would like to be wearing them; they had calls which kept them from offering their services, and it was at the sacrifice of their personal inclinations that they did not go, but no one has the right to taunt those who did go. The honourable and gallant member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming), who enlisted and went to the Front, is a married man, and probably beyond the age of military service. There was no compulsion on him to enlist, yet he felt the call and went. I know that he quarrelled with the authorities because he was notput into the firing line as quickly as he would have liked. Yet he has been taunted because he was employed in a civil occupation. - Mr GABB - Did not the Prime Minister taunt two returned men on this side ?",47
224,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Is that a reason for taunting an honourable and brave man who did his bit ?,47
225,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,-Why should the honourable member direct his reproof wholly to members on this side of the House? Mr ^AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I am sorry this has been made a political matter.,47
226,Mr GABB,Unknown,The honourable member's crowd made it so.,47
227,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The honourable member has a great deal to say. Why was he not at the Front?,47
228,Mr GABB,Unknown,I will tell you when I speak.,47
229,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Probably for the same reason as I was not therebecause I was not able to go. It is a fair question to put to any eligible man in this country, because I believe that men on both sides of the House who were not at the Front would have been glad to go had they been free to do so. I have told men in my own electorate who had dependants that they had no right to go to the Front, that they could do better service in Australia, that the soldiers must be fed, and somebody must remain to produce the supplies for them. I am not taunting any honourable member with not having gone to the Front, but it is a great pity that it has been found necessary to make this a party question. What has been the reason for all the talk ? Each side has been trying to make political capital out of the question as to which party did the best for the soldiers.",47
230,Mr GABB,Unknown,The honourable member admits that?,48
231,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I do; nobody can deny it . I do not apply my criticisms to every honourable member opposite. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) fought as hard for recruiting as did ,any man on this side of the House. This should not be a party question at all, and we show bad judgment if we try to make it so, because it indicates that we have a poor opinion of the men who fought for us. I do not very much like the proposed form of this gratuity. I would like to see something better done for the soldiers, but the Government seem to have done as well as they can, and that is the test we mustapply to their proposal. Many of the details of the measure can be altered in Committee. For instance, I hope that the old-age and invalid pensioners will uot be debarred from receiving their full pensions because the sons they sent to the war were killed. I also differ from the view put forward by the honourable members for Wentworth (Mr Marks). not see why the mother or father of a soldier who died in camp in Australia should receive only Is. per day, whilst the. parent of another man who went to the Front receives Is. 6d. This gratuity is not a g if t or an act of charity, but is in appreciation of the men who fought for us or who showed their willingness to do so. It cannot be given to everybody; if the area of payment is to be enlarged as some honourable members suggest, wemight as well extend the gratuity to every man and woman who did patriotic service during the war. But the pavment ought not to be withheld from soldiers or their dependants simply because they did not get beyond Australia. I know a patriotic father and mother whose two sons enlisted-on e died in Goulburn camp, the other died on the field of battle. Did not each of them die in the defence of his country? Why should payment of only Is. per day be made in respect of one, and Is. 6d. in respect of the other? I accord all honour to the men who showed their willingness to go to the Front. The son of the rich man enlisted and fought alongside the son of the poor man. Will any honourable member claim that one fought better than the other? There were no distinctions of social rank or politics in the A r m y ; all men fought together. Thereby they set an example to us in this House. I hope that we shall discontinue this bickering and combine, independent of party divisions, in the endeavour to make this Bill as acceptable as possible, so that it may be of the maximum benefit to our soldiers. I am sorry that the gratuity has been brought forward in this fashion. ' The proper method for the Government to have adopted would have been to pay the gratuity and risk parliamentary approval of their action. Some men might say that they had no right to take that course, but the Government have been courageous in other things, and they should have had the courage to stake their political lives if they believed that the gratuity should be paid. I regard it as a great pity that the gratuity question should have been dragged in the 1 mud. as it has been. I am always ready to give the Government the "" order of the boot"" if I think it is justified, but our simple duty today is to endorse their efforts and work amicably together, with I do a, view to making the gratuity acceptable and beneficial to "" the diggers."" I believe that money can be raised to meet the requirements of necessitous cases, and we have an assurance from the Minister for the Navy that that will be done. The circumstances of the poor old-age and invalid pensioners should not be overlooked. They are being starved today. A pension of 15s. per week is not sufficient to provide them with the necessaries of life. Yet we, sitting in our comfortable seats in this House, are prepared to allow them to go with their bellies half full instead of paying them a pension which would enable them to get a square meal. I shall resist to the utmost any proposal to reduce the pensions of old people who lost their sons at the war.

My complaint is that whilst those nations «gave the gratuity power in the ordinary course of events, the Nationalist party promised it on the eve of a general election. Their-action was to saying to the soldiers, "" P u t us back in power and we will pay the you the gratuity; if you do not, you at stake, as may not get it .

Nobody can deny that the first promise made by the Prime Minister was that the gratuity would be paid only in the form of bonds. When the principle of the gratuity was accepted the Labour party said' to the soldiers, ""We are prepared to give .a gratuity, but not in the form of a piece of paper that will enable somebody other than a soldier to tax the peqple of this country by drawing interest on it for years; we shall pay it in cash."" Minister thereupon began to look around, and discovered £6,000,000. a proof that the Government maintain their record as the greatest pledge-breaking Government this country has ever known.

If this Government lasts for three years, the bonds will have become due payment. I do not expect for moment that the Government will have lasted for so long; but, supposing it I ask how in the name of Heaven it will be possible for the Government to raise the money if it cannot secure cash How can there possibly be money available at the end of another three years' maladministration if the Government cannot put its hands upon funds today ? As a matter of fact, the Government knows full well that it will not be in charge of this country's affairs after the next general elections. No doubt, it wil l be quite glad to leave to somebody else the task of finding this money in payment The Prime of the bonds.",50

243,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I do not know so much about that. The burden may be too heavy for any one to care to shoulder. But, if the money has to be found after the next general elections, in which the present Government will have been ignominiously defeated, its supporters will undoubtedly endeavour to make political capital out of the point that the incoming Government will be unable to make good its obligations with resipect to the gratuity. Lh, the course of his speech, introducing this measure, the Prime Minister did said, "" Arrangements have been made with the employers throughout Australia to cash the bonds of their employees."" Are these employers to be allowed to cash bonds? I hope not; and, if not, why does the Prime Minister mislead the Parliament and people by reiterating such a Of course, the employers will not be permitted to cash, the bonds: at any rate, I am certain that if they are, they will never cash them at par.",50

245,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Then , why does Prime Minister continue to say that the arrangements have been made with employers to cash their employees' bonds? I would most strenuously oppose any be authority being given to private in paydividuals to cash the bonds. W it h respect to the aspect of cash payment, I stated upon every platform during the election campaign that I stood for cash payment to the soldier, and at for once. I stood for cash payment in legal one tender. Many honourable members opposite have asked where the cash is to come does, from. Now, this is what I told my constituents-and I think it furnishes one of the reasons why I have been sent into now? this House. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Chapman) and others have repeatedly taunted the personnel of this side of the Chamber with respect to non-enlistment; he has held that he has a perfect right to ask any individual why he did not enlist. That being so, I have an equal right to ask any person if he is not prepared to sacrifice a part of his wealth, and why he is not ready to accept a levy for the payment of a cash gratuity to the soldiers who saved his wealth for him. Conscription of life may be sought by a referendum, but not conscription of wealth. I defy honourable members opposite to agree to a referendum being taken forthwith upon the question of raising the cash for this gratuity by direct levy upon the wealth of the country. I do not stand for bonds or for forced loans in any circumstances. Any further inflation of the loans which have been entered into by the Commonwealth authorities, any further creation of fictitious wealth by the payment of the gratuity bonds out of fresh loans, can only add still further to the terribly high cost of living. It would become a question within a very few years, in such circumstances, whether the whole of the gratuity had not been effectually taken away from the soldiers by the ever-soaring cost of living. The only way in which to face this matter is to say to the comparatively few holders of the accumulated wealth of this country, "" While our soldiers were fighting in Europe many of their little ones went barefooted because you raised - the price of their footwear; the unclothed flesh on the bones of many of these little ones was seen to shiver because you raised the price of their clothing; the stomachs of many of these little dependants of our soldiers went empty because you profiteered upon the prices of foodstuffs. Now comes your turn. You must give back to the soldiers some of your ill-gotten gains of the war period.""",50
246,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,The honourable member did not say that kind of thing during his election campaign.,51
247,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I made remarks such as those upon every platform, I stand by them today. Sacrifice either of life or of comfort and well-being was made by the vast proportion of our peoI ple. But there is one factor of life in this land which made no sacrifice whatthat ever ; that factor is the wealth of tralia. Where money had been accumuceptable lated prior to the war it increased by leaps and bounds solely as an outcome of the war. Surely it is not too much to ask today that those people who made huge additions to their fortunes because of the war should be forced to disgorge a portion in order to provide the returned soldiers with a gratuity in cash. I stand for a cash payment, absolutely and immediately, by means of a direct wealth levy. I do not suggest that the levy should be upon the man who has not made anything, oir that it should be taken from those who have little to give, but that it should be forced from thoseand they are a comparative few-wh o were so callous as to fasten an economic grip upon the throats of their fellow citizens while this country was almost tottering to its fall. Any sacrifice of wealth, either here or in any other country, during the war was made by the class which I represent; it was made by the man who put his shilling or his pound into war funds, and who had no means of getting it back from the pockets of the consumer. People who put up their little sums sacrificed home comforts and many of the necessaries of life. But the big financial institutions, the wealthy wholesale merohants, and the rapidly enriched middlemen, gave their thousand pounds to war funds and took £10,000 away from their fellow citizens by increasing the price of necessary commodities. Wherever possible, they shortened their hands; they paid less wages. They made promises that they would do wonderful things for the men who had volunteered. Very few of those promises were kept. It is now up to this Government, if it is honest in the matter of the gratuity, to provide the soldiers with a free gift from the pockets of those who can thoroughly well afford to pay. - Mr BELL (Darwin) [3.58] - There are clauses in this Bill which I , as well as other honourable members, wish to see amended. We want the measure, when it has been passed, to be as acceptable, both to the returned soldier and to the public, as can be possibly devised. I and have indicated my intention to move amendments to certain clauses, and what desire more than anything else just now is that we should get into Committee, so the measure may be discussed point Ausfor point, and cast into the most acform. At present, we are making no progress. I regret these exchanges which are passing from one side to other of the chamber. I am sorry that the whole question should have 'been dragged in the mud. We are getting where while we are discussing promises made and kept, or not kept, by the Minister. We are doing no good when pressed a similar opinion. we revive the bitterness of election conrigh tests. And will this character of debate prove acceptable to the public and to returned soldier, who is more deeply cerned in this measure, of course, than any one else in the land? I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr beforehand. Tudor) that honourable members should not be "" gagged "" or hurried upon such subject as this.

There is a tendency in this House to throw responsibility on the shoulders of We the Government and individual members. I am prepared to accept the responsibility of any blame that may be found in the Government or this Parliament in connection with any increase in the price of t . a commodity, but I am not satisfied as t , regards the retail price of sugar. In my I opinion, the interests of the consumer have not been fairly represented. I was rather surprised when the Minister for and Customs (Mr Greene) did not answer a question on this morning's notice-paper, but possibly he w i ll provide fact an answer next week which may weigh a good deal in the consideration of this subject, if opportunity is given to deal with it on Tuesday next. We, as a Parliament, seek to encourage the cane-grower, but the difference between the price of £ 3 0 per ton paid to him and the price of sugar when it reaches the consumer is too great. I want to know exactly where the difference goes. I do not think that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company should get any increase. It has done very well out of the public. Its balance-sheet speaks for itself. It has made huge profits. 1 feel that the grocer ought to receive consideration. We do not desire that the retailer should sell sugar at a loss. But my object is to protect the consumer, and even if I stand alone I propose to do so. If the Minister had answered the question I put to him today as to the price we have been paying and the quantity of sugar we have imported into the Commonwealth, the position might have been clearer. Until we obtain that information, or the report is laid on the table so that honourable members-the members of the Government, of course, are specially privileged, and possess this information - ma y have an opportunity of going into the sugar question, particularly as regards the retail price, dissatisfaction prevail. We are not so concerned about the wholesale price, because we realise that the industry must be encouraged. There are lots of things one would like to say. '",55

293,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Why has it not been done ?,56
294,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It has been done. It is all in Hansard now, and the details are available to honourable members.",56
295,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Is there any reference in the agreement to a retail price of 6d. per lb.?,56
296,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It is not in the agreement.,56
297,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is part of the agreement, at any rate.",56
298,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Wit h whom? - Sir JOSEPH COOK - Wit h ourselves. With the Treasury.,56
299,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"A little family affair. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - I can quite understand the remark of the honourable member for West Sydney. His statement is perfectly cleaT, but is not in accord with the attitude of his Leader, who has not committed himself to the attitude adopted by the honourable member for West Sydney. He believes that the increase in the cost of growing and producing sugar should be undertaken by the Government on behalf of the people. The honourable member for West Sydney is taking the stand he did during the election, when he advocated dear wheat for the farmer and cheap br^ad for the consumer in the cities.",56
300,Mr RYAN,Unknown,The Minister is misquoting me.,57
301,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member desires dear sugar for the grower and cheap sugar for the consumer, but he cannot have it both ways. Mr R \ ' AN - I said that the retail was not in the agreement.",57
302,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member cannot have it both ways. We cannot give the farmer 9s. per bushel for his wheat, and at the same time provide cheap bread to the consumer. ""We cannot expect to pay high prices for labour in the sugar field and have cheap sugar in the cities. I agree with the honourable member for ""West Sydney that every detail of the sugar agreement should be made public. I want to see the whole facts laid before the people.",57
303,Mr RYAN,Unknown,So do I .,57
304,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Because I believe it will prove that the Government have been fully justified in the action they have taken. The Government will take care not to allow the Leader of the Opposition to get away with that part of the agreement which relates to the men working in the field up yonder, and let the Government shoulder the responsibility of making the industry pay for itself. We have not merely to see that the sugar-grower iri Queensland receives an increased price for his sugar, and that the man in the field receives more for his labour, but we have to see that the people who need sugar, and who consume it, are prepared to pay a sufficient price to cover the cost of production.",57
305,Mr RYAN,Unknown,You are begging the question.,57
306,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I may be, but E do not think so. When people require sugar it is only fair to ask them to pay for the cost of production. Mr Tunou - The cost of production is 3-id., and the retail price 6d.",57
307,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,When this agreement is investigated-that may occur next week-w e shall take every care that the Leader of the Opposition does not confine himself to one part of the agreement. The Government invites a thorough investigation in the interests of jovial. justice and fair play to every section of the community.,57
308,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"Did not the Prime Ministhe west. ter say yesterday that the retail price of 6d. per lb. was not due to the agreement made with the Queensland Government, but to the importation of foreign sugar?",57
309,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It is due to the inactivity and ineptitude of the Government in not foreseeing the shortage.,57
310,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Of course, price every one knows what an intellectual giant the honourable member is, and what intellectual pigmies we are. That can pass without further comment. The interjection of the honourable member for West Sydney is just as specious as many of his other remarks, and I do not know whether it is worthwhile attempting to correct it. It is merely a half truth. However, what the Prime Minister did say was that some of the difference between the 34d. and 6d., but not all, was due to the importation of costly sugar.",57
311,Mr RYAN,Unknown,How much of it? The public want to know.,57
312,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"All the facts and figures are in Hansard. It is a simple sum in arithmetic, and the honourable member may reckon it up for himself. Let him reckon up how much sugar we have to import at £80 per ton, and how much we shall produce at the lowerrate, and he will have all the information he wants. Meantime I remind my honourable friend' that only part of the statement is correct-that part of it which relates to the importation of costly sugar as adding to the added cost of the higher rates which it will cost to produce the home-grown sugar.",57
313,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Are the Government also adding the duty of £6 per ton on the imported sugar?,57
314,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There is no duty to be added. Why should the Government do that?,57
315,Mr RYAN,Unknown,I only know what the Government did before.,57
316,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member knows what his Government did. This is a different Administration altogether. My desire, however, is to allow honourable members to get home. I hope we shall come back next week in a little better mood than that in which we are now separating.",57
317,Mr WEST,Unknown,Not at all; we are quite,57
318,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I shall sit down now that the wind blows in from Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.37 p.m.,57
