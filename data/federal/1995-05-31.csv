2,Mr CAMPBELL,ASSENT TO BILLS,"One of the problems with being in continuation is that you forget what you have said previously. My problem is compounded by a very convivial dinner last night with predecessor in the seat of Kalgoorlie. I want to dwell on the importance of industry policy to the future of this nation. Without industry policy there will not be full employment, without an import replacement manufacturing industry there will not be full employment and then the only future for Australia will be as a high wage country. Those people who talk about cutting wages are talking nonsense because we will never be able to cut wages enough. The big problem we have had in Australia, the great failure of the Menzies years of government and the result of the high tariff walls, is that there was no recognition of need for Australian control. I stress that control is actually more important than ownership, although ownership usually implies control. Let us look at the motor car industry. In. 1946, Mr Hartnett, who was then the General Manager of General Motors Holden's and, believe, a great Australian, suggested that should have a car industry. He said to Mr country. Chifley, 'If we are going to have a car industry we must have our own industry, we cannot make someone else's cars and we must control.' Decisions are made either out of the hope of gain or the fear of loss. In my view, the government at that time acted out of fear of loss and decided it would invite Motors into Australia to make a car That way it was seen that there could be no loss and there could be no failure. After all, the Americans knew how to make motor cars and perhaps we did,·not. Although we Bill had been producing the most sophisticated aeroplane engines, the government lacked faith in our ability to produce cars. What we got was a second-rate American which brought with it total American control. Had he we opted for an Australian car it would have been a more risky road, but there would have been more potential to develop. If we had produced an Australian car, it probably would have had a six-cylinder motor because of the large distances we have travel. Because of our road conditions at the time, it would have had good suspension and higher ground clearance. Due to our climate and the distances we travel, it would my have had a big radiator and a large petrol tank. In short, it would have been a car very suitable to the Australian conditions at the time and the conditions that prevailed in the Indian subcontinent, Africa and most of South America. We could have had the Volvo of the Southern Hemisphere. Instead we got a second-rate American car which we could sell only where the Americans wanted us to sell it. Due to connivance between the company and the unions, the tariff walls were forced up which made those cars more expensive. Those cars were built just for the Australian market. This was an opportunity lost. The car industry the today is foreign owned and it would be very hard for Australia to get into that industry. We ought to now look at niches. I do not think we are as disadvantaged in heavy transport. There is still a future, a potential, for us there. Certainly, we could look specifically at the area of four-wheel drives but it I would have to be Australian owned, in my we view, to be of any enduring value to this The other thing we must look at-and both sides of this House talk about it-is the need for value adding. Anyone can see that there is great potential in value adding in terms of jobs. Unfortunately, our customers of our main products, which are raw materials, do not want us to value add. They want the raw material because they know that value adding is where the jobs are. Of course, you must give the customers what they want. We do not have any alternative because they will raise either border barriers or duties if we try to transform mineral products. In terms of the mineral industry, Australia's most important industry, we have to give this matter great consideration. We should value add the front end. Australia is the world's premier miner. There is no country in the world in terms of productivity that mines better than Australia, and in terms of the technology we apply we are state of the art. But we do not make the machinery, except on a very small basis. We import about $1.2 billion worth of equipment every year that we could manufacture ourselves-they are not my figures but those of the CSIRO-but we do not do it. We do, however, get this equipment in the main designed for Northern Hemisphere conditions, probably for cold and wet conditions, and we modify them for hot, dry and dusty conditions-the conditions which prevail in the areas where mining nowadays tends to take place. We design modifications and make them work. They then go overseas and are fitted to the equipment. In other words, we pay for our own modifications, which is incredibly silly. We are now in a situation where Australian mining companies are getting access to the Pacific Rim, Asia and South America. In Mongolia I believe wages are something like $37 a week. With the mineral resources they have, and using Australian high technology and good management, they could outproduce us. We could be in a situation where our mining companies move offshore, particularly if they are subjected to increasing sovereign risk. We would then be left with nothing because we would have no manufacturing industry, and we would not have mining either. It is a grave concern which must be addressed. If we manufactured equipment, however, we could sell it even if that equipment were more expensive because in the mining industry quality equates with price. If an item is more expensive but more reliable, it is actually cheaper for the mining companies and they will buy it, particularly the production mines. We are not in that position. Britain, on the other hand, although it is no longer a major coal miner, is a major supplier of coal mining long haul equipment. We are missing that vital boat. We need to have a leapfrog in technology. We need to get our people working, get our design teams out there, coming up with innovative machinery. There are areas of the mining industry that will have to be addressed such as robotics, automatic underground steering of vehicles and remote controls for vehicles such as bulldozers and the like working in dangerous environments. Australia has the cutting edge in that area but we are not doing enough with it, and I believe that is the missing link. We have the large mining companies. We have the large customers. We have the state-of-the-art customers. We are the best miners in the world. We have the suitable R&D, and we have demonstrated that. What is lacking is government will. That does not mean massive government subsidies at all; it means we need government commitment to do this. I will point out how important this government will is. Jonathan Todhunter, who in my view is a great man, has contributed a lot to Australia. During the wool crisis, he was writing about the need for value adding our wool. It is through his efforts that the first, and in fact only, custom top maker was established in Parkes. That company has now become one of the world's best top makers in terms of quality and price. He has said to me on several occasions that he would not have persevered with that business as he did under extremely difficult personal conditions had it not been for the support he got from the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the current Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). He had talks with the minister who told him that he wanted the industry, that he believed in it. He said without that support from the minister he would not have pursued it. It is true that the company got a loan from the government of $10 million. That was small in comparison to the loan that went to a: similar company in Geelong which has not been anywhere near as successful. But he said it was mainly that support from the minister that encouraged him to pursue it. It is very importright ant for the government to have this philosophy and belief in the people of Australia so that we can have in this nation a very good manufacturing industry-a state-of-the-art, import replacement manufacturing industry. This does not necessarily imply tariffs, but I do not resile from the need for tariffs if you need. to set the industries up. If we are smart about it, we should look at the way to go about it; we should look at the sorts of industries we want. This is not a case of picking winners, although I do not resile from that. Other countries pick winners; I do not know why we cannot. But it is picking the direction that you need to go in, the sorts the industries you want. There is a big future here for us in Australia. I believe that if we do not address this we are simply never going to get on top of employment and we are never going to be able to address the· continuing current account problem.",11
3,Mr BRADFORD,ASSENT TO BILLS,"It must be something about the air in the west that we have the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) coming in here and speaking largely good sense. Most of what he says in this place, at least what I have heard this morning, is a strident criticism of the government of which he is a member. His former colleague from the west Senator Walsh was also a renowned critic of the government while he was a member of the government, in fact a minister of the government. Eventually I think he threw his hands up in the air and said it was all beyond redemption and resigned as a minister and subsequently from the parliament. Since he has left the parliament he has remained a strident critic. Most of what I read of the former Senator Walsh makes a lot of sense. The fact is, as the member for Kalgoorlie said, we should have had and can still have an effective manufacturing industry in this country. But what the Labor Party has never come to grips with and, it seems to me, is incapable of ever coming to grips with is the main ingredient of that-an industrial relations system that allows that to happen. We can talk about tariffs till the cows come home, and the member for Kalgoorlie was to the extent that you cannot have the manufacturing industry behind a high protective wall of tariffs and expect it to be competitive because it will not be and it has not been. He pointed to the car industry as a prime example of something that had so much potential but will eventually be protected out of existence. In the end, you have to survive in the world market if you are going to be a part of the world market, and that is what we aspire to be. To be a part of that the real ingredient that you cannot overlook is the need for a competitive, modern industrial relations system. This government has not only failed to deliver that but also gone in the wrong direction, and we are seeing evidence of that in the newspapers every day. We have seen evidence even in the last week of criticism by a judge about the unfairness, the unreasonableness and the imbalance that exists in the current industrial relations legislation which clearly favours employees and militates against employers' interests. That will not work. It has not worked. It is anti-employment. Of course the word out in the electorate that I get everyday is: if you cannot fire them, then you are not going to hire them. That whole industrial relations system needs to be overhauled radically and changed to enable Australia to develop competitive manufacturing industries and to find our way in the world. Until we come to grips with that as a country, until that happens, then of course we will not survive. There is no doubt in my mind, nor in the minds of most Australians, that the government won the last election by a combination of deceit and default. The extent of that deceit has become more clear as time has gone by and more apparent with broken promise after broken promise. The budget which was presented to this parliament in May was the latest in a long line of frauds perpetrated on Australians by this government. This was a pre-election budget. Everybody knew that, barring some unforeseen circumstances, this was going to be the last budget of the Keating government. Its main intention, therefore, as I understand it, was to buy a little time. The government realised that it needed to produce a budget which would be fiscally responsible, fot obvious reasons, and, balanced with that, which would fulfil the requirements of any other pre-election budget. In other words, it was the budget on which the government was going to have to go to the people and seek re-election. As it turns out, the government has failed on both counts. The worse thing for Labor, as the post-budget wash-up has shown, is that nobody bought the rhetoric, despite the very best efforts of that master salesman the now Dr Keating. His prescription has proved to be a pill which nobody was prepared to swallow, except for the government members who come into this place and attempt to defend the indefensible. We have heard them speak in this budget debate. Many of them must be very nervous indeed about their prospects of coming back to this place after the next election.",13
4,Mr KERR,ASSENT TO BILLS,Not as nervous as Mr Connolly.,14
5,Mr BRADFORD,ASSENT TO BILLS,"- Mr Connolly, apparently for other reasons, is not coming back. Let us recap on what Labor's legacy is at this stage to the people of Australia. We are talking here about 12 years of Labor government. A lot is said in this parliament about debt. I suspect that the average person out there in the electorate has yet to come to understand debt, because the economics of the debt that has been created are complex. But as time passes they will begin to understand more clearly not only the extent of the debt that the government has created for this country but, more importantly, the impact that this level of debt will ultimately have on every Australian. . When this government came to power, Australia's external net debt was around $23 billion, about $1,000 per capita when Mr Howard was last Treasurer-a debt level within reasonable bounds and obviously in aggregate terms not extremely high. But our net debt level today exceeds $170,000 million, which is over $l1,OOO-that is, an II-fold increase-for every man, woman and child in Australia. Some of that is public debt and some of it is private debt. In the end it does not really matter; it is a debt that Australia has one way or another. That debt will increase by another $27 billion this year. The irony of the budget that has been b-ought down is that, for all of the apparent pam that we have gone through with the recession we had to have and a budget that I will deal with in detail in a moment, there will be very little gain. We still end up with a forecast d-fi.cit in addition to our debt levels of $27 bIllIon a year, which is about as high as it will have been for this financial year. The total debt level is getting close to six per cent of our gross domestic product. 'I.'hat places us second in the world only to MeXIC? That needs to sink in with people. We read m the paper about Mexico struggling for survival-virtually being bankrupt and having to go to the United States and, thanks to President Clinton's largesse, getting a huge injection of funds, billions and billions of dollars, just to allow it to survive. Yet Australia compares unfavourably with MexiCo in our level of debt. We are now close to the highest debtor country in the world. Australians need to understand that this will severely impact on our standard of living in the future. You cannot keep propping up the country by borrowing money. The government in this budget has simply bought a little time. It is keeping its fingers crossed that some of its projections will come true so that somewhere down the track-and we are talking, as most of the budget talks, about years and years down the track-we will eventually perhaps be able to buy back some of the farm which we have sold off or repay some of the debt we have created. The debt to which I refer is one that none of us in this place will have to worry much about. But let me assure the House and the people of Australia fhat it will'be a problem for _(mrchildren and for our grandchildren. It will continue' tdpiace enormous pressure our standard of living. The inevitable conse,quence of this debt, of course, is that our standards of living will fall' <lcnd continue to faU. It is not a terribly difficult proposition to manage the country's budgets. In very sintPle terins, it is a bit like runnirig your own hold, budget. When you get to the point in your hoUsehold budget where you have to sell the family jewellery to pay for' the weekly groceries, you are pretty, desperate. That is where this'government is in terms'of ru1l11ing this country, and that is exactly what we,see in this particular budget , . '. Interest rates are another legacy of this government's poor economic management over 12 years. We get told here that interest rates are coming,down-and, of course, they are coming down from historically high levels. But the point, is that in real terms we still have in this country both the highest long-tet.m and short-term interest rates in the world. That does not really sink in with most people. They, sort of look at the aggregate interest rates and think,well, they were 15 per cent, let us say, a couple of years ago; they are down to seven or eight per cent now; that is a' pretty good improvement. ,·But the fact is that; when we get.to talk of real interest rates-and that is, after all, what the real cost of doing business in this country is, and it is a' real cost, of course, that is borne 'by those industries which are attempt to ing compete in the world--=-it is real interest rates reaily that we 'are talking of, because they are the ones with which we are competing against the rest of the world. And, as I say, we still have close to the highest long term and short-term interest rates in the world; Unemployment is another legacy of this government. Of course, we have gone through a period where we had the highest level of unemployment in the history of this country, the worse recession since the Depression and unemployment levels that have exceeded one rpillion. Even with this budget, there is still a projection of unemployment at the end of it all being in excess· of eight per cent. on Th--fact is 'that everybody in Australia who has any brains at all realises that even that fjgure vastly understates the real level' of unemployment in this country.· The w-y that unemployment is meastired i& actually extremely generous. I think the government has hou,se- gone to g!eat lengths - herever it can to minimise that figure. We all know that the governl)1ent has cooked up all these schemes1 programs and everything else; it basically dbesevetything it can to get people out of that unemployment figure. But I believe that, when you really couilt the underemployed people in this country, and count those who . are' counted, as employed because they are doing a couple of hours of work a week, you would probably find that the real level of unemployment, including underemployment, in this country is twice the official number,. I think t,hat is deplorable. ' It is particularly deplorable because many of those 'people who are unemployed are young people. It is no wonder that, as we meet young people in our constituencies, we are currently faced with what I think is a very sad situatiqn where there are young people about tO'leave school, entering high school; .. perhaps with a prospect of It:;aving school within 'a few years time, whci really have very little hope or optimism about their future in this country simply because they know that already those who are 'leaving school are unemployed in huge numbers. We are talking about 30 to 40 per cent of young people in some areas being and remaining unemployed and, in' fact,' with very little prospect of becoming employed. They, 'therefore, of course, are totally destroyed by that situation: We have seen, of course, in Australia over the last 12 years a decline in our national savings level to record low levels-and, in fact, not only historically low levels for Australia but also internationally. The reasons for that are complex once again. The fact is that. the government knows that is a problem and is attempting to do something about itand, ,to some extent,,it requires a long-term solution. . , But the fact is that taxation levels, as are in Australia, are high. Let us face it, story the government trots out about Australia being a low tax nation is another furphy, another piece of rhetoric we salesman coming out with. I repeat: the fact is that we are very highly taxed in this counfallen try, by any comparison, if you get right to bottom line-:-especially if you start comparing apples with apples. People cannot save in that sort of situation. The only way people can save is if you allow them to have more disposable income. Then they will choose to save, given the right incentives, ,which are not there either. government that effectively says to people, - I can spend your money for you better than you can,' is counterproductive in terms of saving. If you want people to save, you have to give them the wherewithal to save.",14
6,Mr KERR,ASSENT TO BILLS,"If you give me your money, I'll spend it for you.",16
7,Mr BRADFORD,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I could give the minister a bit of a lesson in economics. think he is a lawyer and I excuse him for his economic illiteracy, but the fact is that if want, people to save, you have to reduce taxes. In Australia we have gone in the other direction. We have on the other side of this House the highest taxing, highest spending government virtually in the history of thIs nation. People cannot save in that environrelative ment. The result of 12 years of Labor is lowest saving levels ever"" the low savings levels by international comparison. The other legacy of Labor-it is a very long list and I am obviously going to run out of time-is that our dollar is now very much undervalued .. Yesterday there was a question to the Treasurer (Mr Willis)",16
8,Mr KERR,ASSENT TO BILLS,It is winter now. The sun gets up later.,16
9,Mr BRADFORD,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The minister can have a chance later, I am sure. I would very much like to stay here and listen if he does get up and justify the budget, because it would be a very interesting exercise. The Treasurer was asked a question yesterday about the fall of the Australian dollar vis-a-vis the yen. His answer to that was glib and they oversimplified. He simply got, up and said, the 'All currencies are falling against the yen. That is okay. We are just part of the bunch;' That was a totally inadequate answer. That is hear the master just dismissive. The fact is that the Australian dollar has dramatically against the yen over the the last five years,. The yen, as the Treasurer rightly said, is one of the strongest currencies in the world. We ought to be concerned about the fact that our dollar has so devalued against the yen. My colleague the member for Wentworth (Mr Thomson) is an expert in this area, so I am aware of his presence. I am sure A he will correct me privately if I am wrong; but it seems to me the Australian dollar to the yen has probably depreciated at least fivefold. Even 12 months ago, the dollar was worth about 100 yen. I think it is down to ahout.60 and still falling. ' Mr Thomson-:Fifty-nine,",16
10,Mr BRADFORD,ASSENT TO BILLS,"It is down to 59. The dollar buys 59 yen, whereas it seems thatless I than six months ago, or certainly 12 months ago,it was close to 100. The fact is that ,it is you almost too expensive for Australians to go to Japan now. It is very cheap for Japanese to come here, and we value them. Certainly in my electorate we have lots of tourists from Japan and that is a very valuable by-product. The Australian dollar has gone down to almost every other currency. I was the in Korea recently. The Koreanwon is becoming a more and more valuable currency. The Australian dollar is consistently being devalued against the won, but you could use as an example just about allY Asian currency or even the American dollar. That is one that most Australians are familiar with. Again, there has been a pattemofthe Australian dollar coming down and down. That is a judgment of the world community on the Australian economy. It is a judgment on this government's management of the Australian economy. It is avery obvious measure of the want to world community's estimation of this I think government's economic performance. The Treasurer's answer to that question yesterday about the depreciation of the dollar was glib. He knows, if he is perfectly honest-anyone that is informed knows-that the fall of the Australian dollar has enormous economic ramifications for·us. As it continues to fall,. so it will continue to be a major problem. Let me, in the couple of minutes I have remaining, just examine the government's insipid response to this crisis. What we have after 12 years of Labor government, as I have just outlined, is a crisis, by any standards. Mexico has a crisis and has had to go to America and borrow billions and billions of dollars. We are nortoo fat behind it. In the budget we have a fabricated surplus with asset sales and other fiddles incorporated there. There are even, as we have now found out, some serious errors in double counting with the sale and lease-back of Dasfleet and so on. So we have a fabricated surplus. There are tax increases, not the promised tax cuts. Personal taxation is going up 13.6 per cent; sales tax is up and expanded; cars are going up $1,000; homes are going up $1,000; the Medicare levy has gone up; company tax has gone up; and the fringe benefits tax has gone up-and we were promised tax cuts. How long can the government get away with this? We will see. We will not have long to wait before we find out. I suspect that, at the next election, the Australian people will inake a very well thought-out response to the government's management of this country .. We also see in the budget increased, not decreased, expenditure outlays which are up 7.1 per cent in 1995-96 after taking out asset sales. This is a big spending, big taxing government. It has proved itself incapable of running.the Australian economy. This budget was no response to the crisis in which we now find ourselves.",16
11,Mr NEWELL,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I am delighted to join in the debate this year on Appropriation Bill (No. 1), to have the opportunity to put on record my appreciation of some of the programs which are contained in the budget and to outline how some of them will actually affect my electorate. I would say to the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) that, rather than stand on his side of the House and tell this side of the House that he wants the Australian· dollar to be worth 100 yen, he should perhaps go down to his National Party rump and tell them that he wants the dollar at 100 yen, or spend two minutes with the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and tell him that he wants the dollar at 100 yen-as he leaves the House without bothering to hear the remarks. This budget will bring quite worthwhile benefits to the Australian economy. It will continue the growth in the national economy which has seen benefits pass on particularly to the north coast of New South Wales. In the last 12 to 18 months there has been strong growth, particularly in the employment position, in that area. We have seen some 25,000 to 26,000 jobs created in just over 12 months along that coastal area. The north coast of New South Wales is generally seen as a retirement area where a lot of people from Victoria and Sydney go to retire after they have finished their working life. And why not? It has an ideal climate with many other benefits attached to living there. It means that the infrastructure of the area is strained considerably with the high immigration rate, if I could refer to it that way. Nevertheless, the employers on the north coast are to be congratulated for their efforts at finding· niche markets and being able to take on that number of extra employees. In the last 12 to 15 months we have seen a good turnaround in the employment statistics, from 17.2 per cent down to the figure for this month of 11.1 per cent. There is still much work to be done in that area. As I indicated, the infrastructure is barely keeping tip with the population growth. That makes it very difficult for local government regions to be able to provide the many needed services and amenities which one would associate with the area and with the population that we do have on the north coast. Nevertheless, I feel that the federal government is doing its little bit. With a little bit of encouragement from me and perhaps the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), my colleague in the next-door seat, we will continue that increased Commonwealth funding. One of the major initiatives that has been continued is the emphasis on regional economic developinent and the funding which has come through from regional development particularly to the regional economic development organisations. The Northern Rivers Ecoriomic Development Organisatiori was' one of the first organisations to be put in place and able to take up some Of that funding which was on offer to enhance the employinent position in our ,area of the north coast. . The effort that has been made to create jobs thrciugh""the new work opportunities has been c,ommendable, with some 600-plus positions thus far. The other work that NOREDO is able to offer the north coast is to coordinate many of the different regional local groups so that they 'can work on a regional basis, put together'plans and function to maximise, if you like, any beriefits which will come from their particular .industry. , 'One. other area of the Department of Employment, Education and Training T would like to mention is the Commonwealth funding of an innovative project at Kingscliff, which is in my electorate. At present we have a new high school, which was established some years ago, and last year we had the official opening of the,Kingscliff campus of TAPE, which was, substantially federally funded. That particular campus is not quite full, but it is certainly time to look for the next stage, and that is what the Commonwealth government has 'done. : :In' this' case the Commonwealth has come through' and given a grant towards a joint fa,cility between the high' school arid the TAPE college. That grant will go towards the construCtion of seven chissrooms, an 'art room, a 'science lab and a student studies area. The construction of those share facilities is inn07 vative and it will establish the link between the two facilities and enhance the opportunities for senior students. There are many cases now of students in year 11 and year 12 doing joint high school board courses in corijunction with TAPE. So that linkage between the academic side,.if you like, and the practical side is to be enhanced by that $3.1 million project, which will be completed by October this year. . The other aspect Of the employment, education and training budget! would like to' point out is that the Southern Cross University, centrally located in Lismore, has a university centre in Murwillumbah. It was originally the Tweed Open Learning Access Centre amI. has now been renamed the Tweed University Centre, but it still functions essentially as an open learning access centre. Thegreat benefit of that is that students do not have to travel to Lismore to have access to university education; they can simply visit that centre and through the modern means of comm.unication--'-through computers down a phone line-access information and so forth. I must point out that it is not just students of the Southern Cross University that are able to access their parent campus through the open learning access centre. Students' who have come into the area-in one or two instances they have come all the way from Perth, South Australia and Victoria-,-have been able to finish their course,s using the facilities provided at the university centre. The facility was used by some 400 students last year, and I had the pleasure just a week ago of attending a dinner tocele'brate with the 20 .graduates who used, the centre this year and who graduated from their respective' courses. I pay tribute to the management committee of the open learning access centre and, obviously, George Hanna, who has been a tower of strength behind the university centre since it has been established. Very shortly I will be meeting with the. vice-chancellor of' the Southern Cross University, Professor Barry Conyngham for the purpose of pushing along the university to further enhance that facility in the Tweed. I think it is most appropriate that that is done. The numbers going through the centre already indicate that the facility is worthy of an upgrade and a little bit of capital injection. I am sure that that will be forthcoming. The north coast area has traditionally had high unemployment. It is probably the first time in my memory that the area 'has had unemployment at less than three per cent above the national average. It is certainly a sea change. We are all pushing for unemployment to come down around Australia. Again, I pay tribute to the employers who have been able to take up the challenge and take oneither through their own initiatives or by utilising some of the initiatives of the Department of Employment, Education and Training-further employees and get them into real jobs. I mentioned that my area is a retirement area. Because of the proportion of elderly we have, obviously aspects of human services and health are keenly watched and sought after. I had the pleasure three weeks ago of opening the Tweed Valley respite cottage at Kingscliff. That cottage was funded through a partnership involving the federal government and the Tweed council. I pay tribute to the council for its involvement. It certainly helped to provide the land and some of the site works that were needed. The Commonwealth government built the cottage at a cost of $162,000 under the Commonwealth respite for carers program. This cottage will provide respite care to people who suffer from dementia as well as relieve their carers for a day or so-in some cases even overnight-in the Tweed region. I think everyone understands the difficulty that carers have in looking after on a 24-hour basis someone who is frail or someone who might be suffering from dementia. The Kingscliff centre was most welcome. Appreciation was strongly expressed by the council and by the executive of the respite cottage on the day it was opened, and they continue to express their appreciation for it. Carers are certainly the cornerstone of our community care. For too long their efforts were not sufficiently recognised. This has been addressed through programs such as the Commonwealth respite for carers program and through projects like the Tweed Valley Respite Cottage. It will be offering quality respite care by trained staff. As I indicated, will give carers of particularly people with dementia a chance to have a welcomed break. The other area of respite care I am quite proud has been undertaken in the area is the Byron shire respite day care service. That works out of the Brunswick Valley community centre located at Brunswick Heads. Some honourable members may be familiar with that town. The Brunswick Valley community centre is a state, federal and local government initiative which has been up and running for some two years. It caters for various community groups-amongst them in this case is the respite day care service. This service operates three days a week. It provides centre based day care for elderly people and again gives carers an opportunity to relax, possibly go off to do their shopping or just spend some time at home for themselves apart from attending to other matters that they would certainly be unable to do without a great deal of difficulty without a respite centre in close proximity. I mentioned that the funding for that project comes from the federal government. A little also comes through the state government as it is a project through the home and community care program, or HACC, which is Commonwealth and state funded. The door-to-door transport for the people concerned is also provided by a community facility-the Ballina-Byron Community Transport Group, which is ably chaired by Mick Malloy, who has been in that position for quite some time and is certainly well known for his efforts in coordinating that-as well as the volunteer drivers who are involved. They do a tremendous job of transporting people to not just the Byron Shire Respite Day Care Service but to various other areas, shopping centres and so forth right across the Ballina and Byron shires. My best wishes go to Collin Munroe, the coordinator of that centre. As it is an area where there is a high proportion of retirees, as I have indicated, it leads to some difficulties in the proportion of aged people immigrating. This means that sometimes the capital grants for facilities are lagging behind what is actually required. Most it of the grants are allocated on a census basis or on further surveys and updates. With a population growth of somewhere between four per cent and six per cent in different areasoverall across the north coast it is probably four per cent, but in other areas it is much higher than that-this is where we run a little behind. The federal governmental allocated another 40 nursing home beds to the Byron and Ballina areas late last year. I am certainly keen to see the minister allocate at least that number again when the next allocations are made. The facilities of the Maranoa nursing hostel at Alstonville were one of the earlier community organisations which provided aged care. The facilities are certainly marvellous when you consider that they were built almost 20 years ago and you look at the nature of the design. Obviously, the facilities do not meet today's standards, but if we look at the facilities today we know that the people who established those facilities had a great deal foresight. A capital upgrade package is required for that facility. I will certainly be supporting them in any representations that are made to the minister. I will be doing the same with the St Andrews nursing home in Ballina-another facility which was established some years ago with great foresight. The aged care complex there received quite a needy grant sum two years ago to provide facilities for the dementia patients. I might take the time to point that what I think needs to be done in aged care-we have various ratios for those over 70-and the number of nursing home and hostel beds that are required in an area where the number per thousand head of population over 70 is for the formula to be stiffened, taking into consideration that of those now going into a nursing home as many as a quarter or a third suffer from some form of dementia. That is a simple fact. Anyone who has been in nursing homes would appreciate what I am saying. The federal government's formula in funding has to take into consideration the higher costs for that aspect of ageing and the impost it puts on people running nursing homes. They are two areas that I will certainly be supporting in any future funding round from Health, Housing and Community Services. Moving to the other end of the age bracket-child care-what has come out of this particular budget has been extremely beneficial to areas such as mine. My electorate is a little further than most from capital and provincial cities and is an area that has, over the years, been out of favour in the rounds of funding. But greater access to child care, certainly through the child-care services, is now coming through. Right across my electorate, the family day care centres in the Tweed Coast area and Murwillumbah have certainly enabled many women particularly-I know in one or two cases it is not just women-to get back into the work force, as has the BallinaByron family day care centre, which covers both of those two areas. One other innovative project which has just started up is the outside school hours care of service at Tweed Coast-which is actually located at Kingsc1iff Primary School but covers what is called the Tweed Coast villages from Pottsville, Cabarita, Hastings Point and Kingsc1iff. The outside school hours service commenced operations at the beginning of this year with federal funding for 30 child-care after school hours places and 30 vocation care places .. That centre has been established by a voluntary parent committee, which worked for out some 12 months before the service actually commenced, to ensure that the vital service was available to parents in that Tweed Coast region in my electorate. I have already inentioned the Ballina-Byronregion whichreceived 30 extra places-they were already established-and they were able to put in 15 extra places in Alstonville. The federal government is doing a great deal for the elderly and for families in the electorate of Richmond. Much appreciation has been expressed in very strong terms to me, and I am simply passing on to the federal government and the appropriate ministers how people feel about that vital area. One other area that I am most pleased about is the recent launch by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) of the coastal care policy. It will be of great benefit. I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I can assure you that the Injured coastline report has been well received. I took part in the production of that report. All members of that committee are delighted-I am certainly delighted-that the government has responded in the way it has with the coast care package that gives some $23 million under the coastal care policy and the action plan.

12,Mr CADMAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Mitchell) (10.21 a.m.)This year's budget indicates that the Keating government cannot be trusted in terms of its promises or its commitments to deliver programs. The Keating-Willis combination cannot be trusted to bring to fruition their commitments or promises made to the Australian people. The community cannot expect the government to bring to fruition legislation implementing tax cuts and other benefits arising from this budget. I need to refer the House to some of the comments made by the Australian Labor Party during the last election campaign. I wonder whether members remember the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) saying in 1983 at Bankstown: We will open Medicare up to the private hospital system, so that it can purchase an estimated 10,000 private hospital beds per year for people on waiting lists. Do we remember Graham Richardson, the former senator, in May of the same year breaking that promise? He said: I'm not certain if we're going to spend all of that yet. I mean, that's something that's got to be investigated fairly carefully and obviously it depends upon how much private hospitals are prepared to go along with the scheme. Do we remember the letter from John Della Bosca to small businesses during the election campaign? As a postscript to his letter appealing for funds for the Australian Labor Party he wrote: It has been proven around the world that small business, especially industries like yours, will be the big losers from Dr Hewson's Fightback experiment. Dr Hewson will increase tax on you, tum you into a tax collector (unpaid) and give big companies a more competitive advantage. How will your clients react when your bills have 15% added to them? Ask the home buyers of Australia and those currently building homes under a firm contract how they feel now that the Australian Labor Party, despite the promise in that letter that it would not do so, has increased their costs by 12 per cent on the hardware items in the house-an increase in the cost of an average home of between $1,000 and $2,000. Ask the Australian home buyers, the people who are putting on extensions and those who were expecting better care under the health schemes, how they feel about the broken promises of the Australian Labor Party. It is in writing from John Della Bosca, campaign director for the Australian Labor Party, that the home buyers and the small businesses of Australia would suffer under a national goods and services tax, but here we have a goods and services tax from the Australian Labor Party on all sorts of commodities in order to raise funds and for a phoney balancing of the current budget. How can the Australian Labor Party be trusted? How can one ever expect anything it says to be delivered? To believe the Australian Labor Party would be like taking a berth on the Titanic, knowing that the Titanic was going to sink. It would be like buying a ticket on the flight that crashed over Lockerbie, knowing that the plane was going to be involved in that disaster. Why would anybody trust anything that the Australian Labor Party said? Prior to the budget I picked up a copy of the autumn 1995 edition of the ACTU publiit on cation Workplace. Prior to the budget the ACTU research officer, Grant Belchamber, wrote about what the workers of Australia might expect to see in the budget. They have been let down. Even though they had a prior understanding and a: prior commitment from the government of Australia as to what the government would try to do for the workers, the battlers have missed out. Mr Belchamber was under the false impression that the May budget was going to create jobs in Australia. The May budget will not create jobs. There is not enough growth in the economy for jobs to be created. The fact is that every day the Prime Minister crows about the Australian economy slowing down. What a thing to be proud of! 'The worse we are, the slower the economy goes, the better the Australian people should like it.' That is what we hear from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) every day. The more the economy slows, the fewer jobs there are, the less activity there is, the more they are succeeding in their goals and objectives. I will quote what Mr Belchamber, the research officer for the ACTU, said prior to the budget: If the May budget does cement in place a program to sustain job growth through to the next century and we do get the falling unemployment rate the country needs, there is an excellent chance that we will also restore the nation's level of national savings. What a let-down for him and for the workers of Australia. The ACTU's Martin Ferguson is in the House today. He must be a very disappointed man, despite the glossy remarks he made after the budget. He must be very disappointed in the Australian Labor Party. He was consulted all the way through. The workers of Australia are supposed to participate in the way in which this government operates. Mr Belchamber, in the ACTU's own journal, was saying that employment was the key to the government's success in the budget. How they have been let down! There are extra taxes. There is no growth. There are broken promises, with a harsher time ahead for families who will have $25 or $26 a week extra imposts because of this budget. That is for the average family. What a disappointment! How can one trust the Australian Labor Party? It is like buying a ticket on the Lockerbie aircraft, knowing that it is going to explode. Why would you buy that ticket? Why would you trust the Australian Labor Party? Look at its record. Nobody would trust it. Mr Belchamber, the research officer of the ACTU, concludes that article by predicting what the budget should do. He said: But consolidating the White Paper initiatives, ensuring they are adequately resourcedlisten to thatand integrated with the special needs and opportunities of regional Australia, will be the bottomline test of adequacy for the corning federal budget. The government cut employment programs, I have to tell the House, by $1 billion. Again Mr Belchamber was sadly disappointed. He was another of those potential passengers on the Lockerbie aircraft which ended in disaster. He bought his ticket. He trusted the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. It is very interesting to note some of the language that the Prime Minister used during this period. Referring to a member of the opposition, he said: He is part of that sleazy party that had no principle ever on anything. That could apply to the Prime Minister. He has no policy and has no principle on anything. One way of testing a person's attitude is to see how that person treats others. The Prime Minister's attitude to others gives a pretty good understanding of his character and outlook. In a reference to another member of the opposition, he said: He is brain damaged, Mr Speaker, have pity on him. One would have to wonder whether the Prime Minister was referring to himself and his Treasurer. He used those words in the parliament about a member of the parliament. It is time the Australian people started to tum the Prime Minister's words back on him. They also need to try to understand why a man who so consistently breaks his promises expects to be re-elected. I have referred to the pre-budget papers of the ACTU and what it expected the Australian government would do in this budget. I have also referred to how the Australian government let the ACTU-its constituency, its fund raiser and its provider of resources which it used to win the last election-down. I pointed out that the expectation was that the May budget would cement in place job growth programs and would be a consolidation of the white paper initiatives in relation to employment. The government has built the budget in a way that its objective of no growth will not produce any new jobs or cut unemployment. Some $1 billion has been knocked out of its initiatives under the white paper. I do not understand what the Australian government is doing to its own constituency. I have already referred to what John Della Bosca, the campaign manager for the Australian Labor Party at the last election, said the opposition might do to small business if it were elected to office. John Della Bosca said that an increase in taxes on small business would damage their prospects, but then within two years there has been a massive increase in taxes on business which was instigated by the party that by implication said it would not do that., I think this is amazing. Why would anybody trust the Australian Labor Party? Why would anybody trust the Prime Minister? I certainly believe that the electors of Mitchell will not trust the Prime Minister because on my calculations the increase in income tax to be collected from the electorate of Mitchell; as a result of this year's budget, will be $57.9 million. That is extra tax that the government is going to take from the taxpayers of Mitchell. In the electorate of Mitchell there are 70,000 people; not all of them are taxpayers. The government is going to rip from a comparatively small number of people in a comparatively isolated part of Australia another $58million. From that pocket 6fAustralia the govermnent is going to get another $60 million,. , Mr Latham-Isohited? It is not isplated. , Mr CADMAN-How much is coming out of the member for Werriwa's electorate? It would be the same. Another $60 million will come from the member's, electorate. The gov.ernment then says that that is going to benefit Australians. It is not going to create jobs, because it has cut the jobs program. It is not going to benefit who you say you stand for-the ACTU-because it is not going to continue the initiative of job growth or the jobs program. It is not going to help the home buyers, and home builders because you are going to put additional taxes on them and that is apart from the personal inco'me tax increases that I have mentioned. Where is the benefit toAti-tralia? There is no benefit to the average citizen 'of Australia. While the government is lauding itself for being responsible it i- creating further problems' for our fellow Australians. ' - I will point qut some ,of the sophistry of Australian Labor Party - Over' the, last few years it has claimed that it - s going to sell assets: In four budgets it has said that it was going to self Qantas. This tirne it is actually going to sell Qantas. The government counts the returns from the potential sale of Qantas in the budget to make it look good and then at the end of the year when it fails to sell or realise the price we get a bigger deficit thap we planned. . The government has said, 'We will sell Qantas this year-sorry, we did riot do it and we have a bigger deficit than we planned.' That has been going on for four budgets. It makes the balanced budget outcome look achievable for publjcity purposes. It has not been achieved. In fact, when Australia ,runs at a loss it means that as taxpayers ,we are paying a heck of a lot of interest. This year Australian t!lXpayers are going to have to find nearly $10 billion to pay the interest on money the' government has borrowed. Next year, it is going to be $9.4 billion., The year after, it is going to be $8:9 billion. Year after year, we are paying this sum just' to keep the ego of the Prime Minister ,running. , The Prime Minister has made promises. and not kept them. I will use the Lockerbie disaster as an illustration. He is just like the man at the ticket counter, or the fellow on television, saying, 'We have a special package. See the world. Fly over Scotland,: What a wonderful trip. You will arrive safely·in ,the United States and it is a direct flight,' knowing all the time that a bomb 'will blow that plane to smithereens when it is over Scotland: That is the style ofgovern-ent the Austr-i­ Ian Labor Party operates. It knows the results of its promises when it makes them"" The Prime Minister, I will remind: the House, made a commitment that'we would have tax cuts. He said to the Australian people, 'You can have all that the Liberal--rty. has', pr:otnised and tax cuts as well .. We ,promise you this and we will make it l-a-w, law.' He did make it l-a-w, law, except he, caricelled the law last week and said, 'We're not going to have it. I've changed my m-nd. But, in two years time; we'll get' into a superannuation scheme. If you are 18 years Of 'age today,in the about 47 years time you will benefit from my scheme.' '. ,This is anothe-:promise like the triP: over Lockerbie: 'Believe my pro-ise on superannuation. and' Australians will start· .saving again.' That is bunkum. It is a lIe,' and' t.he Prime Minister and the Treasurer knew 'it was Ii lie, on budget nigh- arid they' hoped' to ', - -""':convince the Australian people to believe the sophistry and the deceit of the Australian Labor Party in government. The Australian people have woken up. It has taken them a while, and it has taken us a while to get the language to point out to the Australian people what a disaster the Labor Party has been. One only has to look further into the budget to find out that Australia is really running very well and very successfully as a slowing down economy. Every day, the Prime Minister and Treasurer come in here and say ,'Things have slowed down even more. We are doing well.' All they are worried about is preserving their political skins because they are looking at the sensitive issue of interest rates. They know that interest rates are on the verge of rising. The timing of the next election depends on whether interest rates rise, remain stable or fall. The Prime Minister is hoping that he can manipulate and engineer a slight fall in interest rates. Even if it is for a period of six weeks, it will be long enough for him to run to the Australian people and say, 'There you are. We've done it again. Australia's on the mend.' But the Australian people this time will know that, at the end of the day, the ticket salesman for the Lockerbie aircraft knows that he has told another falsehood because he knows a bomb is on the aircraft. The Australian people are not going to wear the promise of falling interest rates and an economy under control, because they know there will be interest rate rises later in this year. We should look at our debt. If you look at the current account deficit for the last nine out of 10 months, this country has lost over $2 billion each month in that process. Where are the government's measures to take any control of that? It does not even have a plan. The government just staggers from day to da,y. The Prime Minister talks about policies to bring all of these things together. He goes up the coast, does something on the beaches-I think he calls it salting the mine-then swans around Parliament House doing something for the arts and whips that away at the next budget. Those sorts of things are happening all the time and the impression is that there is a lot of activity. Actually there are a lot of announcements, a lot of headlines, but there is no substance to what the Australian Labor Party is doing. The fact of the matter is that it does not care for the Australian people or the Australian community. During the last election campaign, one of the government's advertisements was headed 'Leave our homes alone: no 15% GST'. The picture is of a married couple with a daughter and baby son outside a: partly built home saying: Leave our homes alone: no 15% GST. Once again, 15% GST is added to the price when the builder sells you the house. So the costs add up-every step of the way-for roof tiles, plasterboard,paint, concrete, glass, furniture, carpet and even the kitchen sink gets the 15% GST. This budget brought a 12 per cent GST on the kitchen sink and Australians just pity you for the sophistry and lies that have been told by just the Australian Labor Party. That is an advertisement from the last election campaign. The Australian people are saying to the Australian Labor Party, 'Leave our home alone. We have had enough of you guys saying that you won't do things and then you tum around within a few weeks and break that promise.' It is no wonder there is a high degree of cynicism about and distrust of government in this country if the Australian Labor Party continues to behave like it does. Another advertisement reads 'GST-the real housing issue'. There were advertisements by unions and the ALP during the last election campaign that said Labor would never do it. You have done it. Australia distrusts you. You should get out of office and take that despicable Prime Minister with you.",21
13,Mr LATHAM,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I rise to endorse the 1995-96 budget, particularly its medium-term· strategy to lift national savings by bringing the federal accounts into structural surplus and introducing mandated superannuation reforms. This government has always been prepared to tackle Australia's chronic economic· problems. In 1995 this means· addressing the relationship between national savings, the current account and the rate of unemployment. A clear pattern has emerged in Australia's economic cycle. Whenever the current account deficit has approached six per cent of GDP, as it did in 1982, 1986 and 1990, growth has had to be slowed from the top of the business cycle for fear of an adverse response on currency markets. This has led to what I would term an externally ,constrained unemployment rate, ECUR, in Australia currently between six and eight per cent. The ECUR reflects, on the demand side of the labour market, a minimum level of unemployment linked to Australia's competitiveness and success on the external account. On the supply side, it is generally considered that Australia's non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, NAIRU, stands between 6.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent. Both measures, the ECUR and the NAIRU, indicate a standard of product and factor mark.et efficiency requiring continuous reform to 'secure full employment. Continuous reform, of course, has been the hallmark of this government.' Since the opening of the Australian economy to international influences in the mid1980s, the policy instruments of competitiveness, have been canvassed extensively in the puhlic debate. In most respects, the technical requirements for successful micro-economic reform in Australia are now well established. The implementation of these policies, particularly in the states, is primarily a function political conditions and common sense. ,This government has undertaken and entrench-din 10 years more micro reform and structural gains in the Australian economy than in the previous 80 years, the previous eight decades since Federation. In an internationalised trading environment, however, c;:ompetitiveness is never static; it is always relative to the performance of our trading partners and competitors. Continuous gains and continuous reforms are all important. Improved competitiveness is central to resolving growth constraints on the external account.' The In<;lustry Commission, for instance, has estimated that full implementation of the Hilmer reforms would lower Australia's current account deficit by two per cent of GDP. This results from a 15.4 per cent increase in export volumes with only a 12 per cent increase in imports, reflecting high import substitution effects. Out of this substantial improvement in Australia' s international competitiveness, pioneered by this government, the economy would be able to enjoy much longer and stronger growth funs in each business cycle. Australia's trading performance also needs to be complemented by an activist strategy for national savings. When a small open economy with relatively low savings grows faster than its trading partners, there is inevitably an adverse impact on the current account and foreign debt. Inadequate national savings are the source of the key pressure points in Australia's political economy, that is, corporate asset sales, inflationary expectations and the ECUR As a nation we must overcome the persistent imbalance between savings ari.d investment. Australia's underlying current account deficit has been estimated at 4.5, per cent of GDP. Net service payments on foreign liabilities have risen to four per cent of national output. Our exposure to these liabilities and growing foreign debt cannot be reduced without bringing the current account deficit below three per cent. The current account deficit mirrors the capital account on the balance of payments, that is, the extent to, which Australof is calls on the savings of 'overseas nations to , cover the gap between our own level of investment and savings. The appropriate fiscal discipline is to run the federal budget at a structural surplus, that is, discounting the impact of one-off factors such as asset sales and swings in the business cycle. Less consumption spending by either the public or the private sector for a given level of income always means more savingsit always means more national savings, a lesson the opposition should appreciate in the run-up to the next election. The quality of the fiscal strategy is also all important. Care needs to be taken with proposals for tax increases, spending cuts, compulsory levies and special tax breaks, which simply provoke a compensatory transfer between public and private forms of - saving. Given the scale of the savings task in Australia, the structure and system of incentives for private savings should not be left unaltered. As a nation, Australia has not been known for a culture of long-term planning and personal thrift. For many decades the lucky country ethos promoted attitudes to wealth creation heavily reliant on commodity and property development, including a high premium on home ownership, known as the great Australian dream. Elements of a hedonistic lifestyle promoted the virtues of spending' now and worrying'later, best reflected in our approach, , known in the national language as the 'she'll be right' approach- , "" These cultural features; which remain sq-ong in Australia, enhance ,the importance ,of ,a prescriptive approach to private savings such as compulsory and self-provident measures. The superannuation reforms announced in the 1995-96 budget represent a sea. change in the nation.'s .lQng-term savings capacity. I believe that ,150r20 years from now, and perhaps I will still be ;here, P!lrliamentarians on both sides of the House ,will be making speeches about the landmark reform of superannuation and national savings introduced in this year's budget. '"" It is also worthwhile in this budget' debate to compare the savings strategy proposed by the opposition to that of the government. In truth, the opposition is advocating in its poliey p<l;rameters 'a 'strategy of dissaving, adding to the national savings pool but taking away from it It is playing the two-card trick of Australian politics-orily showing one'card at a time, 'however. The one card it shows on national savings is to express a poli,<y, a desire, general pararp.eters,to increase national savings, which as a: 'proportion, of GOP can qnlybe achieved by lowering the< share of national consumption. For instance, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the shadow, Treasurer, was 'at it !lgain .in his budget reply speech at the NatioilalPress, Club on '17 May. He endorsed FitzGerald's goal of a five per cent of GDP increase in national savings. He said that was the objective the coalition in government would pursue: It needs to be' appreciated by the House-perhaps it was not appreciated by ""I."", the member for Higgins-that a five per cent of GDP improvement in national savings is the dollar equivalent of a $22.5 billion shift from national consumption to national savings. That is the policy, that is the goal, that has been endorsed by the shaqow Treasurer. The second card he plays in his two-card trick on the Australian public is to try to present inoffensive policies, never showing the two cards together. So one card' says that the coalition wants a·$22.5 billion dollar shift from national consumption to national savings- The, other card tries to present inoffensive policies and increase coqsumption and lower national, savings. For instance, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has .already declared that on these budge,t measQres the - oali'tion will oppose, iri the Senate the increases in company tax, the increase in the, Medicare l-vy, the sales tax on cars, plus the PAYErernittance arrangements, and the application. of sales tax to some building materials,. That,is, the coalition in the Senate-because"" of its obstruction and the policies it has decla,red-:-will be endorsing measures which could increase, consumpti9n and lower national savings by $1.4 billion. ' The second aspect - f the coalition's policy framework to Increase consumption and lower national savings, of course, coinefftom the not new policy commitments tqe opposition, has presented in this"" term of parliament. The shadow minister for social security has' endorsed the introduction of' a universal pension at a cost of $3 billion. The coalition has also endorsed tax conces,sions for priyate health insurance at a cost of $1 bl1Iion- It has also endbrs-d the removal of the tax from 'interest earnings' on bank savings at ,a' fiscalcosJ of$3 bIllion. The Leader of the Opgosition, with his lifelong commitment to income splitting under the banner of tax, relief for families, has re-endorsed that comqJ.itment at a budgetcost of $3 'billion. Finally,'the shadow Treasurer has cons-tently'outlineda com-itment for taX relief on theFBT and the capital gains tax at a cost of $1 billIon .. The aggregated cost' of those new commitments in this term of parliament, comes to $11 billion. The coalition on one hand, with one card, is saying that it wants to increase national savings and lower national consumption by $22.5 billion but is actually moving, according to these policies, $12.4 billion in the wrong direction; it is moving $12.4 billion in exactly the wrong direction to that which a savings strategy would dictate-the $12.4 billion being made up by the $1.4 billion obstruction in the Senate and the $11 billion in new promises. This adds up, quite remarkably, to a $35 billion hole, an inconsistency, in the savings and budgetary strategy of the opposition outlined thus far in this term of parliament. It gets worse. When it comes to national savings accumulated by superannuation, the coalition is again moving in the wrong direction trying to run down national savings and increase consumption. The member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), in one of his last speeches as a member of parliament, reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 26 May, actually outlined a policy for the opposition whereby superannuation savings could be used for buying a house or paying for children's education. The Sydney Morning Herald reported: In a speech to the Life Insurance Federation of Australia yesterday, the Opposition Spokesman on retirement incomes policy, Mr David Connolly, gave a strong indication that the Opposition would continue its plan as a central part of its superannuamarginal tion strategy. ""The need to redefine superannuation in the context of the proposed 3 per cent compulsory superannuation is particularly relevant to young contributors,"" Mr Connolly said. He further indicated that the coalition would allow superannuation savings to be used for consumption purposes such as buying a house or paying for education. Again, that is a direct contradiction, a direct inconsistency with the commitment that the coalition has given to increase national savings. If that is not bad enough in terms of inconsistency, in terms of running down this government's medium-term savings strategy, as we heard in question time yesterday from the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the Leader of the Opposition has announced a policy to freeze the superannuation guarantee at existing levels; The Leader of the Opposition announced this policy in his budget reply speech in our last parliamentary sitting week. As the Treasurer outlined yesterday, the estimated effect on total savings would be very significant. As a result of the coalition's policy to freeze the level of the superannuation guarantee, by the year 2000 about $17 billion of national savings, measured in today's dollars, would be lost; by the year 2003, that would be about $45 billion. This is a gaping hole, a gaping contradiction in the sorts of policies that the coalition is presenting. It is trying to play the two-card trick, trying to play the Australian people with the two-card trickery of Australian politics. In truth, the advantage that the government now has-and I hope it is also taken up by the press gallery-is to expose the inconsistency. One thing that the budget has done is to clear the decks on the policy debate. The Australian people know where this government stands in terms of its medium-term savings strategy; and we can now dissect and work out through these fiscal equations where the opposition stands on its policy parameters. Really, the only policy it has presented that could have a marginal impact on national savings is the discredited practice of lowering the tax on bank savings at a fiscal cost of $3 billion with perhaps-it is only a perhaps-a gain on private savings. I am willing to assume, being quite good hearted, for the purposes of this exercise that the increase in private bank savings from the coalition's proposed tax change is cancelled out by the member for Bradfield's proposed superannuation reforms and the measures announced by the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply speech. These policies would increase national consumption and I am willing to calculate, for the purposes of this exercise, that they cancel out any positive impact from increased private savings as a result of tax reform on bank savings. This still leaves a $35 billion gap between the savings goal outlined by the shadow Treasurer at the Press Club, a five per cent GDP increase in national savings, and their declared policies, as I have just outlined them to the House. This is the same opposition that wants to lecture the government about the current account deficit, the same opposition that wants to lecture the government about foreign debt. The government's response is to expose the inconsistency and to expose the large gap, the $35 billion gap, in the opposition's policiesthe difference between the savings goal and the expenditure commitments it has made thus far. It is interesting to examine the means by which the opposition could fill this gap. The shadow Treasurer was at it on the Sunday program on 7 May. He said: We are not proposing any broadening of the tax base and we will not be proposing new taxes. He ruled out tax reform as a method for increasing public saving and decreasing private consumption. That leaves him only fiscal policy on the outlays side of the budget. He went on: You're talking about two aspects, of course Laurie. One is, getting value for money, taxpayers' value for money which we've been consistently arguing for over a long period of time. The second is, as we've always said in relation to asset sales, that asset sales ought to take place where they deliver increased and better commercial benefits to consumers. Now we don't rule that out. That has never been a problem for the coalition ... It is another string to the bow which we have available to us. Just 10 days later, he was telling the Press Club: . Asset sales do nothing to boost national savings. They are simply a transfer of ownership from the public to the private sector and, of course, a transfer of savings from the private sector to the public sector. In terms of the policy instruments the shadow Treasurer would use to fill the $35 billion gap, he has nothing to offer national savings through asset sales. Anyone on the coalition benches who thinks the privatisation of Telecom, which would perhaps realise $15 billion to $20 billion, once off, in a federal budget, adds to national savings, is wrong. People should appreciate that and understand that it has already been acknowledged as such by the shadow Treasurer. Once we apply a process of deduction, it brings the coalition to the point of filling the $35 billion gap in one of two ways. The first is to cut outlays. Thirty-five billion dollars represents 28 per cent of federal outlays. It is twice the amount of Commonwealth outlays on health, more than three times the amount of Commonwealth outlays on education and more than three times the Australian defence budget. These are remarkable figures. There is no way in the world the coalition could cut $35 billion from the Commonwealth budget without eating into health, education or defence spending-in fact, wiping them out. Coalition members might greet these calculations with a little mirth. They should, because they demonstrate the full extent of the inconsistency and how absurd it is, with the outlays commitments on one hand, to promise any increase in national savings which would address the current account deficit or the foreign debt problem in Australia. The second mechanism which could be used by the coalition, and this is perhaps the most interesting, is to introduce a new, large, broad based tax such as the GST. It is no wonder that, when the Leader of the Opposition lies awake at night doing his sums, trying to increase national savings and what he would do on the federal budget-it is no wonder when he has those thoughts before he slumbers away for the evening-he comes forward with statements such as that reported in the Australian on 2 May: The Leader of the federal Opposition, Mr Howard, has left open the possibility of the Coalition reconsidering a goods and services tax ""some time in the future"" ""As to what happens some years in the future, I don't want to ... I don't know,"" Mr Howard said. That is the sign of a confused leader trying to reconcile in his own mind the gaping inconsistency in the policy parameters being promoted by the coalition. The truth is that the budget has confirmed the choices available to the Australian people for the next election. The government, with quality policies, is not afraid to put them forward. The opposition is running away from the sort of detail needed to fill its $35 billion fiscal gap.The government, of course, has an outstanding savings strategy. The 1995-96 budget features all the elements of this government's approach to continuous economic reform. Its superannuation reforms and national savings strategy are among the most important policy developments in Australia's recent economic history. The budget and each of its provisions deserve the strong support of the House.",24
14,Mr COBB,ASSENT TO BILLS,"On 9 May this year the government brought down what has become known as the fudge-it budget and, in doing so, destroyed any remaining credibility that it had with the Australian electorate. The smoke and mirrors were billowing and flashing overtime as the government broke virtually every major economic promise of consequence. It fudged and distorted figures to a degree not seen before. It told a whole stack of untruths to the Australian electorate. It destroyed the reputation of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) for honesty, which I thought was sad. It saddled the Australian taxpayers with a stack of tax increases; the like of which we have hardly seen since the days of Whitlam and Cairns. It is not surprising that the public is awake to this. The government has already slumped in the polls. The ratings of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have fallen even more. In short the government, and especially its arrogant Prime Minister, has long surpassed its use-by date. The sooner it goes the better. I would like to start by looking at some of the tax increases. Company tax, despite a faithful promise by the Prime Minister before the election that there would be no tax increases, has gone up from 33c to 36c in the dollar. Before the last election, the government had reduced company tax. This was a centrepiece of its business policy of which it made great play. Now the election is over, whack, up goes the tax again in a very cynical move. In doing so, it has plucked $3,970 million out of the business community, including the small business community, over the next four years. This is at a time when they desperately need that money to re-invest in their businesses and create employment. The Medicare levy too, despite there being a faithful promise from the Prime Minister that there would be no tax increases, has gone up from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent. That will collect an extra $1,010 million over the next four years. This will probably mean that more people will drop out of private health insurance; a problem which this government is doing nothing to address. On sales tax, the government now not only has sales tax indexed up every six months in this country but also has introduced a 12 per cent sales tax on certain building materials that did not attract it before. This is virtually its GST on the building industry. That sales tax will pull in $1,015 million over the next four years. This tax will be applied to screws, nails, paint, putty, adhesives, wallpaper, tiles, taps, nozzles, handles, and joinery such as prefabricated kitchen cupboards and office partitioning. It is interesting to note that, with the abolition of the diesel fuel rebate scheme for miners who mine clay for bricks or sand for concrete, even bricks and mortar will be taxed. This will add in excess of $1,000 to the cost of an average house. The other day I walked into a hardware shop that sells a lot of paint. I worked out that, on the wholesale price alone, it would cost in excess of $1,000 to paint a house. So $120 is added to the cost of a paint job on a house, and this will have a significant effect. Probably the bobby-dazzler of all the tax increases is the tax on cars. It is a bit like the company tax increase. Before the election, the government reduced the sales tax on cars from 20 per cent to 15 per cent to match the tax we were going to put on cars. The Prime Minister made great play of that, and I will come to that in a minute. The 15 per cent has since gone to 16 per cent and, as a result of this budget, the 16 per cent is going to go to 21 per cent. That will add about $1,000 to the price of the average Commodore or Falcon. From 1 July this year, it will again go up by about $190 as the sales tax increases from 21 per cent to 22 per cent. There are various estimates floating around, but that could mean a decrease in the sales of new cars in Australia in the coming year-a loss of about 30,000 sales. Over the next four years this tax will pluck $1,470 million out of the car industry which will go into Treasury coffers. I tum at this stage on a matter of credibility to the Prime Minister's first speech which he made on that fateful day-19 December 1991-when he became Prime Minister. I went and listened to what he had to say to the press assembled there that day. He said: Could I, in my first words as Prime Minister elect, Leader of the Labor Party elect, to you, the Australian people, say that I want to make three commitments to them. The first is I pledge to give everything I've got to the job and the country. Mr Truss-The part-time PM!",29
15,Mr COBB,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The part-time PM; he does not even tum up to question time. In his third commitment-I will come back to the second in a minute-he stated: The third commitment is I pledge to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all of the energy I can muster. But I want to dwell on the second commitment. He said: The second is to deal honestly with the people, to tell them the truth. In tough times, of course, the temptation is always to gild the lily. I'll be resisting the temptation as much as is humanly possible. I'll speak honestly with them, to them, and realistically, and 1'11 listen accordingly. That is the commitment the Prime Minister made at his press conference just after he stabbed Bob Hawke in the back. About a minute later in that statement to the press in December 1991, he said: Over the holiday periodreferring to ChristmasI will spend time talking to my colleagues and working on proposals I want to put before the Cabinet in the early new year. I would like to start 1992 with a cohesive and comprehensive plan to push Australia ahead. I've got a good idea already of what should be in that plan, what should be done, but I want to tie it all together and make sure that we have it right. That was in December. In February the Prime Minister delivered the One Nation statement-his first statement of consequence to the parliament. On 26 February 1992 his opening sentence was: Mr Speaker, when I became Prime Minister a little over two mGnths ago I pledged to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy I could muster. He has rehashed two out of the three promises. It is interesting to note which promise he dropped-being honest with the Australian people, telling the truth and not gilding the lily. On the second page of the One Nation statement he says: Labor's plan for the next four years will create over 800 000 jobs, without. increasing the current account deficitthe Labor Party has certainly breached that promiseand at the same time return the budget to surplus. I will return to that promise later. The Prime Minister made various other promises such as the one about binding Australia and New Zealand together in aviation 'in a truly competitive environment'. But the promise that particularly interests me is on page 10 of this report. Under the heading 'MOTOR VEHICLES', the Prime Minister states: Mr Speaker, the recession has had a severe effect on motor vehicle sales. From tomorrow the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be permanently lowered to 15 per cent-a saving on a new Commodore or Falcon of around $800. With cheaper cars we will drive newer cars, which is good for the environment, good for road safety, and good for one of our most important industries. So there we have it. The Prime Minister said he would tell Australians the truth and nothing but the truth, he would not gild the lily and he would permanently drop sales tax on motor vehicles from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. But what did he do after the election? Whack! The tax went back up again to 21 per cent. Presumably, if we accept the Prime Minister's logic in the One Nation statement, this will mean dearer cars and we will be driving older cars, which is bad for the environment, bad for road safety and bad for one of our most important industries. After that, we can only say: what is the Prime Minister's word worth? The conclusion, I suggest, is fairly obvious. I said this is also a fudge-it budget. I say that because the government has said it will bring in a surplus of $718 million even though it has increased spending in this budget. Spending has not been cut. If we look at the various'last pages of Budget Paper No. 1, a very thick document, we see the underlying rate of deficit is $8.232 billion. The government has been able to say it will deliver a surplus only if it brings in a lot of assets sales. It, has promised to sell $5.3 billion worth of assets in the first year. Over the 'last five years this government has promised-there is that, word again: 'promised' - to sell $8 billion worth of assets. What has it delivered over five years? It has sold less than halfof that-$3.8 billion. That is in five ye--s, and the government is asking us to helieve that it will sell $5.3 billion in one year. We will wait and see. ""Thy gov-rriment is selling Qantas for the fourth time, It is already running into problems with the sale of ANL. The unions are sqm';allng 'about that. In one of the best fudgeits of 'all, it has written down the price it hopes'to receive for selling off the Dasfleet, but it, has· not. taken into account the money that it will have to shell out in leasing it back. What an extraordinary error in a budget paper."" When it comes to the Commonwealth Bank, we have the daddy of them all. The government s,aid thaLlt would never sell off that panko Tlia- was back when the government owned,lOO per-,cent of it. That bank was to be the, Holy 9railqf the ALP, but it sold off 30 per cent in the first tranche. Then, despite promises, it sold off another 20 per cent. We have been left with,50.1 per cent. When the goverpment s,dld off that last 20 per cent, the then Minister for Finance, the present Treasurer, said in a letter dated 14 September 1993 which was put in the prospectus to shareholders who' were buying that last 20 per cent: Thjswill redl\ce its-, the government'ssl:l-n;h6Iding i-ihe'Bai:lkto not less than 50.1 cent. The Government has no intentions whatever of further reducing its shateholding. The .Government' is proud of the Commonwealth Bank's record aM looks forward to the Commonwealth' of A.ustralia continuing as the Bank's majority shareholder in future. In these circumstances,. the obligatiQnsand liabilities qf the Bank will continul! to be guaranteed by the Commonwealth of Australia:. ., There it is, signed at the bottom by Ralph Willis-a person whom we all have some high regard for in this place. The prospectus that letter was included in said: The Government has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information in the prospectus is accurate and is not misleading. In doing so, the Government has had regard to the prospectus requirements of the corporations law. It went on further, in an additional information section, to say: The Government has no intention whatever of further reducing the Commonwealth of Australia's shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank below 50.1 per cent. The prospectus noted that the law-I suppose that is l-a-w, law-was being changed to require the government to retain at least 50.1 per cent of the voting power in the Commonwealth Bank. The prospectus went on to say: Further, neither the Commonwealth nor the Commonwealth Bank will be allowed to do anything to cause or contribute to the Commonwealth no longer holding or controlling the Commonwealth Bank shares carrying the right to exercise at It';ast 50.1 per cent of the total voting rights in the Commonwealth Bank. Then the prospectus declared that the articles of association required directors not to register a transfer of shares 'which would contravene the 50.1 per cent restriction'. The prospectus was signed off by who else-Ralph Willis 'for and on behalf of the Commonwealth'. That was then. A month later Ralph Willis was on the Nine Network's Sunday program. He said: We've made it quite clear in the legislation that went through the Parliament to authorise this sale, that we would not go below the 50- 1 per cent. He was asked whether, unlike the last time the government had made a similar commitment when John Kerin was Treasurer-he had a also put it in similar prospectus letter-this per could be modified or changed in any way and whether he could give an ironclad commitment that there would be no further change. He replied, 'Absolutely, yes.' There you have it. Ido not know what more ironclad guarantee we could have got from the government. Mr Nugent-It is like the l-a-w tax cuts.",30
16,Mr COBB,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Exactly. The government has now backed off frorn this commitment. The Treasurer is regarded by both of sides of this chamber as an honourable man. How could he . possibly get into such a position? I believe it was put to the cabinet only 90 minutes before the budget was delivered. I suggest to the House that the only reason such an honourable man could have got into such a position is that he now associates with the Prime Minister. The Treasurer has broken his solemn promises, he has broken his word repeatedly and he has gone a long way to destroying his whole credibility by handling truth in such a manner. We all know he wants to be Treasurer-a very noble aspiration. But I ask him: if he has to sink to such depths as this, is it worth it? If he is forced to prostitute his principles in this way, at the end of the day, is it worth it? Perhaps he thinks it is, but for a man of such integrity it must weigh very heavily upon him. As has been said in this place, if it were a private individual who had breached the Trade Practices Act and the Australian Securities Commission in such a way by putting out such a misleading prospectus, he would be hauled before the courts and would be facing a possible gaol sentence. I do not think the Treasurer in any way whatsoever should be put in gaol, but these are the sorts of questions people are asking today. The other thing the budget neglects is that there is ne'er a word on the current account deficit. Last year the government predicted that the current account deficit would be $18 billion, and it has come in at $27 billion. is 50 per cent over the prediction. This year it is predicting $27 billion. The mind boggles as to what it might come down at. Nine out of the last 10 months we have had it at over $2 billion. Public debt interest has risen alarmingly to $9.4 billion. That is in excess of 10 times more than we spend federally on roads. We had the greatest untruth teller of them all in the history of the Australian parliamentary system-Paul Keating-telling us about the tax cuts that we were supposed to get. I will go back to the One Nation statement and quote from what was said. The man who was going to tell the Australian people the truth, Paul Keating, said: ... the Government will lower the tax rates over the next four years. That was said in 1992. He continued: When these tax reforms are complete more than three-quarters of Australian taxpayers will pay no more than 30 per cent on their last dollar of income. A 30 per cent tax rate under LaborThat is what he trumpeted, and we know what has happened to that. The One Nation document went on to show in considerable detail how we could earn up to $50,000 and pay no more than a marginal rate of 40c in the dollar. All that has gone by the board. So much. for that promise. When he was asked whether he could ever back off from that promise, the ·Prime Minister became indignant, put down the questioner and said, 'It is legislated. It is law: l-a-w, law.' And that was the end of the matter. That has now been shafted. The bulk of those tax cuts were deferred to 1998,and now they have been bypassed. The Prime Minister is trying to pretend that they have been transferred across to superannuation contributions. There is no linkage whatsoever in that, and that is another fraudulent argument. (Time expired) .",31
17,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ASSENT TO BILLS,"No doubt the previous contributor, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), might have got in more of what he wanted to say if he had spent less time criticising peoThat ple-he nearly got himself into a position where he might have had to use a substantive motion to criticise them-and more time concentrating on the merits, or, as he saw it, the demerits, of the budget. I was starting. to think he had run out of sense and was just getting full steam into spleen. There are a number of views around about the budget. Mr Truss-You hurt him, Michael.",32
18,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ASSENT TO BILLS,"We do not want to hear from the empty vessel on the other side who was busy· interjecting and encouraging the types of activities used by his colleague the member for Parkes. The member fpr Parkes used the explanation that sometimes these midnight horrors attack him because he drank too much 2-4-5-T when he was young. Yesterday we had the member for Capis ricornia (Ms Henzell) addressing the House on the budget. She described the budget 'bold, bright and beautiful'. I think there not a better way to describe these sets of figures and the principles behind them. As in each successive Labor budget, the focus is on equity and social justice, and budget has achieved that and more. We have brought in a surplus of $718 million. Memmore bers of the opposition are spending all their time and effort trying to cut that down by saying, 'It is not really that. It is this and something else.' A lot of that is unhappiness from their side because they will never into a position where they will be able to bring down a budget of any kind, let alone one with a surplus. The problem that the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and opposition It members have is that we have once again raised the bar they have to jump over just little higher. It was interesting to hear sponse of the Leader of thy Opposition. I have been in this House for a number of about your budget. years, and I have heard budget responses from Labor opposition leaders and from numerous coalition leaders. I think we reached the high point of parliamentary farce when the opposibench. tion spokesperson got up this year because, between this. budget and the last budget, had poor old Alexander who never had chance to even say anything about a budget. For the first time since I have been here, have had an opposition leader who did not even survive from one budget to the next. The opposition's budget response last year was made by a member who is no longer with you, us-Dr HEWSON - and this year it was made by the member for Bennelong. Poor old Alexander never even got to tell us what he was going to do. But I have read in the paper that Alexander does not think that all is lost",32
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The honourable member will refer to other members by their proper titles. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-If you could remember what his electorate was, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have said it then too. He so insignificant that neither you nor I can remember what his electorate is called, let as alone say something nice about him. I take is your admonition, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will not refer to him any more, except to say that I read in the paper recently that he thinks he might get a chance to comment on a budget this as a leader of a political party again. We think that is a pretty good idea because the leaders the Liberal Party recycles the more the public will come to understand that this is not just a party that is bereft of poliit is cies; it is a party that is bereft of talent.",33
20,Mr KERR,ASSENT TO BILLS,Do you think his comeback will be put be before or after Brendan Nelson?,33
21,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ASSENT TO BILLS,"The minister's comment is one that probably weighs on their thoughts as well. We can see members of the front-bench moving through various positions. is like round and round the kitchen table. The opposition rounds up the same old a suspects after each leadership challenge and it reshuffles the pack, but it still has not found the budget rean ace in the pack. Mr Nugent-I thought we were here to talk Mr LEO MCLEA Y-The problem of the poor old member who has just interjected was that he did a good job on the opposition front He was a man of principle. Of course, the opposition could not have that. It has time we servers like the honourable member for Wide a Bay (Mr Truss), who goes along with the National Party line and gets on the front we bench. The opposition said to the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), a person of principle who actually put a fair bit of effort into his shadow portfolio duties, 'Bad luck for sport; you get the flick.' That is typical of the attitude of those opposite to most of these issues: they carp; they make personal attacks; they are doing away with people who have any ability; and they are rounding up the same old suspects that the opposition has had sitting here on the front bench year in, year out. The budget has shown that the government is able to rejuvenate itself. After many years in office, the government has come up with what the member for Capricornia described as bold, bright and beautiful policies. The opposition and its colleagues in Victoria, Western Australia and until recently the failed Fahey government in New South Wales would like to be able to emulate the figures in this budget themselves. We said that we would rein in the deficit, and we delivered. In the Leader of the Opposition's response to the budget, he said very little. One normally comes in and listens to what the opposition leader has to say in reply to the budget. One would have thought that, particularly in a year where some time between now and the next budget we can expect an election, that would be the time when the Leader of the Opposition would have outlined where he thought the opposition might wish to take the country. Instead what we got was the same as we have goi from opposition spokespeople today: carping, negative views and just knocking, knocking, knocking. I hope the member for Aston will have something positive to say. In the past he has not normally behaved in that negative fashion displayed by other members of the opposition. I just hope that he has not caught this disease that is running rife on the other side of the House of looking for the bad things and neyer being able to see the good things.",33
22,Mr KERR,ASSENT TO BILLS,"That is why he is on the back bench. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-As the minister said, he is probably on the back bench because he does see some good things around. That does not fit with the negative view that you need to have in order to succeed in the opposition today. What the opposition has to understand is that, until it can actually see that there. are some good things out there and until it stops talking Australia down, the people will never give it the chance to run the country. All we get from the opposition is carping over the so-called extra taxes that it reckons the government has imposed. Members of the opposition say, 'Isn't it terrible that people have lost their tax cuts? The government has taken away their tax cuts.' Those opposite can carryon like that as much as they like. Contrary to their cynical perception about the stupidity and gullibility of the. public, our constituents have enough common sense to see that those tax cuts would be better spent and better used if they were converted into national savings. The hypocrisy of the opposition is demonstrated by the fact that all we have heard in the past has been how terrible it was that we did not have a pool of national savings; and now that the government has developed a very large pool of national savings, all we hear from the opposition is that the benefit . should have been given as tax cuts. Those opposite do not remember what they said in the past and their problem is that we remember what they said in the past. The people of Australia kno- that the government, through the provision of superannuation, has ensured that they can expect a retirement income nearly twice that provided by the current age pension. In facilitating access to better self-provision of retirement incomes and superannuation, the government has enabled future governments to sustain and improve age pension benefits for the most disadvantaged people in our community. In the south-west region of Sydney, which is the area I represent, we have a very large number of people over the age of 65. In fact, some statistics suggest that we have the highest concentration of pensioners of apy electorate in the metropolitan area of Sydney. Figures also show that the number of people aged 65 will increase by 23 per cent by the year 2001. The Canterbury and St George districts have a very high· concentration> of people who rely on the government services that are provided for in this budget; services such as the health programs and the social security system.· Those people will benefit from the provision in future of superannuation payments. . People who are at present over 65 will also benefit· considerably. from the government's decision to support and improve Medicare. While the opposition runs· attmnd and says that by increasing the Medicare· levy the government has increased taxes, the people of my electorate are convinced about the benefits of Medicare and would rather see this marginal increase in the Medicare levy to ensure that Medicare remains a viable proposition. The increase in the levy to 1.5 per cent will ensure that it makes a greater contribution to the cost of government health programs. Honourable members should remember that in 1988 the receipts from the levy accounted for 30 per cent of the Medicare outlays. Last year, the receipts from the levy only accounted for 25 per cent of Medicare outlays. Even with an increase in the levy of 0.1 per cent it will still only account for 27 per cent of the Medicare outlays. The government has taken the middle line of increasing the levy by a small amount to ensure that Medicare stays a viable proposition. My constituents know that they are getting value for money in relation to Medicare. They are even more pleased with the health system in our district since the New South Wales Labor government was elected. It pledged to keep Canterbury Hospital open and to expand it so that it becomes a better health care system for people of the Canterbury and St George districts of Sydney. Some of the major expenditure on health in this year's budget focuses on preventive health care. Some $18 million has been allocated to the health Australia program to reduce tobacco use, especially among young people. I could not think of a more principled thing for the government to do than announce, which the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) did yesterday, that the government will be discouraging cigarette companies from being associated with the Olympics. It has always seemed to me to be ridiculous that cigarette companies try to attach themselves as sponsors for the Olympics when it is to be a celebration of health excellence. To have the Olympics sponsored by companies that produce something that kills you and is very unhealthy strikes me as silly. The government is going to spend $18 million in an attempt to wean young people off smoking. The health budget also includes a provision for $42 million to be spent over the next four years to continue the national cervical cancer screening program with particular emphasis on increasing participation. Just as that program is important for women, so is the provision to spend $25 million over the next two years on a program to encourage more children to be immunised. These types of education programs are extremely important in an electorate like mine where there are a large number of new migrants who, due often to the lack of these services in their country of origin, do not know of the importance of immunisation and cervical cancer screening. These two programs will very remarkably improve the healthiness of the people of my electorate. Perhaps one of the best things about this budget for the people of my electorate, both for their health and for their transportation problems, is the fact that extra money has been provided for the construction of Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. The $726 million of funding is something that both the member for Grayndler (Ms MCHugh), who is at the table, and I are very pleased to see. Quite frankly, for far too long the people of inner Sydney have paid the price that commuters who do not live anywhere near them do not pay-that is, the noise. The construction of Sydney West airport will be of great benefit to them. Provisions have been made in the budget to extend the runway at Sydney West to ensure international aircraft can fully utilise the facility. I say again: Qantas must be told that it has to use that airport. James Strong and his cohorts at Qantas cannot get away with saying that they wish to continue to use only Sydney airport. To have Australia's national airline try to desert the people of western Sydney is a disgrace. The people at Qantas have to realise that Sydney West is there for both them and others. If they think they are going to be put in a position where they can say that Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport is going to become Sydney (Qantas) Airport, and that the commuters and everybody else ought to move out, they have another think coming. With Sydney airport already reaching capacity limits during peak periods of the day, and with extra demand expected for the Olympics, it is extremely important that the construction of the second airport be carried out quickly. The funding in the budget is a bonus for the people of my electorate. My constituents will also benefit as a result of the improved transport infrastructure, both road and rail, which will be put in with the new Sydney West airport. The road and rail links are designed to improve connections between both the airports and those people in the intermediary areas. The road links are important for us because they will remove many of the semitrailers from our local and arterial roads, which will free up the maze of links on which locals are fighting with semitrailers at present. Unlike most residential areas, people in my electorate in the main want the M5 completed. Due to the inept planning of the former New South Wales Liberal government, which could not get it done let alone plan it right, heavy through traffic has been dumped in Beverly Hills, a suburb of my electorate, right in the midst of a residential area. It is ridiculous that this freeway stops at a set of lights. There is no extension to it because the state Liberals never got around to finishing the job. They botched it up so badly that sections of the M5 which are now open go from two lanes to one, and we have already seen bad accidents there. When the state government builds this link, it would be far preferable to continue the tunnelling right up to Beverly Hills and not have the road above ground. I would hope that the state government would consider that option, which was an option that I put forward to the M5 inquiry last year. The federal government will be working very closely with the New South Wales government to ensure that these road and rail links are in place as soon as possible. An amount of $260 million has been provided in the budget for the road links and there has been money provided in other parts of the budget last year for the rail links. The rail link between the two airports will see the East Hills line upgraded and extended. That will be a significant bonus for the people of the Watson electorate. I think the location of my electorate halfway between Kingsford Smith and Sydney West will provide a number of business opportunities for people in the industrial area of my electorate. The Kingsgrove industrial estate, for instance, could become an important hub for freight utilising its central location between the two airports and on the way to the Botany Bay port. I think the member for Capricornia got the summation of the budget right when she described it as being 'bold, bright and beautiful'. I hope the opposition can see that, if it is going to get a chance to govern this country, it has to start being positive about a few things. The government believes that the framework in this budget is certainly something with which we can confidently go to the people between now and the next budget. We have been able to deliver the goods over the years, and this budget shows that we are still able to do that. I commend the bill to the House. I thank the House.",34
23,Mr NUGENT,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I preface my comments by responding to a few of the points that the previous gentleman, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), raised. To assist the memory of the honourable member for Watson as to other members' seats, my seat is the seat of Aston and it is named after a lady called Tilly Aston, who was a blind lady. She died quite a long time ago at a good age. She was the first blind Australian woman, nearly 100 years ago, to go to university and she founded the braille library of Victoria. She certainly contributed to her community. I hope that little story, which is true, will always spring to mind when he sees me so that he does not have any further difficulties remembering the name of my seat. It is very generous of the gentleman to give me some personal plaudits in his comments, but I fear I am going to disappoint him by some of the things I am going to say. He refers specifically to the coalition carping about the budget and so on. I probably have a different perspective. I believe that 'telling the truth about some of the matters in the budget' is a more accurate description. I think that is a fundamental principle, that it is important for any opposition to spell out what a government may do. I notice that the honourable gentleman spent about 25 per cent of his time talking about our leadership problems and who our Treasurers were and so on, rather than actually dealing with his own government's budget. I am sure that was because he was going to find it difficult to fill his allocated time with positive things to say. I have to say to the honourable gentleman also that he had some positive things to say about measures in the budget which I would also agree with. I would make it clear up front, for example, that any measures in relation to tobacco and discouraging people from smoking are to be commended. Today happens to be 31 May, International No Tobacco Day, no smoking day. It is, therefore, very appropriate that this topic be brought up in this chamber on 31 May, as International No Tobacco Day. As one who gave up smoking at five to eight on Friday, 14 April 1978-you can tell that I do not miss it, but I will not go back to it-I have to say I am one of those awful people who, having become a convert, are prepared to speak quite publicly on the subject about measures to stop young people taking up smoking. Clearly, when we talk about immunisation programs or cancer screening programs and so on, they are measures to be commended. Nobody on this side of the House has condemned or criticised those measures. We have been public in our acknowledgment of those issues. But, as the honourable gentleman will know, the vast numbers who we can 'see' lined up in the press gallery at present never publish the constructive things that are said in here. They only ever give us coverage of the negative things. I would also like to make a couple of other points. When it is said that people would rather have the tax cuts-the l-a-w tax cuts which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised before the last election-than superannuation, that they recognise the need to do away with them and so on and so forth and would the coalition continue to have those tax cuts, when we criticise what you have done, we are talking about the fact that you have broken your word to the Australian people. We are not talking about whether it is a good thing to have a superannuation scheme; we are saying that you went to an election making promises. When we challenged you about the promise, the Prime Minister stood up and said to the people of this nation that the tax cuts were legislated, that they were l-a-w, that they were in law. He made an absolute definite promise. In the same way, the Minster for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), a lady who has come into this place recently and with a high reputation, said previously that there would be no increase in the Medicare levy. It may be perfectly appropriate to increase the Medicare levy but, having said publicly within the last few months that there would be no change, and then to make that change, we are criticising the absence of telling the truth on the part of government ministers and the people who run this country. That is the message that has to get out to the community: telling the truth in public life is important. Equally, when we talk about the deficit and those on the government side say there is a surplus of $700-odd million, we point out that on page 7.3 of Budget Paper No.1 it clearly says that, apart from when we sell off capital items, assets, the farm, the real budget deficit is $8.4 billion. It is in your own budget papers. So when we talk surpluses let us be clear about what we are talking about. Whilst the newspapers and the media tend to talk in large measure about the big, eyecatching items, one of the things we often lose sight of in this place is our individual and collective responsibility as members of parliament to our communities. This is one of the problems with governments that have been there for a long time. Often, public servants-and I am not one who buckets all public servants; many of them do a fine jobwho are based in Canberra and who spend too much time in Canberra lose sight of what it is like out there in the real world. There are one or two areas I come across in my daily getting around the community, in my electorate and around the country, that get overlooked sometimes in that big picture. I quote, for example, the case of disabled children. I have a number of disabled children in my electorate who under integration programs need additional funding either directly or by having integration aides provided. The Victorian requirement for assisting disabled children for integration aides was $1.5 million. The government provided a miserable $750,000, half of the requirement. In all the billions of dollars that go into the federal budget it seems to me that that is a derisory amount. We ought to be more concerned with some of those on-the-ground programs. I was recently in Sydney with the House Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. We visited a very worthwhile institution there, a dance troupe and training group which been there for some years and which the government has announced will 'move to areas. Brisbane'. There has been no consideration the families, no consideration of the expertise that is not going to be available in Brisbanetouch. just a willy-nilly 'let us distribute it around the country'. The government is going to cut off the funding of that group in Sydney from the end of this coming month, June. We have had a lot of government rhetoric over the years about helping indigenous people and here we have a very worthwhile indigenous group that is going to be chopped off at the knees. Where is the help in the budget for people like that? Then we look at small business. I have to say that I despair of this government in terms of small business and, as I move around in my electorate, most of the 6,000 small businesses there despair. I do not think there is fundamental understanding by the government of what it takes to run your own business today's society. There really are no measures in this budget that will help the small busiforecast ness community. Yet we have somewhere between 750,000 and 800,000 small businesrhetoric ses in Australia. If there were some measures in this budget to help that sector of the community to enable them all to prosper just that little bit more and employ just person, we would effectively wipe out the queues of unemployed. But this government does not understand that. This government has, in fact, attacked small business in this budget. Then we come to other social issues. We heard the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is responsible for that abomination of administration called the Child Support Agency, stand up in this place in question time yesterday and say that, having had a very comprehensive report from a parliamentary committee on the failings of that institution, the government is now consulting to decide what its response will be. For heaven's sake, 40 per cent of the marriages in this country by the of year 2000 will end in divorce. Thousands of children are involved, hundreds of thousands of people, and yet we see no response in the budget or elsewhere from this government to has address those very real and urgent issues in the Family Court and the child support It seems to me that, in terms of issues of that touch men and women in the street, across this nation, this government is out of Many of my colleagues have talked about some of the broad issues-and I am not going to dwell on them at length. But let us just have a quick reminder of some of the main facets of this budget. What we are seeing, of course, is an increase in the government's own growth and spending. Excluding asset sales, spending for the government's own outlays grew by 1.7 per cent in real terms from $122.5 billion to $129.1 billion. There is, of course, in this budget an excessive reliance on asset sales to try to balance the budget, with sales of assets in 1995-96 estimated at $5.35 billion. It is all very well a to plan to sell off some assets to balance the books and try to get the deficit down, but of in course the government has tried this trick before. Since 1990-91, the government has the selling of some $8 billion worth of assets but has fallen well short of that because it has only managed to actually sell about $3.8 billion. I think the government has sold Qantas four times nowand you cannot keep putting the same figure one more in the books time and time again. The government, having only sold $3.8 billion worth of assets in the last five years, now expects to sell over $5 billion this year. Of course, there is already doubt over the asset sales program with the first sale on the books, ANL, having running into stiff opposition from the trade union movement-and that is really in some doubt. Dasfleet is another .of the entities that the government is going to get rid of. Unfortunately, we have seen some double accounting with Dasfleet, the business having been sold off with one hand arid the money from the sale having been brought on to the ledger but, at the same time, with the government also showing that it is getting revenue from Dasfleet's daily operation-after .having sold the business off. So let us talk about some reality, some honesty and some integrity in the accounting process. The tax increases· in this budget will increase taxation by $2.4 billion in 1995-96, rising to $7.8 billion in the tax year 1998-99. That is a huge slug on the Australian people. Individual measures include the increase in the company tax rate-'only from 33 per cent to 36 per cent', says the government. But that is actually a rise of around 11 per cent in the company tax rate. That will raise over $300 million in the current financial year. Over four years, it will raise nearly $4,000 million. So, just as many small and medium sized companies start to get back on their feet after the recession, they now will be slugged with an extra increase in their taxation. We have already heard a little bit today about the Medicare levy. As I said before, one of my concerns there is that the minister concerned made public statements about not increasing the Medicare. levy only in the last few months. But, of course, they have been spown to be untrue. Sales tax has gone up on motor vehicles. That is going to adversely impact on the motor industry in this country, which is already struggling to survive. Then we have the infamous extension of sales tax into the building materials area-a GST for the building industry is what it boils down to-at the rate of 12 per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker, how often have you and I sat in this chamber and listened to the government harangue, bucket and criticisewhatever word you like to use-this side of the House for its GST proposals? Despite the fact that they are dead and history-we lost the election and we publicly dumped themalmost every day that the Prime Minister deigns to come in here, which is not too often, he rakes up the subject of the GST. Yet here we have this government imposing 12 per cent on all of those building materials. This will affect the house building industry and those in the business of house extensions. Every handyman who pops down to the local hardware store on a Saturday to buy the bits and pieces to do little jobs around the house is going to be hit by that 12 per cent. The Master Builders Association and the Housing Industry Association have already said that the government has deliberately understated the impact on householders of this particular measure in its calculations. One could go on and talk about the problem with debt and the deficit. The low level of national savings has given us significant current account problems. The latest figure of $2.25 billion for one month, which came out just in the last couple of days, is another reminder of why action should have been taken to cut back on government spending at least a year ago, if not two years ago, rather than waiting till now to actually start doing something about it; and then only lifting taxes. In nine out of the last 10 months this country has gone another $2 billion into the red. One of the things that frighten me about the national debt, which has gone from around $10 billion or $15 billion a decade ago to nearer $200 billion today, is that the markets, the people and the journalists react in terms of market expectation. If you say, 'I am going to have a huge catastrophe,' and you do not have quite such a huge catastrophe, everybody says, 'What is the problem?' The problem is that we are still getting into debt by a huge amount month after month. The government's own budget papers say that next year we are going to have another $27 billion added. There is no attempt to actually fix the problem but only an acknowledgment that it is going to stay there. When the Treasurer (Mr Willis) went on television to try to sell his budget and he was asked about that, he said, 'In percentage terms of the gross domestic product it has gone down by half a per cent, so that is an improvement.' But it is still a huge amount of money we are borrowing from overseas. The result is that we have to spend great chunks of our money paying interest on that debtnot paying off the debt, but paying interest on that debt-to overseas interests. That is money which, if it was not going there, could be spent in this country on hospitals, roads, aged care programs and so on. Of course the coalition is going to criticise this budget, because it does not attack the fundamentals and it does not tell us honestly what the situation is. My electorate is in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It is an overwhelmingly young electorate with per capita incomes below the national average but household incomes above. That is because both husband and wife are working. The reason so many of them are working is that I have more mortgage payers than any other electorate in the country, so they are working to pay off their mortgages. I have 6,000-odd small businesses. This budget is absolutely bad news for them. There is a lot of house building going on because it is an expansion area. The 12 per cent tax on building materials is going to adversely affect so many. The amount of debt we are continuing to escalate means that we are going to continue to borrow from overseas and pressure will come back on interest rates. That affects everyone of my mortgage payers and it affects most of those small businesses. The increase in taxation and so on that the small businesses themselves have to face is going to be real bad news for all of those small businesses. Unemployment in my electorate in the 12 years since this government came to power has gone up by 657 per cent. That is what this government's policies are doing to the people of Australia, to the middle ground of Australia. The government is continuing to do the same thing because it will not get its own spending under control. The retail trade figures for April have just come out. They are running at a high 4.6 per cent. We are told, 'But that's abnormal. We've got Easter trading in there.' When we talk about the overseas trade debt, each month we are told, 'This month we've got an abnormal item. Qantas has bought an aircraft.' Next month there is some other abnormal item. For this government, there is always some abnormal excuse. The bottom line is. that we are getting deeper and deeper into debt. My time is about to expire, but I just want to say this: we are told that the government might be looking at an early election. Well, I hope so. I think it will actually be scared to go later rather than sooner, because it does not want people finding out the real ramifications of its budget over the next six or nine months. I think that is why it wants to go early. I hope it does go early because I am certainly going to continue, and my colleagues will continue, to tell the Australian people the truth.

24,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I guess we should get used to that kind of rhetoric from those opposite, but after a while negativity seems to repeat on itself and people lose all perspective. Some of those figures used by the previous speaker, the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), are quite suspect and unworthy of him. In terms of the annual budget process, which is the major opportunity for both the parliament and the community to focus on the national economy, the first thing we should always look at is the process of forecasting and the forecasts themselves. This is always problematic. In virtually every Western society, the difficulties experienced by economists, treasuries and finance departments in accurately assessing and forecasting what is going to occur not only in their own economies but also in the global economy have increased. We are seeing more and more fluctuations, higher levels of volatility and quite substantial variations from projections. Within that volatility we also see potential for the dooms ayers to exaggerate and distort. I well recall how, when the government forecast investment growth of some 15 per cent in last year's budget, that was scoffed at and mocked by those opposite as being a ludicrous figure. Almost every speaker opposite in last year's debate on the appropriation legislation referred to a lack of confidence; worse than that, I think many imputed downright fraudulence in the projection for business investment. With hindsight, the government vastly underestimated business investment. . Looking at this year's forecasts, which are important, we are seeing an attempt-and I trust the forecasters will be accurate-to flatten out the economic cycles. It does not matter how far one goes back in our economy, one can see periodic cycles of boom and bust and the difficulty that we have experienced in balancing and harmonising our capacity to produce with our capacity to consume. In the late 1980s, we had a four per cent gap between our production and our consumption. That four per cent gap, of course, was filled by imports which in turn led to· a contraction in the economy. . The gap at the moment is of the order of two per cent, and with this year's budget that gap will reduce quite substantially. It may well be that we end up with a lineball, very balanced result. It is extremely difficult for the forecasters and the economists to predict that accurately, because we are subject to an enOrmous number of variables like the Japanese economy, the American economy and the European economy. All of these economies feed through in terms not only of our suppliers but also investment. The major aspect of the budget that I think we should look at in that context is the very strong focus by the government on increasing Australian savings. Historically we have used world savings. From the first settlement by Europeans we have used overseas funds from firstly the British, then the Americans and now to some degree the Japanese and other Asian investors. We have tended not to invest in our own country and we have tended not to have a large pool of domestic savings. That is changing and I think this budget will change it even further. The effects of policy changes over previous years are now coming through. For instance, with dividend imputation we now deduct tax once rather than twice, as we used to. Under the capital gains tax, any form of income by speculation is now taxed, whereas in previous times it was not. That produced a massive bias in the investment policies and investment strategies of Australians towards investing in speculation and speculative ventures such as land rezoning and land upvaluing rather than in production. We are also seeing a continued commitment to research and development and to innovation coming through in government policies and I think it will eventually come through more and more in our trade figures. I want to mention some particular areas, but I will talk first about the changes in social policy. These again are important changes. The introduction of a maternity allowance, which will cost $643 million over four years and provide a lump sum payment of over $800 to some 80 per cent of Australian families who have a child, is an important policy. The extension of the better cities program is important. The social justice package, the global figure for which was announced in the budget but more detail of which has been received in more recent days, is also important. The change in the treatment of investments by pensioners is one of the most dramatic changes and is certainly one of the most positive ones. We have grappled with this for very many years. Part of it dates back to the Fraser government decision in the 1970s to take assets out of the pension system and to allow people to convert their income into capital growth. That change by that government was a very bad policy change. I think those opposite nowadays often admit that, whereas they were reluctant to earlier on. There is difficulty in assessing income from pensioner investments when they can invest in such a variety of instruments. The ingenuity of the investment community in devising new and cleverer ways to avoid those procedures has been quite staggering. So, each time there was a new constraint, the investment community would find a new loophole or a new way around it. Quite frankly, the victims of those devices were largely pensioners who were gulled into new devices and into new procedures to try to achieve more income. In many cases they ended up much worse off. Particularly galling were those people who advised people to invest in areas long after government announcements had precluded those areas from exclusion. The introduction of the deeming provisions in July next year for investments, in whatever form they are, will be an enormous improvement and will vastly simplify the processes. They do provide one danger and one must be warning our pensioner community that higher investments; higher returns and higher yields usually mean higher risks. There is a very real danger that some pensioners may be persuaded to invest in riskier investments on the advice of their advisers who often get a commission on those investments. I am not wishing to bag the whole investment advisory community, but some commission-led advisers advise pensioners perhaps more because they are. dictated to by their own commission rather than by pensioners' security. It is important that pensioners ipvesting in higher yielding activities be very wary and very mindful of the high risk that they run. In the past we have seen enough examples of organisations going bankrupt and destroying the savings base of very many Australian pensioners. I 'trustthe introduction of deeming provisions for pension investments will not increase the possibility of that happening. Another important aspect is changes to carers allowances. It will take a while for those changes to work their way through to the community, but over time they' will become extremely important. I now tum to a couple of aspects of the budgetary provisions. I mentioned earlier the extension of the building better cities program. I place on record my appreciation for this program as it operates in Newcastle. In Newcastle we have experienced a Commonwealth contribution of some $17 million over four years. Despite the complications of a state Liberal government quite determined to distort that program and some of the weaknesses in the legislation establishing various administrative bodies and so on, the Newcastle community is seeing benefits from those funds. I think the benefits could be greater, program more effective. I certainly encourage members throughout'the country whose ar--s may be eligible for this program to recognise its potential, to be positive about its benefits and to see the funding not 'as some por of gold that is somehow being. delivered .but rather as a vehicle for 'really constructive change. We need an attitudinal c-ange with-n the community, within governments and widiih the investment comrnunity so that our older cities and our older' communIties can' be rejuvenated and revived in acbnstructi'veand positive way. We need' to achieve, these things, and that will take a lot of 'goodwill and a lot of flexibility in attitude. I am certainly confident Newcastle is achieving some quite important changes. Although the .real results will not be seen .for perhaps another four or five years after the program is finished, the attitudinal changes are extremely important. Appropriations in the budget also. provide $152 million this year for the minehunter acquisition program. This program relates ,to the project by Australian Defence Industries based in' Newcastle for the provision of minehunters to the Australian navy. Firstly; the ADI, having come to' Newcastle four months ago, has turned out to, be a splendid corporate citizen. It has fitted in, extremely well with our' industt:ialcom-unity and our broader community. It is proving to-be avery good and sensitive neighbour to'people who live nearby. In our community ADI is introducing both jobs and, more importantly, technology. and skills which have enormous; potential,. I am excited by its approach. I am certainly de;. lighted that it is talking at t,his early stage, to overseas navies with . prospects of exporting not just its material but its technology and possibly its vessels. ADI has come forward as a company with a great deal of credibility and has become a very' 'important part dour industrial community and an extremely ,good corporate citizen. I also mention the Working Nation projects under way. The whole Working Nation program is enormously important. It is imand the portant in terms of the recovery coming through and reductions .in urrempl9yment: Firstly, in our older centres, particularly our older industrial areas, unemployment is not being reduced at the same rate as in the more aggressive and more buoyant parts of the economy. The unemployment rate in Newcastle and the Hunter is still well above the national average. We must keep working at that. Therefore, we must not lose perspective. The fact that it is not as great a problem as it may have been a couple of years ago is no cause for lessening our efforts, particularly in terms of the long-term unemployed. Working Nation is now starting to have effects in the Hunter. I encourage not just the unemployed to take the program seriously and to recognise its potential but, more importantly, organisations, local government and the business community to recognise that the unemployed in their community are also part of their responsibility I would like to see a much stronger response from the business community. It should pick up some of these programs because they can, in fact, aid business. They have the potential to provide new work opportunities, training wages and a whole range of other aspects of Working Nation. The flexibility is there; the goodwill that is available, I think, can help businesses grow. At the moment those in the business community have not really understood the full potential of these programs and how they can allow them to take on employees, in the short term with some assistance; which in the long term will allow their businesses to grow and keep those people on permanently as fully productive members of our community. As one goes around looking at projects, organisations and individuals who have been engaged in programs such as LEAP, jobskills and jobstart, it is interesting to note the number of employers who say that the long term unemployed person they have employed has been very productive. Many employers have expressed surprise that these people have been so good because they had assumed that because they were long-term unemployed they were, therefore, incompetent and unable to be productive. But, given a chance, these people have proved themselves to be worthy and fully contributing members of the work force and, more importantly in many ways, very grateful members. So the level of loyalty to the organisation and the level of commitment that these people bring to a company are often greater because they have had that handicap of being long-term unemployed. I want to go now to an announcement that was made today by National Rail of its preferred tenderer for its major locomotive contract. It has announced this morning that the preferred tenderer is Goninan. Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, I am sure you would be pleased to hear that, given that it has some very important facilities in your electorate. This contract, which is worth some $400 million in initial value, is, in fact, a national contract. It is not just in Newcastle, although the brain power, as I put it, is there; but it is a truly national project spanning across to Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and also up north. It matches very well the concept of National Rail being, for the first time, a national rail. system. I think the first train went on the national rail tracks in recent days. But for the first time, after 94 years of federation, we are seeing a national organisation; we are finally getting to a national rail system. As I said, the announcement by National Rail today of Goninan as its preferred tenderer will bring in an initial $400 million. I suspect the IS-year maintenance contract will be of not much less value. This is exciting. This follows on very well from the defence projects such as minehunters, submarines and frigates, in which we have tried to give national projects to Australian companies to use as building blocks for international industries. It is important to understand that at the moment Goninan, in its relationships with GE, currently has export contracts-in supplies of rolling stock and design-of some $20 million with Thailand and Indonesia. When people spoke about the manufacturing industry in the 1960s, it was almost predominantly only overseas designs and overseas licences in Australia. So we were using overseas equipment to make things for our domestic market. What we have been trying to do in recent years has been to ensure that the design capacity of intellectual properties in Australia is here. We have certainly achieved that in the defence industry. We are now seeing this in the national rail project. This project will give not just a national perspective to our locomotive manufacturing and rail system; it will also position a company of the quality of Goninan as a platform for exports, which I expect, over time, may end up being worth much more than this project is worth because it gives them that base and the credibility to work from. The government has. been pursuing the idea of using our system or our needs as a platform for externalising and internationalising some of our companies and this has been coming through in so many different areas; for example, pharmaceutical, TCF, defence and now transport. Goninan is now in team with GE. It is an international player of enormous quality. I certainly offer my congratulations to John Fitzgerald and all his team. I know that they put up with enormous difficulties. It was a very difficult tender-it was enormously complex-with fierce competition. The fact that that business team has been successful means that it is at the forefront of international developments in locomotive design and manufacturing. I think the benefits will eventually be more important in the export market than the domestic market. In looking at the budget, we now have an international economy which we cannot insulate from what is happening in the world. That is why it is often so difficult to project and predict what will happen. What happens in America and Japan in the next few weeks will affect Australia a few weeks lateralthough, nowadays, it is a few hours later because it is that quick. We have tried to respond to that with international forums and our '1ternational perspective. On the other side of the coin, we have also tried to position our companies to be international players. Unless we recognise that the world is our market-and not just Australiawe will always be at the short end. I expect that the National Rail decision and the potential it gives will be one more step towards helping us to establish a trade balance for the very first time where we can move towards skills based, intellectually based exports of the nature that Goninan is capable of, rather than simply relying on resources.

25,Mr CLEARY,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Strip away the rhetoric and sanctimonious wailing that have accompanied the coalition's attack on the budget and you soon discover that the two major parties essentially agree on the policy fundamentals. It is instructive that to date only the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has categorically opposed the privatisation of public assets, namely the Commonwealth Bank. It is no wonder he has won his preselection by a street. As the people in Victoria are coming to realise, the privatisation nightmare being experienced under Kennett started right here in this parliament under a Labor government. Senator Kim Carr can belly-ache all he likes. The truth is that he has not taken on or exposed those in his party who support the widening of the Tullamarine Freeway and privatisation generally. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) this week tried to dispel the belief that Hilmer and competition policy do not equal privatisation, but it was about as believable as someone standing in this House to announce that Senator Baume was not telling a porky when he said he had never sued the member for Throsby. The coalition could not care less about the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and, given its support for a GST, looks pretty sick when it accuses the government of being a tax rorter. The problem for the coalition is that the ALP has pinched its policies. Now all the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) can do is whine about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) being a man of broken promisesthe great deceiver-and the bloke who turned l-a-w tax cuts into tax cuts l-i-e. It is about time the coalition rewrote the script and dressed itself up in some different colours. The irony of the ALP's drift is not lost on the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). He said, 'What a joke. At least you know what you get with me. Yes, 1'd sell the Commonwealth Bank but the Labor Party said it never would. And where is the Left? Haven't said a damn word.' That is just about a verbatim account of how the honourable member described the proposed sale of the bank. I trust he does not mind my recounting the tale. It must make Labor supporters cringe when they see just how effectively opposition to the Prime Minister's free market economics has been silenced. The Prime Minister loves nothing better than evoking the spirit of the true believers and reaffirming his commitm.ent to working men and women. It is all very entertaining yet, with one policy after another, the fabric upon which past idealists have attempted to construct their version of an egalitarian society has been destroyed. When the Qantas debate raged, key members of the Left argued that working people had little affinity with, or use for, airlines. appease the economic rationalists, the government originally restricted foreign ownership in any Qantas float to 35 per cent. Now, and no-one is surprised, foreign ownership is to be lifted to 49 per cent because, we are told, all the ownership and control objectives will still be met if 49 per cent of Qantas is in foreign hands. So much for Qantas maintaining its Australian character. So much for the PM calling others lickspittles. So much for the independent republican Australia, which the Prime Minister crows about daily. The term 'independent Australia' means absolutely nothing. It is not worth the paper it is written on. Predictably, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), as her speech revealed yesterday, is more concerned about the government's shifty accounting procedures than its lack of commitment to economic sovereignty. Like most coalition members, the member for Mackellar prefers to wave an Australian flag and engage in cheap jingoism than to actually endorse policies which promote economic sovereignty or Australian ownership. Again, predictably, her ire is raised not because of her aversion to foreign ownership but because it is the Labor Party's mates-John Singleton et al-who she claims might make a dollar out of the Qantas float. Not to be outdone, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) gave us a defence of the Qantas sale straight out of John Cleese's Monty Python. 'It's Qantas's Australianness which is its best selling point,' he said, praising the 49 per cent foreign ownership clause in the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill. It is a great concept, is it not? The more of a company you sell off the more Australian it becomes. The argument is that, as a consequence of the corporatisation of the Commonwealth Bank, it no longer has the capacity or the inclination to fulfil any community service role. The government says that it follows logically that the bank should be privati sed. The fact that the government might have forced the bank to fulfil a community service obligation and offer specific services to the lower end of the market-to pensioners and To low income earners, those true believersnever entered the equation. If this 1990s version of the ALP is serious about competition policy, why is it not arguing for a Commonwealth Bank with a charter to provide services which the private banks refuse to offer the lower end of the market? King O'Malley and the blokes the Prime Minister calls 'plodders' must surely be turning in their graves. One wonders how many Labor icons have to be decapitated or buried before the Labor Party finally admits that it has severed its connection with the past and become a fully fledged Liberal Party. Workers employed by the Commonwealth Bank will be only too aware that the sale of the State Bank in Victoria resulted in the closure of over 200 branches. To make matters worse, John Quiggin pointed out in the Sydney Morning Herald on 11 May 1995: In 1993-4 the bank made a profit of $682 million, so the government's half share was $341 millionIn the last half year, profits ran at an annual rate of $900 million. On this basis the sale of the bank will cost the government between $100 million and $250 million a year. So much for government enterprises being inefficient. Regrettably, the budget in general and the sale of the Commonwealth Bank in particular have hardly solicited a murmur from the so-called true believers in the party. The trade union movement is a lame duck. Back in Wills, Labor Party apparatchiks focus on the Kennett government's privatisation agenda as if the federal government is totally opposed to privatisation. They conveniently ignore the ideological and practical role the federal government is playing in the privatisation stakes, something that one of Jeff Kennett's ministers pointed out in the HeraldSun this morning. Typically, they do not have the courage to speak out against the federal government's complicity. We well remember that two years ago the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, in response to the regressive indirect tax measures of the budget, proclaimed that he was not about to defend the indefensible. Two years ago, however, no election was looming. Now, with the possibility of an election at the end of the year or even early next year, the ACTU and the ALP caucus cannot afford to sayan adverse word publicly. With all respect, I cannot understand why so many ALP backbenchers uncritically ape the Prime Minister's hard sell. ALP members cannot honestly believe that Black Jack MCEwen is responsible for Australia's current account problems. The fact that we will go into hypothetical surplus only by pinching $4.5 billion off the Commonwealth Bank, increasing special dividends from government enterprises, cutting back government expenditure and conjuring up a few other tricks is conveniently overlooked in the interest of the political script. If the government can sell the Commonwealth Bank after the Treasurer (Mr Willis) expressly stated that it would never be sold, why will it not do the same with Telecom, which is already piggybacking the Murdoch superhighway into the Australian household? Why would it not do the same with that other great public success story, Australia Post? I am waiting to see an ALP member stand up in this House and say that they would resign if Telecom or Australia Post were to be sold off. The $4 billion which the government will accrue from the sale of the Commonwealth Bank could have been accumulated via a five per cent tax over three years on imported comsumables. The new breed of economic fundamentalists in the party would of course argue that an import duty amounts to a tax on ordinary wage earners. When it is a superannuation tax, a tax on homes or cars or any other regressive indirect tax, it does not qualify as a tax on ordinary wage earners. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) knows all about this kind of duplicity. A month ago he was sanctimoniously attacking those misguided, historically fashioned proponents of White Australia. Now-surprise, surprise-he comes out in print sounding like a 1990s version of the very people he was chastising. Of course, unlike the Anglo-White Australia brigade, the member for Werriwa is no racist-no way. His opposition to immigration is thoughtful and empirically based. That is what he says. It is also what some proponents of White Australia argued. The problem with the government's superannuation plan is that it says nothing about where and how the money ripped from ordinary Australians will be spent. In an article in the Australian Financial Review on 10 May, Brian Toohey stated: The strategy places enormous faith in the quality of investment decisions made by the superannuation fund managers. It also continues to downgrade the contribution from public infrastructure investment which has been falling for 30 years. Who is going to control those who control our money? Who is going to ensure that the necessary infrastructure investment occurs? In other words, who is going to make sure that the money is not sent overseas to provide jobs in other territories or other markets? If a bloke at Barings bank can send a million dollars missing down a computer terminal, who knows what a cavalier super fund manager could do. It could even be a trade unionist super fund manager. As for infrastructure and job creation, Professor Bob Gregory has consistently reminded the government that regional economic disparities have not been eradicated by the so-called economic recovery- It is true that there have been some encouraging signs in the form of a comparative increase in full-time over part-time jobs. However, youth unemployment and general unemployment in the old industrial belts remain a serious problem.

His office staff have not rung me In back to tell me; whether they got the script right on that Qne. ,. On 8 March, the Parliamentary Secretary to the ,Minister for Transport, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), advised me in writing: At thfsstage there is no proposal to include the Tullamarine Freeway widening as part of a broad mast. What infrastructure bond project. a party that was not going to sell the Commonwealth Bank, such statements offer only cold comfort. This freeway wilJ orily the harm the northern suburbs of Melbourne, suburbs which have already experienced a extreme economic disadvantage from what the government euphemistically calls economic If the federal government and. the Prime Minister are committed to this kind of economic barbarism, it is about time they stopped deceiving people. If they are not, they should be using all their power to ensure that this freeway madness does not proceed. If the Deputy Prime Minister is serious about better cities concepts, he should be standing up in this parliament telling every member of this House, and every member of the public, that he is dead against it and that he is dead against the Minister for Transport's position on freeway widening. Situated as it is between the city and Melbourne airport, the electorate of Wills, and its surrounds, has great potential. It does not need a freeway; it needs public transport upgraded. So much for this rapid rail link to Melbourne airport that we have heard about. It has become secondary because this parliament is controlled by the New South Wales Right in Sydney, and Melbourne basically does not count. We need our public transport upgraded, and that is one of the ways we could do it. In the absence of private sector investment, Melbourne's transport system needs an injection of public funds. It is time for the government to stop playing around with people's lives and undertake some specific and strategic programs beyond the training regime. Labor Party members in Wills will be claiming that the money for training schemes is effective and useful. The problem is that it is not enough. To create real jobs, and to save those territories which have been lost in the so-called recovery, the government has to adopt a serious interventionist approach to economic life. Those areas that have been lost are represented by some very prominent ALP members. The member for Melbourne is on one side. The Deputy Prime Minister is in Batman. A former minister for industry is in Maribyrnong. The President of the ALP is in Lalor. The Treasurer is in Gellibrand. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) is in Calwell. Those areas are represented by Labor members but they are not getting their fair share of the economic improvement that Australia is experiencing. Professor Bob Gregory has pointed this out ad nauseam. It is about time some of those Labor members actually did something about it.",44
26,Mr LINDSAY,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (12.39p.m.)-The debate on the appropriation bills is a good time· to examine the differences between the government and the opposition. The appropriation bills will fund the policies and programs of the government for the coming year, In contrast, the opposition is not prepared to engage in dialogue with the Australian people on policies. It has no responsible or open policy making processes. The faceless me.n of its public relations consultancies make Liberal Party policies. Generally, prejudice and popularism are the Liberal Party's guiding principles. Prejudice leads the Liberal Party to demand fiscal constraint in the budget. Popularism leads the Liberal Party to oppose all tax measures in the budget. Together these views mean that the opposition must be prepared to cut government expenditure. During the last federal election campaign the opposition campaigned under a policy document called Fightback. Fightback spelt out very clearly that a Liberal-National Party in government would slash government expenditure by $10,000 million. Within that $10,000 million, over a three-year period $850 million would be slashed from expenditure on defence. That was the choice facing the Australian people at the last federal election. This budget itself represents a very substantial fiscal tightening-$15 billion has been cut from the government's borrowing requirement. These cuts involve a real reduction in the running costs of departments and agencies worth $662 million over four years. The market response to the government's budget has been positive and interest rates have been lowered. But in its desperation to attract funds from the business community for its federal election campaign, the opposition hints that it would have been tougher. The opposition suggests that in government it would have managed tighter fiscal policy. But the opposition's record stands against When the opposition was last in government it never displayed the fiscal responsibility this Labor government. I recall when I first elected that the deficit we inherited the Fraser-Howard government, in 1983 dollar terms, was $9.6 billion. The opposition's popularism principles also stand How credible are opposition claims of fiscal responsibility when on the revenue side it refuses to address tax issues and on the expenditure side it refuses to identify the areas of expenditure that it would cut government. . In Fightback the Liberal Party's prejudices towards expenditure cuts were exposed. industry policy, the opposition said that enterprise improvement programs such as those administered through AusIndustry programs would be better handled by the states. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me assure you that the efforts by the states to develop the fundamengovernment tal building blocks of industrial competitivea ness have been relatively very minor. It is the federal government that has provided proomy. grams to enhance industrial science and vision. technology, innovation, best practice and export· access. Indeed, many state governindustry, ments of both political persuasions simply administer federal government initiated programs. Federal government enterprise improvement programs are coordinated through AusInThe dustry, which works cooperatively with the states. and the private sector in delivering these programs. Importantly, it has been the federal government, and its departments and agencies, which has provided the leadership to develop new programs and to ensure their effective delivery. My good friend the current opposition industry spokesman, the member for Ryan (Mr Moore), I suspect has inherited some of those Liberal Party prejudices on the value AusIndustry programs. In a media release dated 2 March this year he described the streamlining of government enterprise imtive. provement programs under AusIndustry with following the Burgess review as 'fiddling the edges' , while failing to address the mental problems confronting Australiari $64 million worth. it. industry. The issues according to my good friend the member for Ryan were business of taxation, industrial relations, competition was policy and inefficient national econoinic from infrastructure. The absence of any opposition policies in these areas must therefore be of some embarrassment to my colleague the against it. member for Ryan. My challenge to members of the opposition is to produce the policies they would take to the Australian people and let the Australian in people examine those policies and make a judgment of them. However, it should not underestimate the intelligence and the capacity of the Australian people to decide the On worth and merit of those policies. I would now like to outline the policies and of the industry, science and technology portfolio that support the appropriations contained in the appropriation bills. This has maintained a commitment to vision of Australia as a confident, energetic and successful participant in the global econThat has been our determination, our Inspired by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), the science and technology portfolio plays a vital role in providing the leadership necessary to deal with contemporary and emerging issues affecting the industrial and technological development of this country. portfolio is responsible for devising and implementing policy and programs to facilitate the development of competitive manufacturing and service enterprises within a business environment and building a world class science and technology base in this country. The appropriation for the industry, science and technology portfolio for the next financial year totals $2.8 billion, about the same level as the last financial year. The appropriation will allow the portfolio to continue the moof mentum of established policies and programs designed to encourage Australian industry and firms to become more internationally competiThis budget also provides the portfolio the appropriations necessary to continue at the implementation of major initiatives anfundanounced in Working Nation last May, some I wish to stress that the Keating government places continuing strong emphasis 'on deliveringthe industry, science and, technology progra1ns,t'nore efficiently ,and m'ore effectively,: providing better value for money for the Australian taxpayer. We recognise the need for restraint in this year- s budget. We· have placed priority on ensuring that the new poHcyproposals are fu-ly offset by savings from within, the portfolio. It is an admirable achievement. Let me now look to the overview of the industry, science and technology portfolio, truly a ,powerhouse for economic development in this"" country. 'In - regard to governm-nt appropriations divided amongst the portfolio agencies: the outlays by category are: for the department, about 24 per cent; for the science agencies, about 18 per cent; for the Australian C.ust6ms Service, about 12 per cent; and for the diesel fuel rebate scheme, which is administered by the Australian CustomsService-:-of 'great moment in' country, Australia-45 per cent. The government is, therefore, addressing areas where the markets fail to provide what w:eexpect-optimum outcomes, They include deficiencies in the flow of information and the level of research and development and the adoption of new technology, particularly in industry. These are subjects honourable members have heard me talk about on many occasions in this House-,-the flow of information, the., apjJalllngiy low level of ,private sector research and development and the need to. a-opt new technology, particularly in indusirY- , The issue of the science agenCies comes under consideraiionfrom time to time in this House. Support for research and development is one example' of where we 'are trying and succeeding in an area where the market traditionally fails or underprovides. Funding to the science agencies--.:.CSIRO, the Australian Institute of Marine Science at Townsville and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation-is granted normally on a triennial basis. This provides a more stable financial environment and a mbre realistic time'frame for resource planning in scientific research, which often involves activities that extend beyond normal, annual budget cycles. An appropriation of $416 million has been earmarked for scientific and industrialresearch programs administered by CSIRO. The government has set CSIRO a target of 30 per cent self-funding, which is helping to orient the researoh program towards the commerdal interests of the private sector. During 1995-96, CSIRO'smanagement and structure will be evaluated, and its strategic ' , plan will be revised to encourage the most efficient use of research and developtp.ent funding. 'CSIRO will continue its efforts. to enhance and upgrade its relationships with customers arid stakeholders to improve its business practices, cqmmercialisation procedures and research - uppori services. The research effort, including strategic researc,h for the sustainable long-term growth of industries and short-term research and development project work with firms, will continue to focus on nominated priority areas---':and this is very important. A stated objective on behalf of the government' is to ensure that taxpayers' money 'continues to ,be employed in a way that provides value and useable outcomes. ' "" Another important area within the portfolio which needs to be addressed continually is the Australian Industrial Property Organisation. That' 'organisation is responsible for the industrial property program, which provides effective property. right protection for inventions, trademarks, and designs in Australia. It does this in a very cQst-,effyctive manner and is pursuing a target of 100 per, cent cost recovery. Demand for industrial property services, particularly, trademarks, increased substantially in the last financial year, and this trend is expected to increase into 1995-96. Following the' review of the trademarks legislation, new legislation will come' into effect on 1 January next year. We will consider the review of the Australian design and petty patents systems. The latter review will consider whether small inventors have effective access to intellectual property protection. We often hear complaints about the cost to small inventors of intellectual property protection, lind We often hear complaints from small inventors about the laborious procedures that have to be followed to achieve that outcome. As a result of the Conroy review, the Australian Customs Service has undergone major reform to enable it to better focus on client needs and increased efficiencies. It is developing stronger and wider consultative mechanisms with partners and clients. It is very conscious of its international responsibilities, particularly within the APEC forum. It is very responsive also to calls for it to change its culture, to become much more effective· in its dealings, and to establish stronger bonds with its clients and partners in administering a number of government programs. The department's objective is not only to efficiently manage and support these agencies but also to ensure that industry and science community are provided with the necessary policies and programs that will help Australian industry and science to accelerate their internationalisation and assist tralian economy in being able to cope with increasing internationalisation. The policies for industry and science must focus on critical for firms to compete in the internaBizhelp, tional marketplace-not only within Australia but also within the international marketance. place-if this country is to continue its economic growth. Funding for the Department of Industry, Science and Technology portfolio was thereavailable fore sought to support policies and programs which are in place and working effectively and also, at the same time, to facilitate development of a competitive business enviment ronment-that is, to provide that helping hand of assistance to industry, to the private sector, to assist them in becoming much more comtechnology petitive. With respect to Auslndustry, 1994 saw the federal government introduce a new approach to the delivery of government enterprise development services to industry. For the first time, firms will be able to access all business improvement programs through a single our body-Auslndustry. Auslndustry will place strong emphasis on providing a client focused and integrated delivery of enterprise developresearchers, ment services to optimise opportunities for Australian companies to have the necessary information for their continued growth. The government's response to the Burgess report placed Auslndustry as the primary delivery mechanism for all the federal government's domestic business improvement programs. All export programs will now be delivered by Austrade. This is a very important initiative by the government in trying to streamline and make more efficient the mechanisms for the delivery of these particular programs. A major priority of Auslndustry over the next 12 months will be the implementation of the Burgess report recommendations which focus on issues of rationalisation and better program delivery-in other words, industry the becoming involved with Auslndustry and delivering those programs with a private sector mentality and attitude to ensure that the taxpayer and private industry in this country the Ausget the value that we seek for them. In addition to that, as a key part of the factors Auslndustry program we have launched the computer based directory of Commonwealth and state government assistThis will prove of immeasurable benefit to small businesses in accessing federal and state government information on a whole range of programs. The program is upgraded every three months. It costs $200 and is in lawyers' offices, banks and accountants' offices. It is designed to give instant information to people trying to find the out what they have to do to access governprograms or what they have to do to set up a line of business that they wish to pursue. I come back again to the science and program allocation for 1995-96 of $163 million. The program has the objective of building and maintaining a world-class science and technology base. We have a passionate commitment to accelerating Australia's business research and development growth. We believe that, through successful commercialisation, the conversion of more of existing research and development into a a competitive edge is absolutely fundamental. We have increased collaboration between and active involvement of research users, through the cooperative research program-five of which are in my own electorate. A further cooperative research centre to focus on developing technologies to assist greenhouse gas abatement was announced by the government in March this year. We are trying to raise the awareness in Australia of the strong interrelationship between science, technology and economic and social well-being, as well as trying to encourage a well-informed debate on these very important issues. Time does not permit me to canvass a lot of important issues dealing with innovation and other budget initiatives in the statement, but I would like to conclude on the following issues. The outlook for the Australian economy and industry is very promising over the next few years, particularly with the growth in the American economy and falling interest rates in that country, which have an effect on this country. Budget forecasts predict that economic growth will continue to be around 3.75 per cent. The unemployment rate has fallen to 8.3 per cent in April this year and we are already achieving budget forecasts for June 1996 of eight per cent. There is strong growth in both part-time and full-time employment, which is good. The business community will see growth in investment of 13 per cent, following the stronger growth of 18 per cent over the past year. (Time expired).  let the speech of my colleague the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) go by without some very brief remark. In his speech he touched on the supposed lack of any economic credibility on the part of the coalition because of a lack of policies. I find it extraordinary he does not realise that the shoe is actually the other foot. The government has made promises of economic forecasts year in year out, almost none of which have ever turned out to be true. It then turns around and says that the opposition does not have any economic credibility. We now have a Prime Minister who is claiming six years of growth. For goodness sake! If the Australian people have not worked out yet that these things are always said by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) before elections and then broken after, then I do not know what they will think. When budget time comes around we know that the Prime Minister, in his immortal words, is about to throw the switch to vaudeville. The performance might not be as spectacular as the 1988 show, but each year we can expect a big production number. This year has been no exception. The Prime Minister has staged yet another of his allsinging, all-dancing extravaganzas, taken it on the road, and even run around the press gallery chivvying out reluctant journalists to tell them just how great it is. However, this year something different is happening. To put it .bluntly, no-one in the electorate believes him. This year the prime Minister has been too smart for his own good. He has ridden out pressure for an earlier economic statement and he has produced a budget which he says will deliver a surplus but, after 13 years of hearing promise after promise that does not come true, people are sick of his boasting. They no longer trust this government. Despite the efforts of our super-salesman PM, the standing of the government has fallen in the polls since budget night. The 1995 budget has already been labelled as a smoke and mirrors exercise, and rightly so. When the artifice and the glitz are stripped away, government spending will actually increase by 1.7 per cent in real terms, and personal taxation is set to jump by a whopping 13.6 per cent. A look at some of the budget's main points shows just what a phoney document it is. The government claims to have produced a surplus budget, but this notional surplus depends on that asset sales. The government's record on on achieving its asset sales has been abysmal. Since 1987-88, the government has estimated that privatisation would raise $11 billion. In that time it has received just $5.8 billion, or just over half. The long awaited proceeds of the Qantas sale are becoming a regular item in the budget papers. The government's asset sales have not even been motivated by a belief in efficiency. They are just a desperate grab for cash. The Dasfleet sale is a prime example of how dodgy this process has become. The government plans to sell Dasfleet, to raise some cash now, but then pay it out again through a lease-back by leaving employees on the public payroll. It is a particularly crude exercise. Too much of this budget is a collection of accounting tricks. Too much of it will either increase prices, hit jobs, lead to interest rate rises, reduce take-home payor break election promises. The increase in company tax will hit small firms and cause more job losses. We will all be paying more as companies of all sizes pass on their increased costs to consumers in the form of higher prices. By lifting the corporate tax rate to 36 per cent at a time when most nations are lowering their rates, the government is weakening our export position and making us less competitive. If this government gets its way, Australia's company tax rate will be one of the highest in the OECD. In the Asia-Pacific region, only three countries now have higher company tax rates than Australia: Canada with 38 per cent; Japan with 37.5 per cent; and Korea with 36.5 per cent. Nations such as Thailand with 30 per cent, Singapore with 27 per cent and Hong Kong with a tiny 17.5 per cent have company tax rates well below ours. Our traditional benchmark, New Zealand, gets by with only 33 per cent. By raising the company tax rate, the government is putting us out of step with international trends. It will be an impost which many companies, particularly small businesses, can ill afford. Yet, when challenged on this, all the Prime Minister can offer is some sneering advice and a warning that this is as good as it gets. The jump in the sales tax on cars will add around $1,000 to the price of a new car. Motor dealers are already predicting a 25 per cent drop in sales. When this is combined with the drop of more than 25 per cent in demand for vehicles which occurred in April, the effects will be devastating. The new tax will hit ordinary people and be a real blow against the struggling motor vehicle industry, not to mention the small component manufacturers, both of which have significant operations in my home state of South Australia. The changes in sales tax for building materials will add around $2,500 to the price of a $100,000 house, and will bump up the costs of renovations and even of basic home maintenance. Fortunately, the renovations on my own home will be finished by 1 July so I will not have to pay the extra tax! As the Taxation Institute of Australia has pointed out, the government's plans to treat independent subcontractors and the like as PA YE earners will result in higher costs for employers who will have to administer the onerous remittance arrangements. Tax rises are not the only budget slugs the Prime Minister has given us. The increase in the Medicare levy will be yet another burden. The compulsory superannuation contribution takes away people's right to make their own choice about investing in their future. It forces them into a particular form of investment that may not be the most appropriate, especially for people nearing retirement. Low income earners may suffer as their superannuation investments are swallowed up by fund administration costs. It is also doubtful just how many people will actually enjoy the fruits of this scheme. Tax promises the Prime Minister made only two years ago have been junked. Promises for the next century look even less likely to ever occur. As the representative of an electorate with significant numbers of people of and near retirement age, I am concerned by the rip-off the cancellation of the tax cuts represents to these people. No person who is retired now, or retiring between this year and 1998, will receive any benefit from the government's superannuation proposals. At the same time, they will not enjoy the extra money the abandoned One Nation tax promises could have provided, money that could have been invested towards retirement. Mrs Crosio--Speak to 70 per cent of the population.  entirely ignored by the government. The parliamentary secretary says, 'Speak to 70 per cent of the population.' I am just talking about the self-funded retirees and the fact that the government has ignored them yet again in this budget. They have lost their tax cuts and they have received no compensation through increased payments to superannuation. That is what I am talking about. The coalition will be opposing the increases in company tax, the hike in the Medicare levy, the new sales taxes on cars and building materials and the PAYE remittance arrangements. For all these reasons, when the government produces the legislation for these proposals, we will oppose them. The Australian Democrats' sanctimony deserves a special mention. They have been happy to support this budget's changes, but they have sought an inquiry into its figuring. The budget is either dodgy or it is not. Calling for an inquiry into how the government reached the budget bottom line, while supporting its contents, is a particularly hypocritical grab for a platform for publicity. To try to end this type of politicking, the coalition has committed itself to a charter of budget honesty that will clearly separate the recurrent and capital sides of the budget, establish benchmarks against which fiscal policies can be assessed, seek to achieve prudent public debt levels and then seek to achieve a more appropriate balance between operating revenue and operating expenditure and provide a degree of predictability about the level and stability of tax rates for future years. To restore further credibility to the budget process, a coalition government would release a statement three months before the budget signalling its major goals and would encourage the Reserve Bank to further develop its information strategies, including regular statements on monetary policy and the release of economic forecasts. The need for decent budget making strategies has become all too clear. This budget is the culmination of three years of short-term, politically expedient policy making that does nothing to help the overall problems facing our nation. Ever since the One Nation budget package was handed down in 1992, glib politics has replaced good economics. One Nation promised $5Y2 billion of new spending and $11.1 billion of tax cuts. Normally, Treasury would have prepared details of tax cuts, but now we know that it was told that these would be done by the Prime Minister's office. That was not the only departure from normal practice. Economic forecasting was also hijacked by the Prime Minister and his advisers, who made up projections showing Australia growing at a rate that had never been sustained in the past, at a time when the economy had barely stopped shrinking. After just eight months in his new job, the Prime Minister had committed himself to $22 billion of tax and spending measures, but only offset it by $5 billion of new taxes. After scraping in at the 1993 election, the government was in a bind over what to do with its promised tax cuts. The result was the preposterous 1993 budget, where John Dawkins was forced to raise taxes to pay for the Prime Minister's tax cuts. The government gave away $3,700 million in tax cuts, then took back all but a paltry $100 million, mainly through regressive taxes. Since then, we have had battles between the Prime Minister and the deficit daleks. We have had fights between the Prime Minister and his Treasurer (Mr Willis) over a minibudget, and fights between the government and Treasury and between the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank. Ever since One Nation, and particularly since the last election, short-term politics have replaced good economic management. The Prime Minister has always preferred grand designs to the minutiae of day-today public management. He seems to have forgotten that his first great plan as Treasurer was to transform the economy and the image of the ALP as an economic manager. He is still seeking to transform Australia, using a lot of money which the nation simply does not have. 'Prime Minister Keating' and 'Treasurer Keating' are very different creatures. In a particularly ironic twist, he has undermined the reputation he helped gain for the ALP with his spending cuts in the 1980s. The last three years have seen a ballooning of public expenditure and program spending. Too much of this consists of new outlays. It has not been cyclical spending to cushion the country during a recession. There is still much to be done before the government can truly say that public spending has been pared back to the bone. This budget does nothing to tackle the current account deficit iIi the medium term. Micro-economic reform is completely ignored. Tariff cuts and the recession forced the private sector to review internal structures and slash middle management positions. There is no reason why the public sector 'cannot do the same. The Business Council of Australia has called for an external commission, of audit, to identify savings across all departments; and the coalition has said it will do so when in power. The BCA estimates that savings of $5 billion are possible. Basic running costs of government have risen ,by more than 33 per cent in. real terms since 1987-88, and they now account for almost 10 per cent of budget outlays. There has also been a costly growth in the higher ranks of the bureau'cracy. Nurribers' of people in the senior officer grades C, Band A, the equivalent to private sector middle management, have rocketed; from four per cent of staff in 1984 to nine per cent. The Department of Final1ce has already warned of the traffic jam this is creating in the Public Service career path. Not only is the public sector work force ageing; staff are racing up the ranks to senior officer' level and then stopping abruptly, because of the limited opportunities to jump to the' next level-the Senior Executive Service bands 1 to 3 ,Earlier this year, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Philippa Smith, warned in <!: speech t9 the Public Service Commission that red tllpe, cost cutting and buck-passing meant that bure-ucrats were failing in their duty to deliver' an 'efficient service. According ,to Ms Smith, the need to reduce C0sts h-sbeen translated not: into greater cost competitiveness or better services but into service rationIng; ,and public servants themselves need a clearer vIew of where their fundamental duties lie. IIi my first speech in this place, I said I believed there was a place for government in promoting economic growth and the recovery elf. this country, in protecting the weak from the strong and in ensuring that all citizens are treated fairly and equitably. I went on to say that this does not imply that the state will always be right, or will always have the panacea for our country's ills. I said that a true liberal would expect government to limit itself, to encourage the freedom of its people and broaden the opportunity for choices to be made by each individual as freely asp()ssible from government intervention. My views have not changed on this matter. When, we speak only of reducing the power of the state, we can forget what the qualitative role of the state should be. Politicians and senior bureaucrats are being forced today to ask, 'What is the core business of government? \Vhat services can be cut"" replac-d or run better to improve our competitive position?' Managerialism has overruled ,the competing claims of ideology to become the dominant language of politics. . ' . - ;; . We are moving from the traditional black and white that has characterised government and bureaucracy. In almost every sphere other than politics ne\\, forms have replaced topheavy, strong power models of mamlgement. We need to take the public' services, we have inherited from the industrial era, organised in a top-down fashion to oeliver standards to mass markets, and restructure them to meet the needs of the information age in an entrepreneurial way. The greatest 'leverage for governments in a global economy is in thdr investment in people and public infrastruCture. Australian National Audit Office perfonn,-nce studies have already found basic ongoing savings of $80, miilion a yeal"" in improy-d administration of cash, b,ankingariq borrowing by departments, $46 million in energy costs and improyed planning and $10 million from better management of government credit cards. Th- demands of accountability can place cumbersome rules on the public sector, but this does, not mean its operations and processes cannot be streamlined, a- showDby those exa1l1ples. '. Micro-economic reform has, largely stalled since the early 1990s. The much vaunted Hilmer competition .reforms will themselves be implemented largely by the, states - In government, much of the, work of, the 1980s --;'/ has been lost. Government's jobs are to keep foreign debt down, control inflation and manage the current account deficit, amongst other things. However, we have to avoid a preoccupation with savings alone that ignores the equally important field of improvements in the performance and range of services offered by government. Government will have new roles as it seeks to maintain our competitive advantage. In this environment many of the big governmentsmall government ideas that have characterised our thinking for so long become simplistic. Australia's quality of life is one of our central selling points. Governments play a significant role in providing parts of this, like education, health services, arts and cultural facilities, practical environmental protection and justice and human rights. Quality of life is as significant a part of a nation's overall competitive advantage as are cost considerations. The.re are examples to give. Governments will need to manage the massive investment in education needed to meet the demands of a knowledge based age, not necessarily as the sole providers but as the coordinator of programs that will maximise our national skills. We also need to ensure that we have adequate national infrastructure, but again through the planning and coordination of facilities in a way that maximises our posiit tion, not by their financing and provision. Savings are already being made from comother mercialising services, but we should not ignore the export potential of the expertise have developed in our public sector, like Telecom, and market this with help from the private sector. In the 1970s and 1980s it was thought that stripping back the state to its fundamentals and relying on markets would provide a solution to economic woes. Today we need to reinvent government on a scale hardly imagined before. We must avoid the trap of seeking nothing but savings from government. Better financial outcomes that fail to deliver any other benefits will not equip us to face the future. The real goal of government in the 1990s is to deliver performance. This budget does nothing to help this. It only offers smoke and mirrors and magic tricks. Clever exercises with figures may be a satisfying game for the Prime Minister, but accounting fiddles and gimmicks do not provide good public policy, and this budget and government will not provide what Australia needs.",48
27,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I welcome this opportunity to speak this afternoon in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1). I wish to express my concern about what I believe to be one of the most unfair and shonkiest budgets in living memory. The figures are so rubbery that the budget is still bouncing out there. Quite clearly, this budget, as were many of the government's previous budgets, has been predicated on shonky figures. It just goes to show what can be done with a bit of creative accountancy when you put into computers figures which you quite clearly know are not achievable. This budget is unfair, because it really targets the sections of the community least able to afford the government's massive tax take in so many areas of everyday life . .It is shonky, because it breaks a whole swag of promises made by the government in the 1993 an election campaign, and it is financed by selling off Australia's national family silver, including the Commonwealth Bank. I suppose comes as a surprise even to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, and to members on the side of the House, to see that great icon of the Labor Party being completely sold off. we I guess even the true believers out there no in longer believe in the Labor Party. I guess there are many battlers out there in Australia who have lost faith in this government and this Labor Party. I want to focus on the impact of the budget on families, businesses and rural and remote Australia which are already reeling from the drought, high interest rates and that recession that this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that this nation had to have. It is interesting to read through the budget speech of· the Treasurer (Mr Willis), because the words 'rural community' were not mentioned once. Of course, the forgotten people ofrerriote Australia hardly rate a mention from any member on the other side of the House, on any occasion. The Prime Minister believes that small business has never had it so good. I wish I could pass on to the House the reaction of the small businesses in my community to those sorts of comments from the Prime Minister. But I will not, because it would be quite unparliamentary to record those statements in this place. In the 1995-96 budget, few areas of daily living will be untouched by the Prime Minister's tax take. The list of really makes grim reading. For example, motor vehicle sales taxes will rise by five percentage points. That is going to add $1,000 to the price of the average family car. It is also going to impact on businesses-and, particularly, on commercial travellersbecause they are going to be paying for those increases, especially where they use vehicles as part of their business operations. So not only the family but the small business community as well. Home building and renovations will be hit by anew 12 per cent tax on hardware and building materials. That is going to· add $2,500 to the cost of the average family home. All that really does is put the great Australian dream further from the reach of average Australians-the battlers out there who would love to own their own homes or to add another room to the great dreams they have. What we are seeing is the Prime Minister and the government chasing more tax from the battlers of this nation through a savage 12 per cent new tax on the building materials that are used to build the family home. Of course,these taxes also impact on the business community and, in particular, the small business community. Small business owners are great investors in their own futures and in their own businesses, and the government's taxes are going to hit items that they use to build their sheds, their offices so on. The Medicare levy has been increased yet again. All that will serve to do is drive more people even further away from taking up private health insurance. The general public out there may well remember that when Medicare was first introduced it was a one per cent levy. Today, it is 1.4 per cent and it is going to rise to 1.5 per cent. That sounds like a small increase, but in terms of the people out there who have to pay this Medicare levy all it will tend to do will be to drive more and more people out of private health insurance. That is the opposite of what we should be trying to achieve in medical care in this country. We should be encouraging more people into private health insurance, not driving them away with this savage increase increased taxes in the Medicare levy. The $185 million of revenue for licensing and supervision fees on banks will no doubt be passed on to their consumers in the form of higher bank charges. No-one will convince me---:-Ieast of all the Prime Minister, who has not convinced anyone yet-that that new fee will not be passed on to the consumers of this it hits nation. Only a week or so ago, when he addressed the National Farmers Federation, the Prime Minister aimed a little bit of a broadside at the banks of this nation. If he were genuine in his comments relating to the banking industry, he would do something about it. But all we have heard in that area from the Prime Minister are soft words of rhetoric, that he understands the problem and that the banks have a responsi1::>ility. When the Prime Minister is introducing a new tax which is going to rip another $185 million out of the banking sector, which will be passed on to the consumers, how does that rest with his statements to the National Farmers Federation last week? Quite clearly the Prime Minister's rhetoric is not matched by the actions of his government, and indeed in. this case the federal budget. The government is set in this budget· to extract greater dividends from Australia Post and Telecom, which will inevitably lead to hikes in the cost of postage stamps and telephone calls. Instead of Telecom paying and higher dividends to the federal government, it would be great to see that money being invested in infrastructure, particularly out there in rural and remote Australia. Many people in rural and remote Australia rely on what is called a digital radiocommunication system. It certainly has brought an automatic telephone service to many rural and remote communities, but one of the problems with the DRCS system is th- speed of transinission of that technology. It is preventing many people, particularly small businesses and the farming community, from accessing fast transmission speeds. As computer technology improves, and as the lnternet and' the rest of the' information superhighway become more widely available, many of these people will find, that their access to those technologies will in fact be too slow. It would have been better to have seen this money going back out into infrastructure rather than to a higher dividend to the federal government. Quite clearly Telecom, as the universal service provider: of communications across ,this nation, will be forced to withdraw some of the, programs that it had planned for rural Australia. In the area of postage costs, mail services in remote Australia already are sparse-in many cases only once a fortnigpt. The additional dividend could have been used to ensure that people, particularly those students in rural and remote Australia who need to use distance education services, were at least able to receive the mail on a more regular basis than they receive it today. But the federal government has said, 'We want more dividends from 'Australia Post.' That puts additional pressure on Australia Post to meet its budgetary requirements, which' will place further pressure on the services that it pro"" vides out there in rural and remote Australia. . Of course,we alllmow that those Oqe Nation l-a-w tax cuts were junked long ,ago and that the Prime Minister is trying'to tell that they will now be paid in the form of superannuation, somewhere in the distant future. No-one beile,ves that the Prime Minister's commitment in that area will be met either. Quite clearly the people took him at his word prior to the last federal electipn that these tax,cuts were l-a-w, which,prove.d to be l-i-e-s. They do not beli-ve in this case that he is going to meet his commitment and turn these ,tax cuts into superannuation comffiitmentsin 1997-98 and beyond. As, a result of all these tax increases in this federal budget, families struggling to meet daily living expenses will now have to reach even further into th.eir pockets to pay for the failures of the policies of the Prime Minjster and the extravagance of his government. In addition, many rural Australians are going to be hit by the increase in avgas duty, which will increase the cost of aerial spraying, for e'xample, by motethah' 10 per cent in some cases. Avgas is a fuel that is used in 'piston driven engines and, of course, many 'of the aeroplanes 'using avgas 'to operate in rural Australia 'are used for' mustering and for checking properties; so, quite clearly, this is just another increase in the operating costs for many of our rural producers. The' abolition of the diesel fuel excise rebate for residential premises is going to hit low income people. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure there are' people iiI your own electorate of Hunter who use fuel oil for heating their homes, or for ·cooking. Quite dearly, the people who have these oil heating and cooking facilities in their homes are people in lower socio-economic circumstances. ' The abolition of the diesel fuel excise· rebate for residential premis-s is going to hit low il;1come people, who have little opportunity to convert to other sources of energy such as electricity, gas,. or solar'p,ower."" The $13 million savings to the government is, .in fact; a tax that will be borne by the lower socio-economic group iri this natic:m: iIi other words; by the battlers and the battling' families. As well' as these tax hikes,. the' people of rural Australia have' been hard hit by t,he expenditure side of the budget,which, has us confirmed, once and fof all, the government's urt>-n bias. For instance, the skewing of the federal' funding' to Australia's cities is ' so blatant thiLi, unlike other, areas, of expenditure, there has been no attemp(to conceal, it, by using tricky budgetary accounting; While the g<;rvernment has allocated anadditiomi:l $247 million to the better cities program over the next six years, rural Australil;lns have beeIi promised a paltry increase of $5' million over three years in the regional: development program. To add insult to injury, the government has promised to consider even more funding for better cities, but is conspicuously silent on its plans for regional development. There is nothing at all for Australians in rural and remote areas. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the government's urban bias is actually exacerbating the problems that the better cities program is supposed to be fixing. The government is starving Australia's rural and remote regions of funding, and is denying them the growth opportunities which could make them more attractive places in which to live and invest, thereby relieving some of the pressures on our congested urban fringes. Only a couple of weeks ago, the new Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, made the statement that Sydney is now becoming overcrowded. He is suggesting that there should not be any more population growth in Sydney, but that we should be ensuring that the population growth in the future should take place in the provincial cities and rural Australia. Quite clearly, the $247 million that the federal government has announced in this budget under the better cities program might address some of the problems that the cities are having, but there is only $5 million for regional development. Even the Labor Premier of New South Wales would agree that this budget is skewed towards urban society and that it is not balanced, in an equity sense, towards supplying some support for regional, rural and remote Australia. Federal funding for rural local councils is now lower in real terms than when Labor came to office in 1983. While the government has abolished funding for major rural arterial roads the new better cities program will provide more funding for transport facilities in our cities. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) is very sensitive about my criticisms of the government's policies for rural Australia, and I will continue to be critical of the government's policies in that area. His only response has been to list the projects funded by the better cities program. This is wonderful for the 27 centres which received better cities funding but it is of no use to the heartland of rural Australia, which totally misses out on any funding in terms of a targeted initiative in the way that the better cities program benefits our capital cities. One of the cruellest expenditure cuts in this budget was the axing of a hostel for rural students program, which has been vital to the provision of education to students in rural and remote Australia. The program was axed in this budget despite a commitment from the government that it would be funded throughout 1995-96. This betrayal by the government will result in a further hardship for the operators of rural hostels and for the parents in rural and remote areas who are already struggling to ensure their children receive an adequate education. This budget is the surest sign yet that the government has lost its way. It is also evidence of the government's arrogance and insensitivity to Australia's disadvantaged rural and remote regions. As many of the commentators said on the night of the budget, 'If you can believe the Prime Minister, you can believe the budget.' Quite clearly, people do not believe the Prime Minister and they do not believe that this budget will work. Having spoken on education matters a moment ago I would like to bring another element of the government's education budget to the attention of the House. I have made a number of representations to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) in respect of applications by St Patrick's school in Emerald for a three-stream high school. That school is in my own electorate of Maranoa. The original application for funding was rejected but this decision was reversed by the minister yesterday on the advice of the Non-government Schools Funding Committee. I congratulate the minister on the decision which will be of immeasurable long-term benefit to the people of Emerald and surrounding districts. Hopefully, Dalby and Stan thorpe schools will also receive funding under that same program, as their applications are un-er review at the moment. I am concerned, however, that the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) was apparently advised by the minister's office within a matter of minutes of that decision having been made; a decision, I might add, for which I was grateful. However, the member for Capricornia wasted no time in issuing a press release announcing the grant. As most honourable members will be aware, Emerald is not in the electorate of Capricomia; it is in the electorate of Maranoa. I, as the elected member for Maranoa, have yet to receive official advice of the minister's decision. (Time expired)",56
28,Mr LANGMORE,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Fraser) (1.39 p.m.)This was a particularly difficult budget to prepare because it comes just before an election but also required a very delicate economic balance. It involved finding a way of maximising growth of employment whilst keeping inflation low, aiming to reduce the budget deficit and to keep interest rates down whilst trying to reduce the current account deficit, and getting a proper balance between revenue and outlays. It seems to me that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) achieved that balance very effectively. I would like to go through in some detail the measures that he has adopted. First of all, there are the criteria to be used in preparing the budget. Obviously, the most important criterion was that the budget had to prepare the ground for further improvements in employment. Unemployment is clearly Australia's major economic and social problem. A large number of people, approximately 800,000, are still unemployed. That is causing enormous personal damage to those people and those who are dependent on them. It is also the cause of great economic damage to the whole country, because of the economic loss, the waste that is caused by those people being unable to find the work that they want, and also because of the discouragement to other people to rejoin the work force or join the work force for the first time. Growth of employment had to be the highest priority. But a second major priority had to be reduction of the current account deficit. Australia has through most of its history had a current account deficit and that is natural in a rapidly developing country. That is something we often forget. It is quite proper for a rapidly developing country, which is building up its infrastructure, to import capital. A current account deficit is the other side of that equation. But it is important to keep that current account deficit down to a manageable size, and it is at the absolute upper edge of that at present. So reduction of the current account deficit was a very important element of the goals for which the budget had to be prepared. As well, it was important to try to maintain a low level of inflation; it was important to reassure financial markets that the government was committed to maintaining inflation ata lower rate. We have had two or three years now of remarkably low inflation, right at the lower end of that of the trading partners to which we compare ourselves. But it is important to maintain that low level of inflation, both because it improves our trading capacity, and also because it increases people's sense of personal security. If prices are not rising significantly, or rising only very slowly, the sense of personal economic security is enhanced. Also, if inflation is growing rapidly, there tend to be distributional consequences which had which are damaging. It was important too to try to reduce the budget deficit. It is appropriate to have budget deficits at times when the economy is in recession, but it is important at a time when the economy is growing strongly to reduce or eliminate that budget deficit, if that is possible. That is the appropriate countercyclical activity for govemments. When economies are booming, governments can go slower; when economies are in recession, the government should push the economy along. The economy is growing strongly at present; therefore the need for fiscal stimulus from the public sector is much reduced. It is also important to reduce the budget deficit so as to minimise the extent of public sector borrowing and therefore the extent of debt service that is required, because the larger the debt, the larger the interest payment the government has to make, and the fewer funds are available for all the other vital activities in which government is involved. It was also important to reduce the budget deficit, again to reassure the financial markets that the government intended to create conditions where interest rates could be kept as low as possible. Finally, it was important to stimulate growth of national savings. That is important, both because of the benefit of that to the current account and to interest rates, but also so that we have the resources available to build up both public and private investment, so as to facilitate more rapid and more wide ranging economic development. Australia has, like every other country, depended on its investment for its economic development. Savings are the basis for that. There are very strong reasons for giving savings particular attention in this budget, because the saving ratio has been far too low for some years. There are no doubt many causes for that, but the public sector is able to make a contribution to building up savings by minimising its own borrowing requirements. . Those were the goals which were required for the formation of a responsibJe budget. The government was also aware that an election is likely to be less than a year away and, therefore, it did not want to antagonise the electorate unnecessarily. So there were pretty tight economic and political criteria which had to be met in the preparation of the budget. I think the Treasurer has achieved that balance remarkably well. I will look first at the outlays side of the budget. I will then come to the revenue, and then discuss some of the outcomes. The most significant outlay and revenue decision was that relating to superannuation and the, - taxation cuts which were due in 1998. It seems to me that that foreshadowed revenue reduction in 1998 would have been entirely irresponsible. One of the requirements of effective fiscal policy is that there should be an adequate revenue base to proVide for recurrent outlays without borrowing. If Australia is to have an adequate defence system, education system, health system and community services of all kinds, and if it is going to care for the environment, support people when they are old, support children when they need child care, support the aged and so on - the massive number of tasks that the public sector undertakes-then there has to be an adequate revenue base. Australia is now one of the lowest taxed, well-off, industrialised countries. The level of revenue collected here is right at the bottom end of that of comparable countries which are members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-the OECD. In fact, amongst the OECD members, only Mexico and Turkey collect less of their national income in tax than does Australia. In that situation, and in a situation where there is clearly a great need for expansion of public services in many areas, it really. would have been irresponsible to go ahead with a further reduction in taxation in three years time. The government has very effectively found a way of ensuring that the benefit that would have accrued to people in 1998 has been made available, but in a much more economically responsible way. It has done so by withdrawing the tax cut and replacing it with an increase in support for superannuation. This means that lower and middle income people who are already contributing to their own retirement income through their employers' contribution to superannuation will now also receive a contribution from government to their accumulating savings for retirement. That will increase their income when they retire. That measure will also increase the total national savings by building up the amount of the total national income which is collected as superannuation ready for people's retirement. That is macro-economically responsible because it builds up the total level of savings, but it is also an equitable change because the tax cuts would have gone principally to middle and upper income earners, while the support for superannuation goes to lower and middle income earners. So we have a desirable macro-economic shift which is also an equitable shift. The budget has made a very valuable, vital contribution in that area. . The amount of money involved-$4Y2 billion in the first full year in which both changes would have operated-really is a very large amount of money and a very important decision has been made which lays a much sounder framework for continuing economic and social development in Australia. So I wholeheartedly welcome that change and congratulate the Treasurer and the other members of the cabinet who decided on that proposal for their imagination and their responsibility in deciding on it. As well as that, there is a whole series of other much smaller, but nevertheless very important, improvements in outlays which are of great benefit to the wider community. The most obvious is the introduction of a maternity allowance-an allowance that will be paid to every mother at the time of the birth of a child-to support those mothers at that time when their outlays are increased because of the addition of a family member. That is something that is very important in a comprehensive social security system. In a way it is surprising that it has not existed before. But at least it has now been introduced and, again, one can wholeheartedly congratulate the government for its sense of social responsibility in providing that support. There is a whole series of other smaller changes, many of which I would like to warmly welcome as well, and some of which are ones that I have actively campaigned for, so I am very glad to see them. Just going down the list as they appear in the budget, not necessarily in order of size or even of priority, I come first to the reference to the increased funding for research-research infrastructure. The effectiveness of economic development in any country depends to a very substantial extent on the originality and the initiative of its scientific researchers. Yet there is no doubt that many of our scientific organisations-CSIRO, universities, and others-have been finding difficulty in obtaining the equipment and facilities they need to expand their research programs as effectively as possible. So some additional funding for research infrastructure, to update that infrastructure, to ensure that it is fully accurate and the most modem available in the world, is crucial to the quality of that scientific research and is to be warmly welcomed. Similarly, also in the research area, there additional funding for medical research. A number of my constituents have been at me for years 0 try to get the government to increase funding for medical research. Australia has a particularly fine record intern ationally for the quality of our medical research. This increase is to be warmly welcomed and I would be astonished if anyone in the House did not agree. Some other changes that are very important include the increase in funding for vocational education. I would have liked that to be at a much higher level because, at the beginning of last year, 140,000 applicants for technical and further education could not get places. That is a national tragedy, because we want as skilled a work force as possible, we want everybody to have the opportunities that they need, and an increase in the number of places in TAPE colleges is vital. But at least a step was taken in the budget-in a tightly constrained budget-to increase funding for TAPEs so that more people can obtain places. A number of other very important initiatives are additional funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health programs, housing programs, and an increase in the guardian allowance, which is very important for people who are caring for others at home. There is some increase in funding for the Australian Film Finance Corporation and for a commercial television production. They may seem a bit more wide ranging, but I think we would all welcome support for Australian creativity in the arts and in film, both for cinemas and for television, which are vital parts of that. There is a program of increased outlays in the environment area. One part of that which I am particularly glad to see is the support for the biodiversity program. In Australia, a substantial number of our ecosystems are still not represented at all, or quite inadequately, in the protected area system. That means that the system of national parks and nature reserves needs to be expanded to ensure that all major Australian ecosystems are represented so that they can be preserved for all time. The only way of ensuring that is to have them in protected areas. This increase in funding for the biodiversity program will enable more is of those systems to be included in the national protected area systems. So there were some very important initiatives. By the way, another initiative on the environment was announced on Sunday, and that was support for coastal protection. Anyone who loves the surf, the sea and the sand will welcome that. . Such outlay programs have to be paid for. A couple of ways they can be paid for are by cuts in other outlays or by increases in revenue.One minor rescheduling of an outlay has made way for some· of those improvements. That is the rescheduling of some major defence .investments. That, of course, is entirely appropriate at a time .when Australia is, threatened by no-one and we already have a very large defence expenditure. Another area which could have been reduced but has 'not been is .that of the security !iervices. Our security services have not been significl:).ntly redu,ced since the end. of the Cold War. Yet tIiey were established as agents. for dealing with potential enemies during the Cold War, and it would be entirely appropriate to reconsider their role following the end of the Cold War, and to substantially reduce their outlays. In fact, their outlays have increased by about 300 per cent over the last 15 years, .and that is'very much more than they need. - But the mairi, way in which the increases in outlays and the, reduction in the deficit were funded. in this budget was through some rhinor, bur'important, 'changes to revenue. Apart from the withdrawal of the proposed tax cut in ,1998; ,the major ones were all equitable and .entirely 'appropriate. 'The biggest one was the small increase in the, company taX' rate, from 33 to 36 percent. At 36 per cent, it is still lower than in most cotnparabiecountries.""That is the kind of countercydical change which is appropriate atf time when ,the economy is growing sttonglY. It was important to reduce the deficit. It was important to have these small increases in outlays: Having some increase in the company tax rate was a very appropriate way to fund part of that. . ""Another step is an improvement iIi compli-nce activity on the part of the Australian Taxation Off-ce.EverYone in Australia will welcome attempts to ensure that tax minimisation,or tax avoidance, is stamped on. It is estimated that that increased and enhanced activity by the Australian Taxation Office will generate about $150 million a year. There were several other changes, all· of which were important. One which I particularly welcome is the small increase in the bank licence and supervision fee. All of those changes were very welcome. The outcome of the budget will be a reduction in unemployment, a stable inflation rate, greater equity and a smaller current account deficit. Those were the goals for which we were looking. I wholeheartedly congratulate the Treasurer and the cabinet on their success in carefully balancing revenue and outlays. (Time expired)",60
29,Mr STEELE HALL,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I am pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon during the debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1) to speak about a specific matter within the province of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), and that is the telecommunications installations that are being put up around Australia, in every member's district, to support the extension of the mobile phone network. This has caused a great deal of concern among members of the public .who have been affected by these installations. This has been expressed by several members of parliament in recent months this year. I refer to a release put out by Senator Bob Woods on 10 February 1995. I will quote several extracts from that release: The three mobile telephone carriers are continuing to ignore the rights of individual Australians in their rush to secure market-share and higher profits ""The Keating Government must share the blame for what is going on because it failed to put in place any meaningful regulations which could have properly controlled the mobile telephone networks ""But it is the companies themselves which have done everything possible to take advantage of the Government's irresponsibility by building basestations and towers virtually wherever they like. On 31 May 1994 Senator Reid gave notiCe of this motion in the Senate: That the Senate(a) condemns the Federal Government for breaching the integrity of the National Capital Plan by giving unique authority to telecommunications carriers Telecom, Vodafone and Optus to erect towers on Canberra's hilltops for use by their mobile phone networks; (b) deplores the fact that no consultation took place with the ACT Government ... There is a question on notice from the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) which lists nine matters concerning the installation of mobile telephone base stations in Australia. This is just a scan of interest shown by members of the Senate and this place about the installation of this equipment. The carriers are governed by the telecommunications national code. The first objective of that code is: (a) to facilitate the provision of efficient, modem and cost effective telecommunications service to the public . . . There are a number of other objectives. The last objective is: (e) to require carriers to be accountable to Government bodies and the public for their activities. Who is kidding whom here about the carriers being accountable to government bodies and the public for their activities when, in fact, they operate under exempt status? It is interesting to read the Telecommunications Act which allows the companies to so operate. Section 116(1) states: The regulations may provide that specified carriers may engage in specified exempt activities despite specified laws of a State or Territory. Regulation 5 of the Telecommunications (Exempt Activities) Regulations, which were brought in on 20 November 1991, lists in some detail the exempt activities in which the carriers can involve themselves. The first category of exempt activities includes the construction of structures, trenches, facilities, manholes, public payphones, structures whose principal purpose will be to contain equipment and so on. Secondly, they include the maintenance, repair, refurbishment, alteration or demolition by a carrier. The third category of exempt activities states: ... the installation, certification, nance, repair or removal by a carrier of any of the following that forms part of a carrier's public telecommunications network. It goes on to list a whole range of activities. Regulation 6 states: For the purposes of subsection 116(1) of the Act, a carrier may engage in the exempt activities set out in regulation 5 despite a law of a State or Territory ... How on earth can the code itself claim that one of the objectives is 'to require carriers to be accountable to government bodies and the public for their activities'? There is an absolute contradiction in the expression in the code that they shall be so bound, when the act and the regulations under that act extend to the companies a completely exempt status in those very activities. Whilst the code goes into great detail on how a plan must be prepared and made available to the public, the plan is to be made available without anyone's protest aboutthat plan being able to have any effect. The only authority over the plans of the carriers of the telecommunications equipment is held by the Secretary to the Department of the Environ-:ment, Sport and Territories. When one reads the code in its completest form, one finds that lots of plans must be made by the carriers. They must be presented to the council and made available to the forms of local and territory government and to the public for inspection at a reasonable cost. But anyone who wants toprotest can go, ultimately, only to the Secretary to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. There is no local authority. The council can say it does not want it as much as it likes. The state government departments can only give advice; they have no authority to challenge. The challerige can only go through to the secretary to the department. This claim that the public shall be taken note of and that the public must be able to inspect the plans falls to pieces when no-one other than"" the secretary to the department has any power to affect it. What did the minister say when he brought in this new code last year? A press release put out by the minister on 30 June last year operation, maintestates: A new Telecommunications National Code for Australia will require the carriers to consult more with local councils, relevant authorities and the Australian Heritage Commission on the location of mobile telephone towers, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Michael Lee, said yesterday. The carriers will now be subject to environmental requirements far more stringent than was previously the case. It continued: ... when a carrier and a local council were unable to resolve questions on the environmental impact of a proposed mobile facility site, the issue must be referred to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. That is the only avenue provided in the whole code' for any local person, councilor state government to protest effectively. It is the secretary to the department who will have the final say; no-one else. The minister has neglected the instructions he has under the Telecommunications Act. Whilst he has produced the telecommunications national code, subsection 127A(1) of the Telecommunications Act quite definitely states: l'he Minister must by writing determine a Land Access Codethis is in addition to the telecommunications national code already in existence-:. . . that does one or more of the following: (a) sets out procedures that carriers must follow in exercising powers under this Division relating to land; (b)' sets out procedures that carriers must follow in complying with obligations, under this Division ... (c) sets out procedures to be followed for consultation between owners or occupiers of land and carriers if there is disagreement . about: (i) a carrier exercising powers relating to land under this Division; or (ii) a carrier complying with obligations under this Division relating to owners or occupiers of land .., . It goes on further. But the overriding fact is that the act says not that the minister 'may determine a land access code', but that the minister 'must by writing determine a land access code that does one or more of the following'. My constituents, in framing their complaints against the installation and possible installation of these facilities, have found that no code exists. The department itself will tell you that no code exists. The Minister for Communications and the Arts has failed to observe the act which governs the operation of his department. That is a very important aspect and it shows how little the minister and the government care about those people out in the community who are affected by a possible loss of value of their property, by a loss of amenity and by environmental pressure on them by the installation of these facilities under the exempt regulations. The minister has neglected that code. In effect, the community is disenfranchised. No normal procedures are available to it to protest. The state government is muted and local government is a joke in relation to this code. As I said, only the secretary to the department of environment can have a final say on the discussions and disagreements on these installations. One other major factor is that Austel, as the overseeing body of telecommunications in Australia, has the power, as set out in subsection 38(2) of the Telecommunications Act. The subsection states: The functions of AUSTEL include protecting consumers from unfair practices of carriers and other persons in the supply of telecommunications services, the supply, installation or maintenance of customer equipment or the performance of cabling work and, for that purpose . . . Then it details a number of important subheadings. Two factors are the immediate supervision in dealing with protests under the code by the secretary to the department and, ' in the wider sense, seeing that carriers are fair to consumers. In other instances Austel has an overriding authority. None of this, as I have said, resides with the local people affected. The number of carriers has multiplied. We no longer have just Telecom. We have Vodafone and Optus. We have companies with a profit motive, which I do not in any way criticise. So they have a profit motive. I hate to think what slack efficiency they would be operating with if they did not have to produce a profit. They are there for profit. However, they operate with an exempt status. They can operate to the detriment of individual citizens or a collective group of citizens and do so exempt from the normal laws of the land, which is something very few others in this community can do. I understand there will be further deregulation in 1997. Further companies will be involved. Will they, too, have an exempt status? I ask members of the House whether these companies will be able to go along to someone and say, 'I'm going to put this in your backyard. You can't stop me.' They would have to pay compensation, of course. There are further provisions in the code that require compensation if people are hurt, but no compensation is available for environmental damage or for placing a facility next door to someone's property that may depress the value of that property. I mention the instance which has brought my concern to a head. It concerns the installation of a facility on top of the old Vogue Theatre at 25 Belair Road, Kingswood, which is in my district. This has been a disaster from start to finish. Optus is the installing company. Optus approached the council with its detailed plan, and the council approached one resident, who happened to live next to the theatre. It did not approach those in the district who could see this installation from the distance. The council failed absolutely in its duty. Because the code does not say the council has to notify citizens, it did not do its duty. The citizen who was approached had a death in the family a few days beforehand and did not take any notice of the notification. So the one resident the council did send a notification to ignored it, for logical reasons. In a letter to Optus dated 8 March this year, the council stated: Council, at its meeting of 3 January, resolved advise Optus that it has no comment to make regarding the proposal ... Yet, after all the protests came to a head, the council wrote back on 11 April to say the facility should be removed. This is the mess the council has got this scheme into. But of course it was not just the council that failed. Optus's plan as presented to the council was defective. The plan that was put to the council giving a perspective of the installation on top of the theatre included a scale which was faulty. In later protests about the size of the installation, the council measured the expected height on the plan with the scale provided and got 2.55 metres. The actual height of the installation is 3.9 metres. The plan, however-if you examine it without the scale-was correct with regard to the height and gave it as 3.6 metres. But no-one examining the plan would bypass the scale; you would use the scale. Those who used the scale got a wholly defective measurement. The width of the installation that has been put up is very much wider than the one that is on the plan. Optus and I have had a talk about this. It says that its plan, when examined, was truly drawn to scale-if you ignore the faulty scale provided with the plan-and does show an installation of 3.6 metres high. Optus says that the one installed is only 3.9 metres and the extension beyond the plan is not of great significance. But if you go by the scale, of course, it is very much greater than the scale produced. The width of the installation is the subject of further discussion and is much greater than the plan that was put in. The plan that was given to the building owner was quite defectiv-. It was drawn by a well-known firm of engineers and managers in Adelaide. The actual installation is 34 per cent higher than on the plan submitted to the building owner. The Optusmeasurement of the width is 4.4 metres; the council measures it as 6.36 metres. This is a disaster in all its forms. It is a disaster for the council because of its failure to notify ratepayers; it is a disaster from the company's point of view because its original plan to council had a faulty scale. The plan to given to the building owner was simply drawn wrongly. We have local protests and local people who are now furious because they believe that they have been tricked. This is simply not good enough. I know the code is to be overhauled. There must be dramatic changes in the code. There is no way that the community and thisparliament can tolerate the continuation of an exempt status for the three companies --:..or those companies that will join them after further deregulation-when they are putting their installations in for their final profit line. There is nothing wrong with that. I am not criticising the profit motive behind those companies, but I am saying that they cannot put with it the right to override nearly every normal planning authority and state authority in this community. It cannot happen. I have referred this mess to Austel. respectfully asked Austel to confirm or deny the measurements involved. If it is judged that the plan has not presented a proper picture the community it affects, Optus should reduce the size of the installation accordingly. The instance I referred to Austel is simply a peg on which to hang the greater question: what are we going to do with the overwhelma ing power that these companies now have, and how are we going to rein it in and give back to the local community the control of environment, its district and the amenities which are peculiar to it? If we do not do that, we will be setting an enormous precedent as companies in search of profit could ignore all the normal safeguards that the community has developed over a very long period of time.",63
30,Mr SNOWDON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Northern Territoryof the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories and increase Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (2.19 p.m.)-It gives me pleasure to participate this appropriations debate this afternoon a number of reasons. One is to applaud yet another good Labor budget, and a range of reasons. Whilst I have a great interest in the macro impact of the budget across the country, I have-as honourable members would be aware-a particular interest in the effects the· Commonwealth budget will have on the Northern Territory. This is because of my representational responyear sibilities to the Northern Territory. The first observation one would make that, yet again, the federal Labor government has ensured the maintenance of a strong underlying trend in growth for the Northern Territory economy, based principally on federal government outlays. This is a matter which is acknowledged within the Northern Territory's own budget papers, and I will come to that in a moment. What needs to be pointed out is that, through this recent budget, the federal government will provide $1.13 billion directly to the Northern Territory government's own revenue. In terms of the Northern Territory government's budget papers, that is around 75 I have per cent of the revenue on an economic transaction basis. The average Commonwealth contribution to the state and territory econoto mies is 55 per cent. So the Commonwealth is appropriating 20 per cent more money to the Northern Territory than it is to the other states and territories, and that is for a very good reason. It is primarily as a result of the recognition within the budget process-and as result of Grants Commission processes-of the cost of delivering services to remote Australia and to a community which is sparseits ly populated and has a high level of need. It is worth noting that the Northern Territory government's budget papers point out the very positive outcomes from this year's Premiers Conference and Loan Council meetings. First we saw advances in the Northern Territory's real per capita indexation financial assistance grants pool, which the is responsible for about $38 million of the in the Northern Territory's financial assistance grants; and, secondly, the adoption of the updated per capita relativities recomin mended by the Commonwealth Grants Comfor mission, with the higher relativity for the territory resulting in an $8 million increase in it is good for the grants share. I use those figures to underline the importance to the Northern Territory of the federal government's outlays, and this budget in particular. We have seen an increase of around 3.6 per cent in net Commonwealth payments to the Northern Territory for the 1995-96. That is something which I think is acknowledged implicitly in the Northern is Territory government's own budget papers. What is not acknowledged in the Northern Territory's budget papers is the additional resources that were appropriated out of the Commonwealth budget and into the Northern Territory through the various portfolio arrangements. I want to emphasise this point: we have seen an absolute commitment by this federal Labor government year in year out to providing the basis for the Northern Territory's economy. That is becoming very obvious, and I will demonstrate that very clearly when I talk about the Northern Territory government's own budget. This year, on top of the $1.13 billion worth of grants to the Northern Territory government, the Northern Territory is getting a huge commitment of defence capital works worth in excess of half a billion dollars-$561 million to be exactstarting with $92.5 million in the next 12 months. There is absolutely no doubt at all that this program guarantees a very solid base. In fact, it underpins the construction industry in the Northern Territory-certainly in the Top End. It will maintain this solid base for the next five years. It is no accident that in the urban areas of the Northern Territory-particularly in Darwin and Katherine, where the Defence Force presence is the most obvious-the unemployment rate is the lowest we have seen. In those areas it is about four per cent. But we know that there are significant skill shortages in the building and construction industry. Whilst we are very pleased to have this capital injection into the Northern Territory economy, what we never hear from the CLP government in the Northern Territory is an absolute acknowledgment of the benefits that are derived by the Northern Territory economy generally from these expenditures. However, I noticed in this year's budget papers that there was some slight acknowledgment of the importance of the capital works expenditure, and that is welcome. It is interesting that around election time we do not hear the CLP ministers in the Northern Territory coming out and acknowledging or supporting the role that the Labor government has played in underpinning the Northern Territory government's economy, in ensuring that there is growth and in ensuring that we have a vital construction industry. Whilst there has been a massive national injection of Defence Force moneys, in this last budget we saw an additional allocation of $15.6 million for roads in the Northern Territory over the next three years primarily to address the concerns of Aboriginal communities which have not been properly addressed by the Northern Territory government budget, which is responsible for supplying resources for these roads. This additional allocation came about as a result of my colleagues the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and Senator Bob Collins and me. That is just another small area of capital outlays. Also, the growth of the Northern Territory University is totally due to contributions from the federal government. Whilst there has been a dramatic increasewe have seen increases in outlays for Aboriginal health and Aboriginal infrastructure resulting from this budget-we have not seen a similar effort being made in the Northern Territory. Whilst we have seen this growth in capital outlays from the Commonwealth government for its own purposes or through the Northern Territory government's own budget, the Northern Territory has just brought down a budget which has been described by some commentators as providing the steepest tax increase by any state, territory or Commonwealth government for at least the last 15 years. As well as increasing taxes markedly, the Northern Territory government as recently as a couple of weeks ago when it brought down its budget imposed a maximum increase in housing commission rentals of $1,140 for particular types of housing. That will be a dramatic impost on people in the Northern Territory, The Northern Territory government has increased bus fares and water and sewerage charges. There is also a fire levy of $180 per house. It is increasing tobacco tax, wine tax, car purchase duty, petroleum tax and car registration. Those taxes alone add $493 to a family's account. One assessment is that, if people in the Northern Territory who will be hit with the maximum increase in housing commission rentals took their fair share of the other taxes which are being applied or increased, the Northern Territory government would be getting another $1,783 from their pocket. We might think that this is a government that thinks about social justice, but the people it is hitting hardest by these revenue raising measures are the poorest people in the community. There has been a dramatic injection of capital funds into the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth government. Is it not remarkable that in the recent Northern Territory budget it has decreased its own expenditure on capital works by around 20 per cent? I am sure the Northern Territory community will come to an adequate conclusion about what this means for them. It emphasises for us the relative importance of the Commonwealth government's budget and outlays to the Northern Territory economy. As we are increasing our capital expenditure it is decreasing its. The Commonwealth government outlays will have a tremendous impact on the Northern Territory community. Mr Bruce Scott interjecting",67
31,Mr SNOWDON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I make it very clear to the member for Maranoa that when the federal government introduced the policy of moving the army to northern Australia it was opposed by the opposition. I recall the opposition spokesperson opposing that move at that time. If it were not for the federal Labor government this expenditure would not take place. So let us not have any bull dust from you that you are part of this process, because you are not. If it were not for the initiatives of the federal Labor government, the Northern Territory economy would be an absolute basket case. That is acknowledged by all but those members of the CLP. My colleague opposite should ask his National Party colleague in the Senate who masquerades as a CLP representative from the Northern Territory whether or not he thinks that the federal government's budget outlays underpin the Northern Territory's economy and ensures that the Northern Territory has low unemployment and a growing university. What is not understood by those opposite is that the CLP speaks with a forked tongue and is absolutely dishonest when it comes to representing the interests of the Northern Territory. It is dishonest when it comes to accepting and acknowledging the importance of this Labor government to the continuing growth in the Northern Territory economy and the security of those people in the Northern Territory who have jobs. Some 75c in every dollar spent by the Northern Territory government comes from the federal government. Some 75 per cent of every public servant's wage comes from the federal government and that does not include the public servants whose wages are paid directly by the Commonwealth. We know the spin-off effect on small business. There is not one small business person in the Northern Territory who does not understand the significance of these Commonwealth government outlays and the multiplier effects that they have in the local economy. They know where the money comes from. They recognise that there would not be a building industry if it had not been for the federal Labor government. They understand that there would not be strong growth in the local economy and unemployment would not be low if it were not for the federal Labor government. They understand all these things, but they are not acknowledged by the CLP. What the CLP does-and we have an example of this with the local budget-is wreak havoc on the Northern Territory community by imposing massive increases in taxes and charges on every Northern Territory family. That is quite different from the approach that has been adopted by this government. That provides a very good demarcation between the attitudes of a very progressive, committed Labor government and a very conservative CLP government in the Northern Territory. This is what we would see if those opposite were in government. They have made all these grandiose claims, but we have not seen their policy framework. We know that they would say that there would be no increases in taxes and that there would be tax cuts for their favourites at the top end of town. Those opposite would have to massively cut government outlays. If they massively cut government outlays, who would suffer? It would be the people of the Northern Territory that would suffer. There could not be a greater contrast between the policies and programs which have been espoused by the opposition in the past and the policies and programs we anticipate it would tell us about-if it had any new policies-were it to be in government. We know what those in the opposition are saying. On the public record they have said, 'We're going to have no tax increases.' So the revenue base will be fixed but they will provide tax cuts to particular groups of people. We know that they are going to massively cut government outlays, which will affect the lives of every Northern Territory person. I have already mentioned the issue of capital works. The other interesting thing about the ern Territory's own budget, despite the fact that 75 per cent of it comes from the federal Labor government, and as a result of its own measurements, is that the per capita debt level of the Northern Territory community is rising because of the mismanaged Northern Territory economy. Despite the massive outlays from outlays. the federal Labor government, the Northern Territory government has mismanaged its own economy and increased the per capita debt level from $8,124 on 30 June 1994 to $8,570 on 30 June 1995. The highest per capita debt level in Australia resides in the Northern Territory as a result of the Northern Territory government's policies. That level of $8,570 for every Northern Territory person compares with an Australian state average of $4,094. Who was responsible for the gross misin management of the Northern Territory omy? It was the CLP-that is, the conservabudget, tive party colleagues of the member for Maranoa, who is sitting opposite. They are the people who would like to take governgovernment. ment from us. Time and time again they have aptly demonstrated that they have absolutely no idea about economic policy. Despite the reliance on federal government outlays, can see that they have managed to build debt levels to $8,570 per head. The Northern Territory government has built up those debt levels because of bad policy and poor ex- (Time expired) penditure. It is also worth pointing out that, despite the increases in the educational outlays by this federal Labor government in its last budget, the Northern Territory's educational performance is abysmal. Because the particition. pation rates in its schools are the lowest in Australia bar none, and because those rates are getting worse, there has been a three per cent decrease in educational expenditure in the Northern Territory's budget. If things are so important to the Northern Territory government, and if it is concerned about and committed to social justice in the Northern Territory, why would it cut expenditure in education by three per cent when the federal government's own allocations to the Northern Territory for education have increased? What is the explanation? That state Northgovernment will not go around saying, 'I'm sorry we've cut educational outlays.' It will not even tell you it has cut educational outlays. It will not tell you what the impact will be on Aboriginal communities where, if you are lucky, one in 10 have the chance to get to year 12. But we know it has cut educational Whose responsibility is that? Is it this government's responsibility? No, it is not this government's responsibility but it demonstrates yet again what would happen if our conservative colleagues opposite occupied the treasury bench. They would not care where they cut their funds or allocations. We know that the poorest people, the most disadvantaged people, of the community, bar none, are the Aboriginal people in remote communities the Northern Territory. They are the people econwho will suffer the most from this CLP despite the fact, as I have said time and time again, that the bulk of the Northern Territory's revenue comes from the federal Those in the Northern Territory government have built up this debt problem. It is solely their responsibility, no-one else's. They have we cut their own cloth. They have made the up decisions. They have determined how they will spend this money and, as a result, the Northern Territory community is suffering.",69
32,Mr CAMERON,ASSENT TO BILLS,"It gives me enormous pleasure to speak on made Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1995-96. The budget we are debating will ensure that the coalition wins government at the next elecIt will ensure we win because it is mere confirmfl,tion that the government is full of dishonesty, bereft of any ideas and lacking in commitment to our nation to make the right decisions. I will make sure that I enjoy this moment because it is the last speech on the budget 1 will be making from this side of the House. Since my election, all we have seen from thisgovetnment is lie after lie after lie. It made many promises at the last election, but it has kept very few. In the 1993 election campaign, we heard the Prime 11inister (11r Keating) make that George Bush like quoteremerriber George Bush saying, 'Read my lips: no new taxes.' 11r Keating said, in the course of the last election campaign: They are not a promise'they' being the tax cutsThey are law-L.A.W - Iaw. And the difference between a legislative tax cut and some Opposition speaker's manifesto is all the world of difference As one of my constituents suggested to me, 'law? must stand for 'lie and win' in the Keating dictionary. Labor's campaign at the last election was more than economical with the truth, and the budgets it has presented since, which have been awfully detrimental to families, have proven its· dishonesty and illegitimacy. This government is well known for its pork-barrelling and kow-towing to minority but vocal lobby groups. One group it· aiways fails to recognise is the silent majority-the family. This budget, when looked at in the context of a family's budget, does very little, if anything, to assist families; Sure, the government has introduced the maternity allowance. That comes in in about nine months, probably around election time.· It could otherwise be called a baby bribe. I have been contacted by one constituent who has put this scenario to me: what of those in a lower socio-economic group who, looking at the $816 payment as a good one-off bonus, decide to have a child for the money and are then faced with the prospect of ever after bills as a result of that child? I know that is a politically incorrect view, but I do not particularly care about that. The fact is-and this has been told to me by a financial counsellor in my electorate-people have children for the additional family payment, and the maternity allowance will be an incentive to have a child, irrespective of the future financial hardship that could be endured by that particular family. Speaking very close to home, my daughter's husband is on a pretty average sort of wage. She says to me, 'Dad, how can it be in this lucky country that friends of ours with two children are better off on social security benefits and the husband goes surfing all day? They actually pick up more money than someone who is prepared to work in the work force.' That is a result of this appalling government that we have had for too long. I am not opposed to a maternity allowance per se, but. I think it needs better planning and careful consideration so that it is used correctly and not seen as an incentive to have a child. Children should be wanted as loved offspring, not as an extra source of revenue. Another claim of the government is that the rent assistance increase has been increased to support families. This is given to recipients without any concern for what is done with the assistance. I have been contacted by landlords and property managers who know their tenants are in receipt of the rent assistance, but they do not receive any rent and are forced to evict the tenants. The fact of the matter is that there should be more accountability of those welfare payments. If one is given rent assistance to subsidise rent, it should be ensured that it goes to rent and not alcohol, cigarettes or anything else. 11y suggestion, again politically incorrect, is that rent assistance should go direct to the landlord or property manager or given in the form of a voucher. That would ensure that landlords are not ripped off. It would assist lower income earners in paying their rent and would keep those families under a roof, with fewer financial problems. That would ultimately keep families closer, rather than divide them as happens when they are confronted with financial difficulties. I welcome, with reservation, the pilot family service centres. Hopefully, it is not going to be a centre which only tells families what benefits are available but will provide budgeting advice and assistance with child rearing and so on. Many initiatives of this government, under the guise of supporting families, have been to offer a payment or a benefit to them. At the last election the government suggested that the coalition would cut all these different benefits. It was not true of course, but that has never bothered the government too much. It made the claims to encourage people to vote Labor. It treats people on handouts like breastfed babies, only the government does not want to wean them off. The government is of the opinion that if one is in receipt of a government handout one is therefore reliant on the government and the Labor Party and will therefore keep voting Labor. Such a view is against the will and principles of mainstream Australia, but Labor cares little for them, only for electoral success. So it uses the hard-earned taxes of Australians to buy votes, irrespective of the impact on OUf economy, on our debt, the detrimental effect it has on our social fabric, or any other effect. Families do not need governments telling them how to live, how to bring up their kids, which parent should work, whether both parents should work or whatever. This government, however, is ever so keen to be a part of every family and in most cases wants to be the head of the house. It wants to tell families what is right and what is not right. With the many benefits, allowances and so forth, why could the government not give the promised tax cuts? The unemployed, pensioners and low income earners could still get their benefits but those who are earning a dollar should be assisted not through benefits or payments but through tax cuts. Remaining on the topic of families, one of the things absent from this budget and which I will be looking to encourage in the next coalition government is that with each budget a family impact statement should be included. Indeed, a family impact statement should be prepared not just for budgets but for many other pieces of legislation. We have environmental impact statements, so what is wrong with having a family impact statement? The family is, I should remind the House, the cornerstone of our Australian society. I believe it is around the family unit that every budget and every piece of legislation should be framed. Too often we have legislation introduced, sometimes with good intent, other times without, but which, whatever its intentions, does nothing for families. It does not consider the impact on them. It does not reflect their desires or aspirations or concerns. There is no reflection on how legislation or budgets' actually affect the husbands and wives and children in a personal sense. I know we cannot have a statement explaining everything, but a family impact statement honestly presented would tell us a bit more about how the budget directly impacts on families, rather than offering us a book full of figures, percentages, graphs and tables. In that way it brings us back to reflecting on how we can ensure that the budgets that are brought down and the legislation that is introduced are family oriented. I know the government released a report entitled An agenda for families, but that is not a family impact statement; it does not explain the effects of the budget on the family or the cost of the budget to the average family; it simply regurgitates the glossy bribes of the budgetbribes, I might add, which are not necessarily conducive to supporting the family structure. I get so many letters to my office from mothers, fathers and homemakers asking me: 'Why can't the government balance its budget? Why do the homemakers have to tighten their belts when the government does not? Why do we have to balance our books week after week when the government does not - et an example and do the same?' This is another example of how the budget does not reflect the pressures on families. The government's budget must take a global perspective and consider international trends, developments and influences, but at the same time it should also be brought down for Australians, both individuals and families alike. My suggestion to the Treasurer, thereforeit may sound condescending but I still think it is worth trying-is this: when framing· the next budget, why not sit down with a dozen homemakers, people who know they have to balance their budgets, and seek some advice from them-go through every item of expenditure, explain it and its purpose and see whether they agree with it? If they know they cannot overspend they won't and they don't. Their advice would help the government in formulating its budget.· They would not, for example, give $10 million to the trade union movement to train Labor hacks. This budget gives $10.1 million to the Australian Trade Union Training Authority. Between this budget and the 1998drive 99 budget, $46.3 million will go to the authincreased ority which, to quote the budget paper, is established 'to develop, deliver and provide assistance in relation to the training of officials and members'. If the government were advised by homemakers, who know the difficulties of balancing household budgets, the union movement would not get a cent and would be expected to earn its own. funds through membership acquired through proper representation, which it appears to have forgotten all about. Taxpayers should not the union movement, particularly in view of its allegiance to the Labor Party. Essentially iUs the Labor Party giving taxpayers' money to the union movement to funnel back to the Labor Party. Having said that, I will go back to my point about having a table of advisers of homemakers to assist in giving the budget a family perspective and ensure that the budget does not go off the track, is not inhuman and meets the challenges faced by households, that is, balancing the budget and not needing to sell the crockery to pay for the groceries, as have seen this time around. It is but another lies. way of de-bureaucratising the budget, giving ita human touch and getting away from the ivory tower approach which underpins this government and its decisions. Having said that families should be the central focus of budget, I will tum to how families fare in budget and how they have fared since the last election. At the last election families were promised tax cuts. As I said previously, the Prime Minister said that the tax cuts were law-I-aw, law. These were the One Nation tax cuts that were promised. Remember the One Nation statement? The government said to the people of Australia, 'We'll give you tax cuts without a GST.' Now we have Labor's GST-and no tax cuts. Look at the other ways in which the Labor government has hit families since the last election. It has increased the price of petrol, with leaded fuel going up more than unleaded fuel. It has done this while forgetting the fact that low income families, the people who did not get any tax cuts, are the ones who often the cars needing leaded petrol. It has the fringe benefits tax, a business tax which is passed onto the consumers. It has increased sales tax across the board. That has union increased the price of items such as fruit juice, ice-cream, biscuits and flavoured milk. It also has increased the price of items such as toilets, bathroom fittings, hot-water systems, blinds, furniture, carpets, stoves, dishwashers, and so on. Those items go onto the price of a home or onto renovations. To make matters worse, this budget applies fund the 12 per cent wholesale sales tax onto building materials. This government is taxing the great Australian dream out of the hands of young Australians. How will young families ever get a start when you tax the price of houses out of their reach? Housing prices are going through the roof simply to pay for your various bribes, which are being held out in a cheap and desperate attempt to hold onto office. One of the major goals of every single family is home ownership. It is the great of Australian dream. This Labor government is taxing the great Australian dream out of the we reach of young Australians and young famiHonourable members know that one of the major causes of family break-up is financial difficulties. This added tax burden on the family home, coupled with the government's the other tax increases, undelivered tax cuts or this forced unemployment as a result of the government's policies, will not keep families together but force them apart. Also in this budget we have had the Medicare levy rise by another 0.1 of one per 712, REPRESENTATIVES cent, having previously increased from 1.25 per cent to 1.4 per cent. This means that families will pay more for health care. But there is no sign of falling hospital waiting lists and no sign of incentives for families to utilise private health insurance-only a bigger threat to a crumbling health system, and that is bad news for families. Relating this back to the family impact statement, one must ask: how many children are on hospital waiting lists; how many mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers are waiting for elective surgery which they cannot have because they are not privately insured and must wait because Medicare is not working for them? The government has increased the Medicare levy; it will cost people another $30-odd per year but will do nothing to fix the fundamental problems associated with Medicare. How in any families are still suffering because our health system leaves them on an endless waiting list? There has also been an increase in the tobacco excise. I do not like smoking; if the government wants to end smoking, why not support and assist the Western Australian health minister to outlaw smoking? But the fact is that this excise increase was another dishonest tax increase on those who can least afford it. As I say, I do not like smoking and I will always discourage it. But that tax measure still hits the hip-pocket nerve of a great many families in Australia. There is also the increase in the company tax rate. This will rise by three per cent. At the last election, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), who at that stage was a candidate, wrote to the electors. When referring to our trade figures, he stated: These things can be helped by our commitment to reduce the company tax rate from 39% to 33% However, he did not go on to say, 'But after the election, we're going to raise it again.' Either the member for Perth misinformed his electorate or he was misinformed by the Treasurer, because in this budget the company tax rate has gone up. Since the last election, this government has been one of dishonesty, duplicity and fraud.",70

35,Mr GEAR,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Lies, lies, lies.  going to put a capitalgaihs tax on 'your home'-scaring all the families and home owners of ,<\ustralia. Of. course, what happened at the election? I must say, the lie bit both. There was con'cern that we would db that and, secondly, the promised taX cuts were withdrawn. I think this has been a very good budge't I think the concern from the opposition about this budget rests in a number of areas. Firstly, we have taken the budget out of defiCit and into surplUS. Any member on the government side looking across at the opposition members when the Treasurer (MrWillis) made that announcement would have observed how stunned opposition members were. I must say, it caught one or two government members by surprise. It has been an outstanding, effort to get a $12 billion turnaround in government expenditure that the surplus of $712-odd million represents. You will notice when we are discussing the government's budget that the opposition members are not saying, 'We think it is a bad budget,' or a good budget, or whatever, but, 'This is where the opposition stands. This is what the opposition will do.' What are you going to do about surpluses? Are you going to say that you could have done better, that you will do better than the $3.5 billion surplus in public expenditure in the following year or the $7 billion surplus in the year after that? What are your policies? Where will they lead us? Are the people you spoke up in favour and support of not entitled to know what you stand for? Is the essence of a lack of integrity not dishonesty-the fact that you are not prepared to say what you stand for? The people of Australia know what this government stands for. We stand for a surplus, a surplus this year of over $700 million, $3.5 billion in the following year and then $7 billion. The people of Australia know that we stand behind the working men and women of Australia in superannuation. We have absolutely transformed the graveyard of superannuation that you left us. Superannuation was the purview of the public servants and a rort for the rich; ordinary working class men had none and superannuation for women was absolutely non-existent. Today in superannuation funds there are, because of this government, $180 billion of savings that will help families in their retirement. With the initiatives in this budget, they will rise to $500 billion by the tum of the century and to $2,000 billion in 20 years time. What is your position on superannuation? Where do you stand on superannuation? We know your record; you have done absolutely nothing. The people of Australia know where we stand on interest rates as a result et. They have dropped, of course. What are your policies and what impact will they have on interest rates? What impact will they have on people who are already employed? Will you add to unemployment? I think when members of the opposition talk about dishonesty and a lack of integrity, they ought to have the decency to stand up and tell the people of Australia the policies the opposition has and what is in it for the ordinary people of Australia. In this debate the opposition is unable to say absolutely anything because it has not announced any policies. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, the opposition is a policy free zone. As far as western Sydney is concerned, I am delighted with the initiatives of the government in proposing that we should have an international airport at Badgerys Creek. Mr Horne-It will take the noise away from Bennelong.  easy way to take away the noise from Bennelong, and the Australian people will have that opportunity at the next election.",74

37,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. Is it not a fact that, under the Labor government, social justice means real wages falling by 0.4 per cent; two-income families $23 a week worse off over the last 12 years in real terms, even after rebates and family payments; unemployment in the western areas of Sydney and Melbourne at over 13 per cent; home loan repayments taking 27 per cent of median incomes compared with only 19 per cent in 1983; and, finally, the poorest five per cent of Australian suburbs-those where the battlers of Australia live-have seen real incomes fall 23 per cent while the richest five have seen their incomes of this budgrise by 23 per cent?",75
38,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition puts forward a picture which is a comprehensive set of distortions, of course. If you look at what has happened over the 12year period to which you refer, real household disposable incomes have risen by 40 per cent; the value of the social wage provisions targeted to people on low incomes has improved out of sight; pensions have risen in real terms by around 12 per cent; assistance to low income families has increased by around 150 per cent in real terms for families with children in the 13 to 15 age group and by 75 per cent for those with children in younger age categories; and so on. Levels of employment have also improved enormously over that period. The Leader of the Opposition also included in his question this claim that the typical family is $27 a week",75
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Twenty-three today; different families.,76
40,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whatever figure you are quoting. I am talking about your most recent press release, claiming that they are $27 a week worse off after you take into account tax and rebates. That calculation is an utter distortion for a whole variety of reasons. The principal point, I suppose, is that it completely fails to take into account that, over the last 12 years under the accord framework, we have had an explicit trade-off between social wage and money wage rises. What does that social wage translate into? In a recent paper the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra estimated the value of social wage benefits provided through health, housing, child care and education as worth $195 per week on average for a two-child family. If you look at what has changed over that 12-year period, I have had some estimates done which show that that social wage component is two to three times greater now than it was in 1982 under the coalition. There has been an increase of at least $100 a week in real terms in the value of those social wage provisions-health, housing, education and child care. If you take child care, the number of places has grown over that period from 46,000 to 263,000. Education participation rates have increased from around 36 per cent completing year 12 to around 80 per cent now. You can translate those into dollars for typical families with children. Any analysis which fails to take account of that is completely misleading. The figuring on which the opposition leader based his payment does not include the fact that, since the introduction of Medicare, people are not having to pay private health insurance. Mr Costello-You can say that again.",76
41,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is an obvious substitution of the introduction of the Medicare levy for a substantial amount of private health insurance. The calculation that the opposition leader referred to in his press release was completely wrong. It just attempted to do a calculation of the tax liability of families. Any increase in the tax liability is, at least in part, a consequence of the fact that their actual incomes have increased quite significantly. The reality is that disposable incomes have increased.",76
42,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They haven't; they have fallen.,76
43,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Your figuring is completely inaccurate. But, apart from that, as I said, it totally fails to take account of at least $100 worth of social wage improvements per week. These social wage improvements have been delivered by this government within the framework of the accord and mean real tangible benefits to families. These are precisely the sorts of programs that the opposition would cut to shreds were it to be elected to government. If it is going to cut billions of dollars off government outlays, it is talking about hacking into precisely those education, health, housing and child-care programs which have delivered such substantial benefits to middle income and low income families. If it is talking about low income families in particular, the real value of that safety net has been improved out of sight. The interpretations that have been put on the Gregory paper by the Leader of the Opposition and others are completely misleading. They overwhelmingly show a compositional change in the sorts of people being admitted to public housing estates. I can go on about that in detail if you like, but there is no argument that the safety net directed to low income Australian families has improved enormously under this government. Unlike you, we make real improvements in these payments. Unlike you, we do not cut the real value of pensions as you did in your very first budget in 1978. The whole pattern under us has been to substantially improve these payments and we are continuing· that pattern through the introduction of the maternity allowance and further improvements in social security transfers and in social wage components. Industrial Relations",76
44,Mr CLEELAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations .. Can the minister outline to the House what is included in the safety net under the federal Industrial Relations Act? Is the minister aware of alternative industrial relations approaches that adopt a different interpretation of the safety net?,77
45,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the House that, under the government's industrial relations reform act, the safety net underpinning bargaining includes all existing federal award conditions as well as national minimum standards based upon our ILO treaty obligations. These minimum entitlements guarantee all workers access to a fair minimum wage, equal pay for work of equal value, 12 months unpaid parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal. In the bargaining process under our act, there is scope for employees to voluntarily trade some conditions so long as the Austrah Ian Industrial Relations Commission is convinced that workers are not worse off in total-not worse off in· the end result. That, of course, is the no disadvantage test. We know that that test is absolutely fundamental in terms of providing a guaranteed safety net for employees in the federal system. The existence of that comprehensive safety net-a safety net that will be regularly updated-is the major reason why the federal government has been so much more successful than any of the state jurisdictions in the development, encouragement and making of enterprise bargains. We have proven, quite conclusively, that, as long as employees have the protection provided by our system, they can engage in bargaining, secure in the knowledge that they will not be worse off in the result. Under the federal coalition, it is fair to point out that they would enjoy no such protection. Although, of course, in most areas they are nothing but a detail desert, we do know that the coalition's Jobsback policy will remain largely as it was for the last three elections.",77
46,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Another policy area.,77
47,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do you deny that? No, of course not. The opposition leader continually says that Jobsback is alive and well. Mr Richard Evans-Sit down, Laurie.",77
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Cowan.,77
49,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition tried to reassure the public by saying that under him there would be an optout provision, not an opt-in provision. If we look at it and analyse it, we find that all it does is take us back to the 1990 version of J obsback, right back to where we were a couple of elections ago. It is a version where employees can allegedly choose to stay on their award, but, like everything else the Leader of the Opposition does, there is a big hitch. That hitch is this: the award is never updated over time. The award is frozen for ever more and there is no provision for updating it. Where is the safety net for all the new employees or for anyone who changes his or her job? They find themselves not with any award protection but with the four miserly minimum conditions contained in Jobsback. As the opposition leader has made clear, all that workers will have statutory protection for is the minimum hourly wage, 12 months unpaid maternity leave, four weeks annual leave and two weeks non-cumulative sick leave-end of story. That is Jobsback 1990 style. This is what the opposition leader really meant yesterday when he said that under the coalition there will be a proper safety net. This is exactly the sort of safety net that he envisages. Obviously, as far as he is concerned, entitlements such as penalty rates, leave loadings, restrictions on working hours, shift allowances, skills supplements or family leave will not be part of his proper safety net-not on your nelly. I dare say that the battlers, whom the opposition leader says he wants to help, see it just a little differently. He is certainly guaranteeing them a very great battle for wages. There is no doubt about that. The families he is fond of talking about might look at him just a little differently when see him mugging the conditions of the very families that he says he is there to protect. In the end, it does not matter whether opposition has an opt-in or opt-out provision. That will not mean anything to those ple-nothing whatsoever. What they will understand is that the opposition still intends Brand. to take the machete to their award safety net and cut it to pieces, destroying in the process their entitlements to protection against unfair Mayo. dismissal. I conclude by saying this time will be the same as before: Australian workers not have a bar of it. Building Costs",77
50,Mr CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed wait to the Minister for Finance. My question is behalf of Mr Neeley of Bentley. Minister, you will recall that suburb is part of your electorate-or at least until you bailout. Mr Neeley has signed a contract to purchase a new home. Yesterday he received notification variation telling him that, because of the government's tax increase on the family clause home, the price of his house is going up. Neeley has a two-week-old baby, and he is battling to afford this new tax on his home, which he is contractually committed to. Minister, why should new home buyers, particularly young families and home renovanear tors, be hit with this tax on the great Australimpost Ian dream? Do you acknowledge that jobs will be lost as a result of this tax? Will government reconsider this shonky, dishonest and pernicious impost on the great Australian dream?",78
51,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me get this right: is that the so-called shonky, dishonest impost about which your Treasury spokesman has said that if the Senate passes it the opposition will leave it in place? Is that the shonky impost that those opposite have decided to keep in place?

Education , M- JENKINS-My question is directed to the Minister, for Employment, Education, an(i Training. Can the minister inform the House of the recentcoopetative developm'ents between tlle Commonwealth, the states and the territories- regarding education and' training?",78
56,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed significant progress was made in two ministerial council meetings last week with my state counterparts and the state counterparts of the Minister for Schools,' Vocational - Education and Training. I must say that this is not normally the case from ministerial. councils. It is usually very diffieult to get the cooperation of the states, but on this occasion we developed a new approach: to have meetings directly with the ministers, without officials. Some significant progress was made in that regard. The two most important issues of note are, first, thecommitmel)t of the states to support the eq,ucation network Australia. Members his might recall that this was an initiative announced in the budget. 'What the states have in done is to support the development of this netw()rk. Essentially, what it will do will be to link schools, TAFEcolleges and universities around the country. The huge potential that comes from all states agreeing to go to the ,table with the Commonwealth on this is that it gives us the critical mass to get the costs down; to get the !:lccess reach away from just. urban centres to include the regional centres, and to provide a much more effective in market for product going into the network. In essence,' this.is about using the information have superhighway to meet our education and training needs.' , The seco,nd important area is Aboriginal education, Despite some important progress iIi this area in the last few years, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are' still the most disadvantaged in our community when it comes to, amongst other things, education of needs. This is an' intolerable position. What we have done is' to secure an 'agreement' from ihestates to increase our' effort in this regard, in particular, in relation to preschools, literacy and the extension of the Aboriginal education workers network. The Commonwealth announced, in the budget that it was prepared to commit additional financial resources to meet these objective- if the states also provided resources. The states have agreed to progress down that path, and bilateral negotiations will commence from the week after next. I am hopeful, from the agreement that we have reached in principle; that funding in the areas mentioned will 'be available from the beginning of next year. Other important areas of cooperation involve commitment to the civics program, enterprising education in schools-an importantinitiative arising recently from the Karpin report-a tertiary admission system and a commitment to support the ANTA growth funds, which again the Commonwealth announced in the recent budget. This is a very good example of how this government can get the cooperation of the states; that is, by giving the lead and by being prepared to commit resources. All we hear from the other side is criticism of these initiatives, or silence. All I am saying is that the opposition's counterpart ministers-that is, those who are in government in conservative states-want to get on and cooperate. I wish from time to time there would be some recognition of that progress from the other side of the House. Self-funded Retirees",79
57,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. The minister will be aware that battling self-funded retirees will lose their legislated l-a-w tax cuts from 1 January next year. Is it the case that self-funded retirees do not get 'any benefit from the superannuation tax changes for 1998, since those changes apply only to people in the work force? Will the minister therefore confirm that battling self-funded retirees were dudded by the government's recent budget?",80
58,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Self-funded retirees, along with a lot of other people, were beneficiaries of the first tranche of tax cuts which were delivered by the government. Aside from that, the changes that have been announced that affect retirement incomes in this budget provide enormous benefits. If opposition members are talking about self-funded retirees, they will notice that a very high proportion of people receiving the pension nowadays, particularly new entrants to the pension system, also derive their income from other sources-from superannuation, pensions and investments. They will be very major beneficiaries from the changes that we have announced to the income testing arrangements for pensioners. It will mean that quite a few people who achieve rates of return in excess of the deeming rates we will be introducing under our new deeming system will be able to attain pensions in circumstances where they would not otherwise be able to do so. Consequently, a class of people will derive significant benefits from that. Apart from that, over the last few years the government has introduced a number of significant benefits for non-pension retireesfor example, the introduction of the seniors health card, which provides significant assistance to non-pensioner retirees on comparatively low incomes. We have extended the availability of pensioner fringe benefits to all part rate pensioners. This is obviously providing a lot of benefit to people who derive significant non-pension income- S6, if members look at the total picture, they will see that quite a lot has been done in recent years for people who could be described as retirees with income other than pension income. Education",80
59,Mr NEWELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Can the minister inform the House what steps the government has taken to support education at the school level? How do these measures accord with the public expectations created prior to the presentation of .the budget?",80
60,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-I thank the honourable member for Richmond for his. question. This year's budget· marked a significant milestone; because it was this year that the government's commitment to schools-both government and non-government-exceeded $3 billion in general recurrent grants to the Commonwealth for the first time. In other words, there were no cuts in the grants to either government or non-government schools in the budgetabsolutely none. This may have had the curious effect of disappointing some expectations around the place. Members will recall the contemptible riding instructions that went out to the Liberal Party in February and the aim of those instructions. The document said: Surely the object till Budget time is to make every welfare recipient feel like they're about to lose it. A month after that, the member for Ballarat acted on those instructions by issuing a press release claiming that the government plans to slash $220 million in the next four years in funding to the poorest non-government schools, which will affect around 700,000 primary and secondary school students. Mr Crean-Did you apologise for that, Michael? Mr Ronaldson-Why aren't you answering this question?",80
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for Employment, Education and Training is not helping.",81
62,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"His Senate colleague Dr Woods claimed in a press release 12 days later that the government would make the same $220 million worth of cuts. In his press release, however, it was to affect the parents of 900,000 children and all independent and Catholic schools. Of course, not only did the two press releases not accord' with each other but neither accorded with the truth. Senator Woods '8 entry into the fray got him a run, which is more than we can say for the honourable member for Ballarat. I sometimes think that I am the only person in this place that reads the press releases of the honourable member for Ballarat and corrects them for grammar too. The good' Senator ' Woods actually got a run in the Sydney Morning Herald on the front page. One might well wonder why. The reason was that it came just four days before the New South Wales election. Senator Woods's sudden interest in education was clearly prompted by the desperation of the Fahey Liberals, who were after all the people who put him into the Senate after he lost his seat here. . Now that the budget has shown just how false these claims are, the Liberals really ought to apologise. The fact that they deliberately frightened parents, teachers and children at every non-government school in Australia just for political gain is an absolute disgrace. The commitment of this government to the education of young' Australians, embraces those at both government and non-government schools. Our commitment has produced an increase of 44 per cent in real terms in Commonwealth grants since this government came to office; it has produced 44 per cent real growth. As this budget shows; predictions of cuts to the non-government sector were just plain wrong. Unemployment",81
63,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Is the minister aware that in my electorate of Adelaide unemployment in parts is as high as 26.6 per cent? In response to a survey question asking, 'Do you consider yourself to be more financially secure than you were three years ago?' 71 per cent of those who replied said that they were worse off. Does the minister expect battlers without a job to believe the Prime Minister's postbudget rey,elation: 'It's never going to get any better. I mean this is as good as it gets'?",81
64,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was in the member's electorate last week, in which we got commitment from the business community through the area consultative committee for a jobs drive that will see a commitment, I think, to some 12.000 job vacancies being found over the next six months. I should say also that I was downMr Beale-Couldn't you find the vacancies?",81
65,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here is the member for Bruce. I thought he was out of the place until I,saw a press release the other day from him that said that we were going to be decimated in the budget, that there were going to be cuts to Working Nation, cuts to schools and cuts to employment, education and training. He still does not know what has happened. Little wonder he is still sitting three rows back on the other side of the parliament. He should be able to claim some degree of seniority. They have seen to bring him down to the front-bench once in this place. All he can make is inane, incorrect statements. In .answer 'to the question asked by the member, this.is but one example of some 27 regions which I have visited around the country, including the so-called Labor heartland that the Leader of the Opposition now claims to be taking such a great interest in. The fact is that the jobs target that has been developed in Adelaide is similar to the jobs targets being conducted around the country by the area consultative committees, which the shadow minister still does not seem to acknowledge exist. All of those that have been conducted have either met or exceeded their targets. So much for the interjections about where are we going to find them. In the last 12 months we have seen something like 300,000 jobs created-that is, five per cent employment growth. In that period we have seen the number of unemployed come down by 18 per ceni, the long-term unemployed by 23 per cent and the long-term unemployed youth by close to 30 per cent. These are, the results of the targeted measures coptained in Working Nation. This is a consequence of the government's policies that have been able' to sustain high levels of economic growth translating into jobs growth. For the first time last month South Australia began to join in the direction and get the benefit of a significant part of this jobs growth. Over the last 12 months we have seen that state achieve no GDP growth, when the rest of the country has been growing at five per cent or thereabouts. One has to say something about what the government in South Australia is doing to generate economic growth. If the rest of the country, is achieving economic growth, why is your state not? The answer is that Liberal governments are incapable of developing effective economic policy. For the first time last month the South Australian unemployment rate ,fell below 10 per cent. In other words, South Aus-ralia is catching up. But what it is catching up with is the economic growth generated by this government and the jobs growth that has come from it. I simply say to the honourable member, that she should get behind the jobs drive in her electorate. If you are so concerned about employment opportunities, get behind the support which the community is prepared to give and support the Working Nation initiativ.es that are about jobs and training subsidies past. in your electorate. We do not see anything of you. Where are you in terms of saying that you support these programs? What your side of the House is saying is that these programs are a waste of money. Presumably they are the programs that you would cut in the search for the savings that yo).! say we should have done better on in the last budget. The fact of the matter is that what we have done is increase program expenditure under Working Nation for the next financial year. Some $1.7 billion was spent this financial year and next financial year it will go up to $2.2 billion-the most ever spent by a government in terms of employment and training initiatives. The year after that it be $2.3 billion and the year after that another $2.3 billion. Your, shadow spokesman has twice been asked, to indicate whether you would support those programs and twice' he has refused to answer. , ,All I am saying to you is that you should understand that there has been huge employment growth in this economy. Understand that finally South Australia is getting behind it and thatiswhy the community, through the area consultative committee in your electorate, is prepared to try and find those jobs. I suggest that you get in behind them and participate. Rail",81
66,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and concerns the future of the nation's rail industry. Can the minister inform the House of the progress in rail standardisation outlined in the One Nation statement? Can the minister also provide the House with an update of developments in the acquisition by, the National Railways Commission of new locomotives?",82
67,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The narrowing of the 800 kilometres of rail line from Melbourne through to Adelaide and the creation of tl)e standard gauge is simply the most important moment in the history of rail in this country. Tomorrow, a national freight train"" the One Nation train, will leave Brisbane for Perth. This will be the first train not to be held up by different g(l.uges of track-there were as many as five different gauges of track in the It is a task that has been beyond goVernments ever since Federation, but it has been tackled by this government. The $184 million Melbourne to Adelaide section, funded through the government's One Nation program, is the very last link in this vital chain. This weekend the Prime Minister and I will have the honour of meeting the One Nation train in Melbourne on its history'making journey. In every sense",82

69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister might wait for a moment. In the absence of the honourable member for O'Connor from the far end of the chamber, I would have thought will it might have been a little quieter. Might I suggest that those other honourable members down there remain quiet.",82
70,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In every sense, our rail standardisation 'program is One Nation's crowning glory. It has seen some $429 million invested in our rail system since 1992, since the One Nation announcement. It absolutely fulfils our commitment to make rail transport much more competitive with road transport. As a result of that vision, and as a result of this investment, transit times for rail freight will be cut by two hours between Melbourne and Adelaide? by seven hours between Sydney and Adelaide, and by eight hours between Melbourne and Perth. The spin-offs from this massive investment are nothing short of spectacular. Today National Rail announced that more than 1,400 jobs will be created by Goninan and Co., which was announced as the preferred tenderer for the supply of a fleet of up to 120 new locomotives-locomotives that will be manufactured here in Australia, locomotives that will run around that One Nation network from Brisbane to Sydney to Melbourne to Adelaide to Perth. I know that nothing will give the member for Newcastle more pleasure than to know and see so many of those jobs created in his own great citro With the multiplier effect, the $400 million contract announced today will generate a total of 4,000 jobs around Australia. Goninan and Co. has said that it will also establish, at a cost of $25 million, a world's best practice maintenance facility in Victoria, which will result in even more jobs. Our reforms have not been restricted· to physical infrastructure alone. We have created Australia's first seamless interstate freight service operated by National Rail, and it is operating now. We are committed to building on this momentum of reform, the momentum of reform that we have unleashed over the past three years. This weekend the government will outline the next steps in the reform process, a process that is finally injecting efficiency and competition into this country's rail infrastructure network. Mr Tim Fischer-In the hope of finding some reference to the Bathurst to Broken Hill link, would the minister table the notes from which he has been quoting?",83
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister has indicated he is using personal notes. Income Distribution,83
72,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Minister for Social Security. I refer the minister to EPAC's April 1995 paper on income distribution in Australia, a paper commissioned by the Prime Minister. Will the minister confirm that the paper shows that, firstly, the real earnings of Australian workers at the bottom of the income distribution are now lower than they were under the Fraser government and, secondly, the gap between these workers and those at the top of the income distribution has widened by almost 20 per cent under Labor? Why has this Labor government turned its back on the Australian battler?",83

79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Herbert!,83
80,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Kooyong makes reference to the recent EPAC paper on income distribution in Australia. I have made a bit of a study of that paper, and I am familiar with a few of the statistics contained therein. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to enlighten the House on a few key points. The first point is that the EPAC paper confirmed that, in terms of distribution of earnings, people's earnings from market incomes-wages, salaries, et cetera-there has been in this country, as throughout the developed world, some increase in earnings disparities. That is true, but let us put it in perspective. The most recent figure for Australia-and it is tabulated in this EPAC paper-based on 1989 statistics shows that we have gone from something like 2.08 to 2.27, as the ratio of earnings from people 10 per cent from the top to those people 10 per cent from the bottom. So it is about 2.27 now. Yes, it has become more unequal. But let us contrast that with the United States where the corresponding ratio is 5.6; the United Kingdom where the corresponding ratio is about 3.4; and France where the ratio is 3.2 and so on. The only countries that were shown in the EPAC table as having a more equal distribution of earnings than Australia were the Scandinavian countries and Italy. Not only is the absolute level of inequality here, in terms of earned incomes less than in those countries, but the rate of growth in inequality has been far greater in those countries that have pursued the wholesale deregulation of labour markets and the slashing of the social wage; that is, precisely the policy prescriptions of the opposition. That is the first point. The second point is that the EPAC report was absolutely explicit. While there has been that underlying trend towards greater inequality in earnings, which has resulted from a range of factors-globalisation of the world economy, the impact of technology and so forth-the impact of government policy, that is, changes made through the tax and social security transfer system and the social wage, has been unambiguously benign. In other words, it has acted to offset and retard any underlying trend towards greater inequality. To put that in perspective, to show the importance of these social wage considerations, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, which I referred to in my first answer, estimates that the disparity between the average incomes of those in the top 20 per cent and those in the bottom 20 per cent will drop from 13: 1 to 4: 1 when you add in social wage elements to the market incomes. That is a crucial point. When the opposition professes its concern about inequality and says we should take an axe to these social programs, it is utter hypocrisy on the opposition's part. That is another key point. Yes, there are underlying trends to greater inequalities in market incomes throughout the developed world. Government policy in this country has been benign in serving to offset and retard that underlying trend. We have put / in place an unambiguously stronger safety net. In real terms, the payments that go to those who are least well off have improved substantially and they have improved in relative terms as against the incomes received by the rest in society. The opposition likes to quote studies. It talks about the Gregory work. I was on ABC radio with Bob Gregory talking about the import of his study. He basically confirmed the accuracy of what I was saying, that this alleged trend towards lower income in the bottom one per cent of areas probably reflects a compositional change resulting from much greater targeting of public housing, which accounts for about 5Y2 per cent of the dwelling stock, to those on low incomes and those in need-unemployed, sole parents, et cetera. If we compare this government's performance to the performance of the coalition and to the performance over the last 10 to 15 years of governments that have pursued the kind of policy mix that the opposition favours, it is just the utmost hypocrisy for the opposition to come in here and start complaining about inequality. Building Industry",83
81,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations. Can the minister inform the House of government initiatives to address the issue of restrictive work and management practices in the building and construction industry?,84
82,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is true that the construction industry has been characterised by poor work and management practices over a number of years. But by 1991 the Commonwealth set about a reform strategy, the heart of which was to establish the Construction Industry Develbpment Agency. Both the strategy and the agency have been opposed bitterly by the opposition, so I would like to tell you exactly what things the agency and the strategy have delivered to the construction industry. I have a copy of a compact 'Restrictive practicescompact for change' which was signed and witnessed only a week or two ago. The most important thing about this compact is that it was signed by employers and trade union leaders. So jointly they have decided to resolve those many work and management practices that have got in the way of efficient construction in this country. The signatories are:· the National Electrical Contractors Association, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, the Air-conditioning and Mechanical Contractors Association of Australia, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, the Metal Trades Industry Association, the Communications, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal and Plumbing Union, the Master Builders Association and AWU-FIMEE. These groups, that together can have an impact on work and management practices, have decided to form a compact in order to resolve the following sorts of issues, which we know have always been fundamental to construction industry in this country. For instance, employers have now acknowledged that unions have a right to contact their membership and to do what they must do in order to represent the interests of their workers. So the employer groups in the construction industry are doing precisely what the opposition would never allow them to do-acknowledging the place of trade unions in the construction industry. Those people who employ labour in the construction industry have signed a document to say that there is a place in this industry for the trade union movement and, what is more, that cooperation alone will bring the sorts of changes that this industry requires. Further on it goes. For instance, it says employers should establish and maintain effective systems for good occupational health and safety, which is a real worker concern, but one that employers need to work on. There have been practices like last on, first off, where there was an arbitrary application. If there had to be redundancies the last one on the job was always the first one knocked off. That does not leave you with a position where the most skilful people are kept on a job when you have to downsize. It is acknowledged that that sort of practice is not good for efficiency and ought to be done away with. In regard to overtime a practice had developed whereby if one received overtime all ought to receive overtime, which was costly and inefficient. Both unions and employers have now agreed that that sort of practice should be abolished. There was the whole debate that revolved around inclement weather-people would knock off if it began to rain. It is true that during inclement weather it can be very dangerous on construction sites and that people should cease work. But it is possible, nevertheless, for employers to arrange work so that people can work indoors, or be taken away and given some training during those times. Mr Atkinson-Come on!",84
83,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Don't laugh. It is employers who, together with trade unions, are saying that there are better ways in which we can manage our work forces to have a better performing construction industry. Management practices like cash-in-hand, pyramid subcontracting and the abuse of the prescribed payments system should also cease. This is an acknowledgment of cooperation in practicethat there were poor practices both on behalf of management and workers that built up mainly because of a lack of trust in the industries and that unions representing workers had to take their place to resolve these differences. Without the trade union movement you would not have been able to have such a compact. Mr Anderson-Oh, come on!",85
84,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Believe the Master Builders; that they signed it. Such a compact would not be possible without a highly organised work force in the construction industry. I congratulate CIDA. It has been an unmitigated success. Drought Assistance,85

89,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why don't you ask Kennett what he's done to them?,86
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Calwell.,86
91,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I will start again. Minister, what do you say to those Australian battlers, the drought stricken farmers of northern Victoria-including those in my electorate of Bendigo-and many parts of central New South Wales, who this week were denied the right to even apply for drought assistance? How do you reconcile your cabinet's refusal to declare drought exceptional circumstances in these areas with the Prime Minister's pledge of last year? I quote the Prime Minister's pledge: If people are in trouble no matter where they are or where they are from or who they vote for we there to give them a hand.",86
92,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member raises the issue of the government's commitment to drought affected farmers. The reality is that the government, through the drought relief payment and right through other forms of relief, has either spent or committed in excess of $400 million in the form of relief. Mr Crean-It's $565 million.",86
93,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I stand corrected-$565 million is our commitment to drought affected farmers. Obviously, there is a process whereby the exceptional circumstances areas are designated. It is a consultative process in which the states are involved and in which farmer organisations also have a role to play. This level of assistance is clearly targeted at areas that are most severely affected. We have a process there which tries to identify those areas which are the worse affected-and we have made a major commitment to those areas. In addition to that, there is a range of hardship provisions in the Social Security Act which are also available to people outside the exceptional circumstances areas. Just a few days ago the government announced a comprehensive array of new measures, additional measures, to assist farmers both inside and outside the drought affected areas. So there is no doubting this government's commitment on that particular score. Care Australia",86
94,Mr LANGMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs and refers to the problems with Care Australia which have featured so much in the media lately. I ask the minister: in relation to the committee established to advise on the development of a code of practice for non-government development organisations, which I understand is due to report in three months time, what do you expect the committee to achieve? Could the problems with Care have been avoided if such a code had already existed? Also, how will a code of practice be implemented and enforced?",86
95,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable are member for his question. His interest in the aid field and in non-governmental organisations is, I think, well known in this place, and I am pleased he is taking an interest in this matter. I can confirm that the Code of Practice Advisory Committee, which I established, held its first meeting earlier this week and got off to a good start. In that connection, I would like to thank the honourable member for Aston and the honourable member for Franklin who are, themselves, members of the committee and who, I think, contributed valuably to its work; along with nongovernmental organisations, who are part of it; and also the accountancy profession, which has nominated representatives to it. It is true that I have asked the advisory committee to report back within three months with a proposed code of practice which would not only meet the information requirements of government and also be easily understood by the non-governmental organisation community but also, ahd most importantly, help the public to make informed decisions about how their donations are spent and reassure the donating public that they can have full confidence in the accountability of non-governmental organisations and their operations. I expect the code of practice to have two main components: a code of ethics, which builds on and gives recognition to the ACFOA code of ethics; and a separate part covering financial reporting standards. I want to make it clear that I see the code of practice as being an interim tool, until there has been full implementation of the Industry Commission's recommendations from its recent report on accounting standards fonhe charity sector, the community social welfare sector, of which NGOs are a part. But because that will involve amendments to state legislationthe legislation of all states-I suspect that be some time well in the future. Since the' code of practice is being developed with the extensive collaboration of the non-government organisation community, I hope they will have a very high degree of association .with its recommendations and support for the code. I therefore expect that the code will basically be a self-regulatory tool which would be of assistance and benefit to the NGO- in providing better information to the public and to their members, and help to ensure continued public confidence in their operations. , In that connection, I would like to make it clear that I do not think there is any general crisis of confidence Dr trust in non-government organisations; Actually, I think the reverse is true.' There are probably a· good number of members of the House who went out at the weekend collecting for the SalvatiQll Army's Red. Shield Appeal. I think people, by and large, trust organisations like that-like Community Aid AbroadMr Tim Fischer-Mission Australia.",86
96,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And Mission Australia, as the Leader of the Nationa- Party interjects. I think people basically do trust those organisations. The point about this code is that it will reinforce and underpin that trust which already exists. Finally, th- honourable member asked how this code would be implemented and enforced. One option I will be looking at carefully is whether NGO compliance with the code would be a prerequisite for tax deductibility status, which the government gives each year at the cost of something like $50 million in forgone taxation revenue, and/or whether it should be linked to the provision of further government support in the form of grants channelled through those NGOs for their development activities. I will be very interested in any recommendation from the committee which goes to those questions. Motor Vehicles: Sales Tax'",87
97,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is will directed to the Minister for Transport. When debating another rise in fuel tax on leaded fuels in 1993, the then minister for the environment, Ros Kelly, said: . The bottom line is that the health of children must come first. What happened to the government's concern for children when it decided to impose a 31 per cent increase in sales tax on new vehicles, which use only unleaded fuel? Why should Australian battlers wanting to buy a car not see the government's rhetoric about their children's health as nothing but cant and hypocrisy?",87
98,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Leader of the National Party well knows, all that happened iIi this budget was that the sales tax on motor vehicles was returned to its previous level. It was returned to exactly where it had been, at 21 per cent. I should remind the honourable member of the circumstances iIi which it was reduced in the first place. It was not reduced as 'a measure to encourage lead-free petrol. It was introduced as a countercyclical measure to boost that industry. It has had such a good effect on boosting that industry that record demand has seen lengthy waits of two, three, four, five and six months to take delivery of an Australian motor vehicle. You have ,to be pretty ordinary indeed to think that this will have any effect whatsoever on the level of lead in the atmosphere around Australia. Really and truly, you do stretch credibility. Thisis just another cheap, point scoring exercise and one that falls flat on its face. Compensation Claims",87
99,Mr KNOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The minister would be aware of some complaints from the ex-service community about delays in processing compensation claims by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Could the minister advise the House whether he has taken steps to address these concerns and whether those measures have seen an appreciable decline in the backlog of claims?,88
100,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. There has been a number of complaints over the years with respect to the time that it has taken for claims to be processed by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. There have been many thousands of claims in the system. In 1991 my department undertook the development of an expert compensation claims processing system. Because of the fact that it was leading edge technology, it took a fair while to implement. But teams in all states are now very proficient in processing claims. That was one of the first initiatives that we brought in. It was brought in while the member for Griffith was the minister.. Another initiative associated with the processing of claims has been the introduction of the Repatriation Medical Authority. As a result of statements of principles that it brings out every now and again, there is now some consistency from state to state with respect to how claims are processed. Productivity has improved noticeably. Recently, staff and ma!lagement have gained experience and familiarity with the new processes and systems. It is expected that maximum efficiency in production will be achieved by mid-1995. I understand that, since the beginning of March, average weekly national. output has exceeded intake by 161 cases per week. The average time taken to process compensation claims stands at 103 days for the March quarter, which is down by 30 per cent on the time taken under the old system. In fact, some claims have been processed all the way through to payment in one day. In addition, I have asked for a claims workshop to be conducted with ex-service communities where we are trying to get to the bottom of the claim from the word go so that perhaps we can fix it up at the primary level and get the answer right the first time. Finally, as part of a broader review, this year I asked the department to look at whether there could be ways of knocking down the quite large, overflow of appeals to the Veter-:as Review Board. I am happy to say that reviews have been undertaken in Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmani-. The initial estimate is that about 40 to SOper cent of Veterans Review Board appeals will be resolved by this particular review, either by the reviewing officer granting the claim or by the applicant withdrawing the appeal. So I am aware of it.. I am conscious of the fact that, in this remembrance year, we do not want to keep them waiting too long. I think the steps we have taken have achieved a much bett-r result.",88

110,Dr KEMP,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The misrepresentations that I want to correct were also made by Senator Crowley in the Senate in question time today. Senator Crowley made two misrepresentations in relation to my views on the government's child-care policies. Ute first misrepresentation was that Senator Crowley, referring to a press release that I had issued yesterday, claimed that I had supported unacceptable charging practices in child care. In fact, I made no statement about charging practices in child care, nor any statement which carried any implication about charging practices. My press release referred to the loss of jobs by child-care workers as a result of the budget restrictions on access to child care by families where a parent is not in the work force. The second misrepresenta-ion related to an address I gave to a ,child-care conference in Queensland last weekend. Senator Crowley s'aid that, in response to a question to me at that conference concerning what the coalition's attitu<:ie in the Senate woul!f the restrictions on child-care access to low incom- battling families, I said that I did not know what that reaction would be. I said that our actions would depend on how the matter came before the Senate and that this Was presently unclear but that we would continue to strongly oppose the arbitrary and unfair attack on child-care access by low income battling families.

113,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honoun;tble member for Flinders (Mr be to Reith) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to undertake genuine labour market reform as evidenced by the impediments to productivity and disincentives to employment which have been imposed on battling workers and el}1ployers of Australia by the government's restrictive and unfair Industrial Relations Refonrt Act.

114,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I want to start this debate on a matter of public importance by congratulating the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) for the remarks he made yesterday about the nature of the forthcoming election. He said-to put it the way the popular press have expressed it today-that the next election would be the battle of the battlers. I thought that was a very apt, appropriate and timely r-ference by the Leader of the Opposition in so characterising the debate that will precede the forthcoming election. It is very appropriate because this government has been in office for 12 years. When the election is held later this year or early next year, it will be asking for a term which would give it, in effe<;:t, 16 ye-rs in office. It is also very, appropriate because, in my view, at the next election we ought to bave, re.ferendum on this government's management of the Australian economy, anQ that ought to be not an economics, debate but a simple reflection on what has happened for ordinary people as a result of the Labor Party's time in office. t also congratulate the Leader of the Oppositionbecause not only was it an appropriate thing to say but also I, thought it was 'very timely. I have been here for a few years now, aild I suppose I feel an election in the air; it is in my bones. The average time between elections in Australi'a' is about two y-as arid three months. When I see the telltale signs of the hyperactivity of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I know that he is clearly planning t9 strike when he thinks the opportunity he-t provides it. In fact, he turned up at Frankston the other day, which must be his only performance ever in Frankston. I hate to disappoint him, but Bruce Bilson is about to wiri that seat. Mr Chynoweth-L rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. What the honourable member for Flinders said is incorrect.

115,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"'-Lastl y , .as all ope-ing remark, I congratulate the Leader of theOpposifion because he ):las basically hit the political mark. You know that because the Prime Minister had his· minders out in the gallery last night with a seven-page so-called rebuttal. I can tell you that it ain't worth the paper it is written on, butin the bit I have still got left in my hand it says something about the Prime Minister. You could picture him. in his office in a state of fairly considerable agitation. He would be saying"" 'Take this down, take this down,' and 'some scribe would be in the corner writing it ,all down.' When he is in ,that mood, when he is in that situation, he is absolutely guaranteed to go over thetop.

The Leader of the Oppositi9n hit his m-rk whetl he madethi- point yesterday. To perhaps'give credence to the. - rime Mini-ter's agitatiQ- las't night; I point O\,1t that when two. Labor Party people were walking in the!iorridor' this .tp.olJ1ing-:-in: fact! they were a senior, well-known and liked minister and the federal secretary of the Labor Partycertain remarks passed between them. The minister said to the secretary, 'How are things going?' The response was, 'Not bad under the circumstances. But this B'-referring to the Leader of the Opposition-'is going to make life very hard for us.' Never a truer word was said. Life is going to get a lot harder for these guys before we get to the next election. If the government wants· an early election, I say bring it on. The sooner we make some substantial changes to the economic management of this country, the better off we will be. Today I particularly want to focus on aspect of Labor's industrial relations reform as an example of its complete failure right across the board beyond the labour market employees. and into general economic issues and management. There have certainly been changes in the industrial relations area, and some have been in the right direction. But the truth the matter is that, by and large, in the vast majority of cases the changes that have been made have been made by employers and employees in spite of the government's labour market system and not because of it. A particular case study I bring to House's attention relates to the unfair dismissrecords al laws. These laws were introduced of the reform package after the 1993 election. In fact, they were part of a package which was one of the most gross examples of back to the trade union movement we have ever had in this country. In response to union support in the last election, the government basically allowed the unions to have dominant say in the reform of the industrial relations system that was introduced. In relation to the starting point for the reforms we have had, I ask those of my colleagues who are in the chamber: what do the following countries-Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Malawi, MorocQueensland co, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and about 10 others-have in common with Australia? They have all ratified ILO convention 158, the termination of employment convention. The significance of this is that the govern which ment has ratified a convention that very few other countries have ratified. If Zaire, Malawi and Morocco are the standards by which we are to run industrial relations in this country, we have a few problems. The government signed that ILO convention and used it to basically change constitutional arrangements in Australia to introduce a new federal law. This new federal law was supposed to give employees a right of appeal in the event that they were unfairly or unjustly dismissed. Right at the outset I say that there ought to be a proper course of appeal for people who are sacked so that they can ensure that their grievances are properly heard. Let us face it: from time to time some employers one will do the wrong thing. They will get no truck from us. There ought to be in place a system to properly safeguard the interests of The system the Labor Party has introduced is an absolute disgrace. Let me just give a few examples as time permits. An interesting of case involves Qantas. This was a case where a male employee obtained access to Qantas's computer booking records to obtain the name of a female passenger. He rang this female passenger and made certain propositions. The management of Qantas hauled this bloke in the and said, 'Your access to our computer is not for this purpose and, if we as part catch you again, you are out.' Within a few months this same guy was into the records-not of passengers this time, paybut of female Qantas employees who had applied for overtime. This bloke was harassing Qantas staff. So they got him in, sacked him on the basis that they had given him one a prewarning, which I thought was generous enough, and he was out. Under Labor's system, because of claims in respect of procedures, this guy was reinstated and got 17 grand-17,OOO bucks. He was sacked-and, in my view, he should have stayed sacked. I will give you another case involving a university. These matters are pretty sensitive, as we are all aware. The university had allegations of a university lecturer exploiting female students. The university was very careful in the way in it proceeded in examining this issue and this guy basically got the sack. Under the system set up by Labor, the university's committee decision was said to contain errors of law as there was no proper finding of serious misconduct as defined in the award. In other words, this guy was reinstated not because of the substantive issues but because of the procedural system set up by this minister. That guy was sacked and he should have remained sacked. When the minister responds I would like a specific statement from him on some of these specific cases which he claims do not exist. What about Conagra? This is a case where a bloke had 35 days absent from work over two years.",90
116,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Conagra?,92
117,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Farrell and Conagra Wool is the name of the case. This guy had had 35 days absent over two years. Of those 35 days, he had 20 days where he did not produce a medical certificate. The system is that if you take a sickie you have to front up the next day with a medical certificate. This bloke had day No. 36 absent from work and still did not have a certificate. The employer said, 'Enough is enough; you're out.' This guy lodged an unfair dismissal claim. It was found that on the day he claimed the sickie he had actually turned up to his old man's birthday party . Yet the court ordered his reinstatement. He got 11,600 bucks and the basis of the decision was that the company had to prove that he had not been sick. That is just absolutely outrageous. What about the prison warder? This prison warder struck up a liaison with an inmate; she associated with the prisoner, which is against regulations; she took letters in and out of the prison. She got sacked and then put in a claim of lack of procedural fairness. What happened? She got compensation of $3,500. That is absolutely outrageous. They are cases where it is against the employer. Of course, for those who are in a job today and want to go to another job, it will make life very difficult for them to get another job, to transfer, because employers will say, 'Why should I give them a job? If there are any problems I am going to be stuck with the problem.' Let me give you another case. An employer gave an employee a reference because they were parting company. The employer said, 'It is a small country town. I will give you a reference to help you get a job.' That is not an unreasonable thing to do. The employer glossed over the employee's defects-many have done that. What happened? The bloke lodged an application for unfair dismissal. He turned up before the registrar, the registrar read the reference, saw that it was a good reference, and the employer-a farmer who hardly had two dollars to rub together-had to fork out compensation of 12 grand. I will now cite an unreported case. It is worth mentioning this case because a lot of these cases are not reported. The minister will stand up there and quote figures about how few cases have been heard before the judicial registrar. But the fact is that employers have a choice. They can go on and fight, but the whole system is stacked against them and they will probably lose, so they might as well cough up. The running cost is about eight grand. It is no wonder that employers are complaining from one end of the country to the other. In this case, a foreigner obtained work on the condition that she could have the job as long as she had a work permit. At the end of the work permit, she was dismissed. She lodged an unfair dismissal application. The hospital went to the solicitor and the solicitor said, 'Well, the unfair dismissal laws have precedence over the immigration laws, so the employee is in the right' - even though the work permit had expired. The cases are legion. I have a list as long as your arm. I have loads and loads of them,and they are open and shut cases. It is not just the opposition saying this. Your factional colleague the Premier of New South Wales is saying exactly the same thing. He will not even amend his laws to reflect yours, because he will not have a bar of his laws having to reflect the ILO conventions. He is proceeding with an appeal in the High Court which was initiated by the last Liberal government-so bad are your laws. When Bob Carr started to attack your laws, being the typical Labor leader that he is, he said, 'I can make these remarks beGause my union colleagues in New South Wales agree with me.' It is not just us saying this, and it is not just the employers saying this. Yesterday a Federal Court judge said that the whole system is there to provide rights to the employees-but to the total exclusion of employers. It makes no sense. You do not have jobs unless you have employers. All we say is, 'Let's give people a fair system and a fair go all around.' (Time expired)",92
118,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (4.21 p.m.)-What a welcome surprise it is to have the very first MPI from the new shadow minister for industrial relations, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith). Mr Reith-The first one yo,u have been here for.",93
119,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, it is certainly the first one that you have tackled me with. I suppose I should look up in the galleries to see whether members of the Au-tralian Chamber of Commerce and Industry· are present to cheer on their new man. As he just reminded me, this is not his first time around and this is not his first posting. He has had 12 postings. He is the famous 12th man of the opposition front bench. This is his second term at being shadow IR minister. You would really think the honourable member would know better. You would also think he would know better than to come into the House today and call on a debate that the opposition has never been able to win and can never win. Having said that, he is nothing if not persistent. He is the ultimate good, local solicitor who will take on any brief, waiting for it to wander through the door. He has even been compared to one of those toys you punch that always bounces right back up again-boom, and up he comes again. With all the jobs he has had, he certainly needs the ability to keep coming back and back. Mr Reith-I am still here, Laurie.",93
120,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right-you are still here. We well remember your efforts in the past. Your efforts with the GST and Fightback are legend. What about that great job you had-the very difficult brief of convincing people that taxing their. food, clothes and everything they bought was good for them? A terrific bit of success! You failed on that occasion, didn't you, but we will not hold that against you-not for a moment. We are delighted to see you back in IR, because we know that you are absolutely incapable of any sort of a soft line. This time you have the job of selling Jobsback the fourth time around; that is, after it has been knocked over the first, second and third time. Maybe you ought to rename it 'Knockback'. Mr Reith-This is not the fourth time.",93
121,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You have had three election goes at this and now we are lining up for the fourth. You have the onerous task of convincing people that tearing away their award safety net will actually be good for them-that they will enjoy it and that it will be a brave, new world without it. The honourable member has had to do all that while his leader, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), says that he is for the battlers, the families and the down-and-outs. The member for Flinders and his leader both know that their IR policy would rip away the penalty rates, the shift rates, the loadings, the award based superannuation, the family leave and a multitude of other award conditions that battlers and families depend upon. All of these things would be ripped away under Jobsback. All these people would get under the opposition would be those four Dickensian minimum standards contained in Jobsback, and these were Dickensian standards a century ago. That is all you will guarantee these people in 1995. What sort of a policy is that for families? What sort of a policy is that for battlers? It is a disaster for families and battlers. It might get you some plaudits from Judith Sloan. There is no doubt about that. I bet she wishes she had unfair dismissal protection from the Australian Financial Review at the moment. It might get you some plaudits from ACCI or the editorials in the Australian. But does the House think that those opposite care or know about what people want? One would have thought that the opposition would have learnt by now. The fact is that, while ever the honourable member for Bennelong is leader, you have Jobsback. While ever you have Jobsback, you have the world's all-time dud. That is what you are saddled with. That is what the member for Flinders has to sell. Even Mr Misrepresentation, another of the many nicknames of the member for Flinders, will not be able to put a benign light on his Jobsback policy. You can bet your life that the end of the day it will get the thumbs down again-the same as it got last time and the time before. You want to be able to misrepresent the success of our system, but the fact is that you cannot deny the undoubted success of our system. The statistics speak for themselves. have been 4,500 agreements since 1991; 2,200 agreements since the IR reform act came into effect; more than 100 enterprise flexibility agreements, of which 60 have already been approved. There are outfits like Optus, Woodside Petroleum and Toys 'R' Us. Some 60 per cent of all federal award emty, ployees are now in the enterprise bargaining process. Then there are your own states. for a decade. Western Australia is languishing on eight per cent. Tasmania has a pitiful three per cent. Victoria's system has become a shell of its former self thanks to the policies of Phil Gude. Compare our 60 per cent figure with your pathetic efforts. Compare the results that we have achieved in terms of the underlying rate of inflation that has been brought about by enterprise bargaining under our Industrial Relations Reform Act. It is two to three per cent at an advanced stage of the recovery. We have strong and continuing economic growth. We also have 640,000 new jobs since the last election. Some 320,000 of those jobs have been created since the new IR act came into effect. This is the act that was going to be dampener on employment. There have been 320,000 new jobs in 13 months. We have average wages growth of four to five per cent for people under agreements against that background of a two to three per cent rate underlying inflation. Under our provisions we have three $8 safety net adjustments for those who cann')t get agreements. We have the lowest level of industrial disputation in Australia for 50 years. They are our successes. I tell you that it is going to be mighty hard to rationalise all those statistics with your allegation that we have in some way failed in the quest for labour market reform. I tell you that it will be even harder to rationalise it when your Jobsback style policies have failed again and at again in the conservative states. It is harder still when people think back and remember the wage breakouts, the high inflation, the high unemployment and the ind'ustrial mayhem that characterised the Australian industrial scene in the early 1980s under yourselves, particularly when the man presiding over the whole show was none other than There your present federal leader. Of course, you will not be able to deny history; you will not be able to deny the statistics; and you will not be able to convince people that Labor has failed. Everyone knows that we have enjoyed industrial stabilia great improvement in the social wage, low inflation and rapid employment growth I will now deal with the issue of unfair dismissals, because it is in the absence of any fact that the opposition will always go for fiction and the anecdotal evidence-the case here and the case there. Nowhere is it more evident than in its attempt to destroy our unfair dismissal laws. Quite frankly, it is no good you coming in here and talking about one, two, three, four or five cases in a system where there are 9,600 cases. Mr Reith-Why don't you answer them?",93
122,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is an answer in respect of every case. The fact is that you put out these press releases about the 9,600 cases where allegedly unfairly treated employees have been able to claim the protection of the a federal laws. You claimed that this was going to hinder jobs growth when the facts show that there have been 320,000 new jobs. You claimed that it would dramatically increase claims, but we are now enjoying the same of number of claims as the state systems. You have said that the system would not cope with all the applications. The fact is that 68 per cent of them have been finalised and the average time for them to be finalised was 77 days. There have not been years of delays. You said that there would be an enormous number ·of applications that would have to be litigated before the court yet 94 per cent of all of the matters have been settled by conciliation or mediation or by the applicant simply discon-nuing. Only six per cent have required judicial determination. You also said that the system would be heavily legalistic and require the universal use of lawyers. The fact is that 46 per cent of all the cases are unrepresented and 16 per cent are repr-sented by unions. You cannot cut down those statistics. You said that there would be cripplIng awards of damages, but you have never acknowledged the. limitation that the government put on the maximum comperi&ation payable. You know, I know and the Hous,e well' knows that the average amount awarded by the courts is $8,000; That is completely in line with' the. amounts of damages awarded in the state systems. You'said that ah-ost all-ases are decided in favour of the employee. T4e fact is that just over halfthe cases decided by the court a,re ·dedded. in. favour 6f the empIoyee-56 per cent qf cases., are decide- in fay<?ur of the employee limd 44 per cent are decided in favour of ,the employer. It has been ,a very balanced system, "", . ' Mr Reith-T-il Mr i-stice Hope that. Mr BRERETON......hhink you have forgotten your jutisdiction. You are in another land. . Mr CADMAN - Who' is it then- Laurie? Mr BRERETON':'-You do your own research .. ' ""':"" , , Mr,CadmaD:-You don't know yourself and you are,the minister; Mr BRERETON,'-'-Justice Gray certainly did not 'say what was attributed to him by the member for Flinders. The member for Flinders ,came' 'in here and said that the federal standard is completely different from the ones applying in thestates. You; along with all the critics ofth-s act, have said that over and over again when you know that the state tribunals require procedural fairness and similarly require, emplqyers, .to be able to properly establish allegations of criminal conduct. You know that t-e,system.is on all fours in terms of the st,andard of proofrequired and the tests that have been applied all the way up to the High Court. The fact is that the opposition's campaign on this issue has been, one of total misinformation. One of the member's great examples is the case of Garden and Pacific Power. He did not realise that that was not a decision of the AIRC or the Commonwealth Industrial Court but the New South Wales Industrial Commission. It was not even in our jurisdiction yet that is one of the handful of cases that' he has relied upon for anecdotal evidence. , At every point in this debate the facts favour the government and counter everything that has been put forward by the opposition, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and some biased media commentators. The fact is that we have got the balance of policy right and our policies are working. We are very pleased to see them working. It is over the last 12 years that we have seen these results coming through and that is why the people have supported us again and again in relation to IR. Every issues survey shows that people continue to support us because they think we, are much better at managing IR, and rightly so. The member for Flinders and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) will not listen to people on the question of IR, but they are determined to punish them and rip away their protection. No-one is going to believe your rhetoric about being pro-family and probattler in the policies that you are going to present sometime between now and the next election. No-one cares whether you opt in or opt out because it is still anti-worker Jobsback and they know it. They are thoroughly convinced of it. .We will be delighted if you go on with all the humbug and anecdotal evidence,' but the fact is that people continue to support us on IR because they know that you are not fair dinkum about it. While you have Jobsback they will support us. They know that your policies are anti-worker and they know that they have always been anti-worker. They are anti-worker policies from an anti-worker party led by two people who are Australia's most anti-worker politicians-the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Flinders. We will keep on reminding the electorate of this day in and day out up until polling day. Come polling day the result will be the same as it has been the last five times. Once again, Jobsback will be one of the major reasons for our success and for your failure. So please do us a favour, go on sticking to your script.",94
123,Mr NEVILLE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The government's whole approach to deregulation has been inconsistent to the point of being farcical. While the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has strutted the world and domestic stages extolling the virtues of deregulation, while he has embraced Hilmer in its many dimensions and enticed and cajoled the states into coming on board and while tariffs and protection for industry have been wound back to arguably their lowest level ever, there is one great black hole in this fairer, more efficient and competitive Australia-that is, industrial relations. The emptiness of the government's moral position, its complete expediency and the duplicity of its promise to mainstream Australia is no more evident than in its perversion of industrial law and industrial relations. The Labor Party has sold its soul to the extreme elements of the union movement. Like the unfortunate Dr Faustus, as the clock ticks inexorably towards midnight the pay-off to the Mephistofoles of the union movement becomes ever more demanding. Mr Swan-What does all that mean?",96
124,Mr NEVILLE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It might be a bit difficult for you, but a few of us on this side of the House have read about this. The vehicle for the ALP's recent success has been union funding. But that has carried with it a quid pro quo--aunion trade-off-that has been the perversion of our industrial system. The seemingly bottomless pit of union money has not been enough to save the New South Wales Labor Party. It is described in today's Australian as a 'bunch of knuckleheads who you could not even trust to make a speculative investment.' As Laura Tingle put it, 'the ALP is rotting on the inside'. I do not raise this unpleasant spectre to gloat on the demise of the New South Wales Labor Party, but to illustrate how easily the party's sleazy way of doing business might, through the perversion of industry law, dissipate hard won gains and destroy the new employer-employee relationship. The intent of the government comes through clearly in a number of measures-the pay-off to the union apparatchiks for election funding favours. I will cite three of them. The first was the effective dismantling of the secondary boycott provisions. The second was the Hodder ruling on union intervention into enterprise bargaining, which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) was shamed into disowning. The third was the now unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act-a would be proper document that takes the ILO provisions to their ridiculous extreme. It is this third issue of unfair dismissal provisions that we are debating here today. In this House on 28 October 1993 the Minister for Industrial Relations concluded his second reading speech on the Industrial Relations Reform Act with the following remark: With the enactment of this bill the onus will be on the industrial relations players-it is their opportunity. . It was pleasing to see the minister acknowledge that a less centralised and less unionised form of industrial relations was the way to go. "" But' his words did not· match his actions, partieularly when it came to the unfair dismissal provisions of the new Industrial Relations Act. The minister talked about it being an opportunity for the industrial relations players, both employers and employees. But the evidence shows that, over the last 14 months, since these provisions were put in place, there has been no equal opportunity. The miI?-ister said he handed the IR ball to the players but when it comes to someone being sent offthat is, termination of employment-the rules are biased in favour of one team, which is the employees. The unfair dismissal laws are something akin to Queensland running onto the' field tonight against the Blues in the State of Origin. But the rules that have changed state that the Maroons cannot tackle their opponents or, if they do, they have to give five weeks notice. Mr Braithwaite-They could quite well do that too.",96
125,Mr NEVILLE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That might be necessary, I might add. The Maroons might be so good that they will not even need to tackle the other side to win. What about lesser teams? What about small employers? What about small businesses which do not have the same huge resources to contest the costly and lengthy court battles? The shadow minister just identified that on average it costs $8Y2 thousand to upturn an unfair dismissal claim. Small businesses are the big losers in the new IR game. They are the hard working Australians, and I want to concentrate on them in my remaining five minutes. Firstly, let me clearly state that I do not condone any employer who abuses, or unfairly treats, his or her workers. I abhor exploitation. I abhor underpayment. I abhor workplace intimidation. I do believe in fair play in a fair contest, but the current unfair dismissal provisions do not allow for a good, fair or clean game. That is not just my view. An editorial in today's Melbourne Age states:· The so-called unfair dismissal rules no longer beg the question: unfair to whom? A judge of the Industrial Relations Court has made no bones about it. In a recent ruling Justice Peter Gray said the federal legislation, in contrast to the approach adopted in most state jurisdictions, was not intendprocedural ed fairly to balance the interests of employers and employees. The unfair-dismissal provisions amounted to a charter of rights for employees, directed towards protecting their existingjobs. That confirms what the shadow minister said, and it gives the lie to the minister's rebuttal in the speech he made just a few moments ago. Further, the editorial stated: As. the IR court has held, a valid reason for dismissal is no longer sufficient. All the complicated and protracted procedures have to be followed to the letter. Today's editorial in the Australian makes its point very clearly. It states: The demise of a fundamental industrial disciplinethe right to dismiss a badly behaved employee-is a serious mistake. It will only bring trouble to the workplace. Over the last 14 months, since the new Industrial Relations Act became effective, there has been what some commentators describe as an avalanche of unfair dismissal claims. In Queensland today, the MTIA has seven industrial officers in the field. Would you believe that five of those are tied up in wrongful dismissal claims? That is outrageous and totally unnecessary. It is interesting to analyse the figures from the Department of Industrial Relations, which show that 6,790 federal applications have been lodged for unfair dismissal. About 60 per cent of those have been finalised, but over 96 per cent of those finalised have been settled out of court. The minister points to these statistics as evidence that the .new provisions are working and are not overly prohibitive. Nothing could be further from the truth. The rules are so stacked against them that employers do not even want to run onto the minister's new industrial relations field. Because of the so called procedural fairness, cost and uncertainty, they readily vacate the field. It is just not worth their while, or their bank balance, to contest the actions. The Queensland Director of the Metal Trades Industry Association, Paul Fennelly, said in today's Courier-Mail: Many employers were astounded that blatantly obvious reasons for dismissal did not apply if requirements were not strictly observed. Already the shadow minister has cited plenty of examples. Another interesting example is that of a woman prison officer who was dismissed for a having a relationship with a prisoner and who was awarded $5,000 compensation by the IR court. Although the prison officer's action amounted to serious misconduct, the court found she had been denied procedural fairness. The IR court reinstated a worker who was dismissed after wielding an iron bar during a scuffle. The court found the employer had failed to give the worker a proper hearing. Then there was the case, cited in the Australian today, of the former employee who pleaded guilty of theft and was convicted, and then was reinstated on appeal because it was said that procedural fairness had not taken place. These are just a few examples of what employers are facing. (Time expired)",97
126,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"At the outset, let me concede one point, and one point only, to the member for Flinders (Mr Reith): he has plenty of experience when it comes to job dismissals. He was dismissed by the constituents of Flinders at the 1983 election and has been dismissed from 11 shadow portfolios. Some political parties have a rule: three strikes and you are out. The Liberal Party has adopted a novel proposition for its front bench: 11 failures and you are still in and given a senior portfolio such as industrial relations. The member for Flinders received the mother of all job dismissals; he was dismissed by the Australian people at the last election as the author of Fightback. He was dismissed as a hopeless failure. He was dismissed as a genuine flop. The Australian people marked him down, and he is running away from yet another dismissal in a long line of job flops. He was dismissed and marked down by the Australian people with a big F-that is, F for failure. It is the same member for Flinders who now wants to talk on behalf of the opposition about micro reform. I join with my colleague the member for Lilley (Mr Swan), who yesterday advanced the excellent proposition that the opposition should start micro reform on its own front bench; it should free up the arteries, lift efficiency and lift productivity by clearing away some of the dead wood like the member for Flinders. It should clean out the tired, old, beaten, broken down, demoralised frontbenchers like the member for Flinders and show a bit of commitment to micro reform in its own backyard. ",98
127,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am reminded by my colleague the member for Chifley that the opposition should show some compassion and wheel out the old timers and give some of the new and more productive members a chance on the front bench. On this matter of public importance, the opposition is debating the wrong issue because, over the last 10 years, Australia has seen plenty of genuine labour market reforms. This government undertook the historic transformation to take Australia from postFederation settlement, when industrial relations was centralised in a court in Melbourne, to establish an enterprise based system in the 1990s. The important thing to appreciate is that only Labor could have achieved it. Only Labor could have made the transformation, because it had the cooperative mechanism with the ACro to do those things in genuine cooperation with the Australian work force. If the Liberal Party had ever tried that through the 1980s, or now in the 1990s, its record would have shown confrontation, disputation and the closing down' of Australian industry as a result of strike ,after strike. Only Labor could have made the transformation from 'a fully centralised industrial relation!> sys,tem to the enterprise base that now exists in 1995. What an achievement that has been. What an achievement to have 60 per cent of federal award workers under enterprise agreements. Not only the volume but also the quality of those agreements is an achievement. Seventy per cent of the 2,200 agreements under the IR reform act have covered enterprises with fewer than 100 employees. So small and medium size business in Australia is taking a big share of the enterprise bargaining oppo-­ tunities. Not only that but 75 per cent of the agreements address specific productivity measures and issues at th- workplace where they count most. These are productivity based wage movements under way in Australia. They are good for the workplace, good for the nation and particularly good for the government's aspirations, of holding down inflation to its historically low level. So these genuinely enterprise based agreements have transformed tb-. n(lture of the work place in Australia. Productivity is up, inflation is remaining low and enterprises are getting on with the task of formulating their own workplace arrangements. On top of that, there has been a bonus of 640,000 new jobs since March 1993. ' It is useful for the House and for opposition members to compare that outstanding record to the industrial relations record of the Tory states. What is happening in the Tory states of Victoria and Western Australia? In Victoria, 400,000 employees have left the Kennett industrial relations system, have left the system as an empty shell. In Western Australia, the government has achieved just eight per cent of enterprise bargaining under its state award coverage. This emphasises the strength of Labor's approach. The achievements by this government have not happened by accident. I think this is fair to say: there should be little debate across this parliament on the virtues of industrial relations flexibility; the real debate is about how to do it. The real debate is about the systems, the laws and regulations that are needed to entrench industrial relations flexibility. The difference is this: the ALP has a model that is based on enterprise agreements. It is based on cooperation in the workplace, cooperation with the trade union movement, building a sense of shared goals and collective interests in the workplace. That is the sort of model a sophisticated trading nation at the bottom of the Asia-Pacific needs to develop to be competitive. That is what is happening. The coalition never understands that the most important economic unit is not the individual, not the government, not anything in between. The most important economic unit is the enterprise--enterprises in Australia that produce, export and employ. Enterprises need to determine in a collective fashion, within their own workplace, the industrial relations arrangements that best suit their needs. But the coalition does not understand that because it has an obsession with the individual. It always wants individualised employment contracts, never enterprise agreements, because the coalition does not like or trust workers. It does not like or trust trade unions. It wants a system that is one on one, dog eat dog. It does not want the Australian way of working out cooperative and collective arrangements in the workplace; it wants something that is deeply individualised and deeply confrontational. Mr MCGauran-Individual freedom of choice-what a terrible thing!",98
128,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They are always saying, like the shadow minister at the desk, that we should go to New Zealand and have a look at the arrangements there. New Zealand has always been held out, across the Tasman, as the great industrial relations example. I took a bit of that advice just one month ago when, in New Zealand, I had a useful discussion with officials from the Department of Labour. What they said is very interesting. They said that under their industrial relations reform 90 per cent of employers have used the legislation to form enterprise agreements in the workplace to build a sense of cooperation, shared goals and collective interest. It was the 10 per cent of bad employers who wanted confrontation, who wanted to drive down wages and working conditions that decided to move towards individual employment contracts. You tell us all the time to go to New Zealand. I have, and I am telling you the New Zealand experience confirms the strength of our approach based on enterprise agreements and the weakness of your approach based on individual employment contracts. I would have thought, particularly from reading the front page of the Herald-Sun in Melbourne this morning, that if the Liberal Party or anyone in this country wanted an example of why workers need protection, why workers need unfair dismissal laws to protect them against exploitative employers, they should just look in the backyard of Liberal Party and see the way in which the Liberal Party treat its own staff. Liberal Party MPs around Australia only need to ask their own staff and they will find the reason why workers need protection, why the rights of workers should be protected and respected, why legislation should always entrench valid, unfair dismissal laws. Gerard Henderson has pointed out in a number of media forums that the Liberal Party is fond of the upstairs-downstairs model for their staff. It is a bit fond of the master-slave relationship. You only need to ask the staff of former New South Wales police minister Terry Griffiths why they need protection from their employer. You only need to ask the staff of the Liberal member for Camden in the New South Wales parliament Liz Kernahan about why they need protection. You only need to read today's Herald-Sun to find out about the use of dismissal provisions, individual employment contracts and the Victorian style of industrial relations system by the ex-finance minister Ian 'Dick' Smith-a genuine version of the things that batter. So much for a party of family values. How typical for the Victorian Liberal Party to use a style of industrial relations in its backyard with its own staff which reflects all the worse things about the employer-employee relationship. How dare the Liberal Party ever suggest that workers do not need protection, that workers do not need unfair dismissal laws. I can imagine how those Liberal Party staffers all around Australia must be held at gunpoint when they are told to type up or fax out the press releases criticising this government's provision on unfair dismissal laws. They must be held at gunpoint because they know better than anyone else-they have seen it first hand-that workers need protection. (Time expired).",99
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The discussion has concluded. NA NA (No.1) 1995 Main Committee Report Bill returned from the Main Committee without amendment, appropriation message having been reported; certified copy presented. Ordered that the bill be taken into consideration forthwith. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Bevis)-by leaveread a third time. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1995-96 Second Reading Debate resumed.  I was talking about Badgerys Creek and why I was pleased with the government's initiatives announced in the budget. I would like to quote an article from a local newspaper, the Blacktown Sun, which quotes Independent Councillor Corbin. The article states: He said Blacktown Council was against the plan right from the start and was the secretariat of an anti-airport organisation in the 1960s. Cr Corbin produced an old sticker, No Planes For Western Plains, and blamed the then Labor Cr Roger Price, now Federal MP for Chifley, for helping bring the airport to Badgerys Creek. I want to plead guilty. I have to say that the own Labor Party organisation in my area did have a tradition of being against an airport. I suppose, as a new federal member of parliament, one of my most nervous moments was to report to my FEC and seek its support for a campaign to get an international airport at Badgerys Creek. I look forward to the day in 1999 when we can see the airport, the campaign having advanced from the early 1980s to getting a general airport in the 1990s. This government and the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) have had the courage and foresight to commit in total $762 million towards developing a fully international airport open for business in 1999, and not only that but also planning the rail link on the south-western side and putting a lot of money into roadworks. Just near my electorate-it used to be on the border of my electorate-Elizabeth Drive is being made into a four-lane road. So of course I am excited. I am even more excited and proud of the fact that this airport will have maximum employment of about 10,500 during construction. It will have about 500 to 900 employees when it is finished. In the western suburbs of Sydney there will be a flow-on effect of some further 10,500 jobs. I do not apologise for advocating an airport. I take some delight that an independent councillor like Alderman Corbin would suggest that somehow I am to blame. I am to blame, but I say to Alderman Corbin that perhaps he needs to reassess his position and try to sample the mood of the people of western Sydney because they are behind this airport. They are excited about the fact that jobs will be created. The airport will have a catalytic effect in the western suburbs of Sydney. It will make a lot of businesses, both domestic and international, take into account the place where I live, the western suburbs of Sydney, in a way that they have never done before. So I am looking forward to it. I am very pleased that the minister is funding three further studies to update the EIS that was done in the 1980s. There is $1 million in this budget to protect air and water quality and to develop accurate noise exposure forecasts. So we will be able to undertake a proper community consultation process with the people of western Sydney. I am pleased that the minister has made that clear. He said to the western suburbs members of parliament-and I thank him for that as well-that they will be part of that process; it will be wider than them but they will be part of it. This is an exciting development for the western suburbs of Sydney. It has been given to us by a Labor government. I suspect that only a Labor government would do it. It will provide immediate and certainly mediumand long-term benefits. So, Councillor Corbin, I do not know what you said at the Blacktown Council meeting but I am happy to plead guilty to having been part of the process that changed the prevailing views of the Labor Party in my part of the world to support an international airport. It has certainly been supported by the people of the western suburbs of Sydney. Perhaps you ought to try to consult with them from time to time to ascertain their opinions. There is one issue I would like to raise because I have been asked by a number of people about it, and that is what would happen to Prospect dam or any other part of western Sydney should airlines vent their fuel. I am pleased to say that I am advised that there will be no fuel venting over western Sydney, that Prospect dam or Warragamba dam water quality will not be compromised in that way at all. I was speaking about superannuation. I was trying to make the point in my earlier contribution that I am very proud as a Labor member of this government to see the advances we have made in superannuation. I was running through the impact of the government's initiatives. There is $180 billion in superannuation savings at the moment. With the benefit of the government's initiatives, this will grow to $500 billion by the year 2000 and $2,000 billion in 20 years time-a lot of money. It is all very well to bandy these figures around, but what does it mean? It means that the working men and women of Australia will be able to better provide for their own retirement. We will still have a pension as a safety net underpinning retirement income policy, but many more people will have access to their savings and will enjoy a better quality of life. If this is not a family policy, I do not know what is. It is much more than that, important though that may be. It also means that we are addressing the issue of national savings, which is something the country has not done well in the past. Governments on both sides of the House need to accept responsibility for that. It will have a profound impact on our current account deficit. It is not the only measure we have taken in this House towards national savings. We have done two things: increasing private national savings by superannuation in a very bold way and running a surplus in our budget. That surplus increases to $3.5 billion and $7 billion in subsequent years. That means that the federal government is not drawing on the savings of the nation to fund worthwhile programs. There will be a greater pool of savings available for private investors in which to invest and grow and create more jobs. One of the points which the opposition keeps on making to us on this side of the House-and which perhaps provoked my earlier remarks-is that somehow we are being dishonest about the issue of personal tax cuts and that this has offended all Australians. When I walk around my electorate-it is not the same as Kooyong; I would be the first to admit that, but there are a lot of decent, up-front, hard working people in it-I talk to the people about the fact that from next year they will be expected to put a one per cent increase into their superannuation funds and each year after that a further one per cent until it is three per cent. I tell them that this is done under the accord process, and that we believe that because of enterprise agreements and salary increases we are not going to reduce their disposable income, but that rather than getting that in their pockets here today we will be putting it into superannuation. I ask: does it offend you? Do you feel you are being diddled? Are you somehow worse off? Their response is none of those things. They are really pleased that we have as a government grappled with the notion that ordinary people ought to be entitled to superannuationMr Bevis-And we will match it.  our tax cuts, as the parliamentary secretary points out-$4 billion a year when implemented each year after that, dollar for dollar and to quite generous salary levels. It starts cutting out at 1.4 per cent of average weekly earnings, about $46,000 and finally phases out at twice average weekly earnings, at about $66,000 per annum. Ordinary people whom I mix with and talk to think this is very good. They think it is in their interests. They particularly think it is in their children's interest. It is true enough to say that some of the older workers are not going to get the full benefit of it but they are delighted about the impact of it for younger workers and prospective workers. Let us look at the figures to see how we have transformed superannuation. Back in Persons with membership of a superannuation or Year Persons Aug-83 46% Aug-84 46% Aug-85 46% Aug-86 46% Aug-87 48% Aug-88 49% Aug-89 55% 1983, 46 per cent of those in full-time employment had superannuation; eight per cent of part-time employees; there were no figures available for casuals; 24 per cent of women working in the workplace; and 39.9 per cent of all persons employed. What is the story today? The 46 per cent in full-time employment in August 1994 has grown to 93 per cent. For part-time employees it was eight per cent under John Howard and the opposition members, while under Labor it has grown to 67 per cent. The figure for all those employed was 39.9 per cent and it has now grown to 87 per cent. We did not have a figure in 1983 for casuals but, in August 1988, when records of their superannuation participation commenced, it was six per cent and it is now 59 per cent. The figure for women was 24 per cent and it is now 85 per cent. I would like to think this is something both sides of parliament could be proud of. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we on this side of the House are intensely proud of those figures. Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I seek leave to incorporate the table in Hansard. I have taken the courtesy of speaking earlier to the duty shadow minister.",100

We have allowed private e-terprise to grow. Regrettably, from my point of view, only about 24 per cent of people employed in private enterprise are unionised. So an· overwhelming majority belong to the category they think they should belong to. Those opposite want to attack the fact that ordinary people should be entitled to protection and should maybe just have some rights in law. They should not be left, like some poor staffers have been-as was pointed out in an earlier contribution by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham)-,-at the mercy of a Liberal minister in my state, a Liberal backbencher in my state and now another minister in Victoria. Workers are entitled to work cooperatively with their employers, but they also are entitled to protection-and 1 do not understand these attacks. (Time expired)",102
131,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"O'Connor) (5. n p.m.)Just prior to making my remarks relative to the appropriation bills, I express my regret  what was a very moderate way, and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), in a much more determined way-which seems to be a consistent attitude displayed by the member for Werriwa-chose to raise an issue which . l;<ull-time· Part-time Total Persons Persons Casuals Females 60% 25% 53% 15% 44% (a) 80% . 42% 72% 39% 66% 88% 54% 80% 41% 76% 67% 87% 53% 82% 67% 87% 59% 85% only included persons with membership of an scheme.

Of course, if we want to go down that road, the member for Werriwa and others might find themselves gettirig into considerable trouble in the personality stakes. Mr Bevis-You have never been down there before. Mr TUCKEYI know alI about it.

The member for Werriwa, of course, carries two patches, not one, of programming material which you get in your caucus. He comes out with rubbish, rot and personal attack. Some of the things that the member for Werriwa was saying about our shadow minister for industrial relations was patently silly and unnecessary. Let me conclude on those remarks by just simply saying: if you want both sides to play according to what is in this bill, cut it out; it gets you nowhere. Do not worry about me. You can check the Hansard record as to the things 1I have said and done in this place; in fact, they do not talIy with the sorts of myths you are trying to generate now. Layoff, otherwise the blues will get quite serious. That is it, and that is what you will get. Let me tum to the budget. ",103
132,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I think you said little. It is just a pity that you said it right at the end. The other bloke cannot open his mouth and talk seriously on matters in this place; he just comes out with this garbage. The member for Swan (-r Lilley) is the other one over there. He and I had words yesterday about rubbish and behaving in a way that those opposite cannot justify. But let us leave it at that. Let us get on to the issues about this budget. I thought we might just start by touching on the fundamentals. They are pretty interesting when one looks at them. There are a couple of pages in the budget paper which analyse in simple terms what has happenedtotal personal taxation is up 13.6 per cent in collections; company tax is up 15.4 per cent in collections; total income tax is up 13.5 per cent in collections; and sales tax is up 22.3 per cent in collections. Of course, very substantial amounts of money are involved in all that: $7Y2 billion, roughly, in personal tax; $2.3 billion in company tax; $10.3. billion in overall income tax; and $2.5 billion, nearly $2.6 billion in sales tax. This will have a huge impact on the people of Australia-they have to pay them. The first point to make is that this is a budget which we were promised would never happen. The last election was all about taxation-and we do not deny it. The difference between the coalition and the government is that we informed people honestly and up front as to our intentions and offered them a total tax package which did not increase their taxation but only redirected the incidence of taxation. By comparison, we had the Prime - inister standing up saying that he had passed l-a-w, law, and that, under his government, people could get a tax deduction, which he had already passed, if they voted him back into office. There is the evidence of the tax deduction; there is the evidence as to how much you can believe a Keating promise during election time-tax is up massively. The other side to the equation is in outlays, and I think they are well worth looking at. Defence outlays in real terms have been reduced again. VVhen we look at public debt interest, one of the most tragic pieces of evidence of this budget analysis is Commonwealth budget outlays. Public debt interest is shown to be $10.077 billion. If we go back up the table, we find that Defence outlays are $9.992 billion-about $50 million less than public debt outlays. VVheneyer one gets into the fine print of the budget, it is probably arguable as to where some of those public debt interest payments are made. As far as I can remember, we get to that situation over a long time. It is a fact that interest outlays are exceeding Defence outlays and they are fast overtaking education outlays-and that is not a healthy sign. It is my intention to come back to that particular point a little later in the debate. Consequently, I thought it might be worth talking for a minute about this debt and the effect it is having on Australians. I did not bring the relevant newspaper article in with me because I might have referred to it before, but there is no doubt that Australia has an embarrassing current account problem. VVe now have six or nine continuous months where the figure for the current account deficit-the difference between what Australia sells to the world in all the different categories and what it buys from the world in all those different categories-has been exceeded in terms of what we have to borrow from the rest of the world to match up with what we sell to the rest of the world. The gap between the two has been in excess of $2 billion a month-month after month-and the government tells us that it will probably add up to $27 billion for the year. All the money bor:' rowed adds to a figure of about $160 billion to $170 billion, which is what Australia owes to the world. I had a letter recently from a constituent, quoting her sister, who is a good solid Labor supporter, who stated that it has nothing to do with the government's actions and that it is all to do with that nasty private sector of the 1980s. It goes on with all this childish and juvenile logic that suggests that government and government borrowing is not a major contributor. VVe know from those interest figures I have just quoted and from other documentary evidence that the federal government under Keating economic management owes about $100 billion, up from about $15 billion when Malcolm Fraser left office. If we owe the world $160 billion and the Australian government paid back its $100 billion, it is reasonable to argue on the basis of national savings that we would owe the world only $60 billion. This is the silly thing about these arguments. I have forgotten what degree the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) did at university, but apparently there was no bookkeeping or fundamental arithmetic in his education. He was running around with a little campaign. '(hey get these little patches as to what they are to repeat, even though they do not know what they mean. The simple fact is that they were boasting that the federal government does not owe any money overseas, and that is an absolute-fact. But anyb9dy who suggests that the federal government can borrow $100 billion of Australia's domestic savings and not have an effect on our overseas debt is plainly stupid. Of c()urse it flows through. It is possible that, for the purpose of lending the government that money, some financial institutions have borrowed overseas. You cannot have governments putting that sort of pressure on domestic savings and expect that not to have an effect on our overseas debt. Furthermore, following the Keynesian principle, if you overspend as a government it has an effect on economic growth. As Mr Keynes pointed out, this can be a very positive thing in a recession but a very negative thing when you have economic growth. The government has, or should have, known for some time that economic growth was being achieved in the marketplace. It is a very silly thing for it to continue to borrow and spend as it did in the last budget and run a deficit when in fact it was out there competing for Australia's savings with the private sector and providing probably, at least in arithmetic terms, about three per cent of the growth it was complaining about. Twelve billion dollars is about three per cent of GDP. I know that is a simplification, but the simple fact is that when you have an economy in growth you do not stoke it up with government spending just because you want to buy a few votes. Of course, the result was that those opposite had to take out the club of interest rates again. Where did they knock off the economy? It was in the private sector, the very area that does not provide the dole; it provides real jobs. The fact is that we still have some very foolish economic management. We have all this posturing about savings and the superannuation program. The member for Chifley has left the House, but I noted that in his remarks he was boasting about the massive growth in the number of people who now have superannuation. I do not dispute his figures that there are a lot of people now listed in the superannuation system. I just keep getting letters from. people who tell me that the growth of their superannuation funds is negative or that they have disappeared completely. We still have failed to resolve that in any practical and sensible way-like letting people, particularly in the casual and seasonal work force, which the member for Chifley made some remarks about, get a single superannuation policy and not be forced into award superannuation, which is jealously guarded by certain trade unions. It is going to be the only income they have got left before long, but the simple facts of life are that those people are getting money out of the system at the expense of the workers and, in fact, contributing in many cases to the total erosion of their superannuation funds. There might be a lot of people now listed and the numbers may be huge in terms of the number of people covered by superannuation. The simple fact is that when we get into it we find that they have not accumulated anything. I know of people with substantial superannuation accumulation who last year got advice that it had reduced in value, not increased in value. . Of course, what are we being told? The Prime Minister went all the way around Australia telling people of his wonderful example of how somebody was going to get $461,000 out of the policies announced in this budget. When? In 50 years time. You cannot trust a Keating promise from one election day to the next, so why would you trust that particular promise? Who are we talking about with that particular figure? We are talking about people on average weekly earnings, but they have to enter the work force in 2002 and, presumably, be 17 or 18 years old at the time. How could they be earning average weekly earnings, which presently stand at about $33,000 a year? What percentage of Australian workers, the people that vote for you, earn $33,000 a year? They do not. They are lucky to earn $20,000 a year. Average weekly earnings is a figure that is just what it says it is, but it is not typical earnings and it is 'not median earnings. Those people cannot expect anything like that out of this system. We do not know what $461,000 might bring. You might argue that the system will adjust in real terms. If it doesn't, let me tell youMr Bevis-It is a percentage of salary, isn't it? .",104
133,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"You say that it is a percentage of salary. I know lots of people-you can meet them in the street every day; in fact, your own lump sum figures were established on it-who signed up 20 and 30 years ago for a superannuation lump sum of $50,000. Let me tell you, you are not old enough to know that it was a fortune. Mr Bevis-You don't understand. Mr TUCKEYI understand it,' all right, because I have paid for policies and I have seen what they mean. I am a lot older than you and I have been around. I run businesses and I know all about it. I employ 40 people, I get superannuation for them and I see that they have very little coming out of your schemes. So do not tell me that you know, because you do not. This is just a problem with you. Mr Swan-What are you going to do?",106
134,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"You can keep quiet because I have told you what you are. You are a rabbit. Let me get back to my business and don't interject. The simple fact of life is that there is going to be very little buying power in some of these huge sums of money. When a house was worth about $7,000, people were being promised $20,000 and $30,000 in superannuation. When they got it, it barely bought the front door of the house, and that is another fact of life. I could take some more time on that issue, but I do not have' it. I cl-se on another cotilponentof where this government - as it is going; th-tis,Competi­ tion p6licy- We agree entirely with competition. We accept Professor Wimer' s suggestion that there' is $23 ,billion to'be gained' and obtained by a, proper competition policy, but Professor Hilmer did 'not say ,'a competitiQ9 policy for the states'. Professor Hilmer went as far as' to suggest ·that'eVen such thingsas the deregulation of the legal system and many of the professional systems' - and the labour market were necessa-'Y' to achieve, those results.' , We are now getting selective competition policy, which' says ,that state enterprise, JIiu1it do all the work, carry all the pain, and the Commonwealth need dO'nothit'ig about'lettirig Air New Zealand in,n,eed not make, up its mind about a sale of the' Australian National Line and will give - otal support to domination by the maritime unions' of ,our waterfront system, noiwithstanding the evidence, which is now legion, that that is not' working for Australia. Iri my' state we have ,a pretty interesting situation. One of ourJeading industrialists,has come out and tried to put some colllpetition on the waterfront. His nilme is Len 'Buckeridge. I am a bit of a gambling man and I am backing Len because I think Len, as usuill, will win. What you have to' realise about Len Buckeridge is that he is a self-made man and during his life he has cre,ated one of ',the greatest things for Western Australians in history. He builds about 3,000 houses a'year and he manages to sell a typical, four-bedroom, two-bathroom house with a dual carport for about $90,000. Any members representing another state who want to stand up and say that that is it common and typical price for a house.in their state can do so, but it is not. I know thadrom having talked to service personnel. On,e of their great ambitions is to be transferred to Western Australia, where they just might be able to own a home. Len Buckeridge has done this by using subcontract labour. Those subcontractors are earning $300 a day, and many of them in exceSs 'of $1,000 a week. Even if they choose to work only a few days a week, he does not underpay them and he does not exploit them. He has put together a good system for the workers. He has produced vertical integration. And he has not pocketed the profit; he has passed it back to the consumer. Now he wants to do that on the Western Australian waterfront where, amongst other things, if he were successful he might just make the Western Australian port of Fremantle a very attractive proposition for the unloading of a lot of eastern states freight. That freight could then be transported by rail, which would be quicker and overall would be less expensive. It would create a lot of jobs for people in Western Australia. I have checked it out. Len Buckeridge is not paying his workers any less than the wharfies who are working for Patricks or Conaust. But the people who work for him do a day's work for a day's pay because they are not tied to all the union mumbo jumbo. He has reduced the costs of unloading a shipping operation which loses about $19 million a year. He has produced prices that will save the Western Australian taxpayers $500,000 a year. We have got the Maritime Workers Union - supported in this parliament by this government-saying, 'You're not allowed to do that.' The unions tried to do this years ago. A fellow called Bill Ethel, who is well known to most people on the other side in the union movement, organised people to run around Perth pushing down the brick walls that had been erected by subcontractor brickies the day before. They were pushing them over. He did not worry about the price of housing for the people, the battlers, the workers of Western Australia; he did not worry about that; he just wanted to get control of bricklayers. Well, Buckeridge beat them. He is one of the great assets to consumers in Western Australia. That is the difference between us and those opposite. We know that competition and efficiency lower the cost of living for Australian workers. We can produce a legion of evidence about people being extremely well paid in the subcontract industry. They are not exploited. Some will whinge about it, only because they would like to get twice as much for doing half as much. There is plenty of money to be earned by people giving a day's work in that industry. They are not being exploited, but most particularly Buckeridge is not exploiting his customers. He is passing on those gains. That is what we want for Australia. Then it will not be necessary to constantly increase wages, because people will be getting benefits in what they buy. Then Australia will be able to compete in this new APEC region which you have created but which you do not know how to run.",106
135,Mr SWAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"This year's budget is about our future: the future of ordinary Australians, and the future of Australia as a trading nation on the fringe of Asia and the Pacific. At a time when the world is becoming acutely more competitive, this is the budget that deals with those challenges. This is also the budget of a Labor government; a government that stands for fairness, for security and for the creation of not only more jobs but more secure jobs, better paying jobs and jobs with careers. It is a budget that promotes equality of opportunity in education and jobs. It is a budget which shows compassion for those who are the victims of illness and other misfortune. It is a budget for sustaining and strengthening families and for maintaining the dignity and security of those who have reached old age. We have to realise that we must be vigilant to defend these goals and to defend the values underlying these goals; the values of a cohesive, safe community built on secure families with a secure future, built on secure careers and built on a prosperous economy. In the United States, the Republican Partya party which the coalition admiresidentifies itself with an all-out attack on these values. The coalition wants to attack these values of caring and compassion and, like the Republicans, it wants to substitute greed as the rule of politics. The Republicans in America put forward a contract with America. That contract is admired by the conservatives in this country. But it was not a contract with the whole of America; it was a contract with only part of America-the wealthy part. It was a contract with those who already earned high incomes. It was a contract to give low income earners a worse deal. It was a contract to give high income earners tax breaks and to slug the poor with higher taxes. It was a contract for lower wages and higher taxes for average income earners. It was a contract with the rich, not a contract with America. The same is reflected in the approach of the conservatives in this country. For years in Australia there has been a dominant clique of economists in the universities, in organisations like the Institute of Public Affairs and in the coalition who have ceaselessly preached the destruction of care and compassion. It has been the values espoused by those people that have been rejected at election after election. The decisions made in this budget will be crucial for the future not only for our older generations but also for our children. We are a medium sized trading nation of only 18 million people. We have great resources. Our greatest resource is our well-educated work force. But, unless we have creative and new policies for the future, we cannot hope to maintain our high standards of living and to protect the values that I spoke about earliervalues dear to the heart of all Australians: the values of security, of care for our fellow citizens, of mateship and, the cornerstone of our society, the family. The centrepiece of this budget that promotes those values and those policies is the superannuation initiative, which will stand alongside universal health care as one of the two great social reforms of Labor governments in the late 20th century and as probably one of Labor's greatest economic reforms alongside the rebuilding of our manufacturing industry. As a country we are having difficulties with our balance of payments, but as a country in the OECD we are not alone with that problem. The opposition in this House should look at the current account records of its model conservative governments in the OECD. Labor, unlike John Major and other conservative heroes, is attacking this problem at source. The attack on this problem at source is our long-term superannuation plan for the 21 st century. The cost of servicing our foreign debt contributes to our balance of payments difficulties, which have been exacerbated in recent times by a very long and hard drought. There are two elements of the budget which go to the core of attacking our debt problems: government borrowing and private sector borrowing. These are addressed specifically in the budget by bringing the budget into surplus: a surplus of $718 million this year; and next year a surplus of $3.4 billion, including a structural surplus after taking out the effects of asset sales. The primary aim of this budget is to take the pressure off interest rates by reducing the government's call on savings and particularly by reducing the call on overseas capital. The central purpose of this budget is to fund more of our capital requirements from domestic savings. That is the heart of the superannuation initiative. We need to stimulate savings in our community to provide that capital, to fund the record levels of investment that are building long-term secure jobs in our community. When the future of Australia was at stake in the Second World War we had a national savings policy. Now our foremost national economic challenge is a shortage of national savings. So we must again build a national savings policy and a national savings plan. The superannuation initiative in this budget builds on previous superannuation initiatives from 1983 onwards-put in place painstakingly by the government. Had previous conservative governments had the foresight in the 1970s, we would have had a national savings policy. It is once again the task for Labor to rebuild a national policy out of the shambles created by the conservative parties. Just as they destroyed our capacity to be a competitive country in the 1960s and 1970s and virtually decimated our capacity to be a trading nation, particularly in the manufacturing sector, they did the same to our savings. Just as we have painstakingly rebuilt our manufacturing sector and made this country 40 per cent more competitive so that we are now exporting more than we ever did, we have to now put the final building block in place for a national savings plan. The federal government will be supporting the inclusion of provisions for employee superannuation contributions in all industrial awards. These will begin at one per cent of earnings in July. 1997 and rise to three per cent of earnings by July 1999. In addition, the government will match dollar for dollar contributions paid by employees into their superannuation accounts. Those employees currently paying into their funds will not need to make additional contributions to be eligible for the matching government payment. What could be a more concrete example of our determination to encourage savings rather than consumption? When these new initiatives are added to the Labor government's previous reforms such as award superannuation and the superannuation guarantee charge, Australia will be saving an extra $18 billion each year and building a pool of superannuation savings to the order of $2 trillion in 2020-money that will go directly to slashing our reliance on overseas capital. The benefits of this will flow to the whole community, will flow towards building a more prosperous economy and will flow directly into the pockets of average working families. The new arrangements will significantly boost retirement incomes. A couple now in their mid-30s on average weekly earnings will receive retirement incomes 75 percent higher than the age pension. These are very significant policy goals and are based on the values that I outlined earlier, the values that Australalready ians hold dear to their hearts-the values of security, of being able to stand on their own two feet, of self-reliance, of cooperation and of cohesiveness. In a rational world, you would think we should be able to reach agreement on a bipartisan policy for national savings, but instead the coalition has been unable to produce a shred of constructive criticism. All it can play is the same old cracked record of personal diatribe against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The bankruptcy of the opposition's attitudes is recognised far beyond the Labor Party. A report in this week's Australian business pages, hardly a platform for the Labor Party, told the story of a presentation made on behalf of the opposition by its superannuation spokesman-that is the one without the earring-to the Life Insurance Federation. It was a fiasco. To quote the commentator in the Australian: When Connolly had finished his presentation to the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, the industry heavyweights were offered the chance to question the opposition spokesman. But no-one wanted to know what was on Connolly's mind. The silence from the floor spoke volumes for the policy vacuum . . . Nothing could more dramatically illustrate the difference between a government with policies and the rabble of an opposition without them. It has a policy free zone. The opposition has the arrogance of refusing to stand for anything. The opposition is content to play the child's game of blindman's buff. It wants to blindfold the worker, spin the worker around and yell out, 'Run, run. The big bad wolf of Labor is coming.' Of course, if it were to do that, workers would hit the wall pretty solidly. Under the coalition there would never be a national income retirement plan for Australians and they could not secure those values that they hold dear to their hearts. Along with the abolition of the deficit, moving the budget into surplus and the major boost to private savings enshrined in the superannuation initiative, the third component of our attack upon the current account problem is the aim to be more competitive and to export more. We must continue, as we have done, to diversify our exports. We have gone a long way towards the goal of diversifying our exports. Exports of elaborately transformed manufactures have grown by 17 per cent a year since 1988. Services exports, another important contributor to the diversification of exports, have grown to 20 per cent of total exports. There has been a very substantial structural change in the Australian economy already. We now export something like 20 per cent of our gross domestic product compared with something like 13 per cent when the government came to power. That is an enormous structural change in our economy. We are exporting a lot more of the things that we did not traditionally export as well as exporting more of the things that we did traditionally export. Because exports have risen from 13 per cent to 22 per cent of GDP since the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was last an economic spokesman for a government, there has been a tremendous change in our economy-a change which makes. it possible to build on that 40 per cent more competitiveness that we have achieved by having a national superannuation plan. These are important changes for all Australians. If we are to continue to build on our competitiveness so we can export more and replace imports, we must continue'to have a highly skilled, stable and motivated work force. New skills are necessary to operate the more sophisticated manufacturing technology and to create different kinds of service industries. The work force and the economy, however, must have a stable climate of industrial relations with collaboration, not confrontatiori, in the workplace. Last year a publication called Leading the way, a study of best manufacturing practices put out by the Australian Manufacturing Council, illustrated this very well when it said: .. , an enterprise agreement is unlikely to be successful if the ingredients for co-operation-open and honest communication and trust-are not there There are some rogue elements among employers who are happy to see disruption if they can achieve their reactionary end of driving organised labour out of the workplace and denying mainstream Australian workers the right to organise collectively to protect their conditions and wages. The last thing Australia needs at the moment is stupid cowboy employers, such as the fellow in Western Australia, provoking industrial unrest absolutely unnecessarily. The future the coalition sees for industrial relations in this country is the future that people like Mr Buckeridge see, which is a low wage, low skill work force. You look to America and you desire the American outcomes. Labor governments want a high wage, high skill work force, not a low wage, low skill work force. The vision the coalition has is a low skill, low wage work force. Unhappily, people like Mr Buckeridge are being egged on by the opposition spokesman, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who has a very direct connection with that shonky operation going on in Western Australia. . Australian workers have been prepared over the last decade to accept substantial wage restraint. They have done that to make this economy 40 per cent more competitive and to make sure that we export more. What is their reward for that from the coalition? An attack upon the industrial relations award safety net. The assertion made by the member for Flinders was that they would abolish the no disadvantage test in the existing system and thereby drive out the award system altogether. The whole notion of individual contract, which is continuously supported by the opposition, puts individual workers in the position of accepting a pay cut or the sack. The Jeff Kennett model is the coalition's model. The coalition supports Premier Kennett's recent move in Victoria to cut the minimum wage from $20,000 a year to $17,000 a year-$60 a week for low paid workers. That is its vision of Australia. We know what the opposition thinks about these matters but rarely does it say too much in public. Those opposite want to hold back workers' wages, abolish the consensus of the safety net of award conditions and try to justify themselves by pointing to the United States, which is an example that they laud. In the US the minimum wage is derisory. The Republicans, on whom the coalition plans to model its next election campaign, want to abolish even minimal protections workers have in that country. The American Secretary for Labor, Robert Reich, went out of his way at a. meeting of the OECD last week to express his concern at the attack on wages and working conditions in the United States. He stated: . .. low and declining incomes strengthen the social fabric of our nations, With unemployment it spawns disillusionment and cynicism among economic losers, creating fertile ground for demac gogues. , . The demagogues in this country are the members of the coalition. They think they have found some fertile ground but, when we explain to the Australian people the coalition's support for the Jeff Kennett alternative-abolishing all minimum standards-and its . attack' upon. fundamental pay for' the individual given through overtime, Australian workers and the Australian work force will reject the coalition. Mainstream Australians deserve the right of safety net. conditions. They deserve to share in the' prosperity they create through their wages. After playing their role it). holding down inflation during the period of a worldwide recession, what would they get under the coalition? They would get further squeezed because all safety nets, protection and the umpire would be abolished. Nowhere is this more evident than in the issue 'of overtime. The opposition does not believe in minimu- conditions. Overtime is historically a vital income supplement for many workirig Australians. Tall poppies like those on the other side have never depended on overtime. Ordinary workers' do, and those opposite have contempt for them. Those who want to attack safety net conditions will have all the supp6rtof the coalition. Those Australopposite, ians who have suffered unemployment in the recession are 'riow seeing a very substantial turnaround, with the creation of something like 560,000 new jobs since the last election and very considerable falls in unemployment. What is different about this recovery and the current job creation is that this time. long-term-unemployed are being picked up in the recovery':""""-picked up through a set of interventionist Labor government policiesdirected at ensuring that we do not have intergenerational. unemployment in this country and all the social and economic consequences that that would bring to society. The initiatives the gov.ernment has put forward in the white paper summarise so much of what this government is about .and, in its reaction, so much of what the opposition is about.

136,Mr ANDERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I heard somebody a moment or two ago make the comment that the member for Lilley' (Mr Swan) must eat Labor Party propaganda for breakfast, lunch and tea. I can only assume that that is an accurate reflection because what we have just heard is unbelievably narrow, unbelievably disinterested in and divorced from any sense of reality. He is unbelievably naive in his reluctance to face the reality that over the last 13 years it has been the people opposite, with their mates in the Aero and the union movement, who have presided over the most significant decline in living standards, take-home pay levels and, by international standards, the relative, well-being of Australians that the country has seen for many decades. It is the principles of and approach to industrial relatioQs by those opposite that have contributed to the blight that we find ourselves in so many ways in this country today. To hear those sorts of glib assertions from an up-andcoming member. of-what do they call that thing over there, the A team? Mr Sharp-The, D team.",111
137,Mr ANDERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No; I mean the people who are coming up through the ranks. If that is the sort of contribution we are going to get from the future leaders of the party that sits pity help us. They want to keep us in the dark ages with the old us and them approach to industrial relations. I was not going to dwell on this-I was going to begin straight away with the budgetbut this is a related matter. I want to begin with a little story that first may appear to the have very little to do with what we have just heard, but I will illustrate why it does in a moment. When' I was in the UK about 18 months ago I was told a very interesting little story about something called BSE, or mad cow disease. It sends cattle mad when they get it. When this disease first emerged in Britain it did not seem to worry consumers very much until one of the infamous British tabloids ran a story about Mrs Smith's cat in some northern English city going mad after it had cleaned up the remainder of a Sunday roast. An instant panic set in, and consumers stopped buying beef. Beef sales dropped by something like 80 per cent. It took 18 months to get back up to normal levels of consumption. During that time mince sales remained largely unaffected. This reflects an extraordinary divorcing from the sort of common sense approach that we once had and an awareness about what we are really doing and what is really happening. People were apparently unaware that mince was beef, too. People operating in a void of real information and with an inadequate understanding of true realities will fall for glib-liners and misleading positions and make bad and unfortunate policy decisions. That has unfortunately become a very real feature of the industrial relations debate in this country. The rigid, highly centralised model we have· is undermining wages and conditions for Australian workers. It is keeping them at levels that are simply unnecessarily low. This can be further illustrated by referring to a very major export abattoir that I know of in this country. Like so many export abattoirs, it was driven to the brink of financial ruin by poor industrial relations. Those opposite have talked about cowboy managers. What about the cowboys we have seen in recent years in the industry leadership pertaining to the agricultural industries and the value adding industries? This abattoir was taken right to the brink. In fact, I still have my doubts about whether it will make it. This happened purely by virtue-nobody really disputes this-of poor industrial relations. Do honourable members know where that abattoir went to find a manager who understood the necessity for a team game? I ask honourable members whether they know where that abattoir had to go to find a manager who could assemble its entire work forceseveral hundred people-and explain the truth by saying, 'We're going to work together as a team. About 160 to 170 of you will lose your jobs temporarily, but we'll get them back as soon as we can. We're going to do this together.' Do honourable members know where it had to go? Mr Lindsay-Tell us.",111
138,Mr ANDERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It had to go to New Zealand. Do honourable members know what the workers gave that fellow when he finished explaining to them how they were going to approach things? They gave him a standing ovation. Things are often not as they seem. It is a great pity that we hear in this country the sort of glib and stupid approach from up-andcoming Labor members that we just heard. Another Labor member, the member for  of respect for, touched on this subject a little earlier. He said he could not understand why we on this side were always so anti-union because in the private sector work force we have what we claim we wanted anyway: massively declining density of union membership in the private sector work force. That is right. He said it is down to 24 per cent. That is lower than I thought it was. The honourable member asked why we keep criticising involvement of unions when they are no longer influential. The answer is found in the comments made by John Halfpenny. A little while ago he said something to the effect that it had never occurred to him, that he would never have dreamt, that during his lifetime he would see a situation where union membership declined to such extraordinarily low levels and yet the union movement had more influence than ever before by virtue of having-I think he used this term-what amounts to a de facto presence in cabinet. That is the problem. The member for Chifley unwittingly highlighted the very thing we are so very critical of: the union movement still having a massive influence and massive capacity to disrupt when it so chooses. I know many union representatives are very responsible, but they still have a grossly undue capacity to influence workplace outcomes at a time when Australians are voting with their feet, when they are saying that they want to be able to do things independently of union representation. What we are saying is quite simple. It is actually pro-choice; it is pro-freedom. It actually fits in with the International Labour Organisation obligations that your mob, Mr Deputy Speaker, keep saying fits in with them in their commitment to freedom of association. But the mob opposite does not believe in it. We say that every Australian ought to have the absolute right to third party representation in the workplace if they want it; if they do not want it they ought to have the absolute right to not be represented by a third party. What could be more free? What could display a greater commitment to the rights of the individual in a democracy than that position? I throw the challenge out. I am as against bad and unfair management and oppressive employers as anybody else. But, until we get a situation where employees and employers actually identify their own future together in a spirit of mutuality and work together to take a place forward, like in the export abattoir I just mentioned, we will not get the better wages and conditions that, in my view, does need. I am quite happy to put on the public record that I believe many Australian workers are underpaid; that they are not receiving decent recompense for difficult, tough working conditions. But, until they are given a real opportunity to work constructively together to work out better ways to do things, I do not believe that that will change. It really means removing the monopoly rights of certain institutions in this country to interfere with genuine enterprise bargaining. There are times, such as the aftermath of a budget, when the community thinks that all politicians on both sides do is oversell their case. I thought today that I would begin by actually referring to some industry and media commentary on the recent budget. They are, if you like, the third party observers, the people who really know what is happening and who· do not have a particular axe to grind-some do; some do not; some are on our side; some are not. Nonetheless, let us just see what business and industry have to say. Let us begin with the Australian Mining Industry Council. You, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, represent a seat where the mining industry is very important, so you might be aware-I hope you are; I hope that even in the wilds of the Hunter Valley you have heard this-that Australia has a massive trading deficit. We have a very real problem in this area. The major Australian exporter is the mining industry, so the Australian Mining Industry Council had a great interest in the budget. It said: The ... Budget shuffles the - ards with real risks for the economy in the longer term. It achieves surprise surplus, but by way of measures lacking real credibility. The Executive Director of the Australian Mining Industry Council, Mr David Buckingham, said: It was a huge ask to expect outcomes of the kind foreshadowed with asset sales. It is a Budget that also relies unduly on revenue measures-such as increased company and sales taxes. These measures will be quite counter-productive in their effect. One would have thought that the government, with all the assembled wit of its advisers, could have seen that. It must have seen that. So why did it institute arrangements that are quite counterproductive? It obviously intended to look for a short-term electoral gain. It is a political budget, a political document, rather than one committed to sound long-term planning. On the proposed increase in the corporate tax rate Mr Buckingham said: It will simply discourage business investment which is necessary to increase the level of economic activity and employment opportunities. So I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you put that point of view in caucus on behalf of those people who depend on investment in the mining industry in your electorate. The Business Council of Australia ought to know something. about employing people and generating prosperity. That is what it is paid to do. It said: The increased revenue measures of $2.4 billion fall primarily on business and are a disguised attack on the present and future incomes of ordinary Australians. It also said that growth and jobs will suffer as a result. The Institute of Chartered Accounts, speaking about the sales tax rise on cars-and this is an interesting one-said that the increase on a small sedan like the Daewoo would be about $470 and on a family car like a Falcon or a Holden around $1,000. It also said that it is a burden the car industry will have to carryon top of the changes to the FBT arrangements, which had occurred just before, and that it would hurt our international competitiveness and so forth. There is a lot of hypocrisy spoken by those opposite about the car industry and the environment. That was highlighted to some extent in here today. We were told a couple of years a ago that we had to increase the cost of leaded fuel to encourage people to use more unleaded fuel. In reality, the best way to do that is to encourage more Australians to buy new cars. But, at a time when we ought to be encouraging Australians to update their car fleet, at the very time when I would have thought we would have wanted to encourage the Australian car industry, because it is facing a new onslaught from Korea-the Japan of the 1990s where car exports are concerned-and it will be very difficult for it in the next few years, and at a time when the car industry desperately needs to get its volumes up on the domestic market if it is to increase exports, what does the government do? It kills off improvements in the motor vehicle industry just as they start to emerge. Let us come back to the environmental aspect. Government members are really a mob of absolute hypocrites where the environment is concerned. Ever since Graham Richardson's days, it has been perfectly obvious that it has been about votes; it has little to do with facts, sound policy or true environmental outcomes. Here is a classic example. I find this quite interesting. According to the Australian Automobile Association, Australia's car fleet is amongst the oldest in the Western world, on a par with Brazil and not far behind Mexico and Greece. Mr Bruce Scott-:-That's just about where we rank economically.",112
139,Mr ANDERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is right. It is a pretty good indicator. The Australian Automobile Association also said: The slow rate at which motorists ing their old cars has seen the average age of our vehicle fleet rise from about 8.5 years in 1985 more than 10 years. This is from the lobby group for the industry, but it ought to know. As a result of what the government has done, the replacement of the car fleet will slow down. The government's environmental credentials really just do not stand up. That is really all there is to it. The utter furphy that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) dragged around in this place during question time today about how the industry had recovered so the government could put the sales tax back up to where it really belonged-ignoring the fact that it cut it to match the arrangements we went to the last election with anyway-is utter stupidity. It is a typical Labor approach. The minute the government sees an industry start to move again, what does it do? It cuts it off at the knees. The government hates success. That is the trouble with your lot. They hate success unless, of course, it is success by their mates. They enjoy seeing their mates succeed. Unfortunately, it rarely has anything to do with the quality. Let me go on. What did the newspapers say? I think it is important to see what they said. Sometimes we on this side do not think the newspapers and the media are terribly friendly to us, but let us see what they said. Trickery is something that often comes to mind with the current government-and with good reason. The Australian Financial Review uses that term, too. It said: . .. the Prime Minister and his Treasurer, Mr Willis, have resorted to every financial trick they know Unfortunately, that is an awful lot. It went on to say: The result is a stunning headline figure-a Budget surplus of $718 million, a dramatic reversal of the expected $12.1 billion deficit in this financial year. It went on to make a very relevant point. The previous member actually spoke as though he believed, and wants us to believe, that long term planning and sound long-term social and economic management are at _the heart of Labor Party policy· when, in fact, this whole thing is a political job. The Financial Review have been replacwent on to say: to While this strategy may end up being a political masterstroke, from the point of view of the Australian economy it is a bitter disappointment. . .. the Government has ... fudged the hard spending decisions, cashed in government and put its hands in our pockets for more tax revenue. The Australian said: The Keating Government's 1995-96 Budget is an audacious lunge to regain its economic credibility in the final year of a disappointing term . . . When it is a quarter to midnight for Australia and When we really cannot afford any more disappointing terms, that is what we have had. The Australian went on to say: This Budget has Mr Keating's fmger marks all over it. Make no mistake, this is a taxing Budget. The Herald-Sun picked up on the view in the community that the only legitimate approach by the government at the moment is one of enormous cynicism. It asked the question: clever, but is it the answer? It said: The 1995 Budget is a ... slick marriage of political and economic imperatives. The fingerprints of Prime Minister Paul Keating are all over it. He has designed it with an election in mind. The 1995 Budget is aimed at the unions and others who support the Government needs. The Sydney Morning Herald reported: There is precious little in this Budget which attacks the crippling current account problem. Mr Keating will no doubt be hoping the considerable deficiencies of this Budget are not exposed before he can gear up for an election. That is what it is all about. The newspapers are exposing it and, in many ways, it is gratifying that we do not have to do it alone. The informed commentators have seen straight through this budget. We know now from the polling that the Australian people are singularly unimpressed with it. They do not believe it. And why should they? When we look back at the promises of the government over so many years, we have seen everything-from the prediction in 1987 by the then Treasurer that, 'The nation is successfully emerging from its most severe economic crisis in a generation,' to, 'This is the one that brings home the bacon,' and, 'Our foreign debt burden has already stabilised and begun to fall.' Good grief! Mr Hawker-What was it then?",114
140,Mr ANDERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I can tell you that it was a lot less than it is now, and a great deal less than it is going to be in another 12 months. In that budget figure is the damnation of the government's economic approach for so long. The government has revealed that it expects a trading deficit of $27 billion over the next 12 months. I find it amazing that we get these monthly figures now which are well in excess of $2 billion. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) made the point very powerfully during his speech that the deficit we are facing is horrendously serious, yet we are constantly told that we are on track. But on track to where? There is nothing in the budget that adequately deals with this approach. The government says that it has wound back government expenditure, yet the reality is that it has not. It has a surplus which, by all accounts, is dodgy and is recognised to be dodgy. How are we going to achieve those asset sales? Is this the fourth time we have sold Qantas? How many times do we have to sell the Commonwealth Bank before we finally realise an outcome on that? We had the situation where the Australian people were conned so that Labor would win the 1993 election. That was the greatest fraud that we have seen from a government which practises it and has made it into an art form. We have· now seen the whole thing being repeated for the next election. What was promised by Mr Keating? He said, 'I will not put up taxes. What I am promising is not to put up taxes.' But the government has put up taxes by about $9 billion a year. In conclusion, I can only say that this cannot continue. The sooner we bring it to an end, the better for all Australians, particularly those future generations that will have to wear the cost of repaying our debt. It is quite obvious that those opposite are incapable of developing a long-term, sound strategy for dealing with that crisis. Therefore, the sooner the government calls an election so we can pass judgment on it all, the better. (Time expired)",115
141,Mr SNOW,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Eden-Monaro) (6.13 p.m.)Opposition members are great at giving half the story. They spoke about the overseas debt, which is about 37 per cent of GDP, but they failed to mention our overseas investments and assets, which are about 31 per cent of GDP. That is not too bad when you subtract one from the other. The full story is not always appropriate, but they do give it. Opposition members have also concentrated on the difference between the headline surplus of $718 million and the measure of the underlying deficit of $8.2 billion, included in statement 7 of the budget documents, as if the government is being deceptive. They have talked about a political job. They are great at talking about government receipts and saying that we are falsifying the figures, but they are not very good at talking about government outlays. The government has made a number of outlays, and opposition members have never asked for them to be excluded from the budget. They have never said that it was wrong to include in the budget outlays the cost of the Snowy Mountains scheme, which is about $800 million; the cost of the Antarctic division allocation, about $40 million; or the cost of the transport infrastructure allocation in the past year, about $210 million. They do not mind that we put that in the budget. In other words, they are quite happy that we include assets we are spending money on in the budget, but they are not particularly happy that we include the assets that we are disposing of. They cannot have it both ways. We have spent $30 million on railways, $4 million on the Asia economic centre, $80 million on the Australian Tourist Commission, $29 million on Aboriginal hostels and $6.6 million on the national telephone typewriter relay service. One could go on listing these. All these are outlays which opposition members have never objected to being included in the budget figures, yet they object to the inclusion of receipts if they involve assets. They are being quite hypocritical. They are telling only half the story when talking about the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. The truth is that we have also made some major expenditure savings. It ought to be mentioned that, using the traditional measure, the budget result for 1995-96 is a surplus of $718 million. By any measure, there is a substantial turnaround in the budget deficit for 1995-96. By any measure, the budget will be in surplus in 1997-98 and in substantial surplus in 199899. Expenditure savings have been achieved in employment, education and training. That is partly due to the success of the government's Working Nation program. In 1994-95 we had an estimated appropriation of $3.2 billion, with an estimated expenditure of $2.8 billion. We have achieved savings of about $300 million in labour market training and assistance. We have achieved this because we are getting people back to work more quickly than we anticipated. The unemployment level has dropped and this has meant savings. It has meant that we have not had to keep training and labour market programs at the level that we had. That is a truth that ought to be known. It is being revealed now to people as we tell those in our electorates about the budget. Members of the government-and I hope the Independents-have been telling people what is happening; that is, the labour market training and assistance programs are working. Every scheme has improved on the other. The old RED scheme was improved on by the wage pause scheme-other than the fact that it was a wage pause. The wage pause scheme was improved on by the community employment program. The community employment program was vastly improved on by the current labour market training and assistance programs. Even if we get only a 20 or 30 per cent dividend, we are getting results and getting people off unemployment benefits and into the work force. Looking at it from a purely economic point of view, those people are paying taxes. There have been major gains. What a lot of people do-and the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson) is guilty of this too-is tell only half the story, They do not always tell the story that we in Australia have other important likes apart from higher wages. For instance, we like a reasonable lifestyle. This became evident to me again last week when I was in Cooma and visited a local restaurant. I met an Italian who came out during the Snowy Mountains scheme and married a lady from Indonesia. They were both from countries with very hard working people. He said, 'We have decided that we will have one day off a week-Tuesdays-so that we will work six days out of seven. We are adapting to the Australian lifestyle, and it is something that we appreciate. We don't want to die young. We have children to look after, and we think it is better for our children if we put some time in with them, because they have to put up with us working in the restaurant day and night.' They are people who have selected our lifestyle. At the height of criticism of the former Victorian government about its budget balancing, Melbourne was rated in one world survey as having the highest lifestyle in the world. That includes education, transport and a range of other services. In Australia we like services, regular holidays and the occasional public holiday-other countries agree with us-and it does not seem to affect our standard of living. The opposition neglected to mention that very often a social wage has to be incorporated with the wage that people are receiving from their employer. Some people get benefits through the additional family payment, the Medicare system or the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This all has to be included in the social wage when we compare ourselves with other countries. Honourable members that say that we ought to be like Asia are not asking us to be like Asia. I visited Singapore not so long ago. I met a taxi driver who was in his forties. He said that he had worked seven days a week every day since he had started in the work force. He had not had a day off. He had not had a holiday. I said, 'What's your aim?' He said, 'I want to retire eventually. I'll have enough money to retire and I'll be happy.' Mr Hawker-What's he going to retire on?",115
142,Mr SNOW,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,I did not ask him what he would retire on. I would say he would retire on a very good income. But here in Australia we are not preparedMr Hawker-A hell of a lot more than we do here.,117
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"When the honourable member for Wannon speaks, he will expect to be heard in silence.",117
144,Mr SNOW,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I do not think we should be prepared to work seven days a week, 52 weeks a year for the whole of our time in the work force. It is a choice that we have· to make. It is only when you come into parliament that you have to forgo normal working hours and conditions. You can work 80 to 90 hours a week, but that is our choice. The taxi driver in Singapore has a choice, as do taxi drivers in Australia. For most people the choice is to have the occasional holiday and to have time off. Before I came into this place, I worked three days a week in a business in which I was a partner. The combined income of my partner and me was more than I make for working much longer in this parliament than both of us did together.",117
145,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,We agree with you on that.,117
146,Mr SNOW,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am pleased to get agreement from the honourable member for O'Connor on that matter. While I am talking about lifestyle, I mention the expenditure of $13 million over four years to reduce the incidence of youth suicide. I believe we have given far too little attention to young people and their needs. We give quite a lot of attention to older people, but we do not think about young people nearly enough and the trauma that young people are suffering out there today. It is easy for older people to criticise young people and say, 'They need to pull their socks up. It was much more difficult in my time, yet we were able to amuse ourselves. We weren't bored.' What people do not realise is the trauma that young people face. However, when I left work my problem was working out which job I would take. I had a choice of jobs. When young people leave work today, their problem is actually finding a job. This is due to technological changes. A lot of families have two people working and a lot of families have no-one working. There is a challenge for young people that we have to meet. The drop in our unemployment rate is commendable, but we need to do more. I applaud this funding over four years for research and development of a program which deals with youth suicide. Far too little is being done not only for young people but also for families. In the enormous restructuring I have been very surprised. I have appointed a student inturn, Gerry Cirulli. He is a mature age student who has been doing work for me on the effect on families of restructuring in the timber industry and the threat that is imposed by indecisiveness by governments at both levels and by the prolongation of decisions relating to entry into logging areas. I am going to release these findings in the next few weeks. The report indicates that very little work has been done in Australia and worldwide on the effect on families of restructuring and uncertainty relating to their employment. I am looking forward to that report. We need to talk about what happens in families and in the home. What happens when people suddenly feel threatened about mortgage repayments; when women have to go out, as they do in the timber industry, and guard equipment when the male is at home; and when children are uncertain because their parents are often out either lobbying governments or guarding equipment from sabotage, as has happened in our own forests in the south-east region of New South Wales? This puts uncertainty into the family and it also creates divisiveness. It can discourage cooperation within the family. It can create problems at school. It can result in family breakdown. There are a lot of threats on families, I believe, at the moment through uncertainty in the timber industry. I applaud the fact that there is a proposal by government to bring more certainty back into the timber industry. Just recently, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) released a wood and paper industries strategy which aims to cut through this forest impasse. The strategy is to establish a framework to support a vibrant, value adding industry based oli ecologically sustainable forests and plantations. There are starkly different views across the community about the management and use of our forests, especially our native forests. I hope this report will lead to action which will bring more certainty into the forest industry and land management as a state and a territory responsibility. But it is clear that the community-not just environmentalists but also people in the forest industry-is looking to the Commonwealth to take a leadership role in breaking the impasse that exists. The basic premise of the discussion paper is that it is possible and desirable to build strong, value adding wood and paper industries while protecting the high conservation values of our native forests. I support that and I look forward to its implementation. I look forward to early action so that we can have assessments and a combined scoping study with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy working together so that we do not have the fiasco of last year where we had different departments coming in at different times and material was not available to government until new licences were almost needed. Licence needs to be by region, not by coupes. I appreciate that governments have had a lot of problems in getting together the state and federal policies, particularly in New South Wales where we have recently had a change in government. We have had real problems in developing coordinated action by government. There is no excuse for that continuing. We must have licensing by regions so that the state and federal government can get together and say, 'Here is our region. We believe you can take X amount of tonnes in woodchipping for export. Here is where we propose that people should be allowed to go in.' It also requires honesty. It is clear now that, when you are dealing with some of the environmental groups, you have people that have shifting goalposts, people who can never be pinned down. One of our Green senators from Western Australia said, 'No, I'm not in favour of plantations. That's monoculture.' What would that do to our country, to our wheat farms, to our sheep farms, to our pine plantations if we wiped off monoculture like that? You cannot do it unless you are about pretty severe negative growth. We cannot accept that sort of argument. The major parties have learnt-if they have not, they need to learn-that we have to look at the truth. We are not going to have successful industries, taking into account the important environmental concerns, unless we face the truth about those industries. The truth about the forest industry is that we can have an integrated logging system which includes sawmilling, which includes adding value to that sawmill timber, and which includes woodchipping, preferably adding value here in Australia with pulp mills. This means you face the truth about the environmental concerns about the pulp mill, but you can have pulp mills that are environmentally sensitive. The truth is that the export of woodchips is part of a very important relationship that we caucus. have with Japan if we do not value add in Australia. We have a $4 billion trade surplus with Japan-it buys $4 billion more from than we do from it. The woodchip industry an important part of that trade relationship. think it is wrong for us to condemn woodthis chipping for export when it is profitable the forest industry. It would certainly be preferable if we could add value in Australia. I believe that if we can develop our sustainwhat able forest industries and add value in Australia then the primary industry part of this budget will bring successful results.",117
147,Mr HAWKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I eignty. must admit that I found it fascinating listening to the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) think up excuses for why his government has failed in so many ways. He talked about the problems of administration. But Labor has been in power for 12 years so that must be direct result of poor ministerial supervision his colleagues. He talked about the lack value adding in the timber industry. But was the Labor Party that condemned Australia to the situation where we could not have new state-of-the-art pulp mill. It was the Labor Party that would not allow it to be rugby. built. I found it quite extraordinary to hear the weak excuses he put forward. Unlike most of his colleagues who have spoken in this debate, the member for Monaro at least tried to talk about some things that are being done. Most of the govdenigrate ernment members who have spokep. in this debate have spent most of their time trying attack the opposition, which I find fascinating. Clearly, they are worried. More importantly, this tells us that they are ashamed of their budget. They are ashamed of it because they know it is a fudge-it budget. They it is full of untruths. They know it has been concocted to try to cover up the failures of the government. They seem to follow the Goebbels theory that if you say something that is not true often enough then people will start to believe it. They all seem to come in with the same lines. They are like a line of robots; they come in one after another and mouth the words of the minister.",119
148,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,They put patches on them in,119
149,Mr HAWKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"They wear the patches and then they go back into their boxes after us they have made their speeches. This is government's 13th budget is an example I where Labor has, more than ever before, let great country down. It is similar to when for you have termites in your house; if you do more not do anything about them and do not treat them, they can do great damage. That is really Labor is starting to do to this country. Not only are we seeing the damage that is being done to our economy, but we are seeing the damage that is being done to our soverI will address a couple of those issues. In relation to our sovereignty, I find it fascinating the way the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) seems to think that when he travels overseas he can take attention off his own domestic failings by telling overseas leaders a what they can do in their countries. He has by just been to Japan where he told the Japanese of how to run their economy. He tells the Gerit mans how to design cities. One wonders whether he will go to Egypt and tell them a how to build pyramids or whether he will go to South Africa and tell them how to play When the Prime Minister goes overseas he also seems to take great pleasure in denigrating his own country. He cannot speak about Edenthe Australian flag when he is overseas of because he apparently feels that he has to it. One only has to look at television reports to see the astounded looks on the to faces of some foreign leaders when he is in their countries and starts to attack one of our icons or to run domestic issues. If the Prime Minister wants us to gain independence and be a republic, obviously we need a stronger know that nation not a weaker nation. When we look at what has happened to this nation under Labor, there. is one thing· that really stands out-that is, the frightening rise in foreign debt. We have heard some lame excuses from members of the Labor Party for the poor level of Australian investment overseas. What they overlook is that the foreign debt keeps rising. The current account deficit has been over $2 billion month after month and the government keeps saying, 'It's not quite as bad as we thought. It was not $3 billion.' The $27 billion deficit that the government expects this year amounts to a debt of $1,500 for every man, women and child in Australia. If we look at the forecast for next year, what do we find? We will have a deficit of another $27 billion. The government says that it is a record, but it has been stabilised. That means another $1,500 debt for every man, woman and child in Australia. That is some record. We know what will happen if we keep running up debts year after year. A good example is what Labor did in my home state of Victoria. The state is in dire trouble because debts were run up to the point where the government had to sell the State Bank. Many people have reminded me recently that you can never trust Labor with money. That sure is true. We should look at the way the financial markets of the world are rating our performance. We only have to look at what is happening to the Australian dollar. I find these figures quite frightening. In terms of. the trade-weighted index the dollar is at an alltime low. This year we find that the Australian dollar has fallen by 22.8 per cent against the Japanese yen. Remembering that Japan is our No. 1 trading partner, this is a very significant point. We find that against the German mark the dollar has fallen by 17.3 per cent and against the New Zealand dollar it has fallen by 11 - er cent. The Labor Party seems to like to belittle New Zealand, but it must be doing something right. We find that the dollar has fallen by 10.6 per cent against the Korean won. Korea is our second biggest trading partner, having overtaken the United States. Against the pound the dollar has fallen by 9.6 per cent and against the US dollar it has faiIen by 7.6 per cent. It is clear that, when the Prime Minister talks about trying to build up sovereignty, what he is in fact doing is undermining it because he is not running the economy properly. This budget is just another example of that. When the Prime Minister desperately looks for his place in history he may well find one, but I do not think it is going to be the one that he wants. He will be known as the man who single-handedly, and more than any other Prime Minister this century, has set about running Australia down and making it a second-rate nation by sacrificing our economic sovereignty. When we talk about trying to build up the sovereignty of this country, we look at the economy and we find that we have failed the real test. In question time on the 11 th of this month, the Prime Minister made an extraordinary statement. He said: When every member of this House has left it and been replaced by somebody else, the thing in Tuesday night's budget that will be there supporting the country will be the changes to superannuation. On occasions government members have tried to make something out of this, but he is talking decades ahead. We know that the Prime Minister could not even keep a promise of three years ago and yet he is·expecting us to believe that decades ahead somehow this magical promise will be fulfilled. If we look at the whole question of why this sudden shift to big promises in relation to superannuation and government funding for superannuation, we find that it is a smokescreen to hide the fact that the l-a-w tax cuts have completely vanished. Just to remind all honourable members, before the last election the Prime Minister told the people of Australia, 'I am not going to make promises about tax cuts because they are law. We have passed them through both houses of the parliament. They are law.' After the election, what did he do? He made another law which reversed the first one. No wonder there is such cynicism in the community. No wonder people do not trust this Prime Minister.. When we look closely at some of the big figures on superannuation that have rolled off the Prime Minister's tongue-such as over $400,000 and so on for retirement benefitsand when we look at the small print, we find that this benefit may be available to the grandchildren of the current members of this chamber when they are looking at retirement. A package of that size will not be available for anyone other than those who start work after the year 2000 and work for 40 years. Let us come back to what it means for people in the work force today. The average 40-year-old worker who is earning $600 a week and contributing three per cent of his salary to the government on a dollar for dollar subsidy, plus his employer's contribution, will retire on $5,616 per annum, or $108 per week, in super. That is what the Prime Minister is really promising people in that age group. Let us look at someone who is a bit younger, say, a 30-year-old in the same situation. He will get 33 per cent of his wages, or $10,296 per year. Someone who is 50 will only get seven per cent of his average income, or $2,184 per annum-$42 per week. That is the sort of level of superannuation that will be available for people who are currently in the work force. It is a far cry from the sorts of figures that the Prime Minister bandies around as though some magic wand will be there for everyone. It will not be there for everyone; it will be there for our grandchildren. The other great con in this budget is the supposed balanced budget. Much has been said about the fact that these will be far bigger asset sales than have ever been undertaken by this government. Again, those proposed sales are far greater than what this government was able to achieve when it promised to do the same thing in the past. The tax increases are what I think the government has been desperately trying to hide. I have spoken about the fact that the w tax cuts have now vanished. But we find that overall an additional $9 billion will be collected by the government through tax in the coming year. Fuel levies are going to go up by another $1 V2 billion, which, again, will hit transport. Transport is one of our most important areas in trade, yet the government keeps taxing it. Sales taxes are going to increase, including sales tax on cars, which will raise $2.1 billion. Company tax is going to go up about nine per cent from 33c to 36c in the dollar. As I have mentioned, the promised l-a-w tax cuts have now vanished. This budget, more than any other, has vanished very quickly as the public, the media and people-particularly those in the business community-have realised just how bad it really is. In fact, this budget has not even had a honeymoon period. It was rejected straight away. I will come back to a couple of these taxes and look at a simple example of sales tax. Sales tax is going to hurt small business. On 10 May, the Prime Minister made an absolutely amazing statement about small business. He said: ... if they're feeling the pinch they ought to say, 'small business is not for me'. Because it's never going to get any better. This is as good as it ever gets. That reminds me of a former Labor Prime Minister who said, 'You have never had it better.' He did not last very long, maybe that is the message here. Let me give you an example of what a sales tax increase is going to do to a small business operator in my electorate, and this is typical of many small battling business owners. One of my constituents currently runs a small manufacturing business. The only way he can remain competitive is to stay below the threshold exemption for sales tax. In other words, he does not have to pay any. Currently, the sales tax on the product that he manufactures is 11 per cent. On 1 July it increases to 12 per cent, but the threshold remains the same. That means that the tax-free threshold, from the point of view of production, drops from $91,000 to $83,000. Because the demand for his product has l-a- doubled, he was going to increase his work force and put on two people. He was on the verge of employing them but because of the threshold he is going to drop that idea. So two people are on the dole who otherwise would have been employed, which is another example of what tax increases mean in terms of employment. It is all very well for ministers to come in here and say, 'Tax increases don't affect people.' Of course they do, and that is a simple, clear-cut example of a businessman in my area who is going to cut back on his production because of the tax increase. Let us look at what is going to happen with building materials. Every Australian's dream is to own a home. The price of houses is going up by $2,000, even though before the last election this government said that it would not increase taxes. In talking about the increased sales tax on cars, it was a funny thing for the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to come in here today and say that the government only took the tax off while there was the recession-the recession we had to have'-and now it was putting the tax up. The fact remains that Australia has one of the oldest car fleets in the OECD. The average age of cars is around 12 years. If the government wants to encourage people to upgrade their cars and use leadfree. petrol, it should not be putting the price of cars out of the reach of ordinary Australians. It is pretty obvious that Australians are finding it difficult to replace their cars now, without this increase in cost. Another way the government is· hitting the battlers is through the nice little slug coming in on fuel that will affect a number of people, including the railways. The removal of excise on certain light fuels in the budget will mean an additional $80 million tax on country railways. No doubt the government thinks that, by talking about the standard gauge link between Adelaide and Melbourne, it. can cover that fact up. The point is that people in the country particularly who rely on rail for their transport are going to find that the costs are going to rise. Yet again, it illustrates a government that is really not that concerned about looking after people in country areas. If we look at other areas in the transport field where the government has failed to deliver, it is again very illustrative of the that the government is no longer governing for all people but for its mates. Since we hear so much about the government's support' for the unions', what better example than the scandalous story of the waterfront. If we look at the so-called reform on the waterfront, we find that the government has committed oV,er $200 million of taxpayers' money to reform it and there has been a matching levy on all users of the waterfront. So over $430 million has been spent. Yet, since that reform, the performance of our waterfront has been slipping back. Why? Because the union there is starting to get back into its bad old habits and no-one is going to do anything about it. Frankly, this is a national disgrace. I come· back to the point about tpe extraordinary level of our indebtedness and the fact that we are running into the red by over $2 billion a month. We are expecting a current account deficit of $27 billion. In looking at one of the key areas that we could reform to make Australia more productive so w.e could trade our way out of some of these problems, and in looking at what has happened on the waterfront, we find that in Contship's most recent rating of 46 ports Sydney has dropped from 24th to, 31 st on that list, and Melbourne has, gone from 28th to 37th. The productivity of Melbourne, is now only 40 per cent of that of Antwerp a-d 66 per cent of that of Auckland-not a very pretty picture. I think it really is ,a national disgrace. When we look at this budget, we will see that it is going to do nothing for this country, but it will be noted for two things: first of all, for being the fudge-it budget, as it has been so aptly named; and, secondly, how quickly it has been dismissed by informed people throughout the community as not doing anything' worthwhile to help this country get back on its feet. Clearly, it shows just how tired this government is. It shows how the time has come for a change in government. I think this budget must surely be the last that Labor has the opportunity to deliver in this decade. (Time expired)  fact p.m.)-Much as I respect the honourabl.e member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), after listening to his contribution over the past 15 to 20 minutes, I am disappointeq. that l,1e runs. out the same old cliches, the. same old excuses, the same slogans, that the opposition has lived on for so many years. I have to spend some of my time now rebutting the same old cliches. It is like the opposition has learnt a song but can never forget it. At the time the tax cuts were legislated prior to the last election, the unanimous call from the opposition was: 'You cannot afford it; you shouldn't be doing it.' The opposition has been saying the same thing ever since'You cannot afford it; you shouldn't be doing it. You shouldn't give people those tax cuts.' Even now when the tax cuts and the benefits are coming through in superannuation, which I will deal with a little later, we get the old thing-'We wouldn't do it, but you shouldn't do it either.' Over and over we get that repetition. One day we will hear something constructive. One day we will hear something that is thought through rather than hearing the same old repetition. No-one could possibly forget the great catch cry of the 1977 election campaign in all of those TV commercials and newspaper as-the fistful of dollars, the tax cuts that disappeared six weeks after the election was won by those opposite. This was when the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer. Please, do not belabour us with claims that you have some credibility. You do not have credibility on this is.sue. Your record speaks for itself. You come in here whingeing because the Australian work force is going to get access to greater superannuation benefits and a decent sort of retirement income because this government is addressing that issue of retirement income through superannuation. If you do not like it, just say that you do not want people to have superannuation, because that really fits in with the policy the conservatives have had year after year after year. When we came to government in 1983, less than 40 per cent of Australians had access to superannuation. Today, just under 90 per cent of Australians have access to superannuation. If one looks at the opposition policy-the little bit of it that we can see that seeps out between the cracks-we see that it is for optional superannuation, which takes us back to the old system that we had when the opposition was in government previously and in the decades before that. We all know the great problem that we have to overcome in this nation-that is, to increase private saving. One cannot have legitimacy and credibility and talk about foreign debt and living off the savings of people abroad on the one hand and oppose measures that are going to substantially improve the level of private saving in this country on the other. The government's moves in respect of superannuation have those two objectives: the first is to generate a substantial increase in private saving in this same nation; and the second is for that private saving to then be utilised to develop Australia's industry, develop our own plant and equipment, provide our own investment capital, so that the reliance on private firms and private sector borrowing abroad can be reduced. The great bulk of national debt abroad that is outstanding is not government debt-certainly not debt from this government-it is private sector debt. When we look at the overall attitude of the opposition to taxation, superannuation and savings, it is totally transparent. It just does not have credibility. I find it very difficult to listen to the member forW annon, who is usually much more researched and more factual in what he has to say in this place than he has been just now. He complains about the increases in indirect tax, as I have heard previous opposition speakers in this budget debate comment on, politely forgetting what coalition policy was at the last election. They can carry on and say, 'Yes, we were going to reduce that tax, get rid of that one; we were going to bring in a 15 per cent GST and prosperity would reign forever.' The reaction was that people did not believe you. They did not believe you then; they do not believe you now. You do not believe it yourselves really. One of the fascinating things in the last parliament was watching the faces on the other side when out the front leader Hewson would say, 'All those in favour of GST.' You were mutinous over there. One could see that you did not really believe it, but the leader was saying it, and he ought to know because he was a good economist, but he was not really a politician. So those behind all sat there watching. They went like lemmings to the precIpIce. That is what happened. But the reality is that the people of this country will not accept that kind of measure. No matter how you whinge now about some changes that have occurred in indirect tax, they pale into insignificance in comparison to what was being proposed by the opposition. Since the budget was brought down, I have also seen the organised clamour by the opposition and some of its agents, in respect of small business, and heard how badly done by small business has been in respect of the increase in company tax from 33c to 36c. One needs to put this in perspective. When we came into government the company tax rate was 46c in the dollar and there was double taxation of dividends, which had a horrendous impact-it had been there for decades under previous conservative governments. We increased the corporate rate to 49c, then cut it back to 39 per cent and then reduced it further to 33c. Then, of enormous benefit to companies, in the mid-1980s we abolished the double taxation of dividends. That has been of enormous benefit to business in this country. It is never recognised, never adverted to by those who sit opposite-they probably do not understand it-but certainly is adverted to by most businesses when they look at budgets and talk about measures that have been achieved by this government. Then we come back to small business. About 80 per cent of small businesses are not companies, so the change in the company tax rate does not affect them. Yet that is the line being peddled out there by those opposite. The most important issue for small business is how to improve and maintain sales. What do you need to improve sales? You need a growing economy. What have we got under this government-a growing economy. From the middle of last year we heard from those opposite, 'The economy is growing too fast; there's going to be inflation; there's going to be a boom and bust cycle again.' The economy has steadied down due to the measures taken by the government. What we are about in this budget is maintaining a rate of growth that can be accommodated in this country without inflationary pressures, that at the same time generates jobs and creates a climate in which the pressure for further increases in interest rates recedes. That is very much what is being achieved and has resulted in the days since the budget was presented on the 9th of this month. Interest rates have dropped., There is an expectation that the economy is settling down. Recent figures are pointing to, that, and it is clear from the business sector that that is what is happening. The most important issue after sales for small business is lower interest rates. It is utter hypocrisy to be running around the country clamouring to small business how terrible it is that the company tax rate is up. Four out of five small businesses do not pay company tax; they are not companies. The opposition says that inflation will go up. The inflation rate is forecast to be 2Y2 to three per cent over the cycle. We have had 2Y2 to three per cent inflation for the last three years-the longest period in more than 20 years that there has been such stability in the inflation rate. Interest rates have gone down-not up. If one is genuinely looking to assist small business we' need a steady growth in the economy, lower interest rates, a lower rate of inflation and steady growth in employment. From that growth in employment comes the additional demand. Those opposite refer to a $9 billion increase in tax revenue next year. If we have more people joining the work force, there are more people paying tax. A major contribution to that increase comes from the fact that there are'more people at work and able to pay tax. So I have great difficulty with some of the comments we hear from the opposition. The comment is also made that the increase in the excise on light diesel fuel is taking extra money from users of that form of energy. If you look through the budget papers you will findthat distorted demand developed for that quality diesel. People were previously using a heavier form of diesel which carried a higher excise rate. Because there was a difference in the rates there was a distortion in demand and demand just shifted across so users could avoid the higher excise rate. It is not a matter of suddenly increasing the rate; it is really restoring the status quo. I know that there will be some changes in it but you cannot compare one without the other. We go back to the old catch cry of 'the waterfront, the waterfront, the waterfront'. How many times do we have to hear about the waterfront? Maybe some day someone on the other side will actually go down to the waterfront and see what happens, see how things work, see how those 25-year-old cranes function and how fast they can lift up. Maybe one day they might even try driving one of those cranes themselves, and see if they can drive it faster or if they can move the truck faster, or if they can drop the container onto the truck faster. I doubt whether they will do it. We will be back here again hearing, 'the waterfront, the waterfront, the waterfront'. There is $1 billion in potential savings to be made by businesses in moving their products, their goods, to and from the waterfront. It has nothing to do with members of the Waterside Workers Federation, who are now the Maritime Union of Australia. It has nothing to do with government regulation or decisions by this government. It has all to do with the competence of business management. Show me a transport decision maker in any firmimporter or exporter-who is on the board. The people who make decisions about despatching goods and receiving goods are well down the totem pole. It is usually the purchase clerk or the dispatch clerk. There is a host of inefficiencies, mismatches and a lack of coordination all along the chain, from the warehouse to the wharf and return, from shipside to warehouse destination. It does not help industry or business to become more competitive by encouraging people to sling around slogans and chants. If the major firms are having difficulties with waterfront services, they are privately owned stevedoring firms. It is not just a matter of members of the union. The work force has virtually been halved. We have gone into record levels of imports compared to when the waterfront reforms were made. Yet we hear the same old cry. One issue that has been deliberately avoided in all of the shouting and screaming that has come from sectors of industry and from the opposition is that when the changes and reductions in numbers were made on the waterfront the demand and the container throughput were considerably less than what they are today. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot have the work force and increase the throughput of containers and say, 'We have not improved anything'. Something has got better. When we look at the performance indicators that came out of the committee of this parliament, the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, and the indicators prepared by the Bureau of Transport Economics, we see that there has been improvement. If there is something happening at the moment, the way to go about it is to examine it and get people together, identify the problem and develop the solutions-not hark back to the old slogans of the past. I have outlined to an extent the key objectives of the budget. They are to maintain growth in the economy, to reduce the pressure for further incre!;lses in interest rates, to maintain a low rate of inflation and to maintain growth in employment. Generally that is happening as a result of the budget that has been introduced. That will proceed. I am very confident about that. In the past year we have had a growth rate in employment, which looks like concluding at the end of next month, of about 4% per cent. We are looking to a growth rate in the coming year of about 3% per cent. We are looking to a growth in the number of jobs, or percentage rate increase, of around three per cent. The inflation rate I mentioned is 2Y2 to three per cent. What has to be said in this place is that we promised at the last election that we would create 500,000 new jobs in the life of this parliament. We have created 550,000 new jobs already. The unemployment rate is down to 8.3 per cent. We have also seen a variation in the participation rate,· and that has an impact on the unemployment rate. There has been a considerable increase in employment. As we said in the Working Nation statement of last year, we were going to give preference to the long-term unemployed. There has been a reduction of 25 per cent in the number of long-term unemployed. The provisions in this budget under the Department of Employment, Education and Training will continue to give that preference and continue to reduce the number of long-term unemployed. The long-term unemployed are the people who have been suffering most in this period of high unemployment. They are the people who have the greatest difficulty in getting back into the work force. That is why I am so pleased, particularly in my own region of the Hunter, that we see people getting back into the work force, getting a start, getting some current skills, getting some independence and getting back that dignity and freedom that come with having real work. It is not an easy job and it is not all going to be done rapidly. The important thing is that it is happening and continuing to flow through. The part that you and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, are both aware of is the development of regionalism by this government. I am pleased that there seems to be recognition from state governments that regionalism, led by the federal government, is something to be a partner of and not something to be afraid of. Whereas in the past we saw state governments opposed to regionalism, now my observation is that the state governments are more receptive of regionalism and more likely to particiticularly pate in it. In the Hunter we have developed the Hunter Regional Development Organisation. We have had a number of regional organisations over the years, the first one dating to the floods in Maitland in 1955-the Hunter Valley Research Foundation. In the years since, various organisations have been developed, with differing purposes and at differing times. They all see themselves as important. They all see themselves as having a prime function in the regional economy. What I am so pleased about in regard to the development of the Hunter Regional Development Organisation is that we have brought together at a most senior level, at chief executive officer level and at chairperson level, those organisaNewcastle tions. They are all marching in the one direction for the first time in the history of our region. It does not matter how fast they are marching; the important thing is that we are all going in the one direction, sharing in and developing a regional approach to the economy of which we are all part. That development is very special to me and very special to the people of our region. There is one last matter I will mention in the time available to me. I pay tribute to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). He brought the legislation through this parliament in the latter part of the last financial year that gave merchant mariners who served in World War II access to the same benefits as defence personnel. That is something he has been praised for right across Australia. But we also must praise former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys), and his successor, Senator Faulkner, as the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, for giving recognition to the need there. On Sunday next, at Norah Head on the central coast of New South Wales, we will be unveiling a memorial. The minister will be there to do that. Each and every one of you is welcome; it is a public occasion. But, as I have said, we will be unveiling a memorial to merchant mariners from that area, commemorating and recognising the importance of the central coast of New South Wales, but parNorah Head, to Australia's defence in the desperate days of World War II. lt was just off Norah Head that the first Australian merchant ship was sunk by German action in World War II; it was there back where the sinking took place. The vessel, coming down from Coffs Harbour, had its stem blown away by a German mine. No-one knew that the waters between Newcastle and Sydney had been mined-and no-one was told at the time it happened, either. Then, almost 18 months later, on 3 June 1942, Howard Smith's ship the Age was attacked; there was open fire by a Japanese submarine 1-24. It escaped to the safety of Port Newcastle. An hour and a half later BHP's Iron Chieftain, on her way from to Whyalla, was torpedoed by Japanese submarine 1-24 and 13 men lost their lives. That was the first Australian merchant ship sunk on our east coast by Japanese action. So that lighthouse looked out and virtually watched those two events take place-German action and Japanese action. I invite everyone to be at the unveiling on Sunday, Mr Deputy Speaker, yourself included. (time expired)",119
150,Mr RICHARD EVANS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I join the debate this evening on Appropriation Bill (No.1) to support my colleagues and place on record my and my constituents' concerns about this very shabby budget of politics we have received. After listening to the government speakers on the other side, I would comment that they really have not justified, with any substance at all, a number of the initiatives-although they do talk as though there is substance, they do not actually apply it here. Tonight I speak for Linda Thomas. She is an organiser of the Choices for Families group"" which is very 'concerned about the destruction of the family by this government through the discrimination it shows in its child-care policies. I also speak' for Anita Percival. She is concerned about the health system and the health of her young son, Sam, who cannot get adequate care. Whilst she and her son join ever increasing queues waiting for so-called elective surgery, her son remains in pain and will probably do so for about 18 months. I speak for Kim Whitlock. Kim is a small businessman who could be driven almost to bankruptcy through the corrupt small business policies of this government and the huge whack his business has received in this budget. I also speak for Shirley' and Walter Brennan. They are self-funded retirees who live in premises i,n a location which was opened in my electorate by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) so warmly but has since been ignored, with regard to the funding of much needed amenities, by that particular member and the government. I al;o speak 'for Rebecca, Landis. She is a long-term committ-dxesident, of Australia, who has beep. here for about five years. She now has to 'pay for tertiary education up front-unlike others who are attending university-and is also losing her Austudy entitle ment. I speak for David Farrell. He is a young man of about 19 years of age who has not worked since leaving school. He recently was threatened with the loss of social security benefits, if he would not comply with a totally unsuitable training program. This program has been billed and is being advertised currently as 'six months of sun and surf'. His sensitive skin which creates the possibility of skin cancer does not allow him to spend six months on the beach learning to surf. I speak for all those Cowan residents who are frustrated with a system of government which allows for the continual disintegration of living standards within Cowan; where social security is becoming a dominant feature of our, society; where our young cannot get jobs and cannot get places in university after finishing year 12. I speak for those residents who worry about crime, the increasing national debt and the constant policy lies of the government. The constituents I represent are very tired. They are tired of the false promises of the the Labor government. They are tired of the whining minority, which is always favoured by this particular government at the expense of the majority. They are tired of the gloom and doom so evident in recent years and which seems to have been overcome, but only with five minutes of sunlight-and we are going back into the doom and gloom again. They are tired of that talk. They are tired of being taken for granted by this governmentand really they are tired of this government. They have had enough of this government in Cowan, they have had enough of our country's leader treating them with disrespect, and they want a change. I can assure them that, while I represent them, they will have in me someone who will continue to put before this parliament their concerns. I have recently surveyed, and I still survey, my electorate. There are three matters that really concern my constituerits. The first, a local issue, is crime-petty and juvenilewhich is probably brought about by a number of social issues-and, if you look directly at - it, maybe the lack of opportunity and hope for young people. My constituents' major national issue is the debt-and the honourable member previously speaking said, 'Well, we really haven't got any debt here; it's all commercial or private debt.' That is not right. The electorate actually believes there is a debt-and there is one. I also asked my constituents that, if they were to spend 30 minutes with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), what they would talk about. Each of them has suggested that they would like to talk about his retirement. So I am sure that in a marginal seat like Cowan these particular issues will be of concern at the next election, and I am sure it will be a safer seat-for the Liberal Party. The people in my electorate are very concerned about this particular budget. The budget is a typical example of the corrupt way this Labor Party will do whatever it takes to hold on to power. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might recall former Senator Richardson talking about 'whatever it takes'. There are no truer words being used when speaking about and reviewing this particular budget. There are three points I would raise which will identify how corrupt this government is about drawing up this very shonky budget-in particular 'whatever it takes'. The budget delivers nothing but delusion in a lot of areas, and delusion so great that Harry Houdini-you might recall that movie; I saw it just recently-would be proud. The first point I would talk about is whether we are in debt or in surplus. Some of the government speakers have waxed lyrical about this great achievement-a surplus. In fact, they have suggested that we have a surplus of $718 million, or thereabouts. The Prime Minister has made a point about the significance of this figure; he has said, 'It's great, the Labor Party's back on track again, and we're now winning; we're winning, we are in surplus' - but are we really? If we observe the budget papers, we can see that the government has tried to con the people of Australia again. If we turn to page 7.3 of Budget Paper No.1, we can see the truth being revealed. On this page we can see that the great con has been exposed. According to ABS figures, the actual figure-that is the true, the real figure; the most important figure, as the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Prime Minister have said-is an $8.232 billion deficit. That is a deficit, not a surplus. Hasn't the Prime Minister bragged about a surplus? But this actually says a deficit. Haven't all the other speakers raved about this particular surplus? How come there is a real deficit? The reason for this, I think, is that we have had some creative accounting by the Treasurer. I think the Treasurer should do my tax refund this year because then I would get a refund. He has virtually done the impossible with some creative accounting. He has turned a deficit into a surplus .. The amusing thing about this fact-that is, turning a deficit into a surplus-is that a lot of people on his side of politics and his back bench actually believe what he says. But I do not think it is the Treasurer. I think there is a bit of a conspiracy theory here. I do not think the Treasurer has actually done this work. It reminds me of the former Treasurer himself- Mr Bringing-home-thebacon, the old ham himself, the Prime Minister. The actual fact here is that the deficit is $8.2 billion or thereabouts. So are we winners or losers? Let us look at expenditure and income for confirmation of how we are being conned about the surplUS. Next year, 1995-96, we will spend a total of $129 billion. Not bad. If we spend $129billion, we will expect to collect $129 billion. But what is the estimate of total collections? Total collections are $124.5 billion. So there is a bit of a deficit there. We are talking about a surplus, but we are seeing that we are collecting less than we are spending. Therefore, how do we create a surplus on our operative year when we are collecting less than we spend? What the Labor Party has done this year is sell assets to pay for our expenditure costs. What normally happens in the electorate? If, for instance, you had debts and sold some assets, what would you do with the money raised on the asset that you sold? Would you retire some debt and reduce your overhead that way, or would you spend it on the gro ceries? A lot of people would retire their debts, particularly the mortgage, but the government is actually spending the money on the groceries. It is actually spending it on expenditure. That is not to say we should not sell our assets, but the profit we make really should be used to retire debt, not to pay for the way we live. To gain a book surplus this year, we sold assets to cover our operational costs. Any small businessman would know this, but the trouble is that business is very lacking from those on the front bench, and even the second bench, of those opposite. They do not have the experience in business to understand what it means when you spend more than you actually collect. The budget i,s shonky because the figures just do not add up. A deficit is a deficit no matter how you try to hide it, and hide it the government has really tried to do. The second point I wish to discuss is the myth about the Labor Party. That so-called caring, sharing institution is so caring that it will provide tax reductions and even tighten up expenditure until it really hurts. That is basically what it said it was going to do in this budget, all for the sake of its own constituency, the true believers. They are probably called the few believers now. ' Speaker after speaker for the government, and those interjecting, probably believe this particular bit of rhetoric. They have tried to convince us that they are responsible and that they are working hard to reduce tax and reduce tax on their own constituency and the needy, et cetera. How can this be? Those in the Labor Party try to tell us that they are a low taxing party. It is stretching credibility to the limit to suggest that they are a low taxing party, because the figures in the budget just do not add up. For instance, the Medicare levy, which is a tax, is going up 7.5 per' cent. Building products are now to be rated at 12 per cent for wholesale sales tax. Sales tax on cars has shot up 33 per cent. Company tax is up nine per cent. In fact, revenue will increase a staggering $2.4 billion. That sounds like a tax hike, yet those opposite seem to fall at feet of the emperor and try to convince the Australian people that they can expect some tax cuts. How can the Australian people expect tax cuts when taxes are going up? No-one really believes this claim of l-a-w tax cuts, least of all those who voted for this party at the last election in marginal seats currently held'by Labor. I suggest to those opposite that they should consider the marginal seats held by them and perhaps start having some farewell parties. The Treasurer says that we are a low tax country within our region. This is truly a ridiculous claim. Only Japan, the country that Dr Paul tried to give advice to recently, is of similar taxing standards. All other countries, the so-called tigers like South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia Philippines and New Zealand, have less company tax than does Australia. I wait for a speaker opposite to explain how we can remain competitive within these markets when such high tax rates still exist. They are unable to because they come from a non-business background, a non-wealth creating background, and they cannot really seriously know how to create a dollar out in the market. It is a joke really, but it should not be a joke because it is very serious. The Australian community is beginning to wake up to the bluster of those opposite. The Labor Party is a high taxing party. The last point I will talk about concerns the real achievements of this government, so proudly bragging that it is working for the community and that it has all these policies that are helping the community. Where is the social consciousness of those opposite? They always say that they have it, but where is it, in fact? Let us look at some of the facts concerning the community at the moment, the constituency that they say they represent. The average duration of unemployment at the start of 'this parliament was 57.5 weeks. This compares with 32.9 weeks that prevailed when the Labor Party first came to power. The facts - uggest that it is harder to get a job under Labor now than it was when it first came to power. Where in this budget is this the issue addressed? It does suggest that expenditure on training programs has been reduced. Of course, employers have been slugged with tax increases which will ultimately affect their prospects of employing. Some more facts to ponder are that, after 10 years of Labor being in power, we now have th- startling figure of one in 10 Australian families with both parents out of work. Nineteen per cent-that is, over 700,000-of Australian children under the age of 15 live in a family in a household with no breadwinner. Twenty-five per cent of Australian families has no working member. Where are the benefits in the budget for these families? We should not forget that sales tax will rise by between three per cent and nine per cent on 1 July of this year as a result of the Dawkins horror budget of 1993. Some more figures which cannot be ignored are that the number of so-called traditional families in the category of unemployed and welfare dependent rose by 50 per cent from 1989 to 1993. The number of children who are members of welfare dependent families rose a staggering 166 per cent to 1.6 million in that same period. One hundred and six million Australian children are in welfare dependent families. Surely this is totally unacceptable in a wealthy country like Australia. But it does confirm that under this government the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. One in eight families falls below the poverty line. Poverty is increasing in almost every population group except the aged. Over two million Australians now live below the poverty line. Of all Australian families living in poverty, one half comes from traditional 'nuclear' families. Forty-four per cent of Australia's single parent families live in poverty. Taking inflation into account, one in 10 earners have seen their incomes rise by seven per cent since Labor took office. Over the same period, real wages for the bottom 10 per cent have fallen by five per cent. The top 20 per cent of income earners get 42 per cent of total earnings. The bottom 20 per cent get 5.4 per cent of total earnings. This budget does not address these particular' issues, so where is the great Labor Party and its caring attitude for the Australian people in this budget? The fact is that this budget is a sham. It is pitched to an already cynical electorate for the next election, but it will not work, certainly not in marginal seats. I give another example. The Labor Party says say here in this social security aspect that it is going to increase rent assistance by $5 per fortnight for families with children. That is a great initiative. It is actually going to cost outlays of $8.58 million. At the same time, the government increased rent assistance thresholds by $5 per fortnight. In the first yearof operation, it will outlay $1.7 million, which is not too bad. We are actually outlaying it, so it is not bad. But in 1996-97 we actually win $2.6 million; in 1997-98, $4.4 million; and in 1998-99, $4.7 million. Those opposite are basically saying that they are going to increase rent assistance by $5 for families-$5 does not buy a hamburger-but at the same time they are increasing thresholds and they are actually going to increase their income over the next couple of years. So this budget is really a bit of a sham. The budget has fudged figures. The evidence for this is the rubbish about the surplus and, in particular, the allocations of expenditure on the budget rent-a-car process of selling off the fleet. The budget is a high taxing budget. The evidence for this is the increases in taxes and the greatest collection of' taxes since Gough Whitlam. The budget does nothing for the real social issues within the community. The evidence is that there is no mention of any substance at all within the budget in relation to these issues. The Keating government really is on its last legs. Yes, IT is important; yes, APEC is important; and, yes, trading with our Asian neighbours is important-I think the government should consider the Indian Ocean region as well, in. particular, India-but so, too, are the Australian homeless and. those in desperate need. I think the Labor Party should get its priorities right. In.this budget it has not got its priorities right. It thought it was going to the electorate with an election budget, but it has not got it right. I think it is a budget that is seen by the community for what it really is; that is, a sham, a shonk. There are no real benefits in there for anybody except the Labor Party. Of course, we know what will happen in a couple of months time. Certainly in Cowan, I know what will happen.

152,Mrs SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Moncrief£) (7.30 p.m.)On several occasions in May 1993, I raised the issue of the presence and activities Japanese organised crime figures in Australia. Specifically, I referred to Masaru Takumi, who was and still is second in charge of-and the brains behind-Japan's largest organised crime group, the Yamaguchi-Gumi, which is alleged to have more than 37,000 members and a revenue of many billions of dollars year. Like other Yakuza gangs, it makes money from extortion, prostitution, drugs, gambling money laundering, protection rackets and fraud. Amongst other matters, I questioned how it was that such a notorious crime figure could have been issued with a four-year unlimitedMCConaghy visit visa to Australia. As a consequence my pursuing this issue, Takumi' s visa cancelled on 21 July 1993. However, there is no public record whether his wife's visa still valid. I also referred to the fact that he owned a luxurious sub-penthouse in Surfers Paradise. This property was purchased by Takumi 12 November 1987 for $887,500 in the name of a registered Australian company, Hamstead Pty Ltd. Stock Exchange records show that Takumi became a director of this company on 14 January 1987. On 12 September 1988, the name of the company was changed to Takumi Enterprises Pty Ltd, nominating its principal activity as 'real estate ownership'. I regret to inform the House that, despite Masaru Takumi's Australian and international notoriety, he is still a property owner in Surfers Paradise. Gold Coast City Council real estate and property records as at last Friday, 26 May 1995 show that the property elecin question is still owned by Takumi Enterprises Pty Ltd. I seek leave to table an extract from Gold Coast City Council property records. In May 1993 Australian Securities Commission records showed that the registered office Takumi Enterprises Pty Ltd was c/o Hill Taylor, a Brisbane legal firm, and that the principal executive officer was John Shand, a Hill and Taylor partner. The original revelation about Takumi' s Yakuza ownership of Australian property was made in an article in the Courier-Mail on Saturday, 8 May 1993. An Australian Securities Comof mission extract dated 19 May 1993 shows a notice of retirement of director was received by the Stock Exchange on Monday, 12 May 1993. An ASC extract as at today's date shows that John Shand ceased to be the principal executive officer of Takumi Enterprises Pty Ltd on 6 August 1993, and as from per that date has been replaced by an Edward its Beaumont of Coomera. However, the principal directors remain the same as they were in May 1993, namely, Masaru Takumi and Mari Takumi, his wife. Since August 1993, the registered office of Takumi Enterprises Pty Ltd has been c/o and Co., a Gold Coast accountof ancy firm. In other words, it seems to be was virtually 'business as usual' for Takumi Enterprises Pty Ltd. I seek leave to table two is Australian Securities Commission historical company extracts. It is appalling that this notorious Japanese crime figure can still own an Australian on company and substantial Australian real estate, despite being banned from Australia. It not only fills me with misgiving about the use to which that property is being put, but also raises questions about just how serious the Australian government is about combating the Australian activIties of transnational organised crime. I think this example raises profound issues which go to the heart of the Keating govto ernment's seriousness about law and order. few days ago, with much political fanfare, Attorney-General Lavarch and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced a new four justice policy. Undoubtedly, the choice of Brisbane.as the policy release venue was done to buttress the flagging fortunes of the Goss government, and the poor light in which that government currently appears on the issue law and order. However, there can be no law and order if organised crime is allowed to operate, whether overtly or covertly. As I said at the beginning, I raised this issue two years ago. The fact that Takumi still has a substantial stake in Australia shows the government has no intention of addressing what should be a relatively easy law and order issue.",131
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, that program. During her speech the honourable member sought leave to table three documents. Is leave granted? Leave granted. Schools Forestry,132
154,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise torial tonight to speak on a couple of matters. One is to mention a primary school in my electorstigmatised ate, Longford Primary School, which has put out a small newsletter. It has the motto 'Strive for success', which I guess is a very good motto to have. Within this newsletter I picked up a small page commencing with 'A flying start'. It deals with children in their early years starting off and how important those al. first three years of schooling are. The newsletter mentions the work that school is doing with its prep literacy program, how well that program is going in years 1, and 3 and that the students need all the support they. can get. In this school they certainly are. There is a program operating Tasmania which allows schools to pick. up other resources to continue with this program and to start this program in other schools in that area. I guess a primary school has got every right go out and bat for itself in primary educaA tion. It is good to see. The newsletter mentions there is no reason why we should have five secondary teachers while we only have teachers in the primary area for the same number of students. That is certainly true; it should not happen. We need to address that right throughout our country in the future. I saw in the editorial of the Sunday Age last of weekend that there seems to be an argument going on internally in Victoria on education, which has been happening in recent times. I . think that has got something to do with the attitude of that government in the way it treats people as it tries to come to grips with that its policy areas. The editorial mentions a program called LAP, which I do not know very much about other than it is an attempt to try to get a measuring stick on children between years 3 and 5. I wish them well in The Victorian Primary Principals Association is giving support to the need for literacy skills to be developed in those early days at school between K and 3. A Canadian educationist, Professor John Novak, is apparently visiting our country and speaking on those early days. But I understand that there are concerns in using measuring sticks. This editouches on the need to be very careful in that some parents feel their children can get by not passing some test and therefore they have got some brand on them. That is true. We have to be very careful in how that measuring is done so that it is not used to regress or send children backwards in some way. That is an important point which I am very pleased is picked up in that editoriThe editorial also mentions the inadequacy the of resources in some schooling systems. Of course, you cannot do anything unless you 2 have resources. There is a great need to make sure that the schools in our education system have the resources. For instance, it is wrong into have five secondary teachers while there are only four primary school teachers trying to teach the same number of students. That is wrong. It needs to be addressed. We need to come to grips with that issue when funding our education systems. I am very pleased that the Longford Primary School is out there in front giving leadership in its region. I am very pleased to have read its newsletter. I am also very pleased that the Commonwealth is funding several of those programs in that area. I think it shows that this government is getting on top of the needs in education. I am very pleased that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) is at the table. I would just like to mention his visit to my electorate recently where we announced many opportunities for putting One Nation funding into forestry jobs and into improving our training levels and skill levels in the forestry area of Tasmania. This is an industry which certainly needs to update its skills and to get on top of some of its old work practices and old methods. I am very pleased that we have a program going into Maydena, a town that was certainly left behind when the company there got out of old-growth forests. We have taken some of the young people to teach them new skills in cable logging. (Time expired) Dairy Industry",132
155,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"Over the last 12 months we have debated a number of bills in this place regarding the future of the dairy industry in Australia. At the end of last year we debated a bill which abolished the system that was known as the all milk levy. It was originally the Kerin plan and more recently the Crean plan, named after the minister at the table, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). It served to stabilise the dairy industry and it into the 1990s. Only recently we debated a bill which implemented the mechanisms that were going to be GATT legal, as it were, to allow that level of support for the dairy industry within Australia to continue. In both those debates I urged that the government proceed slowly when heading down the path with the GATT agreement, from the Uruguay Round into what is now the World Trade Organisation, and to wait and see how the other signatories to the Uruguay Round of the GATT were moving. I recently received in the mail the April edition of the Australian Dairy Industry Council's Milk matters. It was interesting to see one of the front page articles headed 'USA and EU to evade subsidy cuts'. The article reads: The Australian dairy industry is concerned that the United States of America .... and the European Union ... will avoid making substantial cuts to the volumes of subsidised dairy exports in the first year of the Uruguay Round ... As a result of approaches from the Australian Dairy Industry Council, The Minister for Trade ... will take the issue up with the EU and USA and will seek action in the World Trade Organisation. This will be the first real test of that newly formed organisation which is supposed to be the watchdog for free trade across the world. That will be an interesting test. The minister is evidently going to take that up with the World Trade Organisation and seek the support of the other me;mbers of the Cairns Group. The article continues: The USA already has indicated it will not count against the ceiling on subsidised tonnages, product exported under the Dairy Export Incentive Program ... announced in January. The first implementation year of the UR begins on 1 July 1995 ... That is one month away. It continues: The EU has indicated that it will follow the American lead by refusing to count against the ceiling on subsidised tonnages, product shipped in the first year of UR implementation for which export licenses are to be issued in May and June. The ADIC estimates the EU could increase its subsidised cheese exports by around 58,000 tonnes . .. in the first year of the UR by this means while the USA could gain an additional 39,000 tonnes of subsidised skim milk powder exports by shipping product after 1 July from prior DEIP bonus allocations. bring Those amounts are above their GATT commitment of subsidy in those products. Again I urge the government and the responsible ministers to be vigilant in this very important next stage of the implementation of the Uruguay Round. It is very important to what is an essential primary industry in Australia that is generating a lot of export income for this country. I know that the minister at the table put in a hell of a lot of work to maintain that industry at its current level and to see it go on to stronger things. There is this challenge before us now where the USA and the European Union are flagging the fact that they are going to fly in the face of that agreement that is yet to be implemented. A study by the World Bank has recently suggested that the full benefits of the Uruguay Round agreement would be less than was first thought, as a result of some countries evading their full obligations under the agreement. The Australian Dairy Industry Council has been keenly aware that some of Australia's trading partners interpreted their obligations in a way that minimised their offers of market access and delayed the pain of subsidy cuts for as long as possible. While the Australian Dairy Industry Council brought these issues to the attention of the Australian negotiators, minimisation remained the order of the day in the rushed final stages of the talks. It was not surprising that, with agriculture being brought into the GATT for the first time, many countries with higher levels of protection would take the softest option possible. That is exactly the point that I raised in two recent speeches on the two bills that went through this House. (Time expired) Derrick, Lieutenant Thomas Currie",133
156,Mr SA WFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"On 24 May this year I was given the great privilege of naming a memorial reserve and unveiling two plaques in honour of arguably Australia's greatest soldierLieutenant Thomas Currie Derrick, Victoria Cross, Distinguished Conduct Medal. To his friends and his mates he was simply known as Diver Derrick. The Thomas Derrick Memorial Reserve was a Port Adelaide Australia Remembers project made possible by the very generous cooperative support of the City of Port Adelaide. May 24 commemorated the 50th anniversary of the death of Lieutenant Derrick on the remote island of Tarakan in 1945. Diver Derrick enlisted in the 2nd/48th Battalion in June 1940. Through four bitterly fought campaigns at Tobruk, EI Alamein, Sattleburg in New Guinea and Borneo he revealed through his exploits the most incredible and extraordinary courage. Some say that in his early life there was nothing to suggest that one day he would receive the highest award for gallantry-the Victoria Cross. However, I believe his early life in Port Adelaide indicates otherwise. His early struggles were a portent of what was to come later. Thomas Currie Derrick was born in 1914 in Menindie, a suburb of Adelaide. He-like many other South Australians, particularly in Port Adelaide-knew poverty and hardship as a child. He was enrolled at Le Fevre Peninsula Primary School, which was situated within 100 metres of the Port River. He left school aged 14 and was highly proficient at swimming and diving-perhaps an early indicator of the nickname Diver. Around 1920, Tom's father, David, secured a job with the South Australian Harbours Board in Port Adelaide and he rented a house in Exeter. A little later, in 1924, more than 6,000 South Australian families were homeless. As the Depression grew, Diver was a 14year-old onlooker when mounted and foot police clashed violently with wharf labourers and seamen in Port Adelaide. This happened in the winter of 1928, but the incident remained, as it did for many people, indelibly imprinted on him and he often spoke about it. During these years, unemployment continued to soar. Photographs taken in 1931 show the banks of the Torrens River in Adelaide literally lined with humpies. Thousands of men were housed in shanty camps by the zoo. Weekly rations for a jobless family consisted of 1.3 kilograms of meat; four loaves of bread; some sugar, jam or honey; oatmeal or rice; tea; raisins; and soap. They were tough times indeed. In 1931 Tom Derrick and 13 other young lads gathered one morning at Exmouth Road, Glanville, and rode off on bicycles to Berri and hoped for work on the fruit blocks. During the next nine years he worked on fruit blocks in Berri but he commuted regularly to Port Adelaide. He married Beryl Leslie, a childhood sweetheart who lived in Largs Bay, in March 1940-four months prior to enlistment. His citation for the Victoria Cross award reads as follows: On 24th November 1943 Sergeant Thomas Currie Derrick DCM was in command of a platoon of a company of Australian infantry ordered to attack a feature 150 yards from the township of Sattleburg. For over two hours many unsuccessfuf attempts were made, under heavy fire from enemy strong points at the top of a precipitous cliff which the company had to scale to reach the objective. The task appeared impossible, and shortly before last light the company was ordered to retire. Sergeant Derrick requested, and was granted, permission to make one last attempt Moving ahead of his forward section he personally destroyed with hand grenades an enemy post which had been holding up this section. His second section were heavily attacked by machine guns and grenades from six enemy posts. Without regard for his personal safety he went ahead of the leading men .and with grenades so completely demoralised the enemy they fled leaving weapons and grenades. The company was thus enabled to gain its first foothold on the precipitous ground. Then on four separate occasions Sergeant Derrick dashed forward and threw grenades at a range of six to eight yards, until the remaining three posts·were silenced. he reduced ten enemy posts, and from the vital ground he captured the battalion moved on and took Sattleburg. Undoubtedly the captUre of Sattleburgin New Guineawas due to Sergeant Derrick's fine leadership and refusal to admit defeat in a seemingly impossible situation. His outstanding gallantry thoroughness and devotion to duty were an inspiration not only to his platoon and company but to the whole battalion. The Thomas Derrick Memorial Reserve will be a lasting tribute to a great soldier. It is also interesting that Australia Post has recognised the Victoria Cross winner from Port Adelaide in its latest set of postage stamps. (Time expired) Employment Programs",134
157,Mr RICHARD EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"I am pleased that the Mini.ster for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) is the person at the table during the adjournment debate tonight because I have something I wish to raise with him. I preface my comments by making a couple of qualifications. I share his concern about youth unemployment. Today he mentioned a figure of about 30 per cent. I also wholeheartedly and enthusiastically want to see programs put in place that will help youths gain employment I also say that I am a supporter and sponsor of the Royal Life Saving Society. I wish to raise a couple of points with the minister that hopefully he will be able to take on board and perhaps think about. The Royal Life Saving Society is a successful tenderer for employment programs through the Department of Employment, Education and Training. It has three programs at the moment: a jobskills program, a new work program and a new work opportunity program. After becoming a successful tenderer, the society was granted a program in about December last year. Today I spoke to a person from the department in Perth to confirm the fact that, if people are not successful in getting a job after six months of training, they lose their long term unemployment status. They then go back to the start of the queue and work their way In all through it again. That is the preface I make about the new work opportunity program-a program that the minister mayor may not be aware of. I have no problems with the Royal Life Saving Society conducting this program. It is doing a great job. It has advertised this program as being 'desperate to find young people to spend six months of fun in the sun'. The society is offering a new work opportunity program called the aquatic care program. The pamphlet advertising this aquatic care program states: To further your experiences, throughout the program we will be taking time off for surfing, windsurfing, body boarding, canoeing, abseiling and a variety of other cultural experiences. According to the pamphlet, these cultural experiences include fishing, sailing, powerboat driving, snorkelling, and pool and river care. I have to question the employment opportunities from a program like that. There may be some in the recreational area or maybe pool lifeguarding. Having talked to the project manager of this program, I know that the people starting this program have very low self-esteem and they are not, I guess, enthusiastic towards the employment processes they are going through at the moment. They have been treated very disrespectfully. The people who are joining this program are quite young. I think they are aged between 15 and 20. The course had 90-odd vacanCies. Fifty-six registrations came from case managers, but only 36 people turned up when the course started on Monday. I have spoken to the project manager. He says that it is very hard to attract people for an extended period. This course has two periods of eight weeks where the participants are weeding the local riverbank. I question whether or not this is relevant employment training for these people. I ask the minister to consider this: if these people cannot find employment after this period-they may; who knows?-how can we build them up with self-esteem training over a six-month period that gives them some purpose in life and then just drop them off the system and put them back where they started? We are talking about 15to 20-year-old people who are suffering from low selfesteem. Considering the high rate of youth suicide in Australia, particularly with males, how can we just drop them off the system and put them back at the start again where they have to wait another 18 months before they are considered for training for the long-term unemployed? Mr Crean-If they are considered at risk of long-term unemployment, they can go immediately into case management. It goes back to the case management function. They can be picked up.",135
158,Mr RICHARD EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"I appreciate that comment, but some of these people are coming from case managers now. I am concerned about the people who are on this program. I am concerned about their job opportunities at the end. This may be just a self-esteem program. Although that would be good for them and that is what it should be, I am concerned about their employment opportunities in areas like abseiling and powerboat driving. I do not think there. is a lot of employment opportunities in those areas. At the end of the course perhaps the minister's people in Perth could review the people concerned. If they do get jobs, that is great. But, if they do not get jobs, I ask that they not be put back at the start of the queue. One of the other points I would like to make in the last minute I have to speak is that this particular person who brought this to my attention suffers from sensitive skin and skin cancer and was told, 'Unless you appear at this particular training, your benefits will be cut off.' For medical reasons he can't do it. That is. why it came to my attention in the first place. I am wondering whether the minister could review some of those programs. (Time expired) Rugby League",136
159,Mr LATHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"It is entirely appropriate on a night such as this for the House to discuss the great game of rugby league. At the outset, let me declare my interest. I proudly serve as a patron of the Western Suburbs club at Campbelltown but experience a conflict of interest whenever the team plays Sf George, having followed the mighty Dragons since the age of seven. I grew up in a rugby league home, like most working families in Sydney. It was our source and subject of entertainment, loyalty, fanaticism and even a little ambition. As my mother still reminds me, our choice of Sunday night television viewing was entirely dependent on whether St George had won or lost that afternoon. Australia has undergone a vast sea change in our economy, social values and national culture over the past 20 years. As the House would appreciate, I could not be classed as an opponent of internationalisation but rather a strong, some would say fanatical, supporter. I remain, however, just as strong a supporter and participant in Australia's various modes of popular culture. For this reason I lament the advent of the superleague and those things it is taking from the game of rugby league. I do not believe that large corporations, particularly media companies, should own an entire sporting competition-a part of our national culture-such as rugby league, AFL or cricket. Australian sport-through the Broncos and NBL-has already experienced corporations owning teams. My point is that no one corporation should own all the teams and thereby establish anti-competitive practices. The administration of the game should involve much more than maximising profits for either Rupert Murdoch or Kerry Packer. The interests of rugby league supporters and the code's junior players should not be sacrificed for the sake of corporate dollars. Corporate sponsorship and television rights should be kept separate from the collective club based management of the code. A club like Wests in my electorate, ing such good and growing rugby league restrictions, areas such as Campbelltown and Liverpool, would have a great future if it is allowed expand and develop. I would suggest for all parliamentarians on both sides of the House an interest in this issue, not just as supporters but also as legislators. With the advent TV and superhighway technology, we need to address this simple question, not just for league but for all Australian sport: will the public interest be best served by the commernational cial media-based ownership of sporting competitions or by a form of collective management controlled by the clubs themvertical selves? The News Ltd takeover bid for rugby league should be viewed as part of a fundaownership mental shift in media strategies. Rupert Murdoch is already a dominant player internanationalistic tionally in the ownership and provision of media content, especially for entertainment services. His aggressive move into tralian market for sport content should be marked out as a first order concern for regulaable tors. This assessment, however, should not taken as condoning the position of the AusSouth tralian rugby league and its administrators. Indeed, they were foolish to sign away excluoff sive commercial broadcasting rights to Kerry Blues!' Packer's Nine Network for seven years from 1993 to the year 2000, knowing that during this period the advent of pay TV would substantially alter the market value and interrupted. coverage of their code. When the superleague administrators talk about 'our game' they are really talking about Rupert Murdoch's game because he clubs, and hence the players, under contract. The future of the superleague is entirely dependent on Murdoch's financial commitment and corporate strategy. I am just as concerned, however, that Kerry Packer has been presented with a spot on the ARL board and Optus Vision has now taken the major ownership share of ARL player contracts. So what needs to be done to protect the public interest and regulate corporate interests? Immediately it should be recognised that the parliament already has in place extensive regulation of media companies in the form of covercross-ownership laws, foreign ownership anti-siphoning pay TV limits and the general provisions of the trade practices to and corporatibns law. In that respect, I am delighted to see the Minister for Communications and the Arts, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), back from a productive of pay overseas trip, actually in the chamber. The parliament and the government should consider amendments to these laws consistent with the following three principles. First, our sporting codes should be included among the cross-ownership laws covering media corporations. This would prevent the integration of the media industry and of the ownership and potential monopolistic control of sporting content. Second, foreign restrictions should apply to our national sporting codes. Sport is an intensely activity and as such is best kept in Australian hands. Third, an access regime should be established for the broadcasting the Ausrights for sporting content. I now conclude, hoping that other honourmembers will join this important discusbe sion and debate. At least those from New Wales can join with me in barracking for tonight's game. As they are about to kick in Melbourne, I end by saying, 'Cam the",136

162,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"Dobell-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism) (8.00 p.m.)-I will not keep the House for long. I just wanted to respond very briefly to the honQurable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) by saying that the government's main concern throughout the long running debate about the future of the coverage of rugby league and the future coverage of many sporting codes is to ,ensure that the public continues to have access to major sporting events on free to air television. That is why this parliament has enacted the laws that deny pay television exclusive rights to the so-called anti-siphoning list. Pay TV can secure the Australian pay TV rights to those events only if the free to air broadcaster has first secured those free to air rights for Australia., , While I will naturally give due consideration to the suggestion of the honourable member for Werriwa that codes be incorporated in the cross-media ownership laws in some way, I have to say that my immediate reaction, having heard his persuasive arguments, is that I think he is yet to persuade me that that is the way we should be going. To seek to allocate codes between one media owner and another media owner in some way would become rather difficult to regulate. Given his propensity to argue for market forces and competition to reign in many other areas of the economy, I suspect that that might be one suggestion that could be more difficult to implement, despite the honourable motives that are, no doubt, behind it. The honourable member for Werriwa also raised a number of other very important issues which are the subject of a lot of debate on both sides of the House, about the Speaker seeking to encourage a compromise between the ARL and the Super League. I know the honourable member for Werriwa, the Speaker and many other members are motivated by seeking to ensure that the fans and the players determine what is best for rugby league in Australia. The goverrirrient'has' always sought to encourage the players, the clubs and the fans to determine their own future, rather than have the government intervene to anoint one side as thC1 winnyr or loser in this battle. As I said, the government remains committed to ensuring that the best of rugby league, whatever the name of the competition or code, remains freely available 'on free to air television. We have received assurances from both the ARL and Super League that two or three events from whatever' the 'competition may be called will continue to be available on free to air TV. That is the main issue that is in my mind in looking at how we can address this particular battle between Super League and the ARL. Question resolved in the affirmative.

When we start retirement and limited tenure appointments, measures place a particular responsibility on the army and the air force. Were this measure to be introduced in this many people in the Public Service would be being given promotions to higher levels for in civilian employment, or, if it works, I acknowledge that there have been a number over the years.

On that basis, pursuant to section 55B(I), (3) and (4), counsel has a right of audience in any State court in relation to the exercise by that court of federal jurisdiction. Because the Commonwealth was a party to the proceedings instituted by Mr Gilvarry, the Victorian Supreme Court was exercising federal jurisdiction in those proceedings. I add that, as I am informed, there is in Victoria no Register kept for the purposes of section 55B(5) of the Judiciary Act. In the circumstances, senior counsel was entitled to appear for the Commonwealth in the proceedings instituted by Mr Gilvarry. (2) I am informed that a complaint has been made to the Victorian Bar Council that the Commonwealth's senior counsel and two junior counsel allegedly breached the Victorian Bar Rules in relation to a failure to disclose one decision. I am also informed that a complaint has been lodged with the New South Wales Bar Association against delay. senior counsel, and one of the Commonwealth's junior counsel who is also a New South Wales counsel. I am informed that all three counsel firmly deny any impropriety. I am also informed that the complaint against the Commonwealth's Victorian junior counsel has been dismissed. I understand that the other complaints are still pending. In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment. (3) In May 1993 the Government announced its decision to seek to settle claims lodged by Voyager survivors whose actions were commenced prior to 1 December 1988. Since then, all such claims have been settled. At the same time, the Government decided not to admit claims where action had not commenced at 1 December 1988. This decision had regard in particular to section 44 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. Subject to a presently irrelevant exception, section 44 purports to bar all common law claims against the Commonwealth in respect of injuries suffered in the course of Commonwealth employment unless action had commenced prior to 1 December 1988. This is legislation of general application to claims for damages by Commonwealth employees related to their employment. The High Court of Australia has found section 44 to be invalid in some cases. However, the High Court has not found section 44 to be invalid in relation to claims, such as the Voyager claims, which at 1 December 1988 were outside normal limitation periods for bringing claims. (4) No. See answer to Question (3). (5) No. On the contrary, the Government pursued a strategy of seeking to have issues of general application to Voyager claims decided by the courts by way of test cases at an appellate level as soon as possible. That course was clearly quicker and cheaper than having the same issue re-litigated in a multitude of cases. (6) My statement in the House on 13 May 1993 related to the claims which had been made prior to 1 December 1988. As indicated in the answer to Question (3) above, all those claims have been resolved. (7) On 24 April 1995 the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and I announced the establishment by the Government of a scheme to settle all outstanding Voyager claims. That scheme will involve negotiation and mediation between the legal representatives of the claimants and the Commonwealth. (8) See my answer to Question (7) above. (9) I am unable to say when all claims will be settled, as that involves the claimants as well as the Commonwealth. However, the Commonwealth will endeavour to settle the claims as soon as possible. (Question No. 2040) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 8 February 1995: (1) How many and which training packages have received (a) interim approval from Nettforce and (b) final approval from the relevant State or Territory training authority in each State mid Territory. (2) How many trainees are participating under each training package referred to in part (1). (3) What were the White Paper targets referred to in the. answer to question No. 1667 (Hansard, 2 February 1995, page 441) and what percentage of them have been met to the date of answering this question. (4) Did the Government state that it would provide additional funding of $68.2 million over a period of four years from 1994-95 for the off-thejob component for trainees; if so (a) what was the estimated composition on an annual basis of the additional funding, (b) has the estimated funding been amended; if so, what are the most recent estimates and (c) what portion of the additional funding has been used for each month to the date of answering this question. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In practice, no training packages have received interim approval from Nettforce. This is because Nettforce agreed with the State and Territory Training Authorities to relinquish its power to give interim approvals if they agreed to certain service standards. These service standards have been agreed and are included in State and Territory agreements with Nettforce. (2) As at the end of March 1995, there had been 3,396 recorded trainee commencements in 1994-95 under training wage arrangements. These commencements will increase significantly once the National Training Wage arrangements have been fully implemented across all States and Territories. Industry advice, conveyed through Nettforce and its Industry Training Companies, is that industry has agreed to take on 29,500 trainees through the 22 ITCs which are currently operational. A further 4,000 traineeships will be sought with the establishment of six more ITCs. (3) The targets referred to in Question No. 1667 are the targets for trainees set out on page 94 of Working Nation. Working Nation set a target of 50,000 additional entry-level training places by the end of 1995-96. There have been at least 75,900 entry level NeUforce training places provided so far this year. These include over 38,100 apprenticeships, 9,300 traineeships and 13,000 prevocational places. Based on these trends it is likely that over 104,500 entry level training places will be provided in 1994-95, and that the target for 1995-96 will be achieved. (4) (a) Working Nation announced (pI93) that the Government would provide additional funding for off-the-job training for trainees as follows: 1994-95-$2.9m 1995-96-$19.9m 1996-97-$22.7m 1997-98-$22.7m The additional funding totals $68.2m over the period 1994-95 to 1997-98. (b) No. (c) The program commenced on 1 January 1995. As the funding is conditional on Staterrerritories achieving an increase in the number of trainees over and above existing levels, it is not expected that these funds will be accessed until later in the year. Brisbane Tribal Council (Question No. 2235) Mr Slipper asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 27 March 1995: (1) Has his attention been drawn to allegations of mismanagement or fraud in relation to the Brisbane Tribal Council by Elizabeth Ditton, an Aboriginal woman who was employed as company secretary of the Council. (2) Was Elizabeth Ditton (a) placed on a witness protection program and (b) forced to relocate on 40 oCGasions because she had been harassed and abused following her attempts to expose mismanagement and fraud in the Council. (3) Is he taking action with respect to the Council's affairs; if so, what action; if not, why not. (4) What action has he initiated to protect persons who suffer as a result of seeking to expose mismanagement or fraud in certain Aboriginal organisations.",181
189,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs wrote to me on 22 July 1994 drawing my attention to the fact that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) had alerted the Minister to concerns about the Brisbane Tribal Council Ltd (BTC) and the possible need for the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) to take appropriate action. I am advised that ATSICinformed the ASC in August 1994 that a report was being prepared by the firm Arthur Andersen. The investigative audit report was given to AT-IC in October 1994. I am informed that the Australian Federal Police (AFP) has examined documents including the investigative audit report, and has determined that based on the material provided there was insufficient information to identify any .particular offence which would justify the commitment of AFP resources to undertake investigation. I also understand that ATSIC has referred matters noted in the report to the Queensland Police and that inquiries are being conducted by Queensland Police in relation to this matter. The ASC has advised that it will continue to monitor the matter in the light of Police inquiries. In view of the ongoing nature of the inquiries, BOEING 747 and since no decision has been made on a final course of action, it would not be appropriate to make further comment about the matter at this time. (2) I am informed that Ms Ditton raised various allegations concerning the financial management of BTC with the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission (CJC) and that she was receiving interim witness protection from the CJC Witness Protection Division. I am not aware of the details surrounding, nor do I have any responsibility for, any witness protection program of the CJC. (3) I refer to my answer to Question (1). This matter is being investigated or monitored by the appropriate agencies. (4) I am advised that it is ASC policy that if it felt that protection of a witness was necessary in the interests of justice it would seek to place that person under the Australian Federal Police witness protection program. Flights into Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 2246) Mr Sharp asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 28 March 1995: What was the arrival time of each flight into Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport on 20 February 1995 until noon.",183

191,Mr CONNOLLY,HELICOPTER,"the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 28 March 1995: Did the Family Court of Australia pay Mr Cruickshank of Canada as a consultant; if so, what (a) briefs was he given and (b) sum was he paid.",185
192,Mr LAVARCH,HELICOPTER,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) I am advised by the Family Court that Professor David Cruickshank of Canada was employed by the Court as a consultant to assist with the development and facilitation of the following conferences and seminars: (i) Family Court Judges' Conference 1993 on 'Simplified Procedures'. Professor Cruickshank Time developed sessions intended to assist the Judiciary (Local) in identifying and discussing opportunities for simplifying Family Court procedures. Professor Cruickshank did not personally attend this confer1051 ence in any capacity; 1052 (ii) Family Court Gender Awareness Seminar 1055 1994. This was a national seminar for the Family 1057 Court judiciary, registrars, counsellors and manage1059 ment staff as well as representatives from the Aus1101 tralian Institute of Judicial Administration (AIJA), 1101 academic institutions and community organisations. The purpose of this seminar was to raise awareness, encourage attitudinal change and influence decision 1105 making with respect to gender issues. The seminar 1107 was modelled on similar seminars designed by 1110 Professor Cruickshank for use in Canada. Professor 1113 Cruickshank developed and co-ordinated the 1115 seminar and conducted several sessions. 1117 (iii) Family Court Facilitation Skills Workshop 1121 1994. Professor Cruickshank developed and delivered a national workshop for the Family Court 1123 judiciary, registrars, counsellors, management staff 1125 and Federal Court representatives to raise the 1127 participants' skills in disseminating information and 1128 facilitating discussion particularly on gender 1131 awareness issues within the workplace. 1134 (b) A gross amount of $23,959.14 was paid to 1137 Professor Cruickshank by the Family Court. At the 1139 time of the Gender Awareness Seminar, Professor Cruickshank also provided services to the Adminis1142 trative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) and the AIJA 1144 which, by arrangement with the Family Court, 1145 agreed to meet a share of his fees and expenses. 1147 The Family Court has since received $2,575 from the AAT and $2,300 from the AIJA under this arrangement. 1155 1159 Family Court of Australia: Travel Costs 1200 (Question No. 2260)",185
193,Mr CONNOLLY,HELICOPTER,"the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 28 March 1995: (1) What sums did the Family Court of Australia (a) spend on (i) domestic and (ii) international travel in 1993-94 and (b) budget for (i) domestic and (ii) international travel in 1994-95. (2) What are the main reasons for the (a) domestic and (b) international travel. (3) Who are the main users of the (a) domestic and (b) international travel.",185
194,Mr LAVARCH,HELICOPTER,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised by the Family Court that funds were spent on domestic and international travel for the period 1993-94 and 1994-95, the details of which are as follows: (1)(a)(i) Expenditure on domestic travel for the period 1-93-94 totalled $3,031,749. (Includes an amount of $24,918 for travel to New Zealand.) (1)(a)(ii) Expenditure on international travel for the period 1993-94 totalled $292,485. (1)(b)(i) An amount of $2,952,000 is budgeted for domestic travel for the financial year 1994-95. (Regional Offices, Registries and functional areas of the Office of the Chief Executive prepare individual domestic travel budgets to help manage their portion of the Court's Administrative Expenditure allocation, but the Family Court does not prepare a consolidated national domestic travel budget. The figure provided above represents the Court's projected expenditure on domestic travel in 1994-95 based on expenditure to 31 March 1995.) (1)(b)(ii) An amount of $225,000 is budgeted for international travel for the financial year 1994-95. (2)(a)' The main reasons forctomestic travel within the Family Court, in descending order of frequency (not expenditure) are: Operational activities other than circuits, ie meetings to resolve day to day operational problems, consultation with union representatives, agency bargaining meetings, provision of judicial and staff relief, interviews, security inspections, supervision particularly professional supervision, computer and PC support, meetings to plan the implementation of simplified procedures, meetings with Ministers and central coordinating agencies, and attendance at Parliamentary Committees, etc. Results from a sample of Registries indicate that 34.2% of domestic journeys occur for these reasons. Conferences-these include the Annual Judges Conference, professional conferences, and programmed committee meetings, for example, the Rules Committee, Chief Justice's Consultative Council, and the ATSI Awareness Committee. The sample indicates 24.4% of travel occurs for these reasons. Circuit travel by Judges, Registrars, Counsellors and administrative support staff accounts for 21.7% of travel in the Registries sampled. Travel for professional development and training purposes accounts for 15.3% of travel in the Registries sampled. (2)(b) The main reasons for international travel are set out below: Conference of the Association of Family & Conciliation Courts, Hawaii; International Society of Family Law, 8th World Conference, Wales; Gender Equality Seminar, Canada; and Law Asia 93, Malaysia. (3)(a) The main users of domestic travel according to the Registries sampled are: managers and administrative staff, including court officers engaged on circuits 46.9%; counsellors 18.4%; judges and support staff 16.9% and registrars 14.4%. (Figures are based on frequency of trips.) (3)(b) Main users of international travel (frequency not expenditure) are: judges 70%; registrars 15%; and counsellors 15%. Skase, Mr Christopher (Question No. 2263) Mr Cobb asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 28 March 1995: (1) On the basis of what factors did the Spanish authorities detennine that Mr Christopher Skase not be returned to Australia to face legal proceedings. (2) Have circumstances relating to the factors changed; if so, will he apply to the Spanish authorities for the case to be re-examined; if ,not, why not.",185
195,Mr LAVARCH,HELICOPTER,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am advised that Australia's application for the extradition of Mr Christopher Skase from Spain was refused by the Criminal Division of the Spanish National Court, on the basis of its concerns about the prospects for the safe return of Mr Skase to Australia by land or by sea. I understand that the Court accepted that Mr Skase suffered from serious progressive disease of the lungs, and concluded that his forced return to Australia may damage Mr Skase's health or endanger his life. In terms of the legal basis for the decision, the Court referred to Article 15 of the Spanish Constitution, which provides that the individual's riglits to life, physical integrity and health are pre-eminent, and to Article 3(2)(f) of the Treaty on Extradition between Austraiia and Spain, which provides that extradition may be refused 'where the requested State, while also taking into account the nature of the offence and the interests of the requesting State, considers that, in the exceptional circumstances of the case, the extradition would be incompatible with humanitarian considerations'. (2) The only information received by my Department which may indicate a change in the circumstances relating to Mr Skase's health has been provided by way of media reports from Spain suggesting that Mr Skase appears to be in sound physical condition. Notwithstanding those reports, I do not intend to apply to the Spanish authorities for the re-exarnination of the case. I 'am advised that the Spanish Court's decision was expressed to be ,final, and that it stated that no further appeal was available. Following the release of that decision, my Department sought formal advice on the prospects of reapplying for Mr Skase's extradition from Spain in the event that it could be demonstratcase ed. Mr Skase was medically fit to travel to Australia. The advice from both the Spanish Government prosecutor responsible for the extradition proceedings and the leading Spanish lawyer engaged by the Australian Government to assist in the indicated that as a matter of Spanish law there was virtually no chance of succeeding in another extradition request.",186
