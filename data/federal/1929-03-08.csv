In his reply Sir William MACPherson said:Until the New South Wales miners cated that they would accept a reduction Is. a ton in their wages, the Federal plan could not come into operation. The Ministry, however, was watching the position. He scribed as absurd Mr Bruce's proposal a ""bounty"" of Is. a ton on New South coal "" exported "" into another State. It would be just as absurd if the State Ministry offered a bounty of ld. a pint on milk exported the Hawthorn municipality to the Camberwell municipality. He considered Mr Bruce's proposal to be entirely unconstitutional. Seeing that this scheme will affect a very large number of miners in Victoria, and that one town, containing 7,000 or 8,000 inhabitants, will practically be wiped does the Prime Minister propose to something for the coal mines and the coal-miners of States other than South Wales?",12

81,Mr BEASLEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"West Sydney) [11.10]. ---The handling of mails at the General Post Office, Sydney, has been brought under my notice, and I have been informed that the alphabetical system of sorting has involved considerable delays in the delivery of letters. Not only is this system less efficient, but it bas the effect of depriving a large number of postal workers of their employment. I am opposed to any system which is less efficient and at the same time has the effect of dismissing employees. Will the Postmaster-General state whether this criticism of the alphabetical sorting is correct, and whether, if some men are to be displaced, employment will be found for tbem elsewhere?",19
82,Mr GIBSON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Corangamite-Post master-General and Minister for Works and Railways) '[11.111] - On two previous occasions this work was considered by the Public Works Committee, which was informed that after the trial of certain machinery in Melbourne some alterations in the scheme proposed for Sydney might be necessary. Mr Brown bas since investigated these matters in England, America and Germany, and it is now thought necessary that certain alterations should be effected, and particularly that the width of the conveyor belts should be increased. That is the main alteration that is proposed. I assure the honourable member for. West Sydney (Mr Beasley) that the introduction of the alphabetical system of sorting will not cause the services of mail sorters to be dispensed with, but will considerably expedite their work. Question resolved in the affirmative. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr Bruce) agreed toThat the House at its rising adjourn until Monday next at 3 p.m. NA VALIDATIO N BILL. In committee-(Consideratio n resumed from the 7th March, vide page 902). Clause 2 (Validation of agreement.)",19
83,Mr LACEY,FINANCIAL AGREEMENT,"Grey) [11.14] - When progress was reported last night I was contending that this agreement had been accepted by ^he States under duress, and in support of that statement. I quoted from a speech by Mr L. L. Hill, Leader of the Opposition in the South Australian Parliament. Mr Hill said alsoI t is no use members opposite trying to slielter themselves behind the fact - that Western Australia, Tasmania and other States accepted the agreement.",19
84,Mr REIDY,FINANCIAL AGREEMENT,"You must take things as they were after the repeal of the act. Mr Hill's speech contains many similar statements, and the belief is general in South Australia that the States were compelled to accept the agreement because this Parliament had already discontinued the per capita payments. On every occasion that this subject has been debated in this House the question of the moral or the legal rights of States to the per capita payments has been raised. I have always contended that the States have a moral right to somo saidform of payment from the Commonwealth. When they entered the federation they were led to believe that they would receive, if not a definite proportion of whom the customs revenue, then a per capita payment or some other form of assistance from the Commonwealth.",19
85,Mr RODGERS,FINANCIAL AGREEMENT,"The honourable member's view is more favourable than that of the right honourable member for Balaclava, wbo says that this agreement is a poor business deal. The States, wheu the Commonwealth was formed, surrendered certain powers, and therefore they have a moral rigbt to assistance from the Commonwealth.",20
86,Mr LACEY,FINANCIAL AGREEMENT,"Tba t is so. In 1910 the then Eederal Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom), as reported in Hansard,, said It was well understood and appreciated liy persons of all shades of political opinion that, from the very structure of the Constitution, from the very nature of the powers committed to us, and of necessity, the States should participate to a large extent in the revenue raised from these sources (customs and excise). Let me give the committee the opinions of some of the eminent gentlemen who guided the destinies of South Australia at the time of federation. Sir Frederick Holder, at the second session of the Federal Convention held in Sydney in 1S97, saidA federation in which the Federal authority is not interested in the solvency and prosperity of the States is such a thing that we ought not to consider for a moment. In fact our first duty today is, and I think I can go further and say that the first duty of the Federal Parliament of the future will be, to conserve the interests of the States. The success of federation itself must depend on the success of every State in it , and tlierefore in arguing for the strength and financial stability of the States I am arguing not for that which is parochial but for that which is essential to the success aud strength of the Commonwealth itself. I do not know a treasurer or a budding treasurer who would be willing to go back to his colony and advocate iiny system of federation which did not provide for - the return of practically the whole of the sum now collected from customs and excise to the State from the Federal authority. the Sir Jobn Cockburn, also of South Australia, at the third session of the Federal Convention held in Melbourne in 1898, It would certainly sap the independence of the States to place the Federal Parliament as a sort of Lord Bountiful over the States to made. ad misericordiam appeals could be The whole proposal (that the Federal Parliament might render financial aid to any State in such manner as it thought fit) is foreign to the spirit of the Constitution. The thing will not bear a moment's consideration. Those statements may be applied in many respects to the position in which the States now find themselves because of accepting the financial agreement. In the first place it will sap the independence of the States, because they will be forced from time to time to go cap in hand to the Commonwealth for grants-in-aid to tide tbem over their financial difficulties. It is not right to place the States in that position. I could quote many more eminent authorities who are in agreement with the views of Sir Frederick Holder and Sir Jobn Cockburn. The States certainly have a moral right to some form of assistance from the Commonwealth. From between the commencement of federation and 1910, the States received 75 per cent - of the customs and excise revenue. During that period South Australia received an additional amount under the Surplus Revenue Act. In 1901-2 that State received from the Commonwealth £332,239, and in 1909-10, £803,057. During the first ten years of federation, South Australia received 80.44 per cent, of the customs and excise revenue collected within its borders. Tbat high percentage was obtained because of a grant to South Australia under the Surplus Revenue Act. Under the per capita payment of 25s., South Australia received last year 16.96 per cent, of the customs and excise revenue collected in that State. Tbat is a tremendous decrease. Western Australia and Tasmania are suffering to the same extent. Had the first agreement operated during the period of the per capita system, South Australia would bave received an additional £9,000,000. Tbat State is in a precarious position. Its people contribute largely to the customs and excise revenue,. although they bave not the advantages of the people in the eastern States, who benefit from the many industries that are there established. South Australia, therefore, has a logical case for additional assistance. Although its indirect taxation under the customs and excise duties has increased enormously, its population has not increased in proportion, mainly because it has few factories compared with the other States. The honourable  night said that during the election campaign he had advised his constituents to vote for the referendum because, if carried, it meant the ratification of this agreement. It meant nothing of the kind. As I pointed out in my opening remarks last night, the figures that were submitted to honourable members last year by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) have not yet been answered by the Government. I advise the honourable member for Angas to study those figures. They show that South Australia, during the next 58 years, the period of the agreement, would under the per capita system receive £72,000,000; but under the agreement it will receive only £41,000,000, a difference of £31,000,000. Tbat applies generally to the whole of the States. Under the per capita system the States, during the next 58 years, would have received £823,000,000, but under the agreement they will receive only £440,000,000, a difference of £383,000,000. It is also alleged that the States will be better off under the new arrangement because of the provision of sinking funds for old and new debts. I understand that the States will be better off, not for the next twenty years, as has been stated, but only for the next five years; and thereafter they will gradually lose revenue. Last evening the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) spoke in opposition to the agreement; but he failed to record a vote on the second reading; in fact, be ran away. On page 3779 of Hansard, 9th March, 1928, the honourable member for Swan, after hearing the speech of the honourable member for Perth, saidOn Wednesday niglit the honourable member for Perth brought forward some astounding figures showing the ultimate effect of the financial agreement on the States. He was in agreement with the honourable member for Perth because he said that Sir. Lacey. that honourable member's case had not been answered by the Government, yet last night when be bad an opportunity to oppose the agreement he did not record his vote, despite the fact that Western Australia will suffer under this agreement to the same extent as South Australia. The Hill Labour Government appointed a royal commission to inquire into the disabilities which South Australia bas suffered through federation and the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Butler, was a member of it. Before the commission was able to complete its work, an election occurred and the Hill Government was defeated. The Butler Government, upon assuming office, abolished the commission appointed by the Hill Government, and appointed a commission of experts to report upon the same subject. Tbis commission accepted the evidence given before the commission appointed by the Hill Government, and did not call any additional witnesses. It ultimately reported that South Australia had suffered to the extent of £750,000 a year through federation. In the light of that report, Mr Butler, as Premier of the State, should have done everything in his power to cause the Commonwealth Government to grant South Australia some relief. He had a great opportunity to make effective representations along this line at the first Premiers' Conference be attended, for the agreement now before us was considered at it ; but he failed to do so. As a matter of fact, one of the reasons which makes me suspect the value of this agreement to the States is that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are so anxious to secure its ratification. When the Premiers met the Prime Minister and Treasurer, they almost unanimously opposed the proposals in this agreement, but eventually they agreed to them. Mr Butler is reported to have made the following remarks at the conferenceI listened with great interest to the Prime Minister's explanation of his Government's proposal and I was struck with the soundness of his arguments. I am in entire agreement with the principle he enunciated, but in the inatter of detail his proposal requires amendment. Although on that occasion he neglected to request the Commonwealth Government to make a grant-in-aid to South Australia, Mr Butler afterwards wrote to every member of this Parliament representing a South Australian constituency and requested that an effort should be made to get the Commonwealth to assist the State. In my opinion, Mr Butler fell upon the neck of the Prime Minister simply because be belonged to the same political party; but that does not excuse him for failing to make use of the great opportunity he had, to cause a provision to be inserted in the agreement to ensure that South Australia and other States similarly situated,- should be treated in a fair and reasonable manner. On the eve of the last federal election, the Commonwealth Government appointed a royal commission to inquire into the financial affairs of South Australia. There was no necessity for this to be done, for two royal commissions had already made a similar inquiry. It was a piece of political propaganda designed to mislead the people. But the commission having made its inquiries, the Government should defer the discussion on the bill until the report is before us.",20
87,The CHAIRMAN,FINANCIAL AGREEMENT,"The honourable member's time bas expired.  - So much bas been said recently about the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States in general and on this agreement in particular, that it is difficult to break any new ground. No new arguments have been advanced recently in support of the agreement, and nothing very fresh bas been said against it. However, I desire to make one or two observations on the following aspects of the subject: whether the States are desirous of retaining the - per capita system; whether it should be abrogated; and whether the present proposal is just. I have read many extracts from speeches made years ago by the framers of our Constitution, and the conclusion arrived at is that men like Deakin, Barton, Reid, Cook, Pisher, Dugald Thompson and others did not assume that the per capita payments should be continued for ail time. Any impartial student of the subject must admit that the per capita system was adopted as a temporary expedient, to ensure the acceptance by the States of the Draft Constitution. The Braddon section of the Constitution, which was the forerunner of the per capita system, was not acceptable to New South Wales until a provision was inserted that it should not continue for more than ten years. At the , end of that period, the per capita system was adopted, and the period of its operation was also limited to ten years. During the whole of that decade, repeated attacks were made upon it, and it was quite evident that it was never regarded as other than an expedient until a more permanent settlement could be reached of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. All that the framers of the Constitution contended for was the ensuring of the financial security of the States. As far back as 1908, Mr Andrew Fisher proposed, to pay £5,000,000 to the States annually for a number of years towards the interest on their debts "" as an equivalent to the 25s. per head."" He subsequently increased the proposed amountto £7,500,000. His scheme was not accepted and I submit that the per capita scheme bas, for a number of years, shown unmistakable signs of breaking down. South Australia has proposed that the distribution of the Commonwealth aid to the States should be on the basis of State debts. Tasmania, on the other hand, made a proposal that the available money should be distributed on the following basis:25s. per .head for New South Wales and Victoria; 30s. for Queensland and South Australia; 40s. for Western Australia, and 50s. for Tasmania.",22
88,Mr CURTIN,FINANCIAL AGREEMENT,"The system of differential payments exists in both Canada and the United States of America.  fication for its adoption here. The Tasmanian suggestion would be unacceptable to the great majority of Australian electors. Mr MCCormack, the Labour Premier of Queensland, has also opposed the per capita system. At the conference of Premiers, he saidA State with a large aud increasing population, because of the establishment of secondary industries in the favoured centres of population, would' receive increasing payments out of all proportion to those received by a primary-producing State, and would to that extent give to the wealthier States the greater proportion of the customs revenue. That is the most vulnerable point in regard to the continuance of the per capita payments. No doubt that State would pay the revenue because the customs revenue is collected from the people individually who buy these goods in the markets of the States; but where a Commonwealth is founded for mutual protection io all the interests embraced within that Commonwealth, it would be a much wiser policy to adopt some system that would at least help the weaker States or the States that were not so favourably situated for the establishment of secondary industries. Consequently, wo get to the point where we have to view this loss by the larger States from the broader or wider Australian point of view, and from that viewpoint the agreement has advantages over the present system. Mr Lyons, wlio attended the same conference, as the Labour Premier of Tasmania, made these remarksMr Lang suggests that the Commonwealth should continue paying to the States on amount based on the schedule in the States Grants Act, and that any increase based on the growth of population be credited to the sinking fund. I could not support such a proposal for a moment. It would, not compare favourably with the present proposals now before conference, because the States with the quickly increasing population would receive more than the smaller States. These extracts from the speeches of Premiers of the different States show clearly that the per capita system has always been regarded as an expedient. The right honourable member for Nort h Sydney (Mr Hughes) told us last night that he had never been enamoured of the per capita system. But he did not say that in 1919. Mr Watt, who was then Treasurer, proposed to take 15s. off the per capita, payments, by reducing them by 2s. 6d. or Is. yearly, as might be decided upon. There was undoubtedly grave resentment against what was regarded as the unfair operation of the system, and this would mately have resulted . in the withdrawal of the payments, even if this agreement had not been entered into. Permit me to now refer referendum on the amendment the Constitution. It is my conviction that the electors in voting for the issue submitted referendum, gave their tacit approval to this agreement. I know that this view is not shared by every one, not even by all honourable members on this side of the House. That is immaterial I have my own views on the matter. am convinced that the electors assented  by sucb an overwhelming majority to the amendment of the Constitution because they believed that it would lead to the ratification of the present agreement. It was known by the public that the agreement had been accepted by a conference of State Premiers; that it had been accepted by every State Parliament, Labour and Nationalist in Australia; and that it bad been in operation for two years since June, 1927. Moveover, the defeat of successive referendum proposals for the amendment of the Constitution has been a somewhat melancholy aspect, of Australian political history; yet, in spite of the electors past reluctance to interfere with the provisions of the Constitution, the proposals in the last referendum were agreed to by a majority of nearly 1,500,000. It is true that the electors voted to give power to the Commonwealth to make agreements with the States, but I submit that the present financial agreement, which bas been subscribed to by all the State governments, was the particular agreement which the electors had in mind when they were voting. The electors recognized that under this agreement millions of pounds which had formerly been paid to the States by way of per capita grants, would be applied to the payment of interest, and the reduction of debts - The Commonwealth Government proposed, with the concurrence of the States, that Australia should start to pay her debts, and that proposal was, I believe, understood and assented to by the great majority of the decent citizens of the country. The referendum figures u l t i- in New South Wales were: In favour of the proposal, 754,446; against the proposal, 415,84)6. There was thus a large vote against the referendum proto the posals in New South Wales, and that was of due to the attitude of Mr Lang, the State firm Labour leader. While the campaign director, the honourable member for Dalley at the (Mr Theodore) was telling the electors to vote "" Yes,"" Mr Lang was advising the Labour supporters to vote "" No."" The fact that nearly 500,000 followed his advice shows that he has more influence to me; in New South Wales than any other I Labour leader, Eederal or State. Why did Mr Lang oppose the agreement? He himself states quite clearly his reasons. Here is what he said"" My advice to yon is to vote ' No referendum issue, If you vote ' Yes' is carried New South Wales will cease a sovereign .State. If the proposed alterations to the Constitution were going to give you unification, or would lead to unification, there would be some justification. They are not going to lead to unification, and they are not going'to accord the Federal Parliament control of the finances of New South Wales. If you vote 'Yes,' you are going to allow Ministers of the Crown from various States who compose the Loan Council to say how much money you can borrow."" Then he goes o n to say that the f in a n c i a l proposals w o u l d hamper the operations of the N e w So u t h Wales Government. Mr . L a n g opposed the agreement because, he said, it w o u l d in t e r f e r e w it b the N e w So u t h Wales as a sovereign State. What has the Leader of the O p p o s it i o n in t h is House (Mr S c u l l in ) to say on that point? S p e a k i ng on the agreement in M a r c h last, he s a i d I stand for this Parliament having sovereign powers and the States having only delegated powers. Some people call that unification. I am not afraid of the term. If it is unification to set up in Australia u National Parliament with complete power and State Parliaments with delegated power, then I am a unificationist. I do not think we should have only one Parliament, but we should . have only one sovereign Parliament. Thus, the Leader of the Labour party in this House differs radically on this subject from the Leader of the Labour party in the State of New South Wales, and with the Labour party's platform which provides for the absorption of State Parliaments and the creation of provincial local governing bodies. fact, the voices of the several Labour leaders and the Labour platform on this issue constitute a veritable babel. Mr Lang also opposed the agreement because of its loan provisions. Now, that is the very point that commends it to the Leader of the Federal Opposition, and the Labour party generally. They are opposed to the abolition of the per capita payments, but the honourable member for Yarra, in a speech in March last to which I listened with pleasure, said quite clearly that the State debts should be taken over by the Commonwealth. I submit that when Mr Lang advised the electors to vote "" No,"" he understood that if the referendum were carried, this Financial Agreement would be ratified.' ' on the Let me now quote what Mr Hill, the and it Leader of the Labour party in South to be Australia, said on this matterIn my opinion the safe course for the electors of this State is to vote "" No "" . If the referendum is defeated .the Commonwealth Government must then completely review the financial position. Tbat statement provides clear evidence that Mr Hill recognized that if the referendum were carried this agreement would be ratified, because be said that if the proposals were defeated the Federal Government would have to review its financial arrangements. I wisb now to put on record a stater i g h t s of ment which was published in the Adelaide Register on Monday, 25th February, which, to my mind, succinctly sums up the situation. The statement is as follows :A ll the State Governments and Parliaments have accepted the financial agreement, which is actually in operation. The people, by referendum, have affirmed the Commonwealth's general right to make such agreements, the present scheme being particularly before them. On whose behalf then, can the opponents of this Financial Agreement Bill speak? - They cannot pretend to be championing the cause of the States, since the elected representatives of the States have overwhelmingly accepted the agreement. Nor can they contend that they are expressing popular opinion as against the majority votes in the Parliaments, as the electors have tacitly approved of the scheme. They are entitled to oppose the bill if they think the agreement is bad business for the Commonwealth, but that view has not been seriously put forward. In This agreement provides for three things: the taking over of State debts to the extent of £600,000,000, and the payment annually of £7,585,000 interest by the Commonwealth; the establishment of a sinking fund of 7s. 6d., to which the Commonwealth shall contribute 2s. 6d., amounting* annually to approximately £850,000, to redeem the debts in 5S years. The establishment of a sinking fund of 10s. for all new loans, on which the Commonwealth shall pay 5s. and which will involve the payment of £100,000 on every £40,000,000 raised. It also provides for an increase of interest on transferred property from 3 i per cent, to 5 per cent. After twenty years of discussion on this vexed question, I hope that finality ""will at last he reached. Under these proposals the evil of one government raising money for another government to spend will be largely removed; not entirely, but, at any rate, the money raised by the Commonwealth will be hypothecated for purposes of which the people have approved. The present uncertainty in the financial affairs of the States will be removed. The States will receive fair treatment, while the three great principles essential to the consummation of federation, and the development of our national life, will be achieved; first, the provision of financial security for the States; secondly, the transfer of debts; and thirdly, the common control of borrowing. I believe that no more important question has ever engaged the attention of this House. I believe that no question is of greater importance than this to the growth and development of Australia on national lines. I congratulate the Prime Minister and members of the Government on taking their political lives in their bands and courageously and persistently carrying this proposal through from stage to stage. The importance and magnitude of their work may be today obscured by the haze and smoke of party prejudice, and internecine jealousy. But as independent public organs and institutions today recognize the intrinsic value of the work being done, so I believe that posterity will not withhold from the Prime Minister and members of the Government their praise and appreciation for the statesmanlike work they are doing in initiating and completing the present Einancial Agreement.",22
89,Mr STEWART,FINANCIAL AGREEMENT,"Wimmera) [12.0] The spectacle of the honourable member for  paragingly to party prejudices is enough to make the angels weep. He 'rarely rises to speak without referring to his friend, Mr Lang. He produces this King Charles's head, and when this fails him, be goes across the New South Wales border into Queensland, and refers to the woeful condition of the unfortunate people of Queensland. The honourable gentleman, in his own mind, haa settled the matter now before the committee, and, of course, obviously, it is settled. My object in rising is that which actuates most honourable members. I wish to put on record my reason for the stand I am taking with regard to the bill. I take the opportunity of doing so, particularly, because during the recent election the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) paid frequent visits to my constituency and criticized my political record.  jority down by two-thirds.",25
90,Mr STEWART,FINANCIAL AGREEMENT,"Tb e issue in ' the last election on this and other matters was entirely different from those at previous elections, in the sense that the party to which I previously belonged for pre. selection bad held the Wimmera seat and I was its candidate. On the last occasion I was no longer the candidate of that party. I was informed by the Treasurer, and he told the electors, that I held the seat by virtue of the fact that I was his follower. Thus we had a fight on the question as to who owned the seat. The Treasurer said that his party owned it by 22,900 votes. The result of the election was that the Page majority of 22,900 was converted into a minority of 7,500. I recognize that that has little to do with the bill, but I was tempted to digress to that extent because of the interjection of the honourable member for Warringah. There has been a confusion of important principles in the minds of some honourable members in connection with this bill. I believe, as a layman, not having been a State or Eederal Treasurer, that the Loan Council should be of advantage so far as borrowing is concerned. Certain figures were quoted by my friend the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) in regard to the flotation of various State and Commonwealth loans on the London market, and he instanced three loans to which I desire to refer. There was a Commonwealth loan of £8,000,000, he said, which was floated on the 7th March, 1928, and 84.4 per cent, of it was left with the underwriters. On the 25th April of that year a Western Australian loan of £3,000,000 was oversubscribed at once. On the 17th July-the e months later-anothe r Commonwealth loan of £7,000,000 was floated, and 87 per cent, of that was left with the underwriters. The only reason that the Treasurer gave for this result was that it merely meant that the terms of the Western Australian loan were exceptionally favourable to the investor, the inference being that its terms were to an unbusinesslike extent favourable to the investor, and to the extent that they were overfavorable to him, it was an unbusinesslike transaction on the part of the Western Australian Government. But the reply to that is that, according to the figures quoted by the honourable member for Perth, all these loans were floated on exactly the same termsat the same rate of interest and at £98 5s. That disposes of the Treasurer's argument and I suggest that the matter requires explanation.",25
91,Mr SCULLIN,FINANCIAL AGREEMENT,Did not Western Australia borrow through the Loan Council?,26
92,Mr STEWAET,FINANCIAL AGREEMENT,"Wo t in floating this particular loan. Of course there is provision for individual States to go on the money market, subject to the approval of the Loan Council, and obtain their own loans, so the incident does not provide valid grounds of objection to the establishment of the Loan Council, but it is nevertheless interesting. I wish to make it clear that my vote against this agreement is not a vote against the establishment of the Loan Council. I approve of that Council. My second point is that my opposition to this bill is not opposition to the principle of the consolidation of State debts. I approve of the consolidation of those debts. My real objection to the measure is that the platform of the Country Progressive party, to which I belong, has a plank providing for the retention of the ver capita payments pending the holding of a constitutional session to consider the constitutional relations of the States and the Commonwealth. Eor the greater part of the time when the negotiations that led to the submission of this bill were in progress, a constitutional commission was sitting. It was appointed so long ago that I have almost forgotten the time when it began its work. It is still engaged in its task; we are still waiting for its report. I take it that the very fact of the appointment of that commission indicates that the Government considers there was some necessity for its appointment; at any rate, let us hope so. But it is recognized on all hands that the present financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth under the Constitution cannot much longer remain as they* are. The cost of government in Australia is such that I believe the people will very quickly revolt against the burden that is involved.",26
93,Mr JACKSON,FINANCIAL AGREEMENT,Than k goodness other countries are in a worse position.,26
94,Mr STEWAET,FINANCIAL AGREEMENT,"The optimist from Tasmania does not deny that we are badly off. It is poor consolation to say that other countries are in a worse predicament. Every State, except Queensland, has a double-chambered legislature, there is overlapping, and there are interstate jealousies, and with the Commonwealth Parliament endeavouring to function, and encroaching upon the duties of the States - the present Commonwealth Government has done more than any other in that direction-w e have reached the stage when the present conditions cannot long continue. When I was a member of the Country party its platform contained a plank that I will read. What is in its platform now I do not know; it changes according to circumstances. In the days to which I refer, we were very enthusiastic about this plankNA STATES TO SECURE PRACTICAL DECENTRALIZATION. (a.) To advocate the early holding of a federal convention to consider the revising of the Constitution. Such convention to be elected on the federal rolls, and each State to be divided into five electorates, returning three delegates for each electorate by the system of proportional representation."" To aim at securing new and definite apportionments of the powers and duties of the federal and State authorities. (b) In order to bring about economical and efficient State government and administration, and to avoid costly duplication of State and federal activities, it is necessary to subdivide the present unwieldy States into manageable areas with community of interests, under their own constitution, thereby bringing about a simpler form of State government leaving all national functions to the Federal Parliament. There was a definite policy on the constitutional relations of the State and Federal Parliaments. It is fallacious for the Treasurer to tell us that the present agreement effectively disposes of the whole subject of the financial relatiqns of the States and the Commonwealth' for 58 years. I have not the slightest doubt that the walls of this chamber' will again ring, and before many years have past, with debate on the subject now under consideration. To say that this Parliament in the year 1929 shall bind future generations until 1987 to a bard and fast agreement that will dispose of the matter for time is ludicrous, to say the least of it. The Treasurer, in one of his political visits to my constituency, stated that I had opposed the financial agreement. I am glad that the Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson) is listening to me. I would have preferred to have the Treasurer also as one of my auditors, because he said that I , who am today opposing the financial agreement, supported it in 1923, wben he was a member of the Ministry. Tbat statement typifies what I bave always referred to as "" the Page touch."" The honourable gentleman plainly stated that this agreement is practically identical with the agreement which was submitted by bim in 1923. I shall not take up the time of the committee in explaining the difference between the two. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Theodore) last night referred to this as a complete somersault on the part of the Treasurer; yet the honourable gentleman repeatedly told the electors of Wimmera that it was not be, but I , wbo bad somersaulted. I wish to deal with the point that has been raised repeatedly, regarding the significance of the affirmative vote that was given by the electors. After-events have proved that, in the event of an affirmative vote, being given, the supporters of this measure bad every intention of urging that the people had approved of the agreement itself. They are not playing the game with those who, although strongly opposed to the agreement, nevertheless took a disinterested view of the matter and did what they thought was for the national good. That is what I did. The Leader of the Opposition and many other Labour members were bitterly opposed to the agreement, but they asked the people to cast an affirmative vote.",26

96,Mr STEWART,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"Fro m a thousand platforms, Government members claimed that they were not asking for a "" Yes "" vote on the agreement, but merely on the proposal that power should be given to the Commonwealth to make agreements. If the Labour party, which represents nearly 50 per cent, of the electors, had advised its supporters to vote "" No,"" the referendum would not bave been carried, and this measure could not have been brought forward.

97,Mr ATKINSON,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"Wilmot) [12.20] - I am a supporter of this agreement. During the election campaign, I told my electors that if the Bruce-Page Government was returned to office it would be made law, and that if I were elected I would give it my support. The historian of the future will. regard this as the magnum opus of the present Government. It has done many notable things during the six years that it has held office, but this is an outstanding feat which will everlastingly redound to its credit. It is an attempt to deal with a very big question that has always puzzled federalists and financiers, namely the taking over of the State debts. The present agreement is quite different from that which was submitted to the Commonwealth Parliament when the per capita payments were abolished in 1926. Had this agreement been placed before the House and the public at that time, it would not have been opposed by the press and the parliamentarians of the day. The State Treasurers were becoming very uneasy, and there was no guarantee that they would continue much longer to ""receive the per capita payment. We have beard a great deal regarding the loss which will be occasioned to Western Australia. Neither it nor any other State had any guarantee that when the population had largely increased the Commonwealth Government would continue the payment of 25s. a bead. Where would it raise the amount necessary when the population bad reached many millions? The Parliaments of Canada and the other Dominions make grants to their subsidiary bodies in proportion to their necessities, rather than on the basis of population. If New Soutli Wales became very prosperous and largely increased its population, the effect of a per capita payment would be to assist those who did not really need the money, at the expense of the smaller States. There was the further danger .of some future Government embarking upon schemes requiring a large expenditure, and using the money obtained from this source, instead of banding it over to the States. From whatever angle we view the question, the States are entitled to stability. The underlying idea in the minds of the framers of the Constitution was that, as the States were relieved of the interest on their debts, their receipts from the Commonwealth under other headings would correspondingly diminish. Therefore, I can see no objection to the agree- Green, R. ment on that score.",27
98,Mr CULLEY,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,Why is the State Government in Tasmania seeking a conference with the Prime Minister to place before bim its case for a special grant?,28
99,Mr ATKINSON,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"Specia l grants are made in accordance with the provisions of section 96 of the Constitution, and have no connection with this matter.

100,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"Batman) [12.3S] I desire to make a few valedictory remarks at this final stage of a bill which deals with matters upon which I have expressed opinions on previous occasions, but in regard to which I have not had much opportunity to express myself during this debate. The bill is designed to settle permanently-sav e the mark!or at all events for 58 years, the difficult problem of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. Under this agreement, the Commonwealth will assume a responsibility for the public debt of the States, and will pay monthly to eac% State a fixed sum proportionate in some way to its population. State will, during the same period, pay to the Commonwealth the excess interest falling due each year in respect of its debt. A loan council is to be established, and what is called the consolidation of the public debt is also provided for. The establishment of a sinking fund is another feature of the agreement, and the vexed problem of payment in respect of properties transferred by the States to the Commonwealth is admittedly placed by it upon a more business-like and satisfactory footing. We can afford to give the bill our qualified approval and blessing in so far as it relates to the consolidation of the debts. In that respect the agreement envisages Australian nationality and unity in accordance with the oft-expressed ideals of the Labour party. The sinking fund is a pious aspiration which may, possibly, be honest; but, judging by our experience of the present Government in relation to finance, it is nothing better than the Monday morning resolve of the chronic inebriate. Some speakers have, with quaint humour, claimed that the Government has a mandate to introduce this measure. That it bas a mandate to do anything is doubtful, and its method of doing it, chequered and painful. This claim is too audacious for serious argument. It is sumcient to point out that the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader and the humble workers like myself in the rank and file of the Labour party advocated an affirmative answer to the referendum. Indeed, we felt bound to do so, because the Government policy in that regard was adopted from the platform of Labour. To negative the grant of extended powers to the Commonwealth, or hamper the development of. the nation along those lines, is foreign to Labour's policy. In that regard it niatters not to us what government is in power, whether firmly established in popular favour, as the Labour party hopes to be ?non, or tentative and tottering, as this Government undoubtedly is. But, if any further answer be necessary, it was supplied by the Prime Minister and the Mr Brennan. Attorney-General, who admitted that the affirmative vote on the referendum was not in any sense an endorsement of this agreement. The claim by the Treasurer and other speakers to a mandate to save Each their not too-sensitive conscience is pathetic. Even more pathetic is the swaggering self-sufficiency of those who imagine that they can bind future generations or fetter the action of this Parliament, or any other representative institution that may be functioning 50 years hence. In the fine phrase of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini), we cannot join with those who would ""rattle the bones of the dead to silence the clamour of the living."" The Prime Minister is gracious to posterity. In addition to banding them a legacy of £1,200,000,000 or thereabouts of public debt, he is good enough to suggest that, after he is dead, be may agree to a qualified alteration of the present agreement.",28
101,Unknown,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,Sitting suspended from 12.4.5 to 2.15 p.m.,29
102,Mr BRENN AN,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"The Prime Minister is disposed to be generous to posterity and, in addition to handing down to it a legacy of debts unpaid, obligations undischarged, and national commitments running into hundreds of millions of pounds, he indicates that even during the currency of this present supposed-to-be inflexible agreement, it may be that it will be permissible for the Commonwealth and the States to vary the agreement but only upon lines indicated by himself. The right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), in the course of his interesting speech-no t backed up by his vote-sai d that the Prime Minister might be justly ambitious to have his name inscribed permanently by means of this measure in association with a permanent settlement of the vexed question of the financial allocations between the Commonwealth and the States. I should not like to accept any responsibility for the rigbt honourable gentleman's hereafter, any more than for his present policy. I listened the other evening to the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) when he asked the right honourable gentleman to examine his conscience and to survey his past with a view to seeing if he could discover anything useful that be had done for the people of this countryI have no desire to be - so bard on 'bim, amd I .certainly should not like to see h i a return from his well-earned plaoe of rest or expiation, as the case may be, to face the people of Australia in the light .of the unctuous self-.eomplacency with which he has solemnly attempted to harness and .direct tihe wisdom of the new generation of progressive Australians. This debate, though rendered brief by the operation of .that revolutionary machine known as the guillotine, is, and has been, nevertheless, of i i g h importance, and I had looked eagerly, if not hopefully, to honourable members opposite for light and leading upon the delicate and difficult questions involved. I listened, for instance, to the honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse) and it must be said that he made .an .able and well-consideued speech against the bill. I heard him saj, moreover, that he was fortified in his arguments against the bill by the fact that he had pledged himself to 'his constituents to oppose it. But, alas! there his statesmanship ended. He has declared in this House, by a species of ingenious reasoning which I was entirely unable to follow, that the people of Australia Qtad spoken and lie - was now - obliged - to - vote for the bill. Mr 'Scuixrisr - He voted .against his convictions and Ms pledges. Mr .BEENNAN - That is so. Thus who do .we see that by .stepping .two ,stej>s forward and - thr.ee steps backwards, gliding with the guillotine from one side to .the other .and looking both ways, is the democracy of Eorrest represented.

103,Mr BEENNAN,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"I accept that ruling, but I am looking for the principle in the bill which induced the honourable - member for Swan to leave - the chamber when tke vote was about to be taken, with an agility equal to that which he displayed in returning to speak when the vote was ,over.

Sounded impatience with me, to pursue that line of argument further, and there I leave it. I have raised some points in this brief address of mine which, in a certain way, reconcile me to the passage of the bill. It, no doubt, has some useful features and some good machinery for carrying on the work of the nation from day to day in accordance with the ideals of men of narrow vision, whose eyes are more often upon their feet than upon the stars. I submit that Australia can never, either within or without the commonwealth of nations, become herself a nation so long as we bave the present cougeries of competitive sovereignties known as States, with their elaborate and expensive machinery, their governments, their parliaments, their executives and their local pomposities. We bear the phrases ""State rights,"" ""moral rights,"" and ""legal rights."" There are such things as moral rights and legal - rights, but, in the connection in which the Avords bave been used' in this debate, they are merely phrases with wbicb men invested with power seek to justify the exercise and tinuance of that power. Sovereignty was sought for very naturally, and as naturally obtained, early in Australian history. Civilization and society reached out to other isolated parts of this continent, and local government was demanded. It was mistakenly thought that with the development of Australia along those lines, multiple sovereignties were necessary. The idea is dying hard, but as the union was slowly and painfully born, so the fiction of State rights must, if slowly, at last inevitably perish. It is to the honour of the Labour party that it has surveyed at least the road to Australian nationhood, and future generations must tread it. They will do that in their own way, according to their own lights, and in so doing, their craftsmen will be little concerned with the dead timber which this agreement seeks to strew along the track.",30
106,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"Franklin) [2.30]. - We have had some very interesting reminiscences on the subject of per capita payments, but; if I may be permitted to say so, first the Leader of the Opposition, then the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) and later the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) all made one slight error: They commenced their history in 1909. There are not more than five of us left now wbo were in the House when this story really began in 1908. The States bad been receiving three-fourths of the customs and excise revenue collected by the Federal Government, and all the surplus revenue which the Commonwealth Government did not expend. The Deakin Government, with a handful of supporters, was kept in office by the Labour party. The Labour party, for some time, with the assistance of a number of members on the Opposition side of the House, had been pressing very hard for the introduction of an old-age pension scheme. Mr Eisher, who was taking a prominent part in the affair, was trying to induce the Government to impose a graduated land tax to meet the cost of the old-age pensions. Mr Deakin absolutely refused to accept the proposal, showing for perhaps the only time during the period of his federal leadership, some con- evidence that he possessed a backbone. Then on the 13th March, 1908, Sir William Lyne introduced a Surplus Eevenue Bill which took from the States the unexpended revenue they had been receiving from the Federal Government. One week later Mr Fisher introduced a motion for the inauguration of an old-age pensions scheme, and with the assistance of several members on the opposite side of the House, it was carried on the voices. That happened in 1908, and was the first inroad into the revenues which the States had been receiving from the Commonwealth.",31
107,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,I remind the honourable member that the discussion is on the third reading of the bill.,31
108,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"I know it, and I am grateful to you for having allowed me to get in that little piece of history. If the suggestion made by the right honourable member for Balaclava were adopted, that this agreement should be limited to a period of two years, the bill would not be worth a snap of the fingers. If I had not been going to vote for the bill, his speech would have .made me do so. During his political career he has made only one proposal for the settlement of the per capita problem, namely that the 25s. per capita payment should be reduced by 2s. 6d. a year until it came down to 10s.",31
109,Mr JACKSON,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,And he proposed nothing to take its place.,32
110,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"N O ; he offered no substitute. That is the sole contribution wbicb the right honourable member for Balaclava has made towards improving the financial relations of the CommonAvealth and the States, and that proposal fell stillborn, receiving no support. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) made what I consider a very valuable contribution to the debate, when he impressed upon the Government the enormous responsibilities which the States bave to bear. They have to find the money for such things as roads, railways, charitable grants, judiciaries, and police forces, besides education and other services. In my opinion, this bill, far from being too liberal, as the right honourable members for North Sydney and Balaclava have, said, could be made still more generous, and yet the States would not receive more than their due. As the honourable  pointed out, the States will have to receive further assistance in any case in the form of special grants. Because of the large populations in New South Wales and Victoria, and the concentration of manufacturing interests in those States, the rest of Australia has for years been paying tribute to them. My own State, for instance, while it buys a considerable quantity of sugar from Queensland, also purchases £6,000,000 worth of goods annually from New South Wales and Victoria. The concentration of manufactures in two States places the rest of Australia at a serious financial disadvantage, a fact which this Parliament will have to recognize. I am not a unificationist; I am a federationist. The only way to secure a strong CommonAvealth, and an effective Federal Parliament, is to have strong State Governments, and strong State instrumentalities. Australia was in the first instance governed from Sydney, but it was then a very small entity as far as population was concerned. We found it impossible to carry on on that basis, and Ave shall find ourselves even less able to govern Australia from Canberra. Therefore, instead of trying to undermine the influence and poAvers of the States, we should, if we wish Australia to grow into a strong, national unit, let the States retain sumcient poAver to govern themselves, and especially to keep themselves solvent.",32
111,Mr MANN,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,Why does the honourable member support the bill ?,32
112,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"I shall tell the honourable member why-it is a fair question. I opposed the abolition of the per capita payments when I began my election campaign, but in my State Ave recognized that if we carried the referendum issue, we endorsed the whole of the financial agreement. Mr E. BILEY - What nonsense!",32
113,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"I am stating the position as it existed in my OAvn State. I found opposed to me in Tasmania on this question, the Leader of the Nationalist party, and almost all the members of that party as well as the Leader of the Federal Labour party.",32
114,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"Order ! The debate is upon the bill as it came from committee. The honourable member is entitled to discuss the scope and purport of the bill, but he is now going into a number of outside matters which do not come Avithin the boundaries of a third-reading debate.",32
115,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"I agreed to accept the decision of the electors on the financial agreement, and I am noAv doing so. I did not have an opportunity to speak on the second reading of the bill, and I desire to make my position clear now. I do not agree with the right, honourable member for North Sydney, and the right honourable member for Balaclava, that the sentiment in the country is in favour of unification. It is, I think entirely opposed to it. Time after time the Federal Parliament has sought greater poAvers from the people and has been refused them. Only 3 i years ago the present Government asked the people to authorize an amendment of the Constitution which would enable the Commonwealth Parliament to control essential services. The Government said that it was absolutely necessary for the State Governments to surrender certain powers to the Commonwealth, but the people of Australia turned the proposal down. Mr E. RILET - Then why did they carry the present proposal?",32
116,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,They faced with a most extraordinary situation.,33
117,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"Order ! We are not discussing the referendum. Mr .MCWILLIAMS - I have tried to show that these proposals are not too liberal, but that, on the other hand, the States are not receiving today from the Eederal Government sumcient to enable them to bear their enormous responsibilities. I am speaking now for my own State, and there the leaders of all parties are agreed that this agreement gives them more revenue, and better conditions than they were obtaining under the per capita payments. Mr MANN. - Eve n the Attorney General said that that was not so. Mr MoWILLIAMS - I am not responsible for what the Attorney-General says; I merely stated that the leaders of the Nationalist party, and of the Labour party endorsed this proposal, and it passed through the State Parliament practically without opposition. I do not agree, .however, with the proposal that the agreement should be limited to a term of ten years so as to leave it within the power of the Eederal Parliament to alter it at any time. The States were "" had "" once, and they do not want it to occur again. An old Jew once remarked"" Any man can take me down once, but when the same man does so twice I go out of business."" The Federal Parliament took the States down once over the Surplus Revenue Bill, but the States will not agree to allow the Commonwealth to insert in an agreement purporting to be for a term of 58 years, a clause which enables it to alter that agreement at any time it likes.",33
118,Mr WATKINS,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,But does the honourable member not think that the Federal Parliament should have the power to initiate proposals for the amendment of this agreement?,33
119,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"I do not admit that when an agreement is made for a period of 58 years any one party to that agreement should be .able at any time to have it altered to suit its own convenience. There is power by referendum to the people to amend the Constitution in any way, but when an attempt was made to provide in the Constitution for the paywere ment of 25s. per head of the population the proposal was rejected. If that bad been put into the Constitution at that time there would be no necessity now to try to restore it for ten years.  been endeavouring to get an opportunity to speak on this measure for many days past; but in the few minutes at my disposal I shall not be able to discuss it in more than a cursory manner. It is unusual to address oneself to a bill of this description at the third reading stage, but we know that extraordinary methods have been adopted by the Government in this instance, and it is only right that one should comment upon the way in which the Government and its supporters have treated the measure. Being of the greatest national importance, it has deserved the most serious attention of honourable members, but the Government has applied the ""guillotine,"" and many honourable members have had no opportunity of expressing their views. The great majority of those who have spoken are opposed to the bill. We have had the sorry spectacle in the last two or three days of honourable members opposite speaking against it, but voting for it ; it has been dealt with along party lines. The whip has been cracked, and honourable members opposite have lined up behind the Government. Men like the honourable member for Fawknef (Mr Maxwell), the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes)., and the right honourable member for Balaclava .(Mr. Watt)j have criticized the bill and shown clearly that it should not be accepted, but they have voted with the Government. Parliament has now become an absolute far.ce. Mr SPEAKER,-The honourable member may not speak in disrespectful terms o i Parliament. I call upon bim to withdraw that expression.  show disrespect for this honourable House and I withdraw the expression, but I regret to find honourable members speaking one way and voting another. Personally I have voted consistently. I oppose the bill because I think that it would be in the interest of the States if the capita payments were continued. I believe that the present proposal will not stand the test of time, and that we may eventually have to revert to the old system. I fail to understand the attitude adopted by the Premier of South Australia (Mr. Butler), wbo no doubt was prevailed upon by the persuasive eloquence of the Prime Minister to accept the agreement. One of the reasons why it was accepted by South Australia was no doubt the shocking financial position of that State.",33
120,Mr STEWART,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OP NEW,"South Australia is not the only State to which that remark applies.  other States in the same predicament. The report of the Royal Commission on South Australian Disabilities has not been tabled, but we were entitled to have it before us in considering this measure. I have no doubt that when the ""guillotine"" is applied the bill will be read a third time, but I hope that the Government will deal generously with South Australia's application for a grant of £75,000. I should have liked to discuss the financial provisions of the bill, and the subject of the Loan Council, because I became acquainted with some of the work of that body when I was Agent-General for South Australia in London; but owing to the way in which the bill is being rushed through the House I have been denied an opportunity to so. I regret that the measure will passed.",34

Balaclava (Mr Watt), and found ready acceptance by the Government. I could not believe my ears when I heard the Government accept his suggestion that the agreement should be reviewed inten years time. If the agreement had one good feature, it was its permanence for 58 years. It seems to me that the States and the Australian people generally have been deceived, if it has been intended by the Government that this review should take place. The whole machinery of the scheme is designed to wipe out the inper debtedness of the States in 58 years, and to provide for permanent and definite payments. I am waiting to hear what the various State Premiers and Treasurers think of the suggestion made in this chamber by the right honourable member for Balaclava and the Government's attitude to it. Time and circumstances may compel us to review the agreement, but its outstanding feature was its permanence, and the fact that in 58 years it would liquidate all the debts of the States. I am amazed, because I supported the agreement and I supported the Government. In the first place I opposed the withdrawal of the per capita payments when no agreement such as this was offered in its place, and I believe that the Government made an excellent arrangement in lieu of its original proposal, but I object to any suggestion, such as that from the right honourable member for Balaclava that at this late hour we should go back upon the agreement that has been ratified by the Parliaments of all the States and is understood throughout Australia. I hope that a further statement will be made by the Government on this most serious matter, because it reflects on the whole Parliament.

124,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT," I move That the bill be now read a second time. The object of this bill is to make effective the amendment of sub-section 1 of section 21 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922-27 which was made by the amending act of 1928. The legislation of last year was designed to protect the revenue from the heavy loss which threatened it as a result of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria in the appeal Kellow-Falkiner Pty. Go. Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Taxation. The [REPRESENTATIVES.] Assessment Bill. AYES. judgment had declared that the law as it then stood required the Commissioner to ascertain whether a company had, during a Commonwealth financial year in which the company had derived its taxable income, distributed at least two-thirds of that taxable income among its members or shareholders. If the company had not made such a distribution during that year, the Commissioner could call upon it to pay additional tax at shareholders' rates upon the difference between the actual distributions, if any, made by it during that year out of the taxable income mentioned and two-thirds of. that taxable income. The judgment prevented the Commissioner from substituting a company's NOES. own accounting period for a Commonwealth financial year where the two years differed, or from taking into consideration any distributions which the company may have made out of the income after the close of its own income year, or after the close of a Commonwealth financial year where the company's year ended on the 30th June. The practice of the Commissioner had been to take into consideration all distributions made by the company out of its taxable income, whether made during or subsequent to the close of the company's income year up to the date when PAIRS. the Commissioner determined to apply section 21 of the company's case. Very few of the companies are in a position to make a distribution during an income year out of the profits of that year. As a general rule, a company waits until the close of its income year before ascertaining its profits and before deciding how much of the profits shall be distributed. The acceptance of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria already referred to had the effect of invalidating all previous de'terminations by the Commissioner under section 21 and all consequential assessments, because the Commissioner had not in any case applied his mind to ascertain whether or not during a Commonwealth financial year the company had made any distributions of the profits derived in that year. The 1928 act provided that the existing subsection 1 of section 21 should be replaced by a new provision which should be deemed to have retrospective operation to the date of commencement of the In come Tax Assessment Act 1922, namely, the 18th October, 1922. The new provision that where a company had not before snch date prior to the making of the Commissioner's determination as is fixed by the Commissioner, distributed .among its members or shareholders at least two-thirds of its taxable income, the company would be liable to pay the additional tax provided by the section. The retrospective operation of this provision made it necessary for the Commissioner to bave fixed such a date in connection with all past determinations. This bad not, however, been done and could not be done ex post facto. The 1928 act did not contain any provision definitely validating all past determinations and consequential assessments, so that the department was not able to take any action to claim additional tax by making assessments upon existing determinations where assessments had not already been made. The additional revenue which it was intended should be collected in such cases could not legally be collected. The authority of Parliament is now being sought to enable the Commissioner to make assessments and collect tax in such cases. Tbis bill will validate all past assessments, notwithstanding that no date had been fixed, and all assessments which have been made, notwithstanding that the company's trading year did not coincide with the Commonwealth financial year. Debate (on motion Mr Scullin) adjourned. TARIF F BOARD BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 27th February (vide page 608) upon motion by Mr. GULLETTTliat the bill be now read a second time.",35
125,Mr BLAKELEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Darling) [3.14] The bill contains two important provisions, the first being that which effects a sub-division of the duties of the Tariff Board. Hitherto, the board functioned only in full meeting and now it is proposed that it shall be divided into two sections, each of which will have authority to take evidence and prepare reports. ""With that I cordially agree, believing that the work of the Tariff Board will be advantageous to Australian industries. There is also provision that the Board may confer with the Director of the Bureau of Economic Research concerning certain matters. I do not approve of that. On the contrary I am hostile to it. From time to time statements have been made by chairmen of directors of companies, by Nationalist and Country party members of Parliament, by busybodies such as Rotarians, constitutional club members, and other ""stickybeak"" organizations, which appear to take a delight in interfering with the conditions of the workers and giving advice as to what should be done. All these people have been telling us from time to time that production in' Australia must be upon sound economic lines. In the recent amendment of the Arbitration' Act, which was strenuously opposed by honourable members on this side of the House, there is a provision that a judge of the court must give consideration to the probable economic effect of his award upon the industry itself and other industries that may be affected. I have no doubt that the views of tbese employers' organizations have been conveyed to the Government and have been crystallized in the legislative measures that have come before us in recent years. It would not be in order for me, in the debate on this bill, to trace the history of the various stupid and freakish industrial measures that have been passed by the Federal Parliament. It is clear, however, that the machinery provisions of the Arbitration Act are to be used to break down economic conditions in Australia. Statements have been made before the Tariff Board by various organizations, some of them of mysterious origin. One which I have in mind is the Town and Country Union, which, so far as one can see, has no offices and publishes no balance sheet, and altogether is a most nebulous concern which cannot be said to exist definitely anywhere. Many of tbese bodies, as I have said, arrange from time to time to be represented before the Tariff Board and always, I notice, they state the free trade view. Probably many honourable members remember the extraordinary evidence given by a lecturer named Benham, of the Sydney University, last year in regard to a certain range of customs duties. His evidence was so obsolete and inapplicable to modern Australian conditions, and caused so much indignation that apparently the University Senate instructed him not to. offend again in his position as a lecturer attached to the University. At all events he has not been heard of since. Another professor of the Melbourne University, a gentleman whose name for the moment I forget, has published in pamphlet form, a number of speeches antagonistic to the policy of protection which the people of Australia have endorsed for so many years. These gentlemen, it should _ be noted, are regarded as the leading economists in Australia, so the possibility of the Tariff Board being influenced by their views must cause not a little Uneasiness in the minds of those who have the interests of the Commonwealth at heart. We have built up in Australia a system of high wages and good conditions unparalleled elsewhere in the civilized world. We have established the principle of 44 hours in many industries. It is true"" that the Government is doing its best to take that away from us. We have established also the wage in a number of industries. Again, it is true that the Government is doing its best to break down that standard. We have evidence of this in the present dispute in the timber industry. It would seem that the Government, in introducing this bill desires to have another string to its bow. It proposes to establish a Bureau of Economic Research, which will be presided over by an economist whose ideas may be at variance with those of the people of Australia. The bill provides that, in certain circumstances, the Tariff Board may seek assistance from the director of the Bureau of Economic Research-presumably on the cost of production in Australia. When we remember that the leading text books on economics are all based upon European standards of production, it is difficult to see how the conditions with which they deal can be applied to production in Australia. Eor example, it may be an economic proposition to manufacture certain articles in England, Erance or Germany; but quite uneconomic in Australia, because of our liigher standards and improved industrial conditions. In view of the danger which I foresee, I should like the Minister to define, if he can, the functions of the Mr Blakeley. director of the proposed bureau in consultation with members of the Tariff Board. I am also wondering what was the reason for the visit to Australia recently of the British Economic Mission, popularly known as the "" B i g Four."" Had it any bearing on the question now before the House? These glorified commercial travellers, Mr Amery and the "" B ig Four,"" came to Australia to tell us how we should run this country, and inevitably they expressed the view that many manufacturing industries in Australia were on an uneconomic basis. Honourable members will find in their report various allusions to the high protective tariff in Australia. In one section there appears the following:Protection, as its very name implies, is designed tor the weak, and the weakness may be that of infancy, that of temporary ailment, or that of inefficiency It behoves the State, therefore, to keep a very careful watch upon the whole range of protected industries infant industries are apt to take a long time to grow up and be ready to dispense with their swaddling basic clothes, These are only a few extracts from the report, but they are sumcient to show that the views of the "" Big Four "" are pro-English rather than pro-Australian. They are the ideas of free traders. These gentlemen have something to sell to the people of Australia, and naturally they will do everything possible to* foster British trade, rather than to encourage Australian production. Their report contains a number of what I regard as impertinent comments upon the established policy of the Commonwealth.  member really mean that they were impertinent in their comments?",36
126,Mr BLAKELEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,In my opinion they were.  Australia.,37
127,Mr BLAKELEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I am aware of that, but I believe they exceeded the terms of their invitation. We are completely in the dark as to the reasons for their visit. The Prime Minister, as is well known, is more English than Australian in his outlook, commercially, socially, and otherwise.",37
128,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Order ! The honourable gentleman's remarks are not relevant to the bill.,37
129,Mr BLAKELEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The Prime Minister is constantly referring to what has been done in the British Parliament, and because of his pro-English outlook he invited these people to come to Australia to tell us how we should manage the affairs of this conntry. Obviously, the intention was to encourage British trade with Australia, to the detriment of Australian industries. Not only the Prime Minister, but 'his supporters, probably from a feeling of loyalty, spoke in that vein.",38
130,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"When the Minister was dealing with tihe bill 1 informed Mm that he could not open up the whole question of the tariff policy-freetrad e and protection. The bill relates to the Tariff Board. The honourable member would be quite in .order in discussing the principles nmderlying the bill and the Tariff Aet, .and .also the proposed amendments opening up new questions. The honourable member was quite in order in discussing the economic question, and he is perfectly justified in making incidental references ,to ministerial statements.",38
131,Mr BLAKELEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"^Quite a number of reputable English fijrms have in the past few years lestablished branches in Aaisfacalia, but they did not send delegations here to .ascertain 'whether there was .a market t£or .their products. Por instance, - Sir Arthur Dorman when visiting Aus-fcralia saw the - possibilities of Australian 'industry, and in no time he formed a hnige .company to control the Port Kembla works. One could point to a number of - such instances. Mr J&CKSON - Is not Sir Duckham establisMng a branch of his firm here? Mr BLAKELEY. - I believe he is. We always welcome English capital into this .country. The .more industries that we establish the better it is for Australia; hut we oannot foster British trade, and :at the same time protect Australian industries. To attempt to do that wonld be ridiculous. With reference to the members of the 'Tariff Board, I .am one - of those who believe that good men should be well paid, but I doubt - very much whether the Government should now seek to increase the salaries of those gentlemen. I believe that in Australia can be tfound suitable and efficient men for appointment to the Tariff Board at the present rate of payment. Taking into consideration the desire of the Prime Minister and his followers to cut down wages and to decrease costs of production, it ill becomes the Government to introduce a bill for the. purpose of increasing the salaries of highly-paid officials who may for the time being be appointed to the Tariff Board. The bill provides for consultation between the Tariff Board and the Director of Economic Research. I do not know whether that provision has been inserted at the instigation of the Minister. Judging by his declarations in this House we on this side cannot - but be a little uneasy as to how the industries of Australia will fare under his administration of tariff matters. I have been waiting for the Minister to 'declare his policy. On the 21-st March last year he said Mr .GicnLLBTT - I rise to a point of order. I have no wish to present the honourable member from quoting anything .that I have said, 'but when I was :speaking on the second reading you, sir, pointed out the necessity for me to keep to the subject-matter of the bill, and I .ask that the honourable member be requested to do 'likewise. Mr .SPEAKER - The contention of the honourable member for Darling is .that .tke salaries of the members of the Tariff Board axe being increased, while wages in industries are being decreased. While he confines his remarks to that argument he is in order. . Mr BLAKELEY - I frankly say .that Arthur I am uneasy as to the motive behind Ithe bill, and particularly ,so in view iof the Minister's statement on the 21st March] 1928, that he was favourable to a substantial reduction of .customs and .excise duties.",38
132,Mr GFIXETJE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Ero m what publication ie .the honourable member quoting.?,38
133,Mr BLAKELEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Ero m Mansard of 21st iMarch, 1928. The Minister made - that declaration when a private member., and it iseems to indicate that he is not such a friend of Australian industries ;as was 'the late Minister.",38
134,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The honourable member is not in order in discussing the 'Minister's fiscal views, unless he can show definitely that they have some relation to the principles of the bill. The honourable member is perfectly in order in discussing the Tariff Board.",38
135,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It may be advisable to 'uneasy regarding his appointment. ascertain what we may discuss under the bill. I submit that it would be quite order for an honourable member to discuss the method of appointing the Tariff Board, from what quarter its members Australian industry. sliould be drawn, and whether they should be permanent officials or represenmember tatives of commercial interests. In cussing those questions surely titled to canvass the fiscal views of the Minister wbo will make the appointments - bill provides",39
136,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The honourable memTariff ber may discuss the views of the Minister dustry. so far as they relate to the principles underlying the bill. The bill before orable members is proposed to amend the Tariff Board Act.,39
137,Mr GULLETT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Every one knows that when speaking on the 21st March, 1928, I was referring to revenue duties.",39
138,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Tb e Minister may lines. correct any misrepresentation of his views when he replies.,39
139,Mr BLAKELEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I have no desire to misrepresent what the Minister He undoubtedly stated that he favourable to a substantial reduction in customs and excise duties. He went on say that the financial position would infinitely worse because of the loss revenue. That has nothing to do with the bill, so I did not quote it at first. That declaration was made when the sent Minister was a private member, and bably he then had no thought of being .Minister for Trade and Customs, because after all, the main qualification for that position would ordinarily be a keen desire to protect Australian industries? Apparently his qualifications, or the speech that he made, so impressed the Prime Minister in his desire to bring about greater trade for any country but Australia, that he was given the job. I again ask the Minister whether he is sponsible for the clause under which the Director of Economic Research may agree supply information to the Tariff Board. I think that I am quite justified in deavouring to ascertain what was the state of mind of the Minister prior to appointment as Minister for Trade and Customs. Because of some of his declarations, and of his first effort here as Minister, I am quite frankly sceptical and I hope that my disquiet is without foundain tion, that he will follow in the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor, and adopt a policy which will more firmly establish",39
140,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The honourable apparently is now speaking of disprotecting Australian industry. He must one is enconfine himself to the bill.,39

142,Mr SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The honourable honmember said that the Minister should follow the example of his predecessor and then he appeared to proceed to state what his predecessor's policy was, namely, the establishment of new industries by tariff legislation. He must not speak on those",39
143,Mr BLAKELEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I am most unfortunate in that no matter what line of discussion I open up, I am presaid. vented from following it by the was Standing Orders. I do not agree with the Standing Orders in that respect, to but I bow to your ruling. I think that be I am in order in paying a tribute to the of late Minister for Trade and Customs for the magnificent way in which he carried out his duties, and I hope that the preMinister will follow in his footsteps. proI ask leave to continue my remarks. Leave granted; debate adjourned. ADJOURNMEINT T. CURTAILMENT or DEBATES-DUT Y ON - BANANAS. Motion (by Mr GULLETT) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",39
144,Mr MARTENS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Herbert) [3.50] - I desire to enter a protest against the prorecedure which has been adopted in this House in passing certain legislation. I that it is a good thing sometimes to use the guillotine, but it should be used enwith discretion. I have wished to speak on more 'than one measure recently, but his I have been denied the right to do so. I think that I have been unfairly treated. ""When I sought leave to speak, I was told that the measures before the House had been discussed before; but I was not,, a member of this House then, and I was sent here to oppose some of those measures. If honourable members are definitely obstructing the business of the House, it is quite right to apply the guillotine. In such circumstances, I myself should be unmerciful. But in the cases to which I have referred I think that the Government treated new members unfairly. I feel this matter very keenly, especially as some honourable members ou the other side who helped to apply the gag against the Opposition, themselves came into the chamber immediately after the division and took up most of the time allotted. ' Mr GREGORY (Swan) [3.52] - A few days ago, I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he would refer to the Tariff Board the duty on bananas. I do not think that the present Minister was in Parliament when the present very heavy duty of 8s. 4d. a central, or l d . a lb. was imposed. For months past, right throughout Australia, the worse bananas ever produced in any part of the world have been sold to the public. The duty on bananas is unduly high. Bananas are one of the finest foods which can be given to children, and should be sold at a reasonable price. I ask the Minister to give the matter further consideration, with a view to having it fully investigated by the Tariff Board.",39
145,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Maribyrnong) [3.54]. - I am surprised that this request should come from the honourable member for Swan, who, I understand, professes to be a primary producer. If be is, Why is he not prepared to grant protection to the banana-growers of Queensland. The Queensland growers are trying to produce bananas under white men's conditions, and arc as much entitled to protection as are any other class of primary producers. The honourable member in defaming Queensland bananas seems to be following the old course of depreciating everything Australian. We can produce good bananas here. In Melbourne, only recently, I ate some of the finest and most richly flavoured bananas I have ever had in my life. If the banana-growers are not to receive protection, the alternative is that Australians mnst eat the product of black labour. Apparently, the honourable member wants to go back to trading with F i j i . Let us consider the conditions under which those bananas are produced in that island. Does he.wish Australians to work under the conditions, and for the wages that are paid to the black workers there? If he does, he is most un-Australian in his views. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.55 p.m.",40
