3,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I observed in the' press last week an intimation to the effect that the pilgrimage of honourable members to Tooma, which the Treasurer was to conduct, was also, .if possible, to be extended to Tumut. I desire to know whether the breakdown which occurred was arranged by the honourable gentleman' in order to prevent the inspection of Tumut?",14
4,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Treasurer whether, in view of the reported disappearance of a number of Federal Members who, under his guidance, went to inspect a proposed Federal Capital Site in the neighbourhood of Tooma, he proposes to send out a search party ?",14
5,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes ; I shall send the honourable' member.

COLLECTION OF MAILS BY MOTOR CARCANCELLED MAIL CONTRACT - CBE CODE-ENGLIS H MAILS-CABINE T COMMITTEE OK INQUIRY-EMPLOYMEN T OF ASIATICS. PETITION. Mr HUTCHISON - Last week I directed the attention of the Postmaster General to the unsatisfactory nature of the motor car service for the collection of letters in Adelaide.' I desire now to learn whether h:s attention has been drawn to the followingparagraph which appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser, and was published in the Melbourne press on Saturday lastTHE USE or MOTOR CARS. Melbourne, March 29. . Reports received by Mr Mauger (the .Postmaster-General) from the Deputy Postmaster General of South Australia with reference to the pillar clearance work of the motor car. service in Adelaide, show that the recent breakdowns have not been continued, and that there is a prospect of the smooth working of the. new cars in the near future. Premature collection! from pillars will be specially guarded against. Mr Mauger has approved of calling for tenders for cars to clear pillars in Prahran. I desire to know if the Postmaster-General has noticed also the following paragraphMAIL MOTORS' IN TROUBLE. motors employed to collect letters at Hindmarsh met with two mishaps on the Portroad last .week. On one occasion, it is said, something went wrong with the - steering gear, and the driver ran against a vehicle and was thrown out. In the second instance the motor stopped, and another had to be .sent for. I ask the Postmaster-General whether he still thinks the service satisfactory, or whether it can be improved upon ?",14
7,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The service is as satisfactory as any service in an experimental stage can be expected to be. Steps have been taken which will make the service quite as satisfactory - as the' honourable member can desire.,14
8,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"I desire to know from the Postmaster-General, whether he has any information withregard to the £25,000 re-. coverable from Messrs. James Laing and Company, under the cancelled mail contract, or whether he has given up all hope of recovering the money ?",14
9,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The only information I have is that action is proceeding.,14
10,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has, no doubt, observed that there is to be an International Telegraph Conference held at Lisbon in June next, and that there is an idea abroad that the facilities at present enjoyed in the Commonwealth in the matter of the cable code may be curtailed. In. other words, it is believed that words, which are not very easily pronounced, are not to be allowed in cable messages, and, if that be so, it will be a very serious for Australia. I desire to know the Prime Minister will take steps to see that the present facilities we enjoy in this asked the question. regard are continued. It is most important for a country so isolated as Australia have the facilities to which I refer. know of one firm who are spending £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 in the preparation of a code under the old regulations, and if the rule should come into operation, the busipartments. ness of the country will be much interin fered with.",14
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"So far as I can learn, we have no official information of such intention. There are rumours to that effect, but whether they relate to an tion of the present practice, or are merely proposals in relation to future ness, we are not aware. However, proposed that the Commonwealth shall represented at the Lisbon Conference, steps will be taken to protect any rights we now enjoy.",15
12,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I desire to ask the P.ostmaster-General whether he cannot expedite the delivery of the English mails? haustive. The Commonwealth Parliament House seems to be about the last point of delivery. I heard of English.mail being delivered at Toorak and all over the city about luncheon time today, but only just now received mine.",15
13,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I shall make inquiries on the question.,15
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, a question with reference to a Committee which has recently been appointed to investigate affairs concerning the Post and Telegraph Department. I understand that a Comthe mittee of three, consisting of Cabinet Ministers, has been appointed for that pose. Will the Prime Minister tell the House what the scope of the inquiry is be-for instance, whether ' evidence persons outside is to be invited; and genesaid, rally as to what it is proposed to do?",15
15,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Of course, strictly speaking, a Cabinet has no Committees. All its business is done by the whole Cabinet. But in. view of the frequency, number, and gravity of the complaints made with reference to the working of Post and Telegraph Department, two Minabout isters-on e of . whom, the Minister Home Affairs, is directly connected with one branch of our postal administration,, inasmuch as he represents the Public Service Commissioner-were asked to render thing aid to the Postmaster-General in conductwhether ing an investigation.",15
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is .why I I wish to know whether it is proposed to confine the into quiry to the relations between the ComI missioner and the Department, or to those between the Department and the public.",15
17,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The inquiry is not to new be confined to the relations between DeThe whole range of questions which the'public are interested will come before the Committee in one shape or another. The proceedings of the Committee an have commenced. Inquiries have been d i rected to certain officers in the various alteraStates, mostly the Deputy Postmasters General, in reference to specific questions busirelating to the administration of the Dei t is partment. Their recommendations will be be considered when they arrive. Afterwards and the inquiry will be extended, so as to be directed to public complaints of any character. When those complaints have been classified, consideration will be given to them. The inquiry is intended to be exMr DUGA LD THOMSON - But not public.",15
18,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,P a r t of it may be letters made public as it proceeds. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - That is not I have usual with Cabinet Committees.,15
19,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"At the present stage it ' will not be public, but it will receive and register public complaints.",15
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It will not be satisfactory unless it is public.,15
21,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Not satisfactory to the public, the honourable member means? But matters with which the Committee are dealing more particularly at this moment re-. purquire no participation on the part of the public than has alreadv been taken by comto plaints which must be replied to in the from form of reports by officers. As I have the intention is not to stop there, but to deal with any further public complaints made with regard to the Department. These complaints will be classified in order that the inquiry may be searching. If the Government find that the means of investigation at the disposal of the Committee are the not sufficient there will be no hesitation asking this House for further power of to deal with the difficulties.",15
22,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"May I ask TPrime Minister whether the Government will extend the scope of the inquiry, so that it may include the relations between the Treasury and the Post and Telegraph Department? I ask that question because I have received a letter which contains a recommendation that a certain telephone should be constructed. The letter says that the Postmaster-General is satisfied that the telephone is necessary, but that the matter has been referred to the Secretary of the Department for advice on financial matters in connection therewith. I should like to ask the Prime Minister, therefore, whether the scope of the inquiry will be extended so as to include the 'relations between the Department and the Treasury?",16
23,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The manner in which each year's Estimates are prepared is fairly well known; and the manner in which those Estimates are dealt with afterwards by this House is thoroughly well known. Certain sums are voted for certain purposes. If , however, the demands for new services during the twelve months go up by leaps and bounds, far surpassing anything anticipated when the Estimates were prepared-so that if it was estimated that there would - be a demand for 5,000 telephones there is actually a demand for 20,000-the amount of money available is of course far short of what is required. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - That is a difficulty that has been experienced over and over again during the past seven years to my knowledge.",16
24,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"But the honourable member knows that the demand for new - services during the last twelve months has - greatly exceeded what could have been - foreseen when the Estimates were prepared, even in the light of our experience <of previous years.",16
25,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,The Department introduced the toll system before they were ready for it.,16
26,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We were told that the toll system would be found to be so horribly unpopular that possibly our calculations were affected by that prophecy when estimating the number of people who would take advantage of it. The Estimates were also exceeded in consequence of an extension of the area within which lines mioht be required. Demands out of all proportion to a reasonable estimate of the Treasurer have been made.,16
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Were the Estimates made by the - Treasurer ? the Mr DEAKIN - B y the Department first, and then submitted to the Treasurer and the Cabinet.",16
28,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Is the Postmaster General aware that Asiatics are being employed in the carrying"""" of mails from Port Hedland to Marble Bar, in Western Australia? If , after inquiry, he is satisfied that that statement is correct, does he propose to take any action?",16
29,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I propose to . take whatever action is necessary to carry out the policy of this House and of the Department; that is, that white labour is to be employed in carrying our mails. PRIVILEGE : SELECT COMMITTE E ON PROCEDURE.",16
30,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question based on certain information he gave on the motion for adjournment on Friday in regard to the appointment of a Committee of this Parliament to devise means of procedure in respect of charges of corruption. I desire to know whether, when this Committee has devised or discovered means of procedure, it is the intention of the Prime Minister to introduce legislation, and if so, whether in that case the charges placed before this House by the honourable member for Lang, and the honourable member for Hunter will be immediately investigated ?",16
31,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I hope to give notice to-night' of the members the Government propose to appoint on the Committee. The 'Committee will be asked to report at once, and that will probably require some action by this House, to be taken as soon as time permits. Afterwards, it will be competent for the House to decide which, if any, of the charges already made shall be.investigated. If they come within the new Act they can be dealt with. CHINESE IN AUSTRALIA.",16
32,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has noticed the following statement made by Mr Angus MCLeod, President of the Board of Directors of the Australian Natives Association at Perth :Perth, March 29. Mr Angus MCLeod, president of the board of directors of the A.N.A., stated that when the Federal inquiry in regard to Chinese evading the immigration .regulations was set afoot, his association would be ready with facts to show that a number of Chinese had recently entered the Commonwealth. In 1903 a Chinese was allowed, into Western Australia on a special certificate for the purpose of scientific research, and 12 months later he was ironing shirts in 'a Perth laundry. He was summoned and convicted for the purpose of deportation, but despite the sentence he was still in Perth. Will the Prime Minister cause inquiries to be made, and does he not think tihat the time has arrived' when, in view of the extent of our coastline, all Chinese in Australia ought to be registered?",16
33,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have noticed the paragraph; and the statement. made as to the Chunaman ironing shirts is correct. But the law has been since altered so as to close the loop-hole through which he managed to remain. The statement as to the influx of young Chinamen is receiving special attention, and its accuracy will be known very shortly. SIZE OF GRAIN BAGS.  Minister of - Trade and Customs whether, in view of the fact that there is great misapprehension' as to the shape of the wheat bags it is proposed tb introduce, he will secure one of the dimensions described the regulations, and having had it filled with wheat, will place it in some position the purposes of this Bill in the precincts of the House, so that honourable members can ascertain whether it is a handv shape of bag?",17
34,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I think that this question ought rather, to be addressed to Mr Speaker. If Mr Speaker will give permission, I shall be very glad to have one of the proposed new wheat bags here, and also one of the cated by honourable members, so that Ave may be satisfied.",17
35,Mr TUDO R,Unknown,"Will the Minister of Trade and Customs also get one of the lbs. bags which were carried on the Vic-' toriari Railways,, at Rainbow, last week?",17
36,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I shall be very glad to do so, if the honourable ber for Indi will undertake to carry it in .",17
37,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"These questions are truly national !  that my inquiry has not reference to the size of the bags, but is designed to elicit whether the shape, as described by the regulations, is convenient for handling. Hence, I desire to know whether the Minister, without giving me any flippant - answer, is prepared to bring one of the new bags here? If he cannot get a full bag, let us have an empty one. Honourable members will then be able to see the shape of the bags which; are to come into use.",17
38,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Certainly. SECRET DRUGS, CURES, AND FOODS. MR. BEALE' S REPORT.",17
39,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Las t week the Prime Minister promised to lay upon the table' papers with reference to Mr Beale's report on secret drugs and medicines. May I ask him whether he will adhere fo that promise, and, if so, when the papers will be produced?",17
40,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The papers were before me this morning. They have not yet reached my hands to be laid upon ihe table. Perhaps they will arrive later. QUARANTINE BILL. Assent reported. SURPLUS REVENUEBILL . Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of a in message from His Excellency the Governor General recommending an appropriation for ALBANY FORTS.,17
41,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"the Minister of Defence, ufon notice I. Whether any report was made by Colonel Wallack, who recently inspected the Forts at Albany (King George's Sound) as to the efficiency of the armaments to repel an attack? 2. Whether the guns are sufficiently powerful size advoto repel hostile cruisers? 3. Whether the Forts are sufficiently manned, and, if so, what are the numbers, of permanent oflicers and artillerymen, &c. ? 4. How many of the men belonging to the 475 Albany Forts are working in Fremantle, and whether permanent provision for the Forts at Albany and Fremantle is to be made, and, if so, to what extent?",17
42,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The answers to the right memhonorable member's questions are as follow1. No. 2. These guns, which are one 6-in. Mark IV . and two Mark VI . , were manufactured in 1889-1890, and are regarded as' much inferior weapons to the 6-in. Mark VII . which it is proposed to place in Fixed Defences. The guns at Albany would be useful ' against an unarmoured cruiser, but cannot be regarded as efficient. 3. No. See 4. 4 and 3. Five. At Fremantle full provision will be made when forts are complete. There is much difference in expert opinion regarding the re-arming of Albany, but if determined upon it will await the completion of more urgent work. It is not only a question of re-arming forts and of personnel for guns, but also of garrison troops for land defence of forts. Viewing the question solely from stand-point of numbers, in the Commonwealth there are n,8oi infantry under training at present. The Garrison Troops stipulated in C.I.D. and Commonwealth officers' reports as necessary for land protection of forts numbers 9,550. In the event of sudden hostilities there would be a surplus of only 2,351 infantry under training available for land protection at Albany and all the rest of the Continent. NA CARRIERS AND MAIL-CART",17
43,Mr HUTCHISON,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN,"for CHELOR) asked the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, u-bon notice I. How many letter carriers are there in - South Australia? 2. How many assistant letter carriers? 3. What is the difference in the salaries and duties of these officers? 4. How many mail-cart drivers are there?, 5. How many assistant mail-cart drivers? 6. What is the difference in the salaries and duties of these officers?",18
44,Mr HUME COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN,"The Public Service Commissioner has furnished the following information- ' 1. Seventy-two letter carriers Grade I . and thirty-six Grade II . ) 2.

45,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"About a fortnight ago, the Prime Minister, in reply to the right honourable member for Swan, stated that he would be' prepared to lay before the House the Government proposals in regard to the financial relations of the Commonwealth and States before the coming Conference of Premiers. I desire to know whether the Prime Minister is prepared to make a more definite statement as to the time when we shall have an opportunity to consider those proposals.",18
46,Mr DEAKIN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I am not yet in a position to name the day when the pro : posals will be ready to lay before the House. LETTER- Mr WH IRVINE - It will be this session ? DRIVERS. Mr DEAKIN - Eefor e the Premiers,18
47,Mr BAT,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,meet.,18
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the Government will give this House' an opportunity of discussing before being submitted to the Conference the new proposals of the Government, to be submitted to the Premiers' Conference next month, in regard to the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and States? 2. What - are the reasons that have actuated the Government to withdraw from the proposals made by the Government to the Premiers' Conferences at Melbourne and Brisbane, and which were agreed to by the States and accepted by the Commonwealth at the Brisbane Conference in April last year? (thirty-six 3. Does the Government consider this withdrawal justifiable - or fair or courteous lo the States which agreed to the Commonwealth proposals, more especially seeing that Parliament has never been given an opportunity of considering the arrangements which were ngreed to by the States and Commonwealth at Brisbane in April last year with the approval of - both parties?",18
49,Mr DEAKIN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"In reply to the honourable member's questions, I beg to stateAt Brisbane the Commonwealth submitted complete proposals for taking over the debts of the States, and making payments to their Treasuries, but, the Premiers having resolved £(>o; that the question of taking over the debts should be postponed, no agreement was attained. Any consideration given by the Parliament must be to the proposals as a whole. It is hoped that some agreement will be arrived at with the Premiers after their Conference next month. In that event, it will be at once submitted to Parliament. So far there is no restriction of any kind upon the freedom, either of the Commonwealth BETWEEN - or of the States, preventing them from varying their proposals. The announcement already made that it is the intention of the Government to include in their scheme a provision for Old age Pensions necessarily implies a modification of the Brisbane proposals. ELECTORAL ROLLS.",18
50,Mr WATKINS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"for Mr Webster) asked the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice Whether he will supply the House with following information :- . 1. The number of names removed from the me. Federal electoral toll during' the collection made in 1906? 2. The number of names added to the roll used at the last Federal election? 3.

52,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Trea - ' end surer) [3.33] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. I cannot justly be accused of making the speeches of undue length .in moving the aexpended second reading of Bills, and on this occaforce the Commonwealth sion I,shall again attempt- I hope successthe fully-to explain clearly and concisely the expended. objects in view, and the effect of the main special provisions of the measure. VVhen intxo duced, the Bill was accompanied by a States memorandum which has been laid on the table of the House, and which I wish empurposes. bodied in Hansard for future reference. I fore, do not know that it is necessary, to insure its appearance in that publication, that I should read it ; perhaps it will meet with the. wishes of honourable members if I merely draw attention to it now, on the the understanding that it will be incorporated in the official report as if actually read by",19
53,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"If only the document referred to were concerned, it would, no doubt, be convenient to permit its publication in Hansard without putting the Treasurer to the trouble of reading it ; but I feel bound to point out-that, were the honourable gentleman's request granted, I should have to grant similar requests fromother will honourable members, and it might come about within a short time that written and, perhaps, lengthy discourses, no part of PAPERS. which had been spoken in the Chamber, would be handed in for publication in Hansard. I think it desirable, therefore, that the Treasurer should read the memothe Premier of randum he speaks of.",19
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I am not sure that it would be a disadvantage if some speeches were handed in instead of being delivered.. The memorandum reads as followsThe bookkeeping clauses of the Constitution, eighty-nine and ninety-three, have been found to hamper considerably the finances of Commonwealth. The strict system of crediting revenue, debiting actual expenditure, and paying monthly balances.to the States means that, whatever the financial obligations of the Commonwealth for the coming month or the coming year may be, the Treasury must be emptied of cash-at the end of each month. The difficulties were comparatively small in the early stages of the Commonwealth, before n the establishment of large .national undertakings and the bookkeeping clauses were never - intended to lastbeyond these preliminary stages. They were made absolute for five years after the imposition of uniform duties,but were terminable after that period at the will of Parliament. Those five years have now elapsed, and Parliament has power to put an to the operation of sections eighty-nine to ninety-three by legislation under section ninetyfour. Section ninety-four is far more elastic than temporary sections. Those sections contain special appropriation to the States of all unrevenue; and while they remain in is bound to return to States every penny that is not actually Under section ninety-four the appropriation by the Constitution ceases and in its place there is a requirement that the Federal Parliament should appropriate to the all surplus revenue, i.e., all revenue which it does not require for Commonwealth In legislation under section ninety-four, therethe Parliament may provide for the retention of revenue which, though not actually expended at the end of any.given month, is nevertheless required for and appropriated to the public puiposes of the Commonwealth, and is therefore not in any sense "" surplus revenue.'! This Bill , after providing that the temporary clauses shall cease to operate, substitutes parliamentary provisions for the same .purpose and enables the Commonwealth at any time to withdraw from the Consolidated Revem:e and pay to Trust Account moneys which have been appropriated by the Parliament for any tpecial purpose. The Bill does not, of course, affect the operation of section eighty-seven (the Braddon Clause); but, while the Commonwealth remains during the currency of the Braddon Clause under ah obligation to return to the States three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, it will have power to retain anything over and above that amount which it requires and has appropriated ' for Commonwealth expenditure. The Bill makes no radical alteration in the method of crediting revenue and debiting expenditure. It , however, makes provision for certain minor adjustments as to - which the terms of the Constitution itself were not sufficiently explicit, but as to the justice of which there can be .no dispute. For instance, there is a definition of New Revenue. Revenue is revenue which is credited to the States on a population basis. Amounts were received from time to time by the Treasury which, although received in a particular State, could not by reason of their nature be credited to such State. Again, the Commonwealth earns interest on money in its hands in London. This interest is not collected in any State, and does not belong to any State. It has been divided on a. population basis. The expenditure for the production of Gazettes and Federal parliamentary reports is borne on a' population basis; the proceeds of sale, being practically a reimbursement of that expenditure, are also distributed on a population basis without respect to the State in which they are received. Considerable amounts have been received for rebates made by shipping companies in respect of freight from Great Britain to Australia. It is practically impossible to trace the items on which the freight of the various shipments were originally charged, and it has been the practice to distribute such amounts on a population basis. In practice, the greater part of the revenue received by the new Commonwealth Departments, which really do not appertain to any particular State, is being distributed on a population basis; and this Bill lays down definite rules - in accordance with which such amounts are to be credited. It has been found, however, that any precise rule which can be laid down for this purpose will cause some anomalies; and tlierefore two pro- visos have been inserted to give a measure of elasticity to the system, and to' enable the Treasurer to credit on - a population basis any items of revenue which obviously, from tlieir nature, should be so distributed, and, on the otlier hand, to credit to a particular State, any items of revenue which, from their nature, obviously ought to be so credited. Sir William Lyne. The necessity for this Bill - will, I am sure, appeal to honourable members. Since the inception of Federationwe have every year handed over to the Treasurers of the States a sum considerably in excess of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled under the Constitution. I propose to put before honourable members some figures which will clearly show what we have done in that respect.",19
55,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Every one is familiar with them. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - The honourable member may be familiar with the amounts, but there are others who are not. The following sums have been returned to the States in excess of the ' three-fourths to which they were .entitled:-For the half year ended 30th June, 1901, £ 5 7 7 , 8 4 5 ; in 1901 -2, £ 8 8 8 , 7 4 1 ; 1902-3, £ 1 , 1 4 5 , 2 3 4 ; i 9 3 - 4, £ 7 4 5 , 3 3 ; '904-5, ; £ 7 3 5 , 2 8 6 ; 0 2 i 9 ° 5 - °, £ 8 2 9 , 9 1 0 ; 1906-7,"" £ 8 0 5 , 7 6 6 . The total amount so paid for the six years was £ 5 > 7 > "" 4 2 8 New Mr MCDONALD - That statement does ' not apply to all the States. Queensland, for instance, has been receiving less than her three-fourths.",20
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I am aware of that. I have quoted these figures in .order to show first of all that the Commonwealth has returned to the States revenue that which rightly'- belonged to us, and which could have been utilized in carrying out various works, for which a demand has been made on many occasions. In the second place, the figures show that the accusation of extravagance made againsb us by representatives of the States, and repeated over and over again with a desire to injure the Commonwealth, is absolutely without foundation.",20
57,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The unfortunate feature of the situation is that while some of the States have had returned to them more than their three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue, others have had paid to them less than the three-fourths.",20
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"We have made a distribution according to law, so that neither the Government as a whole,- nor the Treasurer, can be held blameable in that regard. The result of the system hitherto adopted has been ' that works which should have been spread over a number of years, ancl paid for out of the surplus revenue, have been held in abeyance, and that certain services have no doubt beenstarved. This year, all the Departments are making urgent demands for works which, as I have said, should have been spread over a number of ' years. In submitting the Additional Estimates, I shall make a statement as to our present expenditure, and the demands of the Departments, which I think will astonish honourable members.",20
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Why wait until the Additional Estimates are submitted? does not the honourable member tell us frankly what he proposes to do?,21
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I shall speak frankly ; but I cannot now put before House the actual amounts proposed to expended, since the framing of the Additional Estimates has not yet been comshall pleted - It is sumcient to say that I am called upon this year to find money, in many cases, for works, which, had we been able to make the provision for which this Bil l provides, would have been spread over a number of years.'",21
61,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The honourable gentleman would have been able to keep, a nest-egg.",21

63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The money has been spent by the States, and not the Commonwealth, which is in greater need of it . Whilst sections 89 and 93 of plenty of money. the Constitution are in force, it is necessary to hand over to the States every penny of the revenue that we do not spend during the financial year. principal object that I have in view in inrecently' troducing this Bill is to enable the Goourselves vernment to keep in hand sufficient to meet our liabilities in respect of which this Parliament has declared shall be carried out, so that the liability incurred quarantine. in respect of any one year shall not be carried forward to burden the next financial year.",21

70,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Does the Treasurer mean to say that this Bill will enable the Government to retain the whole of the onethe fourth of Customs and Excise revenue to be which the Commonwealth is entitled ?,21
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"It will, ancl we also be able to retain any revenue from other sources. Last year, in addition to the one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue that we were entitled to retain, we received from various services-chiefl y from the Post and Telegraph Department-somethin g like £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 stated to be profit. That sum went into the general revenue, and instead : of being devoted to the carrying out of works of which the Post and Telegraph Department was in urgent - need, was handed over to the Treasurers of the States, the Commonwealth being left to obtain, in some other way, the revenue reby quired for pressing public works.",21

At'present the the balances of London accounts over the various States amount to £250,804; and that is to what 'the right honourable member for Swan, I think, was referring the other night.

102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I should like the Treasurer to. explain how far he is modifying our powers relating to the bookkeeping. It may be clear to the Minister, but it is not clear to us. Sir'WILLIAM LYNE - If the honourable member will permit me to proceed, I shall give any' information he desires at the conclusion of my remarks. Section 89 of the Constitution directs that the Commonwealth shall credit to each State the revenue collected therein by the Commonwealth, and shall debit to each State: (a) the expenditure therein incurred solely for the maintenance or continuance, as af the time of transfer, of any Department transferred from the State to the Comand (b) the proportion of the State, according to the number of the people, in the other expenditure of Commonwealth.",23

104,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Yes , except so far as concerns the trust funds. The bal-. ance is directed to be paid over monthly to the States.",24
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"That is the point, and the only point.",24
106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Probably the great point.,24
107,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"And there is an endeavour to interpret ""new revenue."" sion is closed.",24
108,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Probably , but the interpretation of "" expenditure"" is more important.",24
109,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"We have to find' the interpretation of - "" expenditure,"" for more? the purposes of the Bill , in the Bill itself.",24
110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Yes , but not the interpretation of the words in the Conant stitution. So long as this section stands, there is a doubt as to the legality of creditpenditure,"" ing any amount to a trust fund in the ner desired. That is not my opinion, but the opinion of the law omcers I have con89 sulted. The words "" debit to each State the expenditure therein "" might possibly be held not to include payments fund with a view to further expenditure. It has been thought wise, therefore, to Parliament to exercise the powers which it trary. undoubtedly possesses, under section 94 of the Constitution, to virtually repeal tions 89 and 93, and to provide a new basis for distributing its surplus revenue.

124,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,This .will really be a suspense account.,24
125,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"It is a suspense account for works authorized by this Parliament. I also want honourable members to take notice of the fact that the States will this year get at least £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 more than was anticipated would be returned to them. mainly owing to the increase of revenue from Customs and Excise. There will be an increase of £1,000,000, three-fourths of which Vhe States will get. So that they will be in a very good position indeed.",25
126,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The Treasurer led them to believe that they would get more.,25
127,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"No , I did not. I calculated, in the Budget, that the States would have returned to them £ 1 0 3 , 0 0 0 more than their three-fourths after the Commonwealth had taken its one-fourth.",25

129,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"No , £ 1 0 3 , 0 0 0 above the three-fourths to which they are entitled. I think the estimated increase of revenue was £ 8 7 0 , 0 0 0. ever, it appears that the increase will be £ 1,000,00 0 more, of which they will get £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 . So that they are really placed in a splendid financial position.",25
130,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Will the Minister make the matter a little plainer ? that uncier his proposed scheme the States will get £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 over and above their three-fourths ?",25
131,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"No . £ 7 5 0 . 0 0 0 is an amount additional to that which they would have received if my estimate had not been exceeded. In view of the fact that a very considerable sum will in any case be paid this year to the States Treasurers, the Commonwealth is perfectly justified, as long as it obeys section 87 of the Constitution-the Braddon section-in retaining the amount which it requires for purposes to which it is committed. Now, sir, I desire to say a few words in regard to one or two other matters which are dealt with under this Bill . In framing the clauses which are to supersede the sections of the Constitution which direct the book-keeping of the Treasury, the opportunity has been taken to give certain specific directions not given by the Constitution. For instance, the Constitution does not provide for the crediting of any revenue on a population basis. Section 89 directs that, the Commonwealth shall credit to each State the revenues collected therein by the Commonwealth. It does not provide for the crediting of revenue received outside the Commonwealth, as, for instance, interest on moneys in London. Nor does it provide that such items as "" forfeited deposits on contracts for new works,"" and "" part cost of erection of telegraph and telephone lines,"" shall be credited, That is as is manifestly fair, on a population basis. In the matter of the erection of telephone and telegraph lines, for example, the case is this: Some private individuals very often pay to the Post and Telegraph Depa l'tment an amount! of money to defray part of the cost of the construction of a line which they are anxious tb obtain. That money goes into the Consolidated Revenue, and does not belong to any particular State.",25
132,Mr HENRY WILLIS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The Treasury must pay it to some State. What do they do with it?,25
133,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"We have-pro bably without absolute legal authority-re turned it to the States per capita. The money goes into the general revenue, and Now, howis distributed on a population basis. The Treasurer has in the past taken the responsibility of so crediting such amounts;' but as the opportunity now arises to legalize this practice, advantage is taken of it in this Bill. In certain exceptional cases Does he mean also expenditure in a State has not been debited to the State as directed in the Constitution. For instance, an arrangement was made, in which the States of New The South Wales and Victoria concurred, that the expenditure on the' border Customs Houses should be equally divided between the two States instead of the State on whose side of the river a particular station happened to be being debited with the expenditure. Technically, I do not think that that is legal. Therefore, I am proposing to make it legal under this Bill . It is the proper thing to do. Section 89 of the Constitution directs the Treasurer to debit to a State the expenditure "" therei n . "" - To meet the difficulty I have explained, and others of a similar nature,'-as they occur, the word "" therein "" has been omitted from clause 4 of this Bill . In the observationswhich I have made, I have explained the technical features of the measure. In doing so, I have tried to be brief, and to the point.",25
134,Mr HENRY WILLIS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"If the interpretation were given by the High Court, it would be of more value.",25
135,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,But the honourable member knows that we cannot get an interpretation by the High - Court unless some person takes a case there.,25
136,Mr HENRY WILLIS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The Treasurer is proposing to repeal certain sections of the Constitution.,26
137,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The Bill does propose to legalize some things which the Treasury has done.,26
138,Mr HENRY WILLIS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The Government have no power to alter the Constitution.,26
139,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I have tried to explain the Bill-and think I have succeeded-in such a way that it may be understood by any lay mind. It is an im- very large indeed. portant Bill. It is a Bill that will no doubt be criticized very acutely-and probably very adversely-by some of the States Treasurers.,26
140,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,B y all of them.,26
141,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"It will not criticised adversely by the Commonwealth Treasurer at all events, and I think the matter appeals to the Commonwealth than to any other party. Treasurers ought to consider that they have received in the past the immense sums of money to which I have referred, and that they are going to receive, at all events this year, another very large sum money if the actual three-fourths of year is taken as a basis.",26
142,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"About £ 1 , 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 additional this year, if the Treasurer's estimate be right.",26
143,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Quite so; I think it comes to about that amount-that is, having regard to the estimate which I made in the first instance, and the actual returns that are coming, in from Customs and Excise. Admitting that the honour and Excise. able member's estimate of £ 1 , 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 is correct, I think that the States should not grumble in view of the very large sum of money that is being returned to them.",26

They are works - which are of a necessary character.",26
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Is the Treasurer contemplating any especially large expenditure within the next two years ?,26
147,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I do not know that there will be any large expenditure except this-that the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department has sprung up to such an extent this year that it really frightens me j and I am not easily frightened in regard to financial matters. If what the Department requires for next year-and probably it is right in requiring it in the interests of the public-is voted, the expenditure will certainly be I have to find this money, and I have to look ahead to see what we are to do to provide it. Already I have been asked to find extra money to be expended, not this year, but next year, 'on the Post and Telegraph Department be alone, amounting to £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",26
148,Mr HENRY WILLIS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The Department more ought to be put in commission. The States Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I am not speaking about what ought to be done, nor am I complaining. But I was attacked today by the honourable member for Corio in regard to finding money for works for of Post Office purposes. The fact is that the last demands have been so heavy during the past year that I cannot find the money until Parliament votes it.",26
149,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The Treasurer has set down a great deal more on the Estimates for post and telegraph purposes this year. Sir WILLIAM LY.NE - And I have only been enabled to do that because of the expansion of the revenue from Customs,26

151,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"If the money were not raised in that way, it would have to be raised in some other; and I ask the alhonorable member whether he would like it to be raised by means of direct taxation ? . Mr HENRY WILLIS - D i r e c t is always What I debetter than indirect taxation.",26
152,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I venture to say that if the Tariff had not been made as high as it is-and it is not half high enough yet; it is lower than any other protectionist Tariff in ' the world-w e should have been in difficulties in carrying out works that, the Post and Telegraph the Department say must be carried out.",26
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"So far as the Treasurer's experience has gone, has there been any difficulty in meeting the ordinary penditure monthly out of the month'soneon fourth of the revenue?",26
154,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I believe there has been some difficulty on one or two casions, but not since I have head of the Treasury. I believe that on one or two occasions arrangements had be made that were not, perhaps, of together legal character. But the position is that on the 31st of the month the Treagoes sury is depleted. Suppose a demand is coming in on the 2nd or 3rd of the next month. The Treasurer has no money to meet it. He has to wait until the money required comes in from the ordinary sources of revenue. I say that that is not a proper position in which to place the Commonas wealth Treasurer. I desire to say, in conested. clusion,, that I shall give further details by-and by. To meet demands over and : above the money voted by Parliament - to carry out works required-and properly required-by one or two Departments, I have had practically to exhaust the Trearemainder surer's advance, until I could get it couped by the passing of a Supply Bill .",27

At present, if the Treasurer were put in that position, he would have to resort to a system of financing that I think the Commonwealth ought not to be expected to be compelled to resort to.",27

166,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I think that the that Premier of New South Wales merely asked that he might have an opportunity to let the views of his Government be known before the passing of the Bill .,27

169,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"That does not arise in this connection; the matter can be out discussed when' we are considering the k ; transfer of the States debts and other financial arrangements. Of course, there is room for difference of opinion on the subject. It might, for instance, be proposed that all sums paid to the States in excess of three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue should go to reduce the amount to be' paid by the Commonwealth after an appraisement had been agreed upon . But in doing that we should be 1 curtailing our powers in regard to the carrying out of absolutely necessary works. I do not think'that we should do that, or that we' should wait any longer before making a definite arrangement.",27
170,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,We can carry out necessary public works.,28

It is the duty of this House, nof only to safeguard and defend the interests of the Commonwealth, but also to safeguard the rights of the States.",28
181,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The people of the Commonwealth arid the people of the States are one.,28
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Yes , and I think that we should be, if anything, even more careful in seeing that no injustice is done to the States than in trying to advance the .interests of the Commonwealth. The Bill is a technical measure, and, no doubt, expressions of opinion by honourable members learned in the law will carry not more weight than those of non-legal members. I make the pronouncement' that this Bill will not be allowed to have effect until the High Court has given a decision upon it . I look upon the Bill as unnecessary and mischievous. Seven and a half of the ten years during which the Braddon Minister's provision of the Constitution may not be altered have already elapsed, and as only two arid a half years remain, it is strange that, with an increasing revenue, the Treasurershould complain that he cannot do this or that for want of money. Why was it that £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 was returned to the States last year over and above three-fourths of Go the Customs and Excise revenue, if we were short of money to carry on the requirements of the Commonwealth? Why were not the works for which the money was voted carried out? Why are public works frequently not commenced' until nearly the end of the financial year, so that is a terrible the money voted by Parliament cannot be spent? The reason is that the Public Works Department makes insufficient preparation in' advance, and, I believe, often waits until money is voted before doing so. Consequently voles lapse, and money has present to be re-voted. I pass by the provisions of the Bill dealing with new revenue, which amounts to only £ 1 2 , 0 0 0 a year altogether, although half the provisions of the measure are concerned with its distribution.",28
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"There is not much objection to those clauses. Sir. JOHN FORREST - No ; but the Bill is not necessary for those purposes. Its real, object is the attempt My opposi- made in paragraph D of sub-clause 4 of clause 4 to interpret section 87 of the Constitution. We know that Parliament has no power to amend or interpret the Constitution. It might, of course, de.clare that a provision of the Constitution has a certain meaning, but that declaration would have no effect in determining the meaning, which can be authoritatively settled only by a decision of the High Court. An Order-in-Council, or a Minister's direction, is as effective as an Act of the Parliament for the interpretation of any provision of the Constitution. Therefore, I think we are being asked to exceed our powers. At a time when we are all desirous to promote friendship and a feeling of common interest between the States and the Commonweialth, there is brought in a Bill to take from the States money to which they, are entitled, ifi the Commonwealth does not spend the whole of its one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. The provision to which I have referred, as setting forth the main object of the Bill , practically enacts that appropriation of moneys by Parliament shall be deemed to be expenditure under section 87 of the Constitution. admitted that that is practically the whole aim of the Bill ; that everything else is merely "" leather and prunella."" The Bill is obviously intended to have effect only until the end of 1910.",28
184,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,It may be in force longer.,29
185,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,We have been informed that new proposals are to be subtoms mitted in a few weeks-perhap s in a few ' titled. days-for settling the financial arrangements of the States and the Commonwealth for all time.,29
186,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Not for so long as that.,29
187,Sir JOHN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"FORREST - The Prime Minister said ""finally."" Bill , if passed, will be in force until the end of 1919, when secon the point. tion 87, or the Braddon provision of the Constitution, as it has been called, can be amended. Let us examine that vision. It prohibits the Commonwealth from spending more than one-fourth of net revenue from. Customs and Excise. The wording of the section is very impormonwealth tant, since, it clearly shows what was intention of those who framed it. It does liament deems fair. not provide that the States are to receive only three-fourths of the Customs and cise revenue; it really implies that they shall receive more, because the words more than one-fourth "" are used. Then, again, it should be noted that the section does not provide that not more than that proportion shall be applied towards "" appropriations "" of the Commonwealth. Under this Bill , however, it is interpret the words "" it s expenditure"" which appear in section 87 as meaning "" appropriations by Parliament'' whether those appropriations be expended or not. What was the intention of the Convention in regard to what should be the - financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States for the first ten years of the Federation? I propose now to deal only with the ten years period, since at? the end of 1910 the system for which the Braddon section provides may be replaced by another. What was to be done with the revenue obtained from duties of Customs and Excise for the first ten years and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provided? In the first place it was declared that the bookkeeping system should be adopted for the first five years period and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provided-that the Commonwealth should credit revenue and debit The Treasurer expanditure and pay the balances to the several States as provided by section 93. After five years, if Parliament desires, under section 87, 'the Commonwealth was to pay to the States three-fourths of the Cus.'oms and Excise revenue on such basis as it deemed fair, and also under section 94 all surplus revenue, or, in other words, all moneys not applied towards its expenditure out of the one-fourth of Cusand Excise revenue to which it is en- Mr WH IRVINE - Sectio n 94 means a great deal more than that.

189,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Does the right honourable member mean that it can expend the whole of its one-fourth only in the year in which such revenue ds collected?,30
190,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"In the Constimore tution the word "" annually "" is used.",30
191,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The Constitution provides that the money may be applied annually. An appropriation is an annual appropriation.,30

Is it reasonable to assume that years' limitation was inserted. the words "" its expenditure "" appearing section' 87-that ! is to say, the annual penditure of the Commonwealth-mean "".annual appropriation,"" and not a penny of the appropriation spent.

That is the practice which has been followed for the last seven years, and stitution. if might fairly have been allowed fo run its course. The Treasurer has not shown Constitution. any reason for this proposed change. He has not shown any shortness of funds.",30
195,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,There will be large increase of expenditure.,30
196,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"At the end of the year the Treasurer will find that he has a vastly greater revenue than he anti- . cipatedj that his expenditure has not been than was estimated; and that he has in hand a very large sum which, in my opinion, under section 87 of the - Constitution, ought to be returned to the States. If this. Bill is within our powers, this money will be paid into a Trust Fund- a procedure for which I contend there is no authority. It may be ancient history, but I should like honourable' members to recall the circumstances under which section 87 was passed. It will be remembered that, as the Constitution left the Convention, it must was intended that that clause should be it perpetual, but, at. the Conference of Preof miers held in Melbourne in 1899, the ten Whilst in they made that alteration, however, the exPremiers allowed clause 94 to remain as s passed by the Convention.

200,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"No doubt.. The Chief Justice, however, stated that the a intention of its framers would always be considered by the Court - I repeat that, at the Conference of Premiers in 1899, section 87, which, as it left the Convention, was intended to exist in perpetuity, was limited to a period of ten years.",30
201,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I was a member of the Convention, and I do not think it was the intention that that provision should remain in perpetuity.",31
202,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The Attorney General will tell the Treasurer that it was so. In interpreting section 94, we should not omit to bear in mind its history, and what it was intended to mean as it left the Convention.",31
203,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,That is a very dangerous principle of construction.,31
204,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I am putting the actual facts before the House. Nothing will be settled in regard to the meaning of section 94 until the High Court has had to deal with it j and it is more difficult to construe now than it would have been had section 87 been placed in the Constitution as it left the Convention. As I said just now, I believe that the words ""surplus revenue,"" when interpreted by the High Court, may have an entirely different meaning from that which the Convention intended. In my opinion the words were intended by the Convention to apply to the unexpended balance of the one-fourth, ""which was the maximum the Commonwealth could spend. I wish to make it quite clear, as I have said once or twice before, that there is no doubt whatever as to the power of the Commonwealth to spend the whole of the one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. But I say most certainly that ""appropriation"" cannot be deemed' to be ""expenditure "" as proposed in this Bill . One would think it would not be necessary to labour the point, because the idea that under section 87 of the Constitution appropriation should be deemed to mean expenditure is one that ought to be flouted by every reasonable person.",31

212,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I think the Bill affects the practice.,31
213,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"We are not dealing now with what we should like to do, or what would be convenient, but with what is statutory and just to the States, even if , in doing justice, we injure ourselves. The Commonwealth may spend the whole of the one-fourth,' but, if it does not spend the whole, I contend that the unexpended balance must be paid monthly to the States. Supposing we concede for one moment that appropriation does mean expenditure, what would be easier than for the Federal Government or Parliament to place large sums on the Estimates which we knew could not be required, such, for instance, as the £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 for advertising Australia, when we know that we shall spend no more than £ 5 ^ 0 0 ? There is also a vote of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 for armaments, although we know we are not going to spend any such sum. What is really proposed by this Bill is to appropriate the whole of the balance, and thus deprive the States of it , although we may not spend sixpence of it . Is that fair?",31
214,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,An appropriation lapses if it is not used.,31
215,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"T h at is so, and very properly so; but there is no lapse in the case of a trust fund. Where is our power to make trust funds, and thus take the money away from the States? A trust fund' is a means of holding money until the owner claims it , and I submit that we cannot appropriate £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 for armaments, and, placing the money in a trust fund, thus deprive the States of it . I sav that such a proposal is neither reasonable nor proper. annually Mr. JOSEPH COOK - But I think the right honourable member did something like that in regard to the naval payments.",31

Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - There is a special trust fun d created in that connection. mean all that Sir JOHN FORREST - T h at is paid every month, but we have an appropriation for it , and it must be paid during the year in which it was voted.",31
217,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The whole of it is not paid during the year.,31
218,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Then it ought to be, because it is an expenditure of the year. ' According to the proposal and intention of the Treasurer, this money wil l not be returned to the States, but will be appropriated, to be reapprdpriated, perhaps, later on to quite another object, because money put into a trust fund can, by Act of Parliament, be taken out of that fund, and expendedas we like. This is a subterfuge to keep this money from the States, and, by putting it into a reserve fund called a trust fund, deprive them ,of their just due. That was not the intention or meaning of the framers of the Constitution, and it has not been done by any Treasurer, under the advice of any Attorney-General, during the seven years of There are, I believe, twenty-four trust funds already, for the most part legitimate, though there may be one or two not quite so. On the""3ist December last, according to the public accounts, there was £ 3 4 4 to the credit of those trust funds. I believe that was an excessive, amount, owing to special circumstances at the particular time; and it has not been so large since, though it has been over' £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Trust funds are, no doubt, very convenient, and, .speaking generally, when they are bond fide, are unobjectionable. But the proposal in the Bill is not bond fide; it does not propose a trust fund for a specific purpose, as in the other cases mentioned. The Bill has for its object the placing of large sums in reserve, to be used hereafter, either for the purpose declared, or, probably, reappropriated later on for some other purposes, the States in the meantime being deprived of their moneys, Treasurer clearly stated that the object of the Bill was to retain these moneys, and place them in reserve funds to be used as necessary later on.",32
219,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,There will be moneys beyond the one-fourth.,32
220,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"If we used the whole of the one-fourth for Commonwealth purposes, I should have nothing to say; what I object to is taking the money and putting it on one side, and not using it. During the last seven years the Commonwealth Government have tried their best to limit their expenditure. As I have said, time and again, there has been no extravagance on the part of the Federal Government. There may be some matters in which, had we the time over again, we might act differently; but, generally speaking, the Commonwealth Government and Parliament have been economical, and tried i.o return as much as possible to the States. My predecessor, Sir George Turner, went to great lengths in the latter direction, because those were rather hard days in the States, ancl his efforts were beneficial to some of them, especially Tasmania and Queensland, who suffered a great loss of revenue owing to Federation.",32
221,Mr BAMFORD,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Queenslan d occasionally, did not get her three-fourths.'",32
222,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"T h at is so, while some other States were getting very much more than their three-fourths. However, the Federal Government, did their best all along, Federation. and it has been the policy throughout to economize, bearing jn view the great obligations that lie on the States Governments. We must not forget that the States Governments have in their hands the settling , 0 0 0 of the people on the land, and the opening up and development of the country by means of railways, roads, and bridges, in addition to the responsibility of the public education. With a knowledge ot all these facts, I , when Treasurer, desired to give rather than take away from the States. Now, however, we have a proposal to take money awa!y from the States, not, in my opinion, legitimately, or in a . bona fide way, but, by what I may call a side wind-by altering the procedure which, up to the present, has been acknowledged to be right. If such a step be taken, - without any necessity, it will embitter the feeling between Commonmonwealth and States. It is true that, The without counting the first half-year of Federation, which was very unsettled, there has been returned to the States, during the six years, over £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 more than the three-fourths of the revenue to which they were entitled. There is no doubt that no the Commonwealth could have spent that money had it been in the interests of Australia to do so. But iin such case the States would have suffered, Tasmania and Queensland very largely. It is now proposed that we should retain this money for the future, and put it out of reach in a reserve fund,' calTebl a trust fund, so that later on, when it has accumulated, we may appropriate it,, possibly for some other purpose altogether. That was not the feeling that honourable members had towards the States in the early days of Federation, nor is it , in my opinion, the intention of section 87 of the Constitution. However, there is another matter of law to which I should like to direct the attention of the Attorney-General. Besides the objections I have already raised, I have to say further that the Bill is opposed to section 36 of the Audit Act. What does that section say?Every appropriation made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the service of any financial year shall lapse and cease to have any effect for any purpose at the close of that year.",32
223,Mr GROOM,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"But there are trust funds. Sir JOHN FORREST. - This is not a bond fide trust fund at all. The section goes onand any balance of the moneys so appropriated which may then be unexpended shall lapse, and the accounts of the year shall be then closed.",33
224,Mr GROOM,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Did the trust funds lapse when the honourable member was Treasurer ?,33
225,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I do not think they did. But they were bond fide trust funds. This, however, is an attempt to make a trust fund of that which is not a trust fund at all. This Bill says that, notwithstanding what the Audit Act provides, sums, having been appropriated, shall be regarded as expended. There is to be a reserve fund; that is what it means. The term ""Trust Fund"" is a subterfuge. not a trust fund in the true sense at all. A trust fund is a fund established in relation - to moneys that do not belong to the Government, and which have to be paid when the owner comes along; or it is a fund established for departmental convenience. Why, in these late days, should this attempt be made to fake money away from the States and keep it in reserve for some other purposes? This is not a matter of - likes or dislikes. It is a matter of the interpretation of the Constitution, by which we are bound. . The question at issue will not be settled until we have an authoritative judgment upon it by the High 'Court. I await with some curiosity the course my honourable friend the leader of the Labour Party will take in regard to this matter. I am anxious to know whether he will do justice to the States. I am of opinion that the facts must appeal to him that this is an attempt-a m unjustifiable one - totry to get money that is legally due to the . States put aside to be used hereafter for various .purposes. I am certainly surprised that my honourable friends, the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, should have subscribed to this Bill. [349] well understand the Treasurer wanting money to be put aside to be used by him. I do not suppose that he has looked very closely into the technicalities of the mea'sure. But that remark cannot apply to the. Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. I cannot understand how they can have allowed such a Bill to be introduced. Every measure introduced by the Government must have the imprimatur of the Attorney-General. How the Attorney General can tell us that what it is proposed to do under this measure is in accord with section' 87 of the Constitution, I cannot understand. The Bill will do a great deal of harm. It certainly can do no good - It must irritate the States. The . question concerned is not likely to be settled until we obtain a decision from the High Court; and we have figured in that Court already. I do not see why we should encourage these difficulties which necessitate our appearance in the High Court in opposition to the States, especially during these last years of the operation of the Braddon section. I desire to say, in conclusion, that the opinions which I have . expiessed are those which' I honestly hold, and which have actuated me ever since I have been a member of this House, and while I was the It is Treasurer of the Commonwealth. . My desire is to do justice to the ""States as well as to uphold the interests of the Commonwealth. This is an - unnecessary Bill. It is a mischievous Bill. It is a Bill which, in mv opinion, exceeds our powers under the Constitution.

I do not intend to say very much more at this stage on that point, except this-that I think my right honourable ' friend the member for Swan's condemnation of the Bill , and his indignation af such a measure being brought forward; were to some extent based upon a misapprehension of the section of the .Constitution to which he referred.",34

232,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I certainly should be very sorry to impose on honorabls members a long constitutional argument; and the only excuse I can make for going, into the matter at all is that, as the right honourable member for Swan feels grave doubts about the. question, I ought, as a matter of ordinary courtesy to him,' to do so. I think that even if we do not entertain strong doubts we ought to express our opinions. view which I put on a former occasion is this: The matter all depends upon the proper interpretation to put upon two or three.sections of the Constitution. regard to the view that has been put, that advice has been given, and that a practice has been adopted by the Department, that argument would be very strong except for this fact: that during the five years, until October, 1906, no other practice could be followed except the distribution which the section expressly provided for. lowing seems to me to be the der which the financial sections of the - Constitution were-drafted.",34

"" October, 1906. What I submit is that .the whole frame of the Constitution, its basis, so far as finance is concerned, first of all section 81. That section us that general power of appropriation whichevery self-governing community through its Parliament. If it is to be a Parliament at all-anythin g more than a municipal institution-it must have a general power of appropriating its revenue. That section saysA l l revenues or moneys raised or received by the Executive Government of the Commonweal th shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution. To leave out of consideration the ' ' charges and liabilities "" for the moment, let us see what would be involved in the meaning of - the term ""appropriation."" ""Appropriation "" does not mean merely appropriation for the ordinary current services for the month, or for the year. It covers the putting of money to any purposes-for , as I understand it , this year or next year or any other future time-so long as those way purposes are legitimately purposes of the Commonwealth, and are authorized by an Act of Parliament. I might take a very simple instance. Suppose this Parliament borrowed money, and desired to create a sinking fun d for its repayment. That is the simplest example of all. You may have two kinds of sinking funds. You may have a sinking fund whereby Parliament annually pays towards the repayment of the debt certain moneys, by means of which it provides for principal and interest. But there is another and a more The usual kind of sinking fund, such as is established in nearly all the States of the Union. You borrow money, say, in England, and you agree with the lender that With you shall pay him annual interest, and, when the time for redemption comes, the principal. In the meantime Parliament may say, "" We shall create a sinking fund, putting aside annually enough to enable us to pay the debt when it becomes due."" That would be making a trust fund .

My right honourable friend has asked, "" Where is the authority to I say 'that there this: is authority to make a trust or other fulnd, or any pocket or reserve we may is wish to make, so long as the ultimate purgives poses of the expenditure are Commonwealth purposes.

236,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I think that it is plain. It says thatDuring the period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, and theregiven. after until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Excise, not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. What is the difference between that and the expression in section 81 ? To be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth, is to . be applied to the purposes of the Commonwealth, or to be applied towards the expenditure of the Commonwealth. All the money which we appropriate is expended, if not this year, next year or some other year. expenditure of some year. . We may appropriate this year for one hundred purposes in connection with which the actual expenditure will not take place this year.",35

238,Mr TILLEY BROWN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"But there is absolute limitation. If f t applies to twelve months, it must mean three-fourths within those twelve months.",35
239,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The limitation is not a limitation of the actual expenditure, but of the amount which may be taken for the purposes of the expenditure. A stream of revenue is flowing past, and section 87 of the Constitution says that the Commonwealth shall not take more than one-fourth of it . Suppose we returned to the States only three-fourths, could their Treasurers say to us, "" You have returned to us three-fourths, and have purported to apply the rest. We wish to go into your'books and estimates, 'to ascertain whether you have actually expended' during this month the moneys which you have not returned to us"" ? That was. not intended by the Constitution. Such a provision would have [349]- 2 rendered the government of the Commonwealth almost unworkable.",35

255,Mr GROOM,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I think he said that we -.should consider the financial position before granting the bounties. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - Yes . I suggested that it would be a prudent thing to do, and what a business man would do.",36

"" Mr WH IRVINE - I referred .to the matter to show that, if we adopt the view which the right honourable member for Swan contends for, we shall be prevented from carrying out a large number of functions which every Government should be able to perform. I gave, as an instance, the making of a sinking fund for the payment of debts. Another instance is the providing for bounties the payment of which is spread over a large number of years. Then there is the making' of provision for payment of contracts which, perhaps, cannot be carried out in'less than five or years.",36

To read that as showing that "" what is meant is annual expenditure to cuts down the power of appropriaraised tion given by preceding sections an exceedingly small .point. The Constitution provides a further limitation. Not only is there a limit upon rhe amount which the Commonwealth Parliament apply, but a method is prescribed for distributing, during the five years immediately succeeding the imposition of uniform duties of Customs and Excise, the balance to be returned to the States. They must be given at least three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue which is annually collected, and mav be given more; and section 89, read with section 93, recognises that the Commonwealth must give the States so much, and that it may give them more, and that the amount which must be paid to the States must be distributed for a cerit con- tain period in a particular way.",36
261,Mr GROOM,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,And the balance must be paid over.,36
262,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Yes . After five years have elapsed, Parliament is to make such provision as it may think fair for the payment of all surplus revenues, using the most general term possible.",36
263,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Does surplus revenue mean balance? Are the terms convertible? Mr W . H . IRVINE - No .,36
264,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"""Surplu s revenue"" is used only once.",36

273,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The returns from the post-office are revenue; but could it be said that, if the revenue from, stamps and telegrams throughout Australia is not actually spent in paying the Commonwealth servants, it must be returned to the States ?",37

275,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The not been quite as exact as that.,37
276,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Then , according to the argument of my right honourable friend, the Constitution has been broken. If the - Constitution were read as he reads it, the system of government would be absolutely unworkable.",37
277,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"We still come to what is meant by "" surplus revenue."" Mr W. ' H . IRVINE - The question depends on what is the' meaning of ' ' surplus."" . My contention is that, reading these provisions together, "" surplus "" means money that has not been appropriated by Parliament; It is a very simple meaning; there is nothing to cut it down. It gives full effect to our right as a Parliament to appropriate our money as we think fit for Federal purposes; it also gives full effect to the provisions of section 87 for the protection of the States.",37
278,Mr TILLEY BROWN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,But what the question of policy ?,37
279,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"That is another matter. If I believed, as does the right honourable member for Swan, that in passing this Bill we should transgress our constitutional powers, or that we should be attempting, by means of an Act of Parliament, to place upon the Constitution an interpretation that we have power to . do something that we could not possibly do, I should feel as. indignant as he apparently does. But I do not regard this proposal in that light. Subject to one important consideration, to which I shall refer in a moment, I think that this is a very reasonable business-like proposition to make, and that it does not impinge upon the rights of the States.",37
280,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"It is curious, if this power is so clearly conferred by the stitution, that it has not occurred before to seek to use it.",37
281,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I am afraid that sometimes it does not occur to us to do that which we ought to do. Having regard to the view I have expressed, I should not i ordinary circumstances have the slightest the best of bur own lights. difficulty in giving my entire support to Bill , but I must say that I feel that very unfortunate that it should have been brought forward at the present juncture. When I suggested, whilst the Bounties Bill was under consideration, that the course for which this measure provides should beadopted, we were contemplating that largeiron works which were then in progresswould soon be absorbing the large bountiesproposed, under that Bill , to be paid. Wepractice has know now that that exigency has passedaway for the time being. Therefore, that particular cause of urgency no longer exists. I think I find myself in absolute agreement with the right honourable member for Swan in believing that even in the exercise of our undoubted rights we ought to be as careful as we can not.to wound the susceptibilities of the States; although it may be that sometimes demands couched in language that is altogether too strong are made upon us by some members of the States Legislatures. I read recently that the Premier of New South Wales had requested-and perhaps the same request also emanated from other quarters-that the Premiers of the States should have an opportunity at the forthcoming Conference to place their views before us with regard to this Bill , so that the Parliament might, with a full knowledge of what were the views of the States authorities, exercise its powers in this reabout gard: Why should we not afford them that opportunity ?",37
282,Mr MCDONALD,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Is it wise that w.eshouldsubmit questions of great national policy to the determination of the Premiers Of the States?,37
283,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,No ; but there is a difference between doing that and adopting the course which has been suggested byone if not more of the Premiers of the States. I said' as strongly as I could at an early stage this session that I thought that Conferences of States' Premiers had repeatedly gone rather too far ; but that is not exactly the present situation. My contention is that ultimately the constitutional power and the constitutional duty of settling these financial questions rests upon this Parliament.,37
284,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Surely, in common Concourtesy, we should consult the States to any one Treasurers? .",37

Coming to the Bill itself, I should have as expected to hear the honourable member for express the opinion that he has If I remember rightly, this I therefore B i i l embodies a criticism which he made upon some time ago. I should not go so far to as to say that the Ministry have pirated or by plagiarized his proposal, and have incorporated it in this measure, but the fact rel , mains that this Bill follows closely upon only the suggestion which he made.. And what emdoes the Treasurer say about it? We have to had from him a general statement that in lo some way or other the bookkeeping provisions of the Constitution had hampered Not much evidence has been furnished as to the way in which those conprovisions do hamper him ; we to take his bare statement that they the have done so. When questioned as to whether lie is contemplating any extraordinary expenditure-and I hold,"" would be the only justification for this departure at the represent time-the Treasurer says that he not a does not contemplate any expenditure outH e says that Gohe has no large, ambitious schemes in contemplation, and if , as he also said, he has no difficulty in financing month by month the any of the claims for expenditure which - The are made upon him, why does he want to untake this additional power at the present I put those two questions to the I asked him in the first place whether he had in contemplation any large kind scheme of extraordinary expenditure, and to he said that he had not; that he simply anan expansion of the ordinary exhelp penses as provided for in the Estimates year In the next place I asked him has very plainly if he could tell us whether during any month of the year he had any difficulty infinancingthe needs of the Commonwealth out of our one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue, and he again replied in the negative. Why, then, is this proposal, so drastic and far-reaching as it affects the relations of the Commonwealth with the States, brought forward at the present time? After hearing the arguments fro and con as to the constitutionality - of the Bill, and having read the Constitution, so far as my abilities will permit me, I have no doubt as to the constitutionality - of the procedure proposed . by the Government. There is no doubt that we can vary the arrangements with regard to the disposal of, our surplus revenue; that we can if we choose create these proposed trust accounts",38
289,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The honourable member might take the example of all special appropriations which do not lapse under the Audit Act.,39
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"We have power to create these special trust accounts, and, as I think, to make provision for any extraordinarily large additional expenditures which may from time to time come under the purview of this Parliament. I do not attack the constitutionality of this Bill ; I attack its wisdom, its inopportuneness. Like many of the other financial proposals - of the Government, it is tentative, paltry and entirely inadequate to meet the financial situation. As such it comes fitly from a Government that has been proceeding on those lines through the whole course of its - existence, and is today only fulfilling the promise of its career made from the beginfiing of its existence. I , therefore, confine myself to the consideration of the question whether it is wise, after the lapse of nearly - eight years of the ten that have to run ""before a re-arrangement of the whole financial position must take place, to deal with the matter in this piecemeal way.",39

296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The honourable member would not expect me to agree with every detail of the scheme? I do say, however, that, in my opinion, it is the best scheme proposed by a Treasurer up to date, and I believe that, shorn of one or two of its provisions which, I think, err a little on the side of generosity to the States - thoug h that is a good side to err on-the scheme, on the whole, is a statesmanlike proposal for the settlement of this muchvexed question. But now we find the new Treasurer coming in and upsetting that scheme in this piecemeal way. Such legislation, I think, is unwise; and, as I shall propose in my amendment, I think we ought to wait until the whole relations of - the States and the Commonwealth can be taken into account. I propose to move, if the prior amendment is withdrawn to enable me to do so, that all the words after "" That "" be omitted, in order to insert "" the consideration of this Bill be postponed until the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States can be dealt with as a whole."" It is not a question of what we have a right to do under the Constitution. It has-been the curse of this Parliament in the past that we have been fighting for some supposed rights we have under the Constitution-right s which we could turn against the States to their detriment and to our advantage. That is entirely a wrong attitude to assume. We ought not to consider whether we have this or that right, but we ought to work well' within the rights which are plain on the and conflict. face of the Constitution, so that he who runs may read, and, by degrees, acquire the further confidence of the people, in hope and belief that they will, in time, trust us with such further amendment of the Constitution as the unfolding of our opinion. functions and powers may require at their hands.  gave that advice to the States, it would be very beneficial !",39

Until that can be done, it is far better to leave this tinkering little proposal and discuss the subject in its larger of aspects. I urge the Treasurer, even now, to persevere with this Bill . I say very Treasurer frankly to him that I wish to take no course that would embarrass the Government, having regard to the position of afo fairs on the Tariff and other matters, but cannot, and will not, vote for this Bill . I ask the Treasurer now, in the interests there of a fair, amicable, and reasonable attiof tude being assumed, both by the States themselves and by the Treasurer when he meets the Premiers next month in Confernot to persevere with this Bill , which is bound to anger the whole of the States.",41
331,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Hav e they not been angry all the time? They have made statements against the Commonwealth which they have no right to make.,42
332,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Is it not a fact that at the last Conference .they agreed to proposals submitted by the honourable gentleman's own Government? That does not look like angry antagonism..,42
333,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"They did what? They never did agree. Mr {JOSEPH COOK - Substantially , they did.",42
334,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I beg pardon, they did not.",42
335,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,They agreed substantially to the Government's proposals.,42
336,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,They did not.,42
337,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,They did.,42

339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"As far as the financial scheme of the Government was concerned, they did.",42
340,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,They agreed to wanted. everything that we went down upon.,42
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The Treasurer voted, has raised another matter to which I should States? like to address myself for a moment - This Bill does nottouch the larger financial problems at all. For instance, the Treaa surer says that the bookkeeping provisions of the Constitution are hampering He means only a small part of the bookkeeping provisions and their ramifications. This Bill will leave the bookkeeping provisions intact so far as accounting for the revenues of the States is concerned.",42
342,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I said very little about the bookkeeping sections.,42
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The Treasurer said that the bookkeeping sections of Constitution have been found to hamper considerably the nnances of the Commonunduly wealth.,42
344,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,That is quite true.,42
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"He could not penditure have said very much more about them that. But he did not say what he should have said-that the hampering was only caused with regard to the check which felt was imposed upon him so far as relates to the disposal of surplus funds. The bookkeeping provisions of the Constitucause tion, if this Bill goes through, will continue as before, with all their routine, one' the next. and with all the troubles and anxieties to our merchants which exist af would not. the present time. One of the urgent problems facing this Parliament is, how to do away with those bookkeeping provisions as far as the mere accountancy side of them is concerned, and so far as they affect the trading relations of the Com- monwealth. It is that which is giving trouble. When every merchant has to dissect a suit of clothes to find out what he has to pay on the cloth, on the buttons, on the linings, and on everything else before he can do his business, he is naturally irritated. It is that system which we want to abolish. It is that side of the bookkeeping sections which we want to do away with as quickly as we can do it on a fair basis. The Treasurer is only dealing with an atom of the bookkeeping sections. The hampering will still remain, though the Treasurer will only be benefited to the extent that moneys at present, paid away to the States need not be immediately spent.",42
346,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,And our not having to re-vote and re-raise the money,42
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"And if it is rewho is deprived of revenue but the Have they ever complained of the Treasurer causing such sums of money to be re-voted? Suppose he cannot pay £50,000 bill at the end of the month, and the money has to be re-voted next him. month. Do the States complain?",42
348,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The States do not, but the Commonwealth should.",42
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"If the Treasurer is not hampered in these respects, what does he want this Bill at all for, unless to save money to meet some extraordinary expenditure? I should say it would be for the States to suggest some the such trouble as the Treasurer has suggested, so as not to deplete their revenue one month and inflate it the next. The Treasurers of the States are just as keenly interested in having a steady exrather than a spasmodic and inthan termittent one, as the Commonwealth Treasurer himself can be. It is as much to their interest to know what their monthly he commitments are, and what their monthly payments are to be, as it is, to the Treasurer's. But they make no complaint, be there happens to be a specially large demand one month and an especially easy",42
350,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I should think they,42
351,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"If they make no such complaint, why should the Treasurer? . The money is there and if the Treasurer cannot pay it one month he can pay it the next. Where is the trouble? I tell the honourable gentleman candidly, that I expected him to say today, in justification of this Bill , that he had in contemplation some extraordinarily large expenditure over and above what he has found i l possible hitherto to account for in the ordinarymonthly fashion. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - When the honourable member sees the Additional Estimates he will know that I have. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Then this Bil l should wait until we have the Additional Estimates before us. If that be the reason for it those Additional Estimates ought to have been on the table long ago. But when the year is entirely closed it that the Treasurer is going to bring forward Additional Estimates for the year.",43
352,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The honourable member will have them soon enough. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I hope that if they are reasonable, we shall pass them.",43
353,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I say that it is imputs it , because he has to be"" drawn. possible to make them reasonable on the previous basis.",43
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I say again.and this is all that I want to say-that that is the only reason for bringing in Bill, then those Additional ought to have accompanied the Bill , so that we might see the real reason which the Treasurer has for bringing it forward. Otherwise, he has shown no reason f this violent interference-and it is a violent cerned? interference-wit h the relationships which have existed for eight years, and which must terminate in two more at the outside. I say, therefore, that the Treasurer is goby ing about this business in the wrong The real question for us to consider is whether we have a right to do this under He cannot do it . the Constitution. That is a very able question. It is no doubt teresting question for lawyers to talkwithout about. But the practical question is, as to whether it is wise for us to do this kind of thing at this time.",43
355,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I never brought forward a"" proposal which the honourable member has not asked me to postpone.",43
356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"If the Treasurer had postponed some proposals which he was asked to postpone, the Commonwealth would have been in much better Odour today than it is.",43
357,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I have given up trying to get it into better odour with some people. If we do our duty we need not be afraid of any one. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Since that is the declaration of the Commonwealth Treasurer, on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, all that I have to say is that it only emphasizes more strongly the obligation resting upon us to try to induce this Parliament to extend the fullest possible consideration to the States, and to meet them",43

363,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The honourable gentleman is drawn "" this w a y ,"" as he I am not speaking in a personal sense, but because of the terms that exist in relation to the States and the Commonwealth. The if Treasurer is tied to the States for ten this years, and cannot get away from them for Estimates that term - Since he is tied to them in these vital relationships, and in regard to the financial question, why begin to flout them with regard to comparatively small matters so far as we are concerned, but very imo r portant matters so far as they are conI say that if we pass this Bill we are still tied to the States. The bookkeeping sections will not be abrogated. We shall still be tied to the States the Braddon section. Therefore, way. the Treasurer need not try to shake not himself free in this airy and easy way. The relationship is arguthere. What he is trying to do is to esa very incape from one part of this relationship doingi either the States or the for us Commonwealth very much good.",43
364,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,On e or two of the States are inclined to make themselves angry without any cause.,43

366,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"No , not of some of them ; especially the Premier of South Australia.",43
367,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"It seems to me, with regard to this matter, that the same thing is happening as with regard to some of the other Departments. . We have first one Treasurer, and then another, proposing different schemes, and different methods of administration. that there is nothing but chaos. new schemes following new schemes until the people outside are bewildered, and small wonder if the Premiers of the States are bewildered, too. The same thing has happened with regard to ""the Post and Telegraph Department and the Defence Department. No one Minister is there for long, and there is constant cause for criticism.",44

The financial question, while it remains unsettled, will have little regard for the peace of the Commonwealth. The solution is financial independence.",44

The difficulties confronting the Treasurer in regard to the distribution of surplus money are but small, and should stimulate him, not to the introduction of measures like this, but to the consideration - and settlement, if possible, of the larger financial questions whose solution is necessary for future peace. There are many aspects of the financial question, and the most important and pressing seems to me the completion of the purchase of the properties transferred by the States to the Commonwealth.",45

395,Mr MAUGER,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The work is nearly completed.,45
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The next matter - in order of importance is the bookkeeping arrangement, not merely as it affects the distribution of surpluses, but also as it affects the manner of accounting for moneys received in and for a State, and for the disbursement of money on behalf ' of the people of the Commonwealth. Then ' there is the troublesome question of how best to bring about a - per capita basis, - which, perhaps, must be agreed upon before ' financial peace can be secured. The settlel l . ment of these questions is preliminary to the transfer of the debts of the States to the Commonwealth, and the making of provision for the expiration of the Braddon section. The right honourable member for Swan did as much as was possible Only to settle them at the Conference held in Brisbane with the Premiers of the States. No question in the arena of Federal politics can be compared in importance with the financial question. Before any good is done, the Commonwealth and the States each will have to be independent of the other. There will have to be State control of State finances, and Federal control of purely Federal finances. I was reading today an essay in the Edinburgh Review of Januarylast, in which the writer, in discussing the future of the British Empire, makes this statement, which seems to me to apply with equal force to our' relations with the StatesI f we adhere steadily to the principle that local revenues are to be expended locally, and if , at the same time, we give all reasonable encouragement to local self-government and shun any tendency towards over-centralization, we shall steer clear of one of the rocks on which the Roman ship of state was wrecked. Unskilful or unwise finance is our greatest danger. That is equally true of our relations with the States; unwise or unskilful finance is also our greatest danger. No other danger looming up is comparablewith it . My judgment is that the tentative proposal in this measure is unskilful in its treatment of a large question, and is infinitely unwise, having regard to the imminence of the settlement of the larger question which must be faced within the next two years. It would be very much better to postpone the consideration of this matter until we can deal with the whole broad question of finance. When we come to the consideration of the larger question, I hope that the Treasurer will meet the Premiers at the coming Conference, and am sure that with a reasonable attitude on his part, there will be no difficultv in the way. I , for one, have seen year after year a growing disposition on the part of the States towards its favourable treatment.",45

As will be readily understood, the lapse of time makes the statistics more difficult to obtain; and, in my opinion, the years involved are important. .Coghlan's Seven Colonies covers a very considerable period, and brings the statistics of Australia and New Zealand up to a certain time; and the understanding was that Mr Coghlan should fill up the gap. 'When he left for England, he took material with him, so I understand, which would enable him to bring his volume up to date; but I have seen a newspaper paragraph to the effect that Mr. Coghlan does not propose to carry out the work.

I am not surprised at this enormous sum, having noted the absurdly expensive methods of the office, and the numerous progressive statistics issued. Honourable members receive a monthly progressive report of trade returns, printed on superfine paper, in the most expensive style, a sheer waste of monely. At the very most, these reports are not required more than once every three months; and even that, 1 should say, is unnecessary. We do not need to have printed every month returns of the shipping, and minor details about imports and exports. Such information might be all very well during a Tariff discussion; and even then we did not get the exact figures from the statistical office. In my opinion, the Minister ought to put his foot down, and see that this extravagant expenditure is stopped. The printing bill is already very considerable, and this "" other printing "" is unwarrantable.

It would be interesting to know how much of this £300 has been expended in postage and how much in unnecessary telegrams. Then there is another large item of £1,650 for temporary assistance, and I desire to say that, in my opinion, except in circumstances of extreme urgency, a check should be placed on the engagement of such assistance. Although employment temporarily does not give those employed a prior right to permanent appointments, the general impression is in the minds of those so employed that there is some preferential claim. If a staff is insufficient to do the work required it ought 'to be ascertained what extra assistance is required, and permanent appointments ought to be made to meet the demand. I agree with the honourable member for Coolgardie that the issue of monthly reports is not necessary. I presume that later on these monthly reports will be issued annually in volume form, and will require to be reprinted for that purpose.

These cleaners are women, and their method of appointment is most unsatisfactory, seeing that there is a separate list kept for every Department. This is the first opportunity I have had to bring this matter forward, and, as we recognise under the Federal Government that women doing the same work as men shall receive similar pay, I suggest that these women cleaners should be 'taken on in the same way as men, namely, by registration. If that were done charges of favouritism; which I thinkhave some tinge of support, could not be made. In one case, I regret to sav, there was made a charge of this kind which I shall later on bringunder the notice of honourable members.",48
438,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Parramatta) [8.24] - Revertin g to the question of statistics, I may say that I have no wish whatever to see the monthly bulletins discontinued. ' They serve a very useful function, both here and in the States.",48
439,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"What ' function do they serve ? - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - They place before us as quickly 'as possible tabulated formation relative to the facts with which they are concerned. Instead of having to wait a year for the information, we get it monthly.",48
440,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Who suggested waiting a year? I said three months, and so did the honourable member for Lang.",49
441,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I do not see what would be gained by waiting even three months. The sooner the figures are made available the better.,49

446,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,That shows how little honourable member knows about it.,49
447,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I suppose that the honourable member for Coolgardie knows it all. At any rate the tabulation of these figures is of material assistance in the paration of the annual volume. I challenge the honourable member to prove to the conhope trary.,49

Indeed I rose rather to make a gestion as to the expansion of the Departworth ment rather than for its contraction. have for a long time had the firm conported viction that this Census Department be made of material assistance to the manufacturers and producers of Australia.

I think that [35°] these statistics were made readily available in- to our manufacturers and producers, they would be of very material assistance to them as indicating the particular industries to which they should devote their capital and energies. I see no difficulty in making; such forecasts upon a reasonably approxima.e basis. .1 hope to see the Census. Department grow in that direction particularly. I see no reason why questions relating to estimating the probable avenues of employment should not become addenda to the work of this already useful Department. I ' believe that if its energies could expand, it would be of great assistance both to the unemployed in Australia and to manufacturers and producers. I know that it cannot be expanded in that direction yet, because its present limited sphere has not been fully exploited, and cannot be for some little time to come. I also express the hope that by when the yearly volumes make their apthey will come to us in as handy a form for reference as we have been the accustomed to in the books issued by Mr. Coghlan. I do not think that, in relation to the size of the volumes and their handiness for reference purposes, Mr Coghlan's work could have been improved upon. But, preas far as I have'; seen, I have nothing but praise for the Census Department, and I that its work may expand rather than be contracted.",49

Again, it cannot be of much use to anybody to know that we exported £ i worth of currants in March, 1907, and that we exported £ 8 worth of oversea origin. What practical advantage can be served by the monthly publication of these particulars? I ask honourable members to look through one of these volumes for themselves, and to say whether the statistics are worth printing on this superior paper. ally, I do not think they are. receive a bill for nearly £4,000 for printing for this new office, we ought to begin to inquire whether it is all justified. I regret that the honourable member for Lang has decided to withdraw his amendment.",49
454,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Only on the understanding that the Minister would make inquiries with a view to having the amount of printing curtailed.,50
455,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"That is not a promise of much value. It is merely a general - undertaking.. I do not mean to cast any aspersion on the Minister,- but certainly a general undertaking is not so valuable as a specific undertaking. What I desire is the discontinuance of these monthly volumes. In my opinion, it would be quite sufficient for all practical purposes to have the reports issued af the end of every three months. That does not mean that the figures would not. be compiled in the Department at the end of every month. Any honourable member can satisfy himself that these volumes are not read by members of Parliament generally. They lie about untouched. think we ought to take advantage of the opportunity offered to make a very considerable saving in this very heavv item. With a view of impressing upon the Government the desirableness of discontinuing these monthly publications, and issuing the statistics not oftener than every three months, I moveTh.it the item ""Other printing, reduced by £1.",50
456,Mr MALONEY,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Melbourne) [8.35] - I hope that the honourable member for Coolgardie will not press his amendment to' a division. I regret very much to hear his remarks. I have always been fond of the study of statistics. often that I find myself in accord with every word that the honourable member for Parramatta says, but I must pay him the. compliment of saying that I agree with every remark that he made in reference to the statistics published by the Census Office. We cannot have bur statistics published too promptly. I take it that these monthly issues are simply like bankers' monthlv balances. A man who is interested even in bones, hoofs, and horns may want to see the amount of imports and exports in any particular month. The honourable member for Coolgardie savs that a business man can go to the Customs House and ascertain what he wants to know. I do not Person- know whether the honourable member has. When we ever tried to getinformation of this kind from the Customs House. I once spent three months in hunting up information on a subject; and I say, "" God help the man who goes to the Customs House to get statistics."" These monthly records are not meant to be read from cover to cover, but a member of Parliament, or a member of the public who wants statistical information on any subject for any month, turns to one of these books, and hunts it up. I doubt whether the monthly issues are the cause of much expense. Whether they are or not. can be ascertained by putting a question to the Minister. I shall certainly vote against the amendment. I maintain that we do not spend enough in collecting statistics. The nation that stands foremost in the affairs of the world today is America, and there is - no nation that spends more on the collection and publication of statistical information. Further, the printing of these books gives employment to men who support the party to which the honourable member for Coolgardie and I belong. I do not oppose his amendI ment for that reason, however, but simply because I honestly think that we do not spend enough money on collecting statistics. I doubt whether much money would be : saved if we discontinued the publication of the monthly statistical volumes. In any case, the figures would have to be made up monthly. ""They would always have to be ready to hand, month by month, for the ^3,950,"" be preparation of the quarterly or yearly volumes.",50
457,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Lang) [8.38] - I do not wish it to be understood that I desire in any way to belittle the work performed by the Census Office. I suppose that I can appreciate as - keenly as any honourable It is not member can, the advantages of the information contained in these statistical papers. On more than one occasion honourable members have found the information contained in them to be of considerable service. But it must be remembered that Parliament is not sitting all the. year round. If the statements were issued quarterly, I think they would serve all practical purposes. I have no objection to their being issued monthly, except that the cost is altogether disproportionate to the service rendered. "" And if they do not require to be reset in the annual volumes the ultimate cost will not be so great. It was for ihat reason that I called attention to what I thought was an opportunity' for curtailing expenditure on account - of the printing of the Census Office.",50
458,Mr HUME COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The item is so large partly because the Commonwealth is now undertaking work which Mr Coghlan used to do for New South Wales.,51
459,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Not in the same form.,51
460,Mr HUME COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Not exactly; but the work will be quite as good.,51
461,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The monthly statements are liable to alteration in the light of fuller particulars, and are, therefore, only approximately reliable.",51
462,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Mr Coghlan used to issue two sets of statistics, one of them being issued quarterly.",51
463,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"A quarterly issue would lessen the cost. I suggest to the honourable member for Coolgardie that, as Supply for only two months of the year remains unvoted, he should withdraw his amendment. It probably requires only a hint from the Minister to insure a substantial reduction of expenditure in the future. Mr DUGALD THOMSON Sydney) [8.43] - If the publications of the Statistical Office are too elaborate, there is too much economy in the publication of the lists of Commonwealth public servants. These have been issued loose, without binding, and the sheets cannot easily be kept together. The cost of printing is so large that a slight extra expense on binding would be amply justified. If the sheets are not bound, the cost incurred in printing will be practically wasted. Amendment negatived. Proposed vote agreed to. Division' 26 (Meteorological",51
464,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Calare) [8.45] - I feel, sure that, under the able management of Mr Hunt, the Meteorological Office will become a credit to the Commonwealth, and I wish to point out a manner in which its usefulness may be increased. In New South' Wales, prior to Federation, weather reports were sent .to selected centres, and exhibited at the local, post-offices for public information; but since Federation the number of these centres has been hardly increased. This anomaly, therefore, now exists, that a number of other townships of considerable arid growing importance are not supplied. I urge the Government to increase this service, and make it more efficient. Nothing can be of greater advantage to those on the land than to have timely and regular weather information. Where stations are connected with telephone bureaux it ought to be possible for those who wish for it to obtain weather information from the lccal telegraph office.",51
465,Mr FRAZER,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Information as to whether it is likely to rain next day ?,51
466,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Forecast s have an interest, but they are nbt so important as records of rainfall, which are extremely useful to those who are dealing in stock, or are following agricultural pursuits. I hope that the Government will take every means to make the Department as useful as possible to the Commonwealth. 0",51
467,Mr BOWDEN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Nepean) [8.49] - I rise to repeat a protest which I made once before in reference to the transfer to Melbourne of the Meterol'ogical Department, although the Meteorologist declared that this is not the best, position for it. ",51
468,Mr BOWDEN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"He said that Svdney is a better position, because the climatic (North changes there are not so frequent. The Minister of Home Affairs, however, nractically told him that it was none of his business. Another matter to which I draw attention is the fact that, while two forecasts are issued every twenty-four hours for the States of Victoria and Tasmania, only one is published for the'State of New South Wales, and there is a feeling amongst those connected with shipping in Sydney that they are not getting as much, or as reliable, information 'from the Commonwealth as they got from the State. I think that the office should be better worked under ComBrancli), monwealth control than under State control, an'd, therefore, I join with the honourable member for Calare. with whose remarks I ' cordially agree, in' urging the Minister to make it as useful as possible.' ' Mr Wilks (Dallev) [8.52] - The honourable member for Nepean has brought a very important matter under the notice of the Minister. I wish to'draw 'attention to - another'which concerns 'the interests of ..Sydney. It is the practice to fly, from .tower of the General Post Office there, a - flag warning persons of the approach of a "" southerly,"" and some time ago I asked that at night-time this warning might he given by means of a lamp. The Postmaster-General told me that the matter came under the Department of Home Affairs.",51
469,Mr MAUGER,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I also said that the harbour authorities urged that the light should not be shown. The harbormaster, in personal conversation, and by writing, urged me on no account to' sanction it.",52
470,Mr WILKS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I could understand the harbormaster objecting to tights which might confuse navigation; but a red light on' the top of the Post Office tower would be too high to do so. Many a catastrophe might have been avoided had this warning .been given in the past. I speak on behalf of those who earn a livelihood on the or pass their time on it in pleasuring.,52
471,Mr MAUGER,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Does the honourable member urge his request in spite of the statement of the' harbormaster?,52
472,Mr WILKS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,A broader expression of opinion should be asked for. I do not say that the harbormaster is so jealous of the powers of the Board that he would say that a thing was dangerous if he believed it not to be; but Lam of opinion that he has exaggerated. The experience I gained by yachting in my younger days tells me that the light would not create any confu-sion. Any one on the harbour would have lo look upwards at an angle of about 75 - degrees in order to see it. I ask the Minister tb cause further inquiry to be made.,52
473,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Lang) [8.55] - Perhaps the Postmaster-General will tell the Committee whether the harbormaster advanced any reason why this light should tnot be exhibited ?,52
474,Mr MAUGER,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"We made inquiries, and I am not at all certain that it was the harbormaster who objected; but the shipping authorities urged that it should not be done, as the light might be mistaken by vessels at sea, and a disaster ocCQ-Sioncd",52

477,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Coolgardie) [8.57] This division provides for an expenditure of £29,824 in respect of rent. It calls for attention that in some of the States the Commonwealth is renting buildings in townships where we should have our own structures. I have water, often drawn the attention of the House to the want of foresight shown by the Government in failing to purchase suitable sites in new centres-mor e particularly in Western Australia-and erecting thereon their own postal buildings. We find, however, that year after year the Government continue to pay exorbitant rents to private individuals for inferior accommodation. For a much smaller capital oiftlay they could provide build-ings adequate for their needs, with sufficient accommodation for their officers. Considerable economies could thus be effected. It is a rather sad commentary on the public spirit of the Administration to find in some parts of Australia banking institutions and private individuals erecting expensive buildings, whilst the Government is represented by an iron shed in which the temperature during 'the summer months is almost unbearable. . I do not suggest that the Government should erect public offices in towns that are purely ephemeral; I am speaking now of proved goldfields, which are likely to remain for many generations permanent cenftres of population. Although the Government might have to expend a considerable amount in giving effect to this suggestion, they would, in the long run, effect considerable sav-' I hope that the Minister will give coast to the matter his attention.",52
478,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Lang) [9.1] - This division makes provisions for repairs and maintenance' of postal and telegraphic is buildings. When last year's Estimates be were under consideration, I drew the .attention of the Postmaster-General 'to some very necessary work-the painting of the Marrickville Post-office-whic h I have endeavoured to have carried out. Minister then gave, me to understand-that he had obtained from his officers some information which led him to believe that - the work had been carried out since I had previously brought the matter under notice. When I went home during the recess, however, I found '.that it had not been touched, but that some internal work, which I did not consider of special urgency, and which I had never asked for, had been done. I made a further representation to the Postmaster-General, who assured me that the painting of the exterior would be carried out; but, although I have made representations to the Department of Home Affairs, have . interviewed Mr Oakeshatt, who has charge of the works branch of the Home Affairs Office in Sydney, and have repeatedly interviewed the Deputy Postmaster-General, nothing has yet been done. The last report that I received was that a State official had said that the work was unnecessary.",52
479,Mr MAUGER,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I am sorry to say that that is continually occurring.,53
480,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,What right has any State official - to say that a Commonwealth work should or should not be. done ?,53
481,Mr MAUGER,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"At the instance of Speaker, we ordered a galvanized-iron fence to be erected in a certain place where it was necessary for the protection of children. The State authorities, however, blocked the work for months, until I ordered that it should be done forthwith.",53

483,Mr MAUGER,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Where they object to a Commonwealth work they passively oppose it.,53
484,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"It is worth considering whether the Department of Home Affairs should not have an independent Works Branch. I raise my protest against the delav in carrying out work already approved, and against the unnecessary and unwarrantable interposition of officials with the object of thwarting the intention of the Commonwealth Ministers in regard to such undertakings. The appearance of the Marrickville - Post-office is simply disgraceful. The exterior wallswhere street loungers lean against themare greasy, dirty, and shabby looking, besides being insanitary, and I should like The to have from the Minister an assurance that they will, be painted forthwith.",53
485,Mr BOWDEN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Nepean) [9.7] - The objection raised by the honourable member for Lang applies to almost every Department which has to invoke the assistance of the Works Departments of the States. The latter seem to make it a practice to shelve Commonwealth work as long as States work remains to be done. There may be financial reasons why we cannot establish a Works Department of our own. It would, doubtless, involve an expenditure so stupendous that I do not think we should be justified at present in-undertaking it ; but we should, at all events, give the officers of the various Departments more power than they appear to have to carry out works involving a trifling expenditure, without the intervention of the Works Departments of the States. . For some time there has been a proposal to erect a new post-office at Katoomba, and also one at Lithgow. The site for a new post-office at Katoomba has been purchased, and I understand that plans have been prepared, but, although the matter has been in hand for some years, I do not know that a transfer has actually been drawn up. The work was determined upon before I entered this House, Mr and still the townspeople are crying out for it, and the Department is paying a much larger rent than the interest on the proposed outlay would involve. No headway seems to have been made. The case of the Lithgow Post-office is even worse, because the Department has not yet made up its mind where they will place it . - Before we adjourned, an item of £ r , o o o was placed on the Estimates towards this building, and, in my youthful parliamentary innocence, I thought the matter was quite settled. However, nothing has been done; and there is a dispute amongst the townspeople themselves as to where the office ought to be. Owing to the present arrangements the business is in a state of chaos; and I think the Department ought to take on itself the responsible y of saving where - the post-office shall be placed. I understand that the Departmental Inspectors have on two difStates ferent occasions recommended sites; and the late Postmaster-.General visited the place, and selected one for himself.",53
486,Mr MAUGER,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"After the late Postmaster-General had made his decision, the State officials reported that the. selected ground was unsafe, and strongly recommended that the building should not be placed there.",53

It has to be remembered that many we pay men who have come to Australia to be Governors or Governors-General have done so such to enable them to rehabilitate their own",55
510,Mr BOWDEN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Oh !,55
511,Mr WILKS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"-It is all very well for the honourable member for Nepean to say, "" Oh,"" but the facts are as I have stated I do not say our Governors or the Governors-General have made money out of their positions, but I do say that many them have come to Australia to rehabilitate their own private fortunes. What I mean is that they make a saving by being enabled to live in Australia without incurring the expenditure to which they are put when in England. I consider that an expenditure of £10,000 in addition to the Governor General's salary is more than we ought to incur. In my opinion, the honourable member for Coolgardie has done well in bringing the matter forward. No matter is touched more gingerly than expenditure relative to the Governor General. But it is necessary to criticise these ters sometimes. I suppose that while we expect the Governor General to perambulate between Melbourne and Sydney, we shall have to incur extra expenditure. hope that what has occurred will induce the honourable member for Coolgardie to urge the speedy settlement of the Federal Capital question.",55
512,Mr HENRY WILLIS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Robertson) [9.30] - It is .generally agreed that we should have a representative of the King in Australia, and we shouldhouse him decently. To take exception to such items as have been criticised is a mistake. Items such as telephones and postage do not really involve actual expenditure. are merely bookkeeping entries. again, we have to maintain the houses and grounds which are provided for the Governor General's use. The grounds are maintained as much for the pleasure of the public as for the use of the Governor General. Especially is that the case in Victoria, where virtually no one is excluded from Government House grounds on reception days. As far as I cari understand, many of these items are merely bookkeeping entries; and when they are duplicated it simply means that they are cross-entries. . Then as to the Government House in Svdney, does any one mean to say that it would be desirable to keep the representative of the King all the year round in the climate of Melbourne, when he could enjoy life in Sydney? . Mr CROUCH - Why not have a Government House in every country town?",56
513,Mr HENRY WILLIS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The Governor General visits every State in the Union, - and he goes as the welcome guest of the people.

The Governor General' of Canada has one residence at Ottawa and another in Quebec. Duffenln Terrace, Quebec, is a great public. promenade, and a very beautiful place it is, too, right alongside the St. Lawrence. There is mat- nothing to take exception to in these amounts, unless honourable members wish to break down our present system of Government, and say that we shall have a I republic.",56
515,Mr BOWDEN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The expense would be greater then.,56

We are told that the. President receives £10,000 per annum, but we do not know what the other expenditure is. Certainly the cost of maintaining a great establishment like the White House at They Washington must be greater than £10,000 Then, a - year. There are items in the Estimates of more importance than this, and I do not think that there is.any reason for cavilling at the expenditure involved in enabling the people of New . South Wales to continue their hospitalitv to the Governor General.",56
517,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Lang) [9.34] - I believe that the argument of the honourable member for Dalley was intended to show why we should proceed as soon as possible to fix upon a site for the Federal Capital. At the same time, we should not overlook the fact that when we do have such a place- "" a consummation devoutly to be wished ""-the people of Melbourne and Sydney will still desire to see the Governor General occasionally.",56
518,Mr MAUGER,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Instea d of having two establishments we shall want three.,56
519,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Yes ; there will be three establishments then, which will have to be kept up. I think that there would not be so much comment upon this expenditure if the Governor General were to distribute his favours a little more evenlv - between the two'capitals. Sydney sees too little of the Governor General in comparison with Melbourne. It must, I think, be admitted by Ministers that His Excellency spends more of his time in Melbourne than in Sydney. He goes to Sydney at Easter for a little while, but I am not sure that he goes af any other time of the year to be unless for a flying visit.",56
520,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Oh , yes, he",56
521,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"At any rate, the .people of Sydney would like to see him a little oftener. There is a feeling that Melbourne enjoys something of a monopoly of the advantages accruing from the presence of the. Governor General and his suite in this city. My only complaint is that we do not see him quite as often as we should like in the principal city of the Commonwealth. There is, 1 hoticej a great difference between the cost of the upkeep of Government Houses in Melbourne and Sydney.. There is a difference of £ 3 0 0 in the upkeep of the grounds alone. For the upkeep of the grounds in Sydney there is an expenditure of £ 1 , 0 0 0; whilst on the grounds in Melbourne there is an expenditure of £1,300. Then, again, for the House itself there is £500 for maintenance in Sydney, and £600 in Melbourne. In Melbourne again sanitation and water supply absorb £1,168. There is an increase in the appropriation for the Melbourne' establishment t'o that extent, the amount last year being £2,915, whilst this year it is £4,083. Perhaps the Minister in charge will explain what is meant by the item "" non-recurring works"" on account of both Melbourne and Sydney Government' Houses, and why the whole of the expenditure in connection with Government House is not placed under one heading? When we have dealt with it under the Department of Home Affairs we should not have to deal with it again in connection with the Treasury.",57

I rise to point out that, while we properly recognise the advantages which we enjoy here, there, is, in the instance before us, evidence of a growing restiveness in .certain official Victorian quarters at our continued residence here, in view of which it is desirable that we should, at the earliest moment, get into quarters of our own al the Seat of Government in New South is.

As a matter of fact, it has appeared on the Estimates year after year. Last year we appropriated £ 1 , 0 0 0 for this purpose, and only £ 1 0 0 was used. It will thus be seen that the item is very much in-the'nature'of a bunch of carrots. Are we to be captured by such a device ? The honourable member for Wentworth was told this afternoon by the Prime Minister that the'Federal Capital Site question would probably be dealt with next week. t Thut being so, the necessity for the item disappears.

Unfortunately that is not the position. The Seat of Government Act does not fix the site. True, it names Dalgety, but it was passed for the purpose of facilitating negotiations between the Commonwealth and the ,State concerned, and before the Dalgety site can be finally chosen further legislation will be necessary.

564,Mr HUTCHISON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Hindmarsh) [10. n ] - I desire to call attention to the item of £ 2 3 , 5 0 0 in connection with the administration of the Electoral Act. I think a large saving might have been effected with much better service as the result. Hundredweights of printed matter are destroyed as of no use by returning officers, and yet the administration is so bad that forms absolutely necessary are not to be had at the polling booths, with the result that in South ' Australia a large number of people were deprived of the franchise. Here there is room for much inquiry, and I may point out that the working of the Commonwealth Act has been very defective as compared with the working of the South Australian Act. There have ""been mistakes which would not have occurred if we had been working under the State Act to which I have referred. However, I now desire to call attention to the vote of £ 1 , 5 0 0 towards the expense of making inquiries and preparing plans for additional lighthouses required on the coast of Australia. Do I understand that the Commonwealth is at the present time expending money on lighthouses and so forth, which are not under their control ? In some States there are no light dues at all, and, therefore, this will prove a very unprofitable administration. I hope that before undertaking any responsibility the Government will consider the advisability of imposing light dues throughout Australia. In South Australia, the light dues show a profit over expenditure, but that is not so in Queensland and some other States, and, therefore, I hope (Calare) the Government will act with caution until such time as proper legislation is introduced and passed.",60

Is the Treasurer waiting until we can see on it the site of the Federal Capital? This item has appeared on the Estimates year after year, and the work is apparently no nearer completion.",60
568,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Calare) [10.19] - As to the item of £23,-500, expenses in connection with the administration of the Electoral Act, I think there may be something in the contention of the honourable member for Hindmarsh that saving may be effected in the printing and so forth, though I do think at the last general election there was an effort made at cutting down expenses, which gave rise to a serious problem from the point of view of the secrecy of the ballot. This difficulty is more particularly felt in country districts. For the first time the Department introduced the principle of dispensing with a poll clerk at a great number of booths, with the result that the whole of the work had to be done by one officer, who was very often a local resident with, perhaps, some bias. A great deal of suspicion was aroused on this account. .",60
569,Mr HUTCHISON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The Act itself stroys the secrecy of the ballot. Mr THOMAS ' BROWN - I am now 'dealing, not so much with the question of the secrecy of the ballot, as with the proper return of the votes recorded. The departure I have indicated was made on the score of economy, and the result was that at a number of polling booths in the country, where there were from 50 to 100 voters, the whole administration was in the hands of one man, on whose discretion and honesty everything depended. Mr/MCDouGALL - Were there not cases of returning officers and poll clerks canvassing candidates overballot-boxes ?",61

The State Government of New South Wales would never think for one moment of conducting an election under such conditions.

Last May, when the right honourable member for Swan was Acting Prime Minister, he visited North Queensland. I took occasion to write to him prior to his leaving Melbourne, asking him to investigate this matter. I had had communications, personal and otherwise, with several members of the Torres Straits Pilots' Association, who urged upon me, - when I was last at Thursday Island, the absolute necessity for extra lightingupon the coast between Cairns and Thursday Island. It is a very dangerous coast, and at present it is not nearly so well lighted as it ought to be.",61

Is it proposed to take in New Zealand and Fiji? We have heard something about the necessity for more lights on the western, coast, but very little is said about the Queensland coast. Going down that coast lately, I found that the ship anchored because the captain could not pick up a certain light. In the morning he found that if he had kept on his course five minutes longer, he would have picked up the light quite easily. But he said that the coast was so dangerous that, although he had been on it for about twenty years and knew it very well, yet if he could not pick up a light to the minute he always went to anchor. Beyond Thursday Island also more lights are urgently necessary. I hope that the Treasurer, who is a practical business man, will look into the matter. I also notice a vote for the payment of gratuities to officers who have made suggestions which have led to the adoption of reforms and The economies. I should like to know whether this is a newly-established system, or whether it has been in operation for any length of time? If so, what good results have followed from the suggestions made by officers?

582,Mr HUTCHISON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Hindmarsh) [10.32] - In relation to the electoral administration, I should like to make an observation regarding the striking of names off the rolls.

Electors have told me that their names have been struck off the rolls, although they were on for years previously, and voted at the last election. .They do not know why it has been done, nor why their names did not appear on the supplementary rolls. Possibly one reason, so far as the large centres are concerned, may be that the returning officers are most inadequately paid. Some of their assistants get nearly, as much for temporary work as they do for a whole year's service - As to. gratuities to officers, I desire to point out that some time ago I had the pleasure of looking through a new mail van. In the old vans there was no room for the proper sorting of letters, and it was always a marvel to me how ihe work was done. In the new mail vans there are ingenious arrangements by means of which the work can be expeditiously done.

That is a matter of arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth, but cer-' tainly the States should be relieved of the payment of interest for money borrowed on the properties taken over by the Commonwealth.",62
590,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,rDoe s not the honourable member think that the States have been relieved by the large amount of money we have paid to them?,62
591,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Whether the ""Commonwealth has been generous to the States in returning money does not affect the point that there was a distinct agreement between the States and the Commonwealth in regard to these properties, which should be paid for in some shape or form. There was a square deal between the Commonwealth, and the States, and the Gommonwealth should carry out its part of the agreement by relieving the States of the interest on the cost of construction. I hope that no time will be lost in giving attention to this matter,. and that there will thus be - removed what, in some of the States at least, has been a cause of friction.",62
592,Mr HUME COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Bourke-Honorar y Minister) [10.39] - The honourable member for Robertson has asked a question with regard to the preparation of a map of Australasia. The work is in the hands of the Department Of Lands in New South Wales.,62
593,Mr HENRY WILLIS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,They have been a long time over it.,62
594,Mr HUME COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The information supplied to me in reference to the matter is as followsI have the . honour to inform you that the taken by this Department up to date, iscomputation of the projection on which the map is to be compiled. This projection will be laid down shortly upon linen, and the sheets warded to the Department of Home Affairs, Melbourne, with a view ta the various States being asked to show .in outline the main coast lines, features, & c , upon the sheets of the projection. provement is urgent. Accompanying such sheets will be a memo, showing what is desired the States should add to the sheets with a view to uniform action being taken by the several States.",62
595,Mr HENRY WHJLIS,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Nothin g has been done; they have simply sent over a piece of calico.,63
596,Mr HUME COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,That is all Jl know about the matter.,63
597,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Were tenders invited for the preparation of the map?,63
598,Mr HUME COOK,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I am not sure. I have been asked a question with regard to gratuities paid to officers. Each Department pays its own gratuities, and - officers are permitted to communicate directly, with the Minister. There is no go-between that can take the credit of .any suggestion that may be put forward. No matter how humble the officer, he may send his suggestion direct to the Minister. Several such suggestions have been rewarded. With respect to the transferred properties, the valuations are now complete, and Colonel Miller is preparing a report which should be in the hands of the Minister in a few weeks, when. action will follow, though how soon I cannot say. There will be - no undue delay, As to the taking over of the control of the lighthouses, the authorities of the States have been consulted, and advice has been obtained from ship captains, pilots, and all others likely to be able to give information of Value. Something has also been done in the preparation of plans, and Parliament has made provision for the appointment of an officer to further assist the Government in this matter. Nothing more, can be done until the States Departments are transferred to the Commonwealth, and, in all probability early next session, for that purpose a Bill will be introduced.",63
599,Mr JOHNSON,FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Lang). [10.44] - The taking over of the control of lighthouses, beacons, and buoys is a very important matter, and I hope that a Bill will be introduced to give effect to it early next session. On the Queensland coast, in particular, the increased volume of trade, which hasnecessitated the employment of ships of larger draught, carrying of course, bigger and more valuable cargoes and a larger number of passengers, has made it increasingly necessary to improve the lighting of the intricate waters of the for- Barrier and Torres Straits. Ships' officers, pilots,- and all connected with shipping are unanimously of the opinion that this imConsiderable attention should also be given to the lighting of part of the coast ofWestern Australia and of part of trie Victorian coast. I cannot be accused of speaking in a provincial spirit in. this matter, because New South Wales has, perhaps, the best lighted coast in Australia. Proposed vote agreed to. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.48 p.m.",63
