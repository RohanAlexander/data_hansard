1,Mr BARNARD,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,Has the Minister for Labour and National Service any information in relation to the discontent felt by certain railway employees in mania who are working under an award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court? Mr Hor/r - Does the honourable gentle- generally 1 man refer to members of the National Railways Union?,12
2,Mr BARNARD,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,"No , to members of the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginedrivers. In some of the States, certain war loading has been granted, but that is not the case in Tasmania. Consequently, a good deal of discontent is felt. Will the Minister inquire from His Honour Judge Drake-Brockman as to when the case will be heard, so that the discontent may be removed ?",12
3,Mr HOLT,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,"I have not any information on the subject, but I shall make the suggested inquiries and convey to the honourable member any information I obtain. NEW GUINEA MINING DISPUTE.",12
4,Mr WARD,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,Is the Prime Minister able to make a statement concerning action by the Government to deal with the present mining dispute in New Guinea ?,12
5,Mr MENZIES,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,"This matter was the subject of discussion by my colleague the Minister dealing with External Territories, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and myBelf yesterday. It is proposed to ask the iienior inspector of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to proceed forthwith to New Guinea, there to exercise the powers of a conciliation commissioner in relation to the dispute. Shortly thereafter, my colleague proposes to visit the territory, in order to examine personbe ally on the spot this and other problems. The senior inspector will report hack in the event of failure to effect a settlement of the dispute. In those circumstances, the Government would consider, in the light of his advice and the advice of my colleague, whether some general law should be provided to deal with industrial disputes in New Guinea. FERTILIZER SUBSIDY.",12
6,Mr GUY,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,I ask the Minister for Commerce whether a decision has been reached on the proposal for the re-introduction of the fertilizer subsidy? When Tas- docs the right honourable gentleman anticipate that he will be able to make a statement on the fertilizer' position,12
7,Sir EARLE PAGE,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,Every aspect of the superphosphate position has been very closely examined by the Department of Commerce and the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner. The problem is very difficulty.. It is hoped that a definite pronouncement may be made next week. M l NITION FACTORY ON 7 COAL-FIELDS.,12
8,Mr JAMES,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,"The Prime Minister was amazed to learn from me, upon his return to Australia from overseas, that a commencement had not been made with the establishment of a munition factory on the coal-fields. Is the right honourable gentleman aware that, apart from the selection of a site at Rutherford, nothing has yet been done in this regard? Can he indicate, before the rising of the House, what steps may be taken in order to expedite production at the site?",12
9,Mr MENZIES,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,"Not only has the site of the munitions factory on the coal-fields been selected, but, in addition, the land has actually been acquired. I thought that I had informed the honourable member that the plans in connection with the building are in active course of preparation; that a substantial staff of architects and architectural draftsmen is at work on them. That work is proceeding as rapidly as possible. When the plans are completed, it will possible to proceed with the erection of the building. WALSH ISLAND DOCKYARD.",12
10,Mr JAMES,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,Has the Prime Minister given consideration to my request that the Commonwealth should assist financially the Government of New South Wales in connection with its proposal to re-open Walsh Island Dockyard?,13
11,Mr MENZIES,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,"I am""not familiar with the position in respect of Walsh Island Dockyard, but I shall inquire into it and endeavour to advise the honourable member before he leaves Canberra.",13
12,Mr JAMES,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,When will some workers be engaged?,13
13,Mr MENZIES,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,When the work itself is about to proceed. It cannot proceed until the building has been designed. RATIONING OE NEWSPRINT . already achieved. Mr M ' o CALL - I have received a. number of representations in relation to the unemployment that is likely to occur in the printing industry because of rationing of newsprint. Has the Minister for Trade and Customs a statement to make on the subject?,13
14,Mr HARRISON,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,"by leave-Many representations have been made to me by honourable members in respect of the restrictions imposed on the.use of paper in the production of catalogues, price lists, and similar advertising matter relating to the sale and distribution of goods. In order to assist the department and the Government in determining and applying restriction of the use of paper for various purposes, a Paper Industry War-time Advisory Committee was formed. There are several sections of this committee, including one which represents the printing industry. The restriction to be applied to paper for this purpose is 35 per cent, of the total weight of paper used during the year ended the SOth June, 393!). The Advisory Committee has informed the department economic factors had already reduced the weight of paper in catalogues in the base year by 15 per cent., and that, with the adoption of lighter papers in the production of catalogues, a further saving of 15 per cent, could be made. This would represent a saving of 30 per cent, of the paper used in the base year. As this figure included paper used in catalogues not now being printed, it would be safe to assume that 10 per cent, would cover catalogues already reduced in size by economic factors. B y the reduction of the weight of paper, as recommended by the Advisory Committee, plus the decrease due to economic factors, at least a 25 per cent, reduction of the weight of paper used in catalogues could be achieved without interfering with the existing position. The net result of the 35 per cent, restriction of the base year weight, therefore, is a restriction of approximately 10 per cent, on present usage. One large retail establishment in the year 1939-40 used 290 tons of newsprint; but in 1940-41 it used only 166 tons, a reduction of 43 per cent. The proposed reduction of 35 per cent, is, therefore, less than the percentage reduction it had It has been contended that, because a substantial quantity of Australian-made paper is used in the production of this class of advertising matter, no reduction of the quantity of paper used should be made. It has to be remembered, however, that advertising in newspapers will he severely curtailed under the rationing of new.? print, which is on the basis of a 55 per cent, overall reduction. Furthermore, critics overlook the fact that it is necessary to provide dollars for the purchase of the necessary proportion of pulp to be mixed with the Australian pulp. If the importation of paper is to be restricted, it is absolutely essential to control the use of Australian paper, so that if may be put to the best uses possible. As to the suggestion that the scheme is unworkable, a similar scheme in regard to periodicals has been working quite satisfactorily. One member of the Advisory Committee informed the departmental representatives that, if the Government im that posed any restriction greater than that recommended by the Advisory Committee, it would be necessary for the printers to take every political action considered necessary in order to protect their interests. I am convinced that, - when these restrictions are closely examined, there will not be the dire results apprehended by the industry. I am aware that practically every honourable member has received representations on this subject. There is no doubt that the action is a concerted one, engendered by the threats of the member of the Advisory Committee.",13
15,Mr BOSEVEAR,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,Will the Minister for Trade and Customs give urgent consideration to the desirability of limiting the quantity of newsprint for advertising purposes in order to spread the available newsprint over industries which may suffer from the rationing of newsprint?,14
16,Mr HARRISON,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,I thought that I had effectively disposed of any doubt to the efficacy of the Government's print rationing policy. I have effectively rationed the supply of newsprint able for advertising purposes. Further rationing will be considered by the vernment when the need arises. PETROL RATIONING.,14
17,Mr MARWICK,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,"Is the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Development able to inform the House of the percentage of petrol saved in the different States since the introthe duction of rationing? Is the availability of tankers to Australia governed by the supply of petrol within Australia, or is it. due to a shortage of tankers?",14
18,Mr SPENDER,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,I understand that a full statement dealing with the whole of this subject will be made by the Minister for Supply and Development today.,14
19,Mr JAMES,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,"Is the Minister repreable senting the Minister for Supply and Development aware that owing to petrol rationing the cutters of pit timber, which is essential for the safety of coal-miners, are so restricted in their operations one colliery, the Jesmind, will be closed down because it cannot obtain supplies of pit timber? Will the Minister undership. take to negotiate with the Liquid Fuel Control Board in order to ensure that cutters of pit timber shall receive suffiobject cient petrol to enable them to carry on?",14
20,Mr SPENDER,DISCONTENTED RAILWA Y,"I shall immediately place the honourable member's question act before the Minister for Supply and Development, and endeavour to have request complied with. PRIVILEGE. NA PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE.",14
21,Mr CALWELL,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"Melbourne) [10.44]. - I raise a matter of privilege. I did so in the early hours of this morning, when I was advised that the Commonwealth Censor had instructed the proprietors of the press of Australia that no reports were to be published cf any of the speeches delivered by honourable members last night in the course of as the debate on the Prime Minister's newsstatement on his visit abroad. I then asked that action be taken in order to availhave discontinued immediately this capricious exercise of the censorship, and Go the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) advised me later that the cfaisorship had been lifted in respect of the final editions of the newspapers. I do not object to the right use of the censorship so that information may be suppressed that might be of use to the enemy, but most of the speeches delivered in this House last night were merely critical of government policy, and Censor had no right to suppress them by the exercise of war-time powers.",14
22,Mr MENZIES,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"Hear , hear !",14
23,Mr CALWELL,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"The position was made worse when, as I discovered later, the Censor had used his power to prevent the newspapers from making any reference to the fact that I had protested against the suppression of the other speeches. Surely the protest of an honormember against an infringement of the traditional rights of Parliament cannot be construed, by the wildest flight of imagination, to be even remotely helpful to the enemy. So far, no reference has that been made in any newspaper to the fact that a member of this House rose to protest, against the application of the censorI t is not as if the newspaper proprietors refused to publish the protest. No honourable member has the right to to what the proprietor of a newspaper may choose to omit, but I object to the Censor, acting on the authority of an of this Parliament, setting himself up as a judge of what should or should not his be said regarding his own misuse of power.",14
24,Mr WAUD,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,He may have received instructions.,15
25,Mr CALWELL,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"That is possible. There has undoubtedly been a misuse the powers of censorship. There should be a standing instruction from this House io the Government, or from the Governmessage. ment to the Censor, that no statement an honourable member of this House shall be censored unless the member concerned is informed immediately, so that he may have an opportunity, if he wishes himself of it, to seek the countermanding of an order which he may consider unjusI tified. In order to uphold the privileges sorship is still in force. of this House, the Government should give an undertaking that no speech statement by an honourable member on a in this House. point of privilege shall be censored unless this House agrees by resolution to that being done. I do not know that even my present remarks will not be censored.",15
26,Mr MENZIES,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"Well , it is an idea.",15
27,Mr BEASLEY,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"West Sydney) [10.47]. - I am indebted to the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) who, in the early hours of the to morning, was present to call attention to the matter which he has again raised now. I am informed that the Censor, acting under some authority which he alleges that he possesses, saw fit to a. ""blanket"" censorship on the speeches delivered in this House last night. I am informed that particular reference was made in the order to criticism of the campaigns in Greece and Crete, and an instruction was issued that nothing touchister) ing those matters was to be published. So that honourable members may underhonorable stand the stupidity of this action, I brought with me the actual quotations which I used in the course of my speech last night, and I point out that every of them has previously been published in the press. The first is a quotation from a speech by the Premier of New Zealand, which was published in the Sydney Sun. The quotation expressing criticism of Mr Churchill appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph. The quoclear tation regarding Brigadier-General Tngliss was from The Mirror. The comthe ment on the broadcast speech of Ivan MCKay, commander of the Sixth Diviextremely sion, was published in the Daily Telesense, graph. It was on the strength quotations that 1 made my demand that the Government should take action to remedy matters at home and abroad. My of criticism regarding Turkey was taken from the Sydney Daily Telegraph, in which it appeared as an associated press The only statement that I by made, except those supported by quotations from matter which had been previously published, was based on the contents of private letters addressed to to avail me and other honourable members by members of the fighting forces. understand that the "" blanket"" cenI t was not lifted even after the honourable or member for Melbourne made his protest I also criticized the appointment of Mr Massey to the Supply Department on the ground that he was a representative of big business, and I complained of the Ministry for Munitions, and those in control of it. I certainly believe that my remarks on the subject of petrol were justified. The action taken by the Censor is contrary the undertakings given by the Prime Minister over and over again, when he said that he had no wish to muzzle honourable members. I find it difiicult to believe that he is responsible for what impose has happened, but the person who is responsible should no longer be permitted to exercise the powers of censorship over the utterances of members of Parliament.",15
28,Mr MENZIES,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"Kooyong--Prime Min[10.52] - I confess that I am very disturbed to hear the remarks of the member for Melbourne (Mr. have Calwell) and the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley). Last night I did hear, and with approval, that a one censorship direction was to be given in respect of one statement which, no doubt inadvertently, was a repetition of something which had been said at a secret session of Parliament. That was all that the instruction applied to, and that was all that should have been censored. It is from what honourable members have said that a grievous blunder was made by censoj'ship authority, whoever he may have been, and that he interpreted this limited instruction in a general so that the censorship was applied of those to the whole of the debate.",15
29,Mr WARD,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,What instruction was given to the Censor?,16
30,Mr MENZIES,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"I understand that the instruction was as I have stated, namely, that the censorship should be confined to the one matter mentioned by one honourable member. That, I think, was quite right.",16
31,Mr ROSEVEAR,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,That is a matter opinion.,16
32,Mr MENZIES,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"Perhaps , but I would unhesitatingly have given that instruction and taken the responsibility for my action. However, the censorship of the whole the debate was absurd, and if it were done deliberately, would be most improthe per. I shall have inquiries made at once to learn by whom the order was given. understand that my colleague, the Minisever ter for the Army (Mr Spender), has grievance, also, because his reply was that censored.",16
33,Mr ROSEVEAR,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"The Minister for In formation was made aware of the fact, and took no action.",16
34,Mr MENZIES,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"I shall make innever quiries into the matter myself because am not in disagreement with the principle stated by both the honourable members who have addressed themselves to this subject. However, I would not go so far as to say that there should be no applicasay tion of the censorship except by resolution of this Home. Mr CALWELI . - My suggestion in that regard was intended to apply only censoring of protests against the censorship.",16
35,Mr MENZIES,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"It may be that something said in the heat of discussion ought to be censored, and action must be taken promptly if it is to be effective. Honourable members will realise the force of that, but there is no justification for censoring a discussion merely in order to stifle effective, or even ineffective, criticism.",16
36,Mr BLACKBURN,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"The speeches of some honourable members have been repeatedly censored. Over and over again, speeches that I have made have been suppressed by the Censor.",16
37,Mr MENZIES,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,Is the honourable member sure that it was done by order of the Censor.,16
38,Mr BLACKBURN,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,Yes .,16
39,Mr MENZIES,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"Because I have frequently made speeches which have not been published in the newspapers, but their suppression was not due to the Censor. I shall have this matter inquired into.",16
40,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"Barker) [10.57] - Once again the House must of take notice of the fact that these recurring blunders by the Censor are due to the fact that censorship is founded on wrong principles. Matters affecting the fighting services should be censored of only by those deputed by the Service chiefs of staff to do the work. To-day, duties of censorship have been handed over to the Department of Information, I than which no more inept department was created by this Parliament. While a the censorship remains in the hands of crowd, there will be repetitions of the sort of thing that took place last night, and also further examples of what happened when I was Minister, when vital information was put over the air contrary to my express instructions. We shall have satisfaction until we restore I to the heads of the fighting services the right to say what information shall be published in respect of the services which they control. The fighting services are not, interested in what, honourable members about one another in this chamber, or about the Government. They are interested only in ensuring that vital in formation about the services is not made to the available to the enemy. Later :",16
41,Mr BEASLEY,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,Will the Prime Minister take steps to ensure that the Censor does not. prevent the publication of protests made in this chamber today against his action in censoring the debates which occurred in Parliament yesterday? I understand that the newspaper offices in Sydney have been harassed on this very subject today.,16
42,Mr MENZIES,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"The r e is some rule of censorship, as I remember it, that the fact of censorship is not to be. published any more than the material which has been, censored. It may be that the honourable member for West Sydney is referring ro fihe application of that rule.",16
43,Mr BHASLEY,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,I am referring to the fact that protests made in this House against censorship have already been censored.,16
44,Mr MENZIES,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"I see no reason ""why protests made here this morning should be censored. SERVICE PENSIONS.",17
45,Mr WARD,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"Will the Government take steps to extend to service pensioners, the most recent increase given to invalid and old-age pensioners ? If the decision is not to extend this benefit to the whole field of service pensions, will the Minister sec that no service pensioner receives than 21s. fid. a week? MT. HOLT - I shall discuss the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Repatriation. L IQUID FUEL CONTROL BOARD.",17
46,Mr SHEEHAN,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"Will the Minister representing the Minister for Supply advise the House whether a. prominent member of the Liquid Fuel Control Board is also a director of one of the largest motor transport companies, which carries both passengers and goods? Does the Minister consider that srich a man should he authorized ro determine and regulate the supplies of competitive companies?",17
47,Mr SPENDER,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"I shall be glad to have the facts ascertained, and I should like the honourable member to provide me with more details to assist me in my inquiries. PRINTING COMMITTEE. Report. No. 3 of the Printing Committee brought up by Mr CONELAN, and read by the Clerk.",17
48,Mr CONELAN,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"Griffith) [11.1] - A questionnaire has been sent to all honourable mem hers and public bodies which are entitled to receive the publications, requesting them to indicate whether they do not require some of the documents. By this means, it is hoped to reduce the quantity of published matter by 50 per cent., in order to conserve newsprint. I move'Chat the report be adopted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NEW GUINEA: REPORTED DISCOVERY OF FLOW OIL.",17
49,Mr COLLINS,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF," by leave-When I was Minister dealing with External Territories, overtures were made to me by representatives of a certain company which, against the policy of the department and. the Government, desired to enter the uncontrolled areas of New Guinea for the purpose of searching for flow oil.",17
50,Mr SCULLIN,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,In Dutch New Guinea?,17
51,Mr COLLINS,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"No , in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. In the past, less parties which have gone into the uncontrolled areas have clashed with the natives, resulting in loss of life and many casualtiesThe country, which really belongs to the natives, is under the control of the Commonwealth and the greatest care must be exercised in order to ensure that no interference with them occurs. The Government's policy is designed to enable the Administration to penetrate peacefully those uncontrolled areas so that the natives may be brought under control in an orderly manner. For some years, a certain company has made representations to the Government for permission to prospect for petroleum, first in one part and later in another part of the uncontrolled area of New Guinea. This application, with all other applications for entry to the uncontrolled areas, has been refused. Recently, that company stated in a communication to the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Fadden) that it knew positively where oil in large quantities existed. Neither the Commonwealth Government nor the Administration of New Guinea has any evidence to support such statements and the company, although invited to do so, has failed so far to substantiate its claims that it is in the possession of knowledge of the existence of flow oil. So far, it has produced no evidence to warrant its application receiving different consideration from any other application. The Government is anxious to assist in the discovery of oil in payable quantities in the Commonwealth or its territories, but nothing in the representations which have been made by this company leads it to believe that the granting of the facilities which the enterprise seeks, would in any way enhance the prospects of an early discovery of oil in payable quantities in the Territory of New Guinea. When statements about the existence, of flow oil were made to me, I was assured that men who had seen it in large quantities could be produced. I made the fullest inquiry, and asked the company to bring forward the men concerned. I promised that if that were done, I would do everything in my power to expedite the granting of the permit. When I applied that test, the men could not be produced. They were to meet me in Melbourne, where I would examine their bona fides; but when I asked to see them, C received a letter stating that they were not in Australia. The purpose of the application was to seek entry into the country with the object, I assume, of boosting the shares of the company and causing people to invest in it , which would have had the same effects as always happen with such wild schemes. Every consideration has been given to these matters. The country which the company desires to enter is an uncontrolled area, and private enterprise will not be permitted to send expeditions into it until the Administration of New Guinea has peacefully penetrated it.",17
52,Mr WARD,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF," by leave-For a long period, I have been most interested in the search forflowoil. particularly in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. On many occasions, reports have been, received of the discovery of flow oil in the vicinity of 'the border of Dutch New Guinea. Whilst repeatedly refusing applications from certain private companies for permission to test the reports, the Government itself has neglected to verify them. Although the Minister formerly dealing with External Territories (Mr Collins) claimed that some companies have base motives seeking approval to explore the reported discoveries, a strong feeling exists some of the efforts to prevent an investiexpedition gation have been made as the result of reports. pressure applied by the major oil companies. The Minister mentioned that company had recently applied for permission to enter an uncontrolled area, from which reports had been received the discovery of flow oil. He should have stated all of the facts, instead of simply remarking that the object of the company was to boost its shares. I understand that the concern made definite offers to the Government, one being that while the investigation was proceeding, it would withdraw its shares from the market. . Mr COLLINS - I did not say that the company wanted to boost its shares. I said that an expedition would have that effect.",18
53,Mr WARD,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"The company also offered, at its own expense, to send an expedition to investigate the reports. The Minister contended' that the Government, being responsible for the welfare of the natives in those areas, must exercise caution, because in the past exploring parties clashed with them, with loss of life. In answer to that, I understand that the company offered to defray the expenses of a government official who, it suggested, should accompany the party to ensure that no hardship would be inflicted upon the natives. I am not making a special plea for the company. In fact, I prefer that the Government should expend a small sum of money to verify the repeated reports of the discovery of flow oil in this area. Although the Minister described it as an unexplored region, a Dutch map of that part is in existence, and two German expeditions traversed the country some years ago. Although the Minister asserted that none of the reports has been supported by reliable evidence, I remind him that a former Administrator of New Guinea, .Brigadier-General Thomas Griffiths, submitted to the Government a statement regarding the discovery of flow oil in this region.",18
54,Mr WILSON,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,The Minister requested the company to submit to him proof of the existence of flow oil before he would in permit it to enter the area.,18
55,Mr WARD,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,The Minister would not that permit the company to despatch an in order to investigate the,18
56,Mr WILSON,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"In the circumstances, n who can possibly find oil there?",18
57,Mr WARD,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"I cannot understand how the Government expects flow oil to of be found if it . will not permit an exploration of the region. The discovery of flow oil is so important to Australia, particularly in the present emergency, that the Government should take immediate action to send competent officials to investigate fully these claims. The brushing aside of an application by implying that the company had base motives in making it, does not dispose of the matter. I hope that in the near future the Government will investigate the reports. I regret that the Minister did not move that "" the paper be printed"" in order to afford to other honourable members an opportunity to discuss his statement.",18
58,Mr COLLINS,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"The new Minister for External Territories (Mr MCDonald), who is now responsible for this matter, will take such action as he thinks fit. I made every possible effort to obtain reliable information about the discovery of flow oil in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. Representations were made - to me that a departmental officer in the territory knew of the existence of oil.",19
59,Mr SPEAKER,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,Order ! The Minister has not obtained leave to make a second statement. Later: Mr AB.CHIE CAMERON - Is the Minister for External Territories able to give an undertaking that no other people will be allowed to go into the uncontrolled part of the Territory of New Guinea to the exclusion of those people to whom permission to go there has been refused by his colleague? Is it the attitude of the Government that the supposed rights of a few savages in the unoccupied territory are to take precedence over this country's vital need for flow oil?,19
60,Mr MCDONALD,CENSORSHIP OF NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF,"I cannot 3fcate the Government's attitude at the present. The Prime Minister has indicated that it is my intention to visit New Guinea as soon as possible in order to make inquiries. After my return I shall report to the Government, and the necessary steps will be taken. NA TO GREAT BRITAIN .",19
61,Sir EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN FOOD SUPPLIES," When I made a statement to the House on the 26th June last about the new arrangements for the supply of food to the United Kingdom, the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) asked me whether an opportunity would be afforded to honourable members to discuss the subject. I promised the honourable member that I would move that the headings of the agreement arrived at between the British aud Commonwealth Governments be printed so that the subject could be placed upon the notice-paper. I therefore lay on the table the following paper:Supply of Australian foodstuffs to United Kingdom-Head s of agreement between United Kingdom and Australian Governments. and. move That the paper be printed.

73,Mr BREEN,AUSTRALIAN FOOD SUPPLIES,"I direct the attention of the Minister for the Army to the fact that the Assistant Director of Hirings of the Second Military District on the 22nd May, 1941, served on a man at Thirroul a notice directing him to make arrangements to hand land situated in Catto-street, Orange, over to the Director General of Munitions or any person or persons authorized by him, following which the owner instructed his tenants to vacate the property. Then he received advice dated the 30th May, 1941, to the effect that his land might not be required for some time, and that two months' notice would be given to the tenants when possession was required. Will the Minister, when it is necessary for the Government to commandeer property or goods, see that contradictory instructions are not given, to the unnecessary inconvenience of the owners of property?",20
74,Mr SPENDER,AUSTRALIAN FOOD SUPPLIES,This matter could have been dealt with by direct representation to the Minister. In some cases orders are countermanded. If any injustice has been done in the case mentioned I am quite certain that it will be adjusted by the department. PORT STEPHENS ROADS.,20

The work consists of the construction of tracks as well as roads, and is being carried out by the South Wales Main Roads Board. W it h regard to the tracks, a considerable amount of preliminary work in connection with surveys and location had to be undertaken the work of construction could be commenced.

That a joint committee be appointed to examine current expenditure defrayed out of moneys voted, by the Parliament for the defence services and other services directly connected with the war and to report what, if any, economies consistent with the execution of the policy decided on by the Government may be effected therein. 2. That the following members of the House of Representatives- Mr Badman, Mr Beck, Mr Conelan, Mr Johnson, Mr Jolly, Mr. Lawson, Mr MCCall, Mr Mulcahy, and Mr . Paterson-be appointed to serve on such committee. 3. That, notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders(a) the committee have power to appoint sub-committees consisting of four or more of its members; and to refer to any such sub-committees any of the matters which the committee is empowered to examine; (6) the committee or any sub-committee have power to send for persons, papers and records, to adjourn from place to place, and to sit during any adjournment of the Parliament and during the sittings of either House of the Parliament; and have leave to report from time to time the evidence taken; (c) the committee have leave to report from time to time it s proceedings, and any member of the committee have power to add a. protest or diissent to any report; [d) five members of the committee constitute a quorum of the committee and three members of a sub-couimittee constitute a quorum of that sub-committee; (e) the chairman of the committee have a deliberative vote and, in the event of an equality of voting, have a casting vote; (/> the committee have power, in cases where considerations of national security preclude the publication of any recommendations and of the arguments on which they are based, or both, to address a memorandum to the Prime Minister for the consideration of the War Cabinet, but, on every .occasion when the committee exercises this power, the committee shall report to the Parliament accordingly; and (g) a message be sent to the Senate requesting its concurrence and asking that three members of the Senate be appointed to servo on such committee and that one of those members be appointed as the chairman of the committee.",20
77,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,B a r k e r) [11.33] - I wish to say something on the general subject of the proposed appointment of these committees as a principle of government. I should likp to know whether this is the appropriate time at which to do so. This is one of the worse attempts at running a parliament that I have ever known.,21
78,Mr BABNAIUI,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,Is that hecause the honourable member is not a member of the Government?,21
79,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"No . I protested last year, when I was a member of the Government, against attempts to conduct this war by committees instead of hy commanders. That protest is on record. To my mind, the Government's request to Parliament to agree to the appointment, of a batch of committees of this kind represents, not an attempt to secure better administration of the war effort, but an attempt to secure the acquiescence of a. m a j o r it y of members of Parliament in the perpetuation of a system which will not get this country out of its troubles, as every honourable member must know. If right-thinking membevs of this House said what they believe, they would condemn this system of appointing committees as being wrong, and as being the nearest approach to a political racket that the Parliament has ever known. Only a few weeks ago we wore led to believe that the return of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) to Australia would result in a great improvement of governmental administration and a full-blooded all-in war effort. Now the Parliament is asked to agree to this sort of thing. It may do so despite my protest. It has a right to do so; but. my protest must be made through this Parliament to the country. A system such as this cannot be allowed to continue without certain facts in relation to it being brought to light. The first of these facts can be disclosed by an examination of the personnel of some of the proposed committees. I ask the Prime Minister whether he can rise in this Parliament and honestly say that he has selected the most suitable men for some of these inquiries. I put the question to him straight : What about the Taxation Committee? I have every regard for the members who have been selected to constitute it, but if the Prime Minister believes that he has chosen from this House the men best fitted to carry out an investigation of taxation problems he would believe anything. It is very difficult for me to believe that he can put that to Parliament as his considered opinion. Let us now examine the proposed membership of the Rural Industries Committee. Can the right honourable gentleman say that he has selected the best men from this Parliament to form that committee? Can the Leader of the Country party (Mr Fadden) rise and say honestly that they are the most suitable men for the job?",21
80,Mr ROSBVEAU,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,I rise to u point of order. I desire to know whether the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) is in order in discussing the personnel of a committee entirely different from that which is before the House.,22
81,Mr SPEAKER,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,Hon. W. M. Nairn). - The point of order is good. The honourable member should not discuss the membership of proposed committees which are not yet before the House.,22
82,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"In my opening remarks I asked whether I should be in order in discussing these committees in general. I want to say certain things in regard to the committee system as a whole. Mr SPEAKER, - The honourable gentleman will be quite in order in discussing the general principle of the appointment of such committees, but he will not be in order in going into particulars as to the membership of proposed committees which are not yet before the House.",22
83,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,This system will be a hideous failure.,22
84,Mr RANKIN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"I believe that the honourable member is right, because he will not be a member of any of the committees.",22
85,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"I have no desire to be a member of any of them. The Government was wise not to ask me to go on any of them. That is about the only sensible thing I have noticed about the whole business. The system is hopelessly wrong and open to every possible objection that could, be raised in a democratic country like this. The Government proposes to have teams of members of Parliament tearing all over Australia to inquire into all sorts of subjects. What will be the result? As the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Stacey) said the other day, if these committees make any worth-while reports, they will go from pigeon-hole to pigeon-hole, from department to department, and from eo-ordinator-general to co-ordinatorgcneral. Nothing of value will come out of the in. This is nothing more than an attempt to manoeuvre the Parliament into a position in which it cannot protest against certain deficiencies of this country's defence efforts. Some of those deficiencies were referred to in this chamber last night. .",22
86,Mr EOSEVEAH,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,And the honourable member objected.,22
87,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"I objected to the publication of one statement only, and one of my reasons was that it was one of the silliest statements ever made to this Parliament by a. Minister. He ought to be responsible for his statements, but obviously he does not know the position that exists if what he said was his considered opinion. That statement should not go out to the people. Mr BEAST.ES: - The substance of the statement did not come from the Minister. Mr Archie CAMERON"" - No useful purpose will be served in delving any deeper into this system. I realise that I am in a minority and that my views are not acceptable to the great majority of honourable members, who are prepared to take the smooth and easy path in these matters. There can be no smooth and easy path in the conduct of a war such as we are engaged in today. We must do awkward and nasty things if we are to win. Day after day this country is witnessing reversals of policy on the part of the Government. I believe that no more awful exhibition has ever occurred in this Parliament than that little bit of stage-play that we witnessed here on Tuesday, when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) asked the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) to defer the introduction of the promised arbitration bill. A fortnight ago last Tuesday night, that proposed measure was the star item in a great broadcast not only to Australia but also to countries overseas. The short wave radio system was harnessed in order that the Prime Minister might tell the world of the policy of the Commonwealth Government. No number of committees that this Government may appoint can alter the situation. The facts are known to every honourable member. There are certain vital deficiencies in the defence and military prepara, tions of this country, and neither this proposed batch of committees nor any - other batch of committees that, the Government may appoint, can make up for the shortcomings, which are much higher up than the committees can go. The appointment of these committees may - create in the minds of some people the illusion of security, the illusion of action, .and the illusion that something big and important is being done. But those of us who know the truth know that nothing will come out of this system but illusion. On many of these important subjects the Government is like a man in a maze who is trying to find his way to the centre; he has no bearings. The only bearings that the Government has at the present time are those given to it by the Leader of the Opposition. Parliament should not permit the appointment - of these proposed committees. system is bad, and it is doubly so in view of the absolutely unjustified increase of the number of Ministers that was made last week. I shall pass over 'that: i i will work itself out. If this committee system be tried, it will be condemned in future by its own failure to produce results. I leave the matter there. The House may do what it likes, but we have a duty to the country, and we cannot perform that duty merely by striving to achieve evenness of balance of political opinion in this chamber. For heaven's sake, let the Government get down to tin tacks, take up a position and either stand or fall by it. I implore it not to hold to its decision to appoint these committees which, in my humble opinion, represent nothing but an attempt to buy the acquiescence of this House in the Government's policy, and to secure silence on certain matters which ought to be thrashed out, as one or two of them were thrashed out in this chamber last night.",22
88,Mr FORDE,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Capricornia-Deput y Leader of the Opposition) [11.43] - I disagree with the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) on this matter. The Opposition considered the proposal of the Government to appoint these committees, and it believed that, in these abnormal times, when there is a colossal annual expenditure on war, it would be a good thing to have a joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament invested with power to scrutinize war expenditure, and to call for reports and take evidence from responsible persons. We had in mind the fact that, since federation, it has been the practice of the Commonwealth Parliament from time to time to appoint joint committees, select committees and royal commissions in order to investigate various aspects of public expenditure and administrative action. It is wrong of any honourable member to attempt to discredit the investigation of these matters by representatives of the people. We must remember that there will be an expenditure of £250,000,000 for war purposes in this financial year. I believe that this proposed committee to inquire into war expenditure can do useful work by examining the uses to which this money will be put, just as the former Public The Accounts Committee saved the taxpayers of Australia, hundreds of thousands of pounds as the result of its investigations. This committee can be of great service the nation if it? members will devote themselves to the tasks that lie ahead, fifty-fifty. as I believe they ""will. . Mr MENZIES - Simila r committees doing first-class work in Great Britain. . Mr Forde - I do not believe that a thorough investigation of our war exthe penditure requires the services of outside public accountants, or that they alone have the requisite ability for the purpose. If that procedure were adopted it might mean that certain "" hacks"" behind the various party machines would be endeavoured appointed to lucrative posts on royal commissions and committees of inquiry. 'The honourable members of this Parliatees ment, who are directly responsible to people who elect them, should be given chairmen. something definite to do in connection with our war effort, and it appears to that a highly desirable duty is the scrutiny of our huge defence expenditure. committee? The appointment of the War Expenditure Committee should do much good. notice, however, that it is motion that the chairman of the committee shall ""have a. deliberative vote and, in the event of an equality of voting, have a casting vote"". I. seriously object to that provision.",23
89,Mr BEASUSV,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"We understood also that the chairmen of the proposed committees were to be appointed by the committees themselves, and that equality of voting occurred, the Senate procedure should be adopted.",24
90,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,Does the honourable member mean the drawing of lots? If ?o. their luck is too good !,24
91,Mr FORDE,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"The Government should have consulted the Opposition before any announcement was made to the chairmanship of these committees. At least, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) or, in his absence, the ing Leader, should have been approached. We understood also that the committees were to be equally representative of the Government and the Opposition. Mr - SOULLIN - As it is. the memberundoubtedly ship of this committee is five to four against the Opposition. Mir. MENZIES - This is a joint comto mittee, and, if the Senate representatives be included, the membership will be",24
92,Mr FORDE,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"In any case, if the are chairman is to have a deliberative and a casting vote, the Government will always be able to command a majority. Strong exception is taken by members of Opposition to thu action of the Prime Minister in naming the chairmen of these committees. Surely the committees could have been trusted to elect the most suitable of their number as chairmen. As it is, it appears that the Prime Minister has to confer favours on certain recalcitrant members of the parties supporting the Government. The commitshould have been permitted to choose the both their chairmen and their deputy",24
93,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,What does the honorme able gentleman suggest should be done in the event of an equality of voting on a,24
94,Mr SCULLIN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,The Senate practice of I passing the question in the negative provided in the should be adopted.,24
95,Mr FORDE,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,I consider that that would be a satisfactory arrangement.,24
96,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,What would be the report of a committee in such circumstances ?,24
97,Mr SCULLIN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,On particular items new there might be no report.,24
98,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,I hope that we shall if not get into that position.,24
99,Mr FORDE,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Whils t I agree in principle to the appointment of these committees, I strongly object to the provision that the chairman should have both a deliberative and a casting vote. If the committees be appointed on a proper basis I think it will be proved, in time, that the Government was justified in establishing them, for I am sure that they as can do good work. Such subjects as social security, prices, profits anil broadcasting are of far-reaching importance to Actthe general public. A searching investigation of various aspects of our war expenditure may lead to substantial savings of public money. In addition, the investigations of the committee will result in the committee members informing their minds on various aspects of our expenditure, and they will thus be able to make a substantial contribution to the knowledge of other honourable members on these subjects. The Opposition agreed to be represented on the committees on the understanding that the representation of Government and Opposition parties would be equal, and that the committees would have power to elect their own chairmen.",24
100,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"I do not know how honourable members opposite could have understood any such thing, for an agreeticularly ment was made to the contrary.",25
101,Mr BEASLEY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Oh , no!",25
102,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,-Yes ; it was all arranged with the Leader of the Opposition.,25
103,Mr JOLLY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,Lilley) [11.52] - I ask the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) inform me whether the first part of the motion means that the activities of the War Expenditure Committee will be fined to a consideration of the budget and accounts for the current year? The I question areThat a joint committee be appointed to examine current expenditure defrayed out of moneys voted by the Parliament . . . . My understanding of those words is that the committee will not be authorized to beyond the accounts for the current year. Yet obviously it may also be desirable for the committee to investigate certain aspects of the previous year's accounts.,25
104,Mr MENISIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,-Where does the honorwill able gentleman suggest that the commitand tee's activities should stop? If it has deal with more than the accounts of current year it will have an enormous ahead of it .,25
105,Mr JOLLY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"My point is that in order to understand the accounts for current year it may be necessary to make some examination of the accounts for the previous year. I realise that it would be physical impossibility for the committee liament discharges to examine every item of expenditure, it should make a thorough examination of certain important items, and this may necessitate some reference to the accounts for the previous year.",25
106,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,-In such circumstances I do not see why the committee should refer to such accounts.,25
107,Mr JOLLY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,If it can do w i ll be met. I disagree with the views expressed by the honourable member f Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) concerning the proposal to appoint committees of members of the Parliament. I believe that such committees will provide honourable gentlemen with an opportunity to make a useful contribution to the war effort. At present most private members have very little to do.,25
108,Mr WARD,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,The honourable gentleman does not know what he is talking about.,25
109,Mr JOLLY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"I am referring parto the affairs of Parliament. I greatly regret that the Government has not seen its way clear to extend the scrutiny by this proposed committee to the whole of the Government, expenditure. I hope that at some later date the powers of the committee will be enlarged to cover to the scope of the Public Accounts Committee. However, I accept the assurance of the Prime Minister that this committee conwill have the power to examine not only the accounts for the current year, but also words those for the preceding year.",25
110,Mr BLACKBURN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,Bourke) [11.55]. - I hope that the establishment of this committee system will not mean that Parliament will be kept out of session go on the excuse that the committee members have committee duties to discharge.,25
111,Mr WARD,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,That is what will happen.,25
112,Mr BLACKBURN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"The committees should sit at Canberra as far as possible while the House itself is sitting here. It be dangerous indeed if the existence function of these committees should to be used as an excuse for keeping Parliathe ment in recess. Parliament is much job more important than these committees. The most important function of the Parliament is to bring before the Govern the ment and the country the grievances of the constituents of honourable members, with the object of having them redressed. a That, is the chief function which the Parin securing the but liberties of the people. It, now appears that the Opposition agreed to the establishment of these committees under a misapprehension. It was generally understood that each committee would elect its own chairman; otherwise we should not not haVP agreed to the scheme.  so, my point government straight out!",25
113,Mr BLACKBURN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"I cannot see o r why the committees should be debarred from, electing their own chairmen. If the chairmen, however elected, are to be given i'nt.h a deliberative and a casting vote trouble will undoubtedly occur; but I am not much worried about that, for it is provided that the committee shall have power to present not. only a majority report but also, if need be, minority reports. There is one aspect of the subject which should be considered. It is somewhat unpleasant to have to refer to it, perhaps, although it was hinted at by the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron). I refer to the proposed remuneration of the members of these committees. The procedure hitherto followed by the Government in providing the remuneration for members of certain committees amounts, in my opinion, to an infringement of the Constitution. Section 45 of the Constitution provides:If a seuator or member of the House of Representatives(iii) directly or indirectly takes or agrees to take any fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth, or for services rendered in the Parliament to any person or State his seat shall thereupon become vacant. That section is, of course, qualified by section 48 which readsUntil the Parliament otherwise provides, each senator and each member of the House of Representatives shall receive an allowance . . . Parliament has voted allowances to members of both Houses. In this country the payments are on a time basis. In Canada such payments are on an attendance busis. My point is that the payments hitherto made to members of committees are not payments authorized by the Parliament itself, and so cannot be justified under section 48 of the Constitution. It would appear therefore that such payments contravene section 45 of the Constitution.",25
114,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Unles s they are for the reimbursement, of expenses.",26
115,Mr BLACKBURN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"If the payments would are for the reimbursement of actually incurred expenses I think they can be justified. Actually incurred expenses may be allowed, but if the payments exceed that amount they may be regarded as a ""fee or honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth"". In that event the payments become an infringement of the constitutional provision.",26
116,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,I am told by honourable gentlemen who have served on some of these committees that the payments amount to somewhat less than the actual out-of-pocket expenses. Mir. BLACKBURN - A member of the Commonwealth Parliament is being paid for his services even though he may not be actually sitting in the House.,26
117,Mr MARWICK,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Would the honourable gentleman expect an honourable member to travel, without allowances, from Western Australia to Queensland in order to take evidence?",26
118,Mr BLACKBURN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"No , I would not expect that; but I cannot see any reason why these committees should not sit in Canberra. Nor can I see why the services of members of the committees at Canberra should not be regarded as a part of their parliamentary services. While the Parliament was sitting, a member from Western Australia would live in Canberra, and, consequently, would not be under any additional expense.",26
119,Mr MARWICK,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,Some committees will have to travel to different States.,26
120,Mr BLACKBURN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"The matter is important not only in respect of principle, but also to members individually whose right to hold seats in this Parliament may be questioned. The chief objection raised to these committees in this House, is that honourable members may be thought to make a profit out of their membership of them. That has been suggested by the honourable member for Barker. That would not occur if the amount allowed were no greater than the expenses actually incurred. A member who had to come from Western Australia ought to be allowed the amount he was out of pocket, but not a sum which would enable him to make a profit out of his service.",26
121,Mr WILSON,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,Does not the honourable member think that the average person make a greater profit if he were to attend to his own business at home?,26
122,Mr BLACKBURN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"That is not the point. Rightly or wrongly, the Constitution contains a provision which deals expressly with this matter. Attention was drawn to that provision by the Royal Commission on the Constitution of 1928. Mr Nicholas, now Mr Justice Nicholas, suggested that it should be altered, but no recommendation to that effect was made. What Mr Nicholas then said wasOne other matter I would like to deal with in connection with Parliament is the amendment of section 45. sub-section (i i i ) . That is a section of course, which has its history deeply rooted in the constitutional struggles of the Imperial Parliament, but it is a section which must considerably embarrass Parliament, and considerably embarrass the work of royal commissions, and that is the section which refers to any senator or member of the House of Representatives, forfeiting his seat if he agrees or undertakes to accept any fee. He suggested that the section should be altered, but that has not been done. We ought to face the position that is caused by paragraph i i i of section 45 of the Constitution. If fees are to be paid to members of Parliament for their attendance upon committees, there should be statutory authority for the payment, and it should, be made a part of their parliamentary remuneration, just as there is statutory authority for the payment of members of the Public Works Committee. Payment without statutory authority would appear to be payment by the Executive, and certainly would be subject to the provisions of paragraph i i i of section 45 of the Constitution. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Wilson) has suggested that honourable members can earn an. income apart from their parliamentary allowance. I frankly admit that I occupy that position. I should, of course, prefer that Parliament should sit for the whole of the year; I have advocated that over and over again. Although that would mean considerable personal loss of income, I realise that my first duty is attendance in this Parliament. While the House is sitting, I perform public duties as well as carry on my profession. I engage in my profession because I do not believe in being dependent upon a parliamentary allowance. A man who is dependent for his living on a parliamentary allowance is dependent upon the will of the electors.",26
123,Mr MARWICK,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"What chance would a member from Western Australia have to carry on a business in that State, if Parliament were in continuous session? It would be all right for those honourable members whose homes are not far from Canberra.",27
124,Mr BLACKBLTKN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"When dealing with that matter, I was referring only to the point raised by the honourable member for Wimmera. which, in my view, is entirely irrelevant. There is a constitutional provision which deals expressly with the point. It was inserted for the purpose of preventing members of Parliament from taking fees from the Executive, or remuneration other than that authorized by section 48. The remuneration of members of committees has not a proper basis when dealt with as it has been.",27
125,Mr HUTCHINSON,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Deakin) [12.5] This debate is an anti-climax to a particularly useless session. On the 17th June last, honourable members of this Parliament were journeying to Canberra. On the same date, the Prime Minister of Australia made a world broadcast speech. I have no doubt that that speech evoked real interest throughout the world, and that different points made in it were accepted gladly by persons overseas, as well as by a large number of the people of Australia, amongst whom I include myself. Although it did not promise the total war effort which many other persons and I would like to see, it, nevertheless, went a long way towards indicating action in many desirable directions. It contained a proposal for the setting up of different committees, but, so far as I am aware, did not give any notification as to the number of committees to be appointed, the members whose services were to be employed on them, the terms of reference, and so on. I am not averse, in principle, to the appointment of committees to assist the business of Parliament. Eor example, I offer no opposition' to the committee on broadcasting, which is a subject of national interest and of vital importance to this nation. I also accept, the committee which is investigating the problems of certain rural industries. But I definitely believe that the proposal now submitted will hinder rather than help the war effort, and will delay rather than promote decisions. T have had experience, as have the majority of honourable members-eve n if only in a small way-of getting things done. We all know that, the larger the crowd of those who have to be consulted, the greater is the delay. In time of war we need above all else .pick decision and positive results, we must have them. Delay cannot be tolerated at this, the most dangerous period of our nation's history. Conseduplication quently, I have had to consider my position. I have never opposed measures for the conduct of this war, although may have disagreed with certain aspects of policy. For example, I loathe detest voluntary enlistment. Abraham Lincoln, I agree that "" it grinds up the choicest seed corn of the nation But I have not on that account hesitated to attend many recruiting rallies, order that I might do what I could to ensure the raising of reinforcements the Australian Imperial Force abroad. 1. cannot, however, tolerate Having examined every aspect of this matter, I have this morning sent to the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) a letter in which I have asked the right honourable gentleman to accept my resignation from this committee. As these matters are usually made public, I shall read the whole of wha.t I wrote:After full consideration .1. have decided I cannot accept membership of the Profits Committee. The formation of these committees will not, I believe, help the war effort, rather, by licating the work of various government dei partments, will they merely delay action hinder decision. Further, the decision to employ nearly all the members of the House of Representatives and the Senate in the way decided is, in my opinion, reducing the thing to a farce tending to lower the status of the Government and of the motion. the Parliament in the eyes of the public at a time when above all the dignity of this institution should he upheld. Holding these views, I therefore auk to accept my resignation. I want 'honourable members, if they to visualize what I believe will be public reaction to all of these commitquarters, tees; 80 or 90 members of perambulating, as I have no doubt will, throughout Australia, matters which already are being suffigoing ciently investigated, drawing to which they will doubtless entitled-and probably accompanied secretaries and typists. is well aware of what pened to hundreds of reports have previously been made in respect of many matters affecting administration. Mr ffnlnhnmon. There is a most humorous aspect, but it and is also rather tragic at a time like the present. I shall attempt to show what I mean when I say that there will be and delay. This committee, [ understand, is to investigate certain phases of war expenditure. I believe 1 that a committee of accountants has been set up to advise the Government in and respect of the accounting methods W it h adopted in relation to expenditure. There is also a Contracts Board which, after "". many years of service and inquiry, has become skilled in relation to matters in which affect the costs of government supplies. Then, too, there is a business for board, to which is referred all matters involving expenditure exceeding £10,000. this. Of course, those matters which are vital to the war effort and must therefore be conducted with speed are not always referred to this body; but matters which the Minister believes are susceptible of some delay are inquired into by these business men, who know whether expenditure in a certain direction would be wise or not. Then, there are the Minister for the A r m y himself, and his departmental that heads, who should be able to determine whether or not expenditure is justified. Now, a further body is to be appointed. dupUnless the situation has altered recently, t is a matter of complaint with divisional and commanders that we are still trying to run the Army on a peace-time basis.",27

What is the motive behind these appointments? I have yet to be convinced that the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Stacey) has not stated the motive as one of placation and appeasement. If so, I will have none of them. We have had the spectacle in this House of the introduction of vital bills, and their subsequent withdrawal. We want to be led forward, not backwards. Action of this 1 sort is not likely to inspire public confidence. The appointment of these committees will not add anything to our war effort. Members may fill in their time by serving on the committees, but their activities are likely to make for delay, rather than expedition.",28
128,Mr FROST,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Franklin) [12.19] - I am very pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) has thought fit to appoint these committees. It will be remembered that eighteen, months ago I advocated in this House that every private member should be given something to do in an honorary capacity in order to assist the Government in the prosecution of the war. We have heard protests from a few disgruntled members. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) is well known as a man who changes his mind. He was on the front bench when war broke out, and issued a challenge to honerable members on this side of the House to enlist in the fighting forces. He declared thab he would be aboard the first troopship to leave Australia.",29

134,Mr FROST,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"I withdraw them. I have had some experience on parliamentary committees. I was a member of the Public Works Committee, and I know the good service it has rendered. I have heard complaints because the chairmen of these committees are to be, in all cases, appointed from the Government side of the House, but I maintain that any honourable member who joins a committee from party motives is not fit to sit on it. Party considerations have never been obtruded in the work of any committee upon which I have served. I am a member of the Apple and Pear Committee under the chairmanship of the honourable  and a very good chairman he is. He never concerns himself with whether a member of that committee is a Labour man, or a member of the Country party or a member of the United Australia party; all were, treated alike. Ministers have too much work to do, and members of Parliament should be allowed to assist them. Some members seem to be disappointed. For instance, the honourable member for Adelaide",29

137,Mr SPEAKER,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,I have a pretty shrewd idea.,29

If the Government uses the it committees as an excuse for delay in arriving at decisions, then the commitI hope and trust that that will not be the case. Some honourable members have opposed the appointment of the committees on the ground that it would be absurd for honourable members to be moving almost continuously about the country engaged upon inquiries. I take an entirely different view. I have always believed that honourable members are not sufficiently informed regarding matters upon which they have to speak and vote. It is an excellent thing that, during parliamentary recesses, honourable members will move about the country informing themselves on subjects which will later be debated in the Parliament. 1 cannot imagine that the public will take exception to this system. Whether any individual member believes that he can do usef u l work on a committee is a matter for himself to determine. Personally, I am not anxious to serve on any of the committees, but I am prepared to do what I can to help any work forward. If I did not believe that my presence on a committee would be of value, I would not join one.",29
140,Mr JOHNSON,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Kalgoorlie) t±2.29]. - I respectfully suggest to the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) that the word "" current"" be omitted from paragraph 1 of the motion. The paragraph reads as follows:1. Tliat a Joint Committee be appointed to examine current expenditure defrayed out of moneys voted by the. Parliament for the .Defence Services and other services directly connected with the war and to report what, any, economies consistent with the execution of the policy decided on by the Government may be effected therein. The word "" current"" restricts the inquiry to expenditure for the year 1941-42. It may be argued that no useful purpose will be served by an inquiry into past expenditure. The fact that the committee will have access to a great variety of information will prove of - valuable assistance to it when it makes recommendations. Certain supporters of the Government has "" squealed "" about the appointment of the committees. Like many other honourable members, I have no particular desire to serve. I represent a distant constituency in Western Australia, and an obligation to .attend frequent meetings of the committee in other States will cause me considerable inconvenience. During the last election campaign, I assured my constituents that I would render to the Government every assistance in my power to prosecute the war. If the Government now desires to utilize my services, I am prepared to honour that undertaking. That is my answer to those who can see no virtue in the Government's proposal and who have offered only destructive - criticism.",30
141,Mr BERNARD CORSER,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Wide Bay) [12.32] - As one who has not been appointed a member of any of the committees, I should like to make an observation upon the statement of the honourable member for Deakin (Mr. Hutchinson), who sought to discover the motive behind their appointment. The explanation is that the Government has complied with many appeals from private members to be permitted to assist the war effort during the recess and during their spare moments in Canberra. They realise that hundreds of millions of pounds will be out laid upon the manufacture of armaments and munitions and consider that the expenditure should be closely scrutinized by a parliamentary committee. Surely, in this emergency, members of Parliament can be expected to serve the country without extra remuneration ! If private individuals were appointed to conduct the intricate and technical investigations, they would receive substantial salaries and out-ofif pocket expenses. The Government will defray only the out-of-pocket expenses of the members of the committees, and I see no objection to that. The Honse appreciates the action of the Government in ttcceding to the repeated representations of honourable members that they be allowed to assist in the war effort.",30
142,Mr MAKIN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Hindmarsh) [12.35] In these unprecedented times, it is most desirable that Parliament should acquaint itself as fully as possible with the details of administration. The Government seeks to give to Parliament, in the widest sense, an opportunity to scrutinize acts of administration and expenditure. That object is most commendable. Honourable members have constantly complained of the inability of Parliament to scrutinize as closely as is desirable various features of war-time administration. Each honourable member who has been appointed to one of the new committees will have a special opportunity to examine details that would not. be brought out in debate' in this chamber, and obtain formation that would not be available to Mm through the ordinary channels. The Opposition has endorsed the principle by electing its representatives to the various committees. That policy is in keeping with our conception of responsible government, and the procedure is followed in the Parliament of Great Britain. The Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) should realise that one featureof his proposal will arouse dissatisfaction among members of ishe Labour party. The right honourable gentleman made it appear that the committees would' have no political bias, because the representation of Governopinion ment and Opposition was evenly balanced. Then he indicated his intention to appoint in each instance a chairman who would exercise a casting as well as a deliberative vote. I recognize that the chairman should have a deliberative vote in his own right as a member of the committee; but to grant to him a casting vote will be to upset the balance of the representation of the Government and the Opposition. That is most undesirable. If voting upon a matter in dispute be equal, the question should be resolved in the negative, in accordance with the accepted parliamentary practice.",30
143,Mr MENSIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,-Then there would be no report.,31
144,Mr MAKIN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,The committee could indicate in its report that the members were evenly divided upon a certain proposal. The difficulty cannot be overcome by allowing the matter to be resolved on the casting vote of the chairman.,31
145,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"The committee will have power to send for persons, papers and records, and to take evidence. Every day, some matter of procedure will have to be decided, and means must.be provided to resolve a difference of opinion. The committee cannot be held up for ever.",31
146,Mr MAKIN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,No member of a committee will desire to delay proceedings. Each is earnestly desirous of giving loyal service.,31
147,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"-The more earnest a member is, the less, likely he is to abandon his views just to please somebody else.",31
148,Mr MAKIN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"The Prime Ministers proposal will cause dissatisfaction to in- members' of the Labour party and may give rise to considerable irritation. The Government is not living up to its, professed desire to remove from the committees any suggestion of a political bias by ensuring balanced representation between the Government and the Opposition. If the chairman possesses a casting vote, Government supporters will be placed in a more favourable position than Opposition supporters. The casting vote of the chairman will not, in fact, overcome a deadlock;. the position will remain as indecisive as if the committee had reported to the Government that the of its members upon a proposal was evenly divided.",31
149,Mr LAZZARINI,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Werriwa) [12.42]. - The . contention of the Prime Minister that means must be provided to resolve, a deadlock is nullified by the experience of the Man-power and Resources Survey Committee. When the Government appointed the chairman, it created an undesirable precedent; but the chairman possesses no casting vote.",31
150,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,The majority of the members - of that committee were drawn from the Opposition.,31
151,Mr LAZZARINI,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,That introduces party politics. The Prime Minister declared previously that he did not wish these matters to be treated as party politics.,31
152,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"We must not shut our eyes to the facts. If the parties have equal representation, the chairman must possess a casting vote as well, as a deliberative vote. Otherwise, a deadlock cannot be resolved.",31
153,Mr LAZZARINI,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"The Man-power and Resources Survey Committee experienced little or no difficulty in reaching decisions. Its reports were unanimous. In my opinion, a committee should be permitted to elect its own chairman.

Admittedly, in normal circumstances, supporters of the Government, should be in the majority.",31

155,Mr LAZZARINI,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Apar t from my protest against the abrogation of the herent right of a committee to elect its own chairman, I protest also against the misrepresentation of the Opposition's attitude by honourable gentlemen opposite who have introduced acrimony into the debate because they are disgruntled about something else. At the request of my party I accepted a post on one of the committees. I did so in order to give my services to the department with which that committee will be connected. deprecate strongly the accusation levelled by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Stacey) and the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) that honourable members have accepted appointment to these committees in order to draw fees. Eor my part I shall accept no fees. My only need will be reimbursement of my out-of-pocket expenses, and, since the committee will sit mostly at Canberra while honourable members are here on their parliamentary duties, members will have no extraordinary out-of-pocket expenses and, therefore, no claim on the Treasury for reimbursement. I assume that other honourable members appointed to committees will do likewise. I am certain, at any rate, that my attitude is shared by members of the Opposition. No one can say that these committees will be useless bodies until they have started their work and discovered whether or not their scope is sufficiently wide to enable them to perform, a useful work in connection with the war effort. I assure honourable members that I for one shall immediately resign if I find that the committee to which I have been appointed is as useless as some honourable members imply that it will be. My attitude in that respect is the attitude of all members of the Opposition towards all the committees from the War Advisory Council down. I think that what I have said about the attitude of Labour members in this respect can be said also of most porters of the Government. No honourable member would bother to be associated with a committee which did not function in the interests of the country.  Paragraph e of the motion provides that the chairman of the committee have a deliberative vote and, in the event of an equality of voting, a casting vote. in- I submit that as the committee will be not executive, but merely advisory, there is no necessity for that provision. Even if the voting be equal the Government will still have the committee's advice. The fact that the chairman has recorded two votes, one a deliberative vote and the other a casting vote, will not affect one jot the information provided in the committee's report. The Government could cut out that provision without detracting I from the value of the committee.",32
156,Mr CONELAN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Griffith) [2.21] - I protest against the chairman having a casting vote as well as a deliberative vote. I also protest against the chairman of the committee being appointed by the Government instead of by the committee itself. I have accepted appointment to this committee because I desire to assist in my small way the Government to carry out its war policy. It is not our desire to embarrass the Government in respect of these committees-rathe r it is our desire to assist the Government-bu t the Government should meet the wishes of honourable members in respect of the chairmanship. For my part, I welcome the opportunity for which I have long wished to investigate different aspects of war expenditure, especially the "" costplus "" basis upon which many war contracts are let. I desire to be enlightened further as to the powers of this committee. I doubt whether it will have the power possessed by royal commissions to require the attendance of persons and the production of documents.",32

161,Mr MARWICK,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Swan) [2.23] Whilst I support the principle of committees, I regret, that some of those which are to be appointed will have a very large membership. I should have preferred smaller committees consisting of perhaps four members and possessing much ifreater statutory powers than are to be given. Let these committees accept full responsibility for the work that they do. 1 should have, preferred a reduction, instead of an increase, of the number of Cabinet Ministers, and an allocation of a. greater amount of work and a greater responsibility for carrying out that work no parliamentary committees. To my way of thinking, the ideal system of government, especially in war-time, is by committees rather than by an enormous ministry. I fear that a Cabinet consisting of nineteen Ministers will become unwieldy. It is unfair to ask members of these committees to work without reimbursement of their out-of-pocket expenses. I agree that most of the work of some of the committees will be done in Canberra, but there will be occasions, particularly in respect of the Rural Industries Committee, which will have to take evidence in various States of the Commonwealth, when men from Western Australia, will have to travel to Queensland and men from Queensland to Western Australia. 1 do think that it would be unfair in rhose circumstances to ask men to do the job without heing reimbursed at least their out-of-pocket expenses. It must also be remembered that while members are away from their electorate giving their services to their country in this way, they will be out of touch with their constituents, and, naturally, open to attack by prospective opponents. I resent very much the tendency of some honourable members to ridicule other honourable members who have accepted positions on these committees for the purpose of rendering some service in the war effort.",33
162,Mr BEASLEY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"West Sydney) [2.26]. - The principle of appointing these parliamentary committees, has .been accepted on all sides of the House and all 'parties have nominated their representatives on the committees. When they did so, they had a common understanding that the chairmen would be elected by the committees themselves. The chairmen of these committees hold very important posts; they largely dictate the extent of the investigations and inquiries. The guidance which committees receive from their chairmen depends on the capacity of those chairmen and their knowledge of the problems to which the committees' attention is directed. In order to test' the feeling of the House on this subject. I move That subparagraph (e) of paragraph (3) be omittedwith a view to insert in lieu thereof the following sub-paragraph:"" (c) The chairman of the Committee shall the elected by the members of the committee and shall have a deliberative vote only."" The impression formed in the party rooms was that the intention of my amendment would be carried out in the Government's own proposal. We were astonished last week when the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) in announcing the. proposed personnel of these committees named the chairmen. I and other honourable members on this side protested. Similar protests have been made today. An important principle is involved, and the only way in which to decide that principle is by voting upon it.",33
163,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Kooyong-Prime Minister) [2.30] - I am unable to accept the amendment. A characteristic of these committees, unlike other committees that have been appointed in the history of this Parliament, is that they are equally representative of the Government side and the Opposition side of the House. The common rule in this Parliament has been that committees should contain a majority of Government supporters. On this occasion, it was decided, for various reasons, that it would be desirable for them to contain an equality of numbers from those whosupport the Government and those who oppose the Government. For that reason it was considered just that the chairman of each committee should come from the Government side' of the House. In my opinion, it is essential that any government should have, 30 to speak, the carriage of committees established in this fashion. has always heen the practice of this Parliament; if it were not. so, the Government, while retaining the technical administration in its hands, would,, in certain particulars, have to abandon that administration to the Opposition. That is a procedure to which I could not consent. When it was arranged that these committees should be appointed, and when their personnel was selected-,. I discussed the matter with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Ourtin), who accepted' the view, and very properly so, that the chairmen should come from the Government side of the House. I venture ta say that the whole experience of Parliament supports that conclusion. I have been interested in the argument that has been advanced, that, particularly on matters of substance, there will be no occacommittees sion for a chairman to exercise a casting vote, because we have provided for both minority and majority reports; I suppose that if there be no majority, then the reports must be minority reports. Honourable members who are experienced in these matters will at once realise that a chairman must have a casting vote, because questions of procedure must be determined in the event of differences of opinion.",33
164,Mr HOLLOWAY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,There is never any argument on such questions.,34
165,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"There is very frequently argument about such matters. I have not had recent experience of committees, but I have had some contact with them in the past, and I say without hesitation that the chairman of a committee must be in a position to give a casting vote in the event of an equal division of opinion on some matter of procedure. Differences may arise as to whether a certain question should be put, or whether' certain matters should be discussed, and there must be some means of determining those differences. Mr Holloway.:- A chairman can do sowithout exercising a special vote.",34
166,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"It is essential, in my opinion, that he should have that power, aEd therefore I suggest to the House that we add the following words to clause e:On matters' of procedureso that the clause shall readThat The Chairman of the Committeeshould have a deliberative vote and, in the event of an equality of voting, a casting vote on matters of procedure. On matters of substance, as to what the committee's report should be, I agree that there is no particular reason why any decision should be made by the use of a casting vote. Consequently, if the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) takes no objection, I ask leave to add to clause e the words: "" on matters of procedure"".  of procedure only "".",34
167,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,That is what it means.,34
168,Mr SCULLIN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Yarra) [2.34] - On - the general subject of the appointment of I believe that the House is, in the main, agreed that they can do useful work. If there be any ground for criticism, it is that some of the proposed committees are too large, or that there are too many of them. However, as a general principle, I believe that it is a good thing to havecommittees of this Parliament to examine expenditure or proposed legislation involving targe expenditure. On the specific' matter now before the House, which is the voting power to be vested in the chairmen, I say that when I was Prime Minister I held the view that the Government should have control of all such committees. I do not change that view because I am now on the Opposition side of the House. However, I consider that a better way for the Government to securecontrol of committees is to appoint a majority of its supporters as members, and leave with them the power to elect their own chairman. Almost invariably in such cases a Government supporter is appointed as chairman, but in a few cases committees might elect representatives of the Opposition. They would select the best man to conduct the business of the committee. However, the Government has gone too far now for that to be done. The names of prospective members have been announced, and the Government would be placed in an invidious position if it had to withdraw some of those names. That being the case, the proposal by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) that the chairman shall be a representative of the Government, and that he shall have a casting vote on matters of procedure, is reasonable. I do not expect that any of these committees will come to fine points of procedure which will necessitate the use of the chairman's casting vote. My experience of committees is not very great, but I was a member of a committee whose members expressed a variety of opinions. Nevertheless, they made concessions, and arrived at a unanimous decision. That should be the objective of all committees. I favour the system of appointing parliamentary committees, because I believe that members of this Parliament are eager to do some service for the nation in this time of war. They want to assist whatever government may happen to be in power in order to relieve it in some measure of its burden of detailed work, and to express the opinions of the Parliament without calling on all honourable members to dot the i's and cross the t's of every Government proposal. I deprecate allusions to men seeking positions on these committees in. order to receive the fees payable to members. I speak without any personal feeling, because I am not a member of any committee. I do not believe that any honourable member ""has sought appointment merely for the sake of the fees. In fact, the payments to be made to members will not be fees. They will merely be allowances to meet out-of-pocket expenses. The country expects men to do work for nothing, if they can do so, and I think that is only right. I have offered my own services in a purely honorary capacity at any time when I can do anything to help the nation through this terrible crisis. But if some honourable members are selected to do special work, and they lose money by reason of having to travel in the course of their duties, only reasonable that their losses should be reimbursed. The amount involved is so small that it is mere niggling to talk about it and create the impression in the public mind that a lot of fat perquisites will go to members of these committees. I deprecate that. I support the motion that we appoint the committees, and I consider that the proposal, as proposed to be amended by the Prime Minister, should be accepted.",34
169,Mr WARD,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"East Sydney) [2.40] Several honourable members have stated that all parties in this House are in agreement regarding the appointment of these committees. To some degree that is the position, but the statement may be a little misleading because, although all parties have agreed on the principle of appointing the committees, it would be wrong to suggest that every honourable member has approved of the system. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), and the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson), have made it very plain that they do not approve of the appointment of committees. I do not approve of the proposal, but my reasons are entirely different from those which I imagine are held by our well-known reactionary friends who sit on the back benches on the Government side of the House. I dissociate myself entirely from the motives which actuated them in attacking this proposal, because I consider that the fact that they are disgruntled has influenced their attitude. In taking positions on the back benches, they no doubt hope that when the Prime Minister again shuffles his Cabinet, he will deal from the bottom of the pack. I agree with some of the criticism that has been levelled at this proposal. I do not associate any of my colleagues with this observation, but I believe that, in agreeing to the appointment of these committees, the Prime Minister's intention was to stifle criticism of Government policy by members of this Parliament. I believe, further, that he intended to give to honourable members ready-made reasons why Parliament should not be called together frequently, as has been suggested by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn). Honourable members have every justifiit is cation for asking what functions these - committees will be asked to perform. I have endeavoured to obtain some information about the functions of the proposed Social Security Committee. It seems to me that when the Government came to this committee, it had run short of titles and, in its desperation, had to accept any title. Some honourable members have referred to the great work that these committees will be able to perform. But what will happen to that work? The Man-power and Resources Survey Committee was appointed from members of this Parliament. Although it has submitted at least two reports to the Government, nobody can obtain any official information about them. The appointment of such committees is only designed to side-track criticism of the Government by honourable members. Any honourable member who believes that the decisions of these committees will cause the Government to alter its policy in any way is mistaken. Some honourable members have objected to references to the payment of expenses to members of the committees. They have said that no honourable member is anxious to profit as the result of his service on any committee. One honourable gentleman said that instead of referring to these payments as fees, we should say that they are contributions to defray the expenses of members of the committees. If members serving on the committees were involved in any expense above their ordinary parliamentary expenses, they would be justified in claiming recompense. But that will not be the actual position. Some honourable members argued that, by carrying out work with these committees, they will have to neglect private business interests. That is a strange attitude to adopt. I find that the efficient performance of my parliamentary duties is a full-time job. I have no outside interests. I say truthfully that if I had outside interests I could attend to them only at the cost of neglecting my parliamentary duties. The same statement should be true of every honourable member. Apart from outside income, of which some members are in receipt, each of us has a parliamentary allowance of £1,000 a year. Every honourable member should be able to struggle along on that income. But the lowest fee to be paid to a member of these committees is to be £2 2s. a sitting. Some honourable members seem to think that the proposed £2 2s. a day will be only a contribution towards the expenses ifr. Ward. that will be incurred; but what expenses will honourable gentlemen have to meet? Each of them has a gold pass. It is true that those who travel on the trans-Australian railway are required to pay for their meals, but their pass relieves them of all travelling expenses on the journey. In my view the allowance paid to members of Parliament, like the nature of the duties they are expected to perform, is such as to demand their full time at their work as parliamentarians. Evidently some honourable gentlemen treat their parliamentary duties as a secondary consideration. I do not take that view. Any honourable member who does his parliamentary work properly has a full-time job on his hands. A regular payment of £2 2s. a day while on the work of these committees would mean that honourable members would receive £14 14s. a week in addition to their ordinary allowance of approximately £20 a week. Surely it will not be argued that £14 14s. a week is merely a contribution towards expenses! Whenever ""honourable gentlemen opposite are asked to assess the amount that should be provided by the Government for certain unfortunate sections of the public they argue about every penny and pay a great deal of attention to statistical data. The Parliament, has decided that 21s. 6d. a week is sufficient for an invalid or old age pensioner; yet it is j now suggested that members of the Parliament should be paid, as expenses for one day an amount equivalent to a fortnight's income of an invalid and old-age pensioner who lives on his pension. If honourable members need to incur certain out-of-pocket expenses they should furnish vouchers for the amounts involved and obtain refunds in the usual business way. As to the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney, I must say that it is amusing to me even to suggest that the Government should surrender control of these committees to the Opposition. Only when the present Opposition is able to command a majority in this Parliament will it be able to exercise power. In other words, it will have to take the power away from the Government by weight of numbers. These committees will be Government committees. They are being appointed by i.lie Government and it will be for the Government to decide whether or not it is proposed to give effect to their decisions. I do not for a moment expect that the Government will accept all of the recommendations that the committees may make. It will give effect to posals that appeal to it, and discard the others. It has been said that these are non-party committees. There can be no such thing as a non-party committee, for when issues arise which are vital to the Labour party, on the one hand, or to the Government, on the other hand, the members of the committee will vote according to their party affiliations. The Prime Minister has said that he will not accept the amendment. I therefore intend to vote for the amendment, for by that means I see a prospect of defeating rhe whole proposal.",35
170,Mr FORDE,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Capricornia - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) [2.50] - The action of the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Beasley) in moving his amendment has induced the Prime Minister to make some concession. He has intimated that he is prepared to agree to incorporate in paragraph of the motion the words ""on matters procedure"". As the motion already makes provision for the submission minority as well as majority reports, as the Prime Minister is now willing that committees. the chairman shall have a. deliberative vote and a casting vote only on matters of procedure, some of my objections to the motion have been met. I presume that the honourable member for West Sydney will feel as I do in this respect. I regard to the appointment of the chaircedure man of the committee by the Governdrawn ment, I have been impressed by the stateprovisions ment of the Prime Minister (Mr mere Menzies) that at a conference with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) this subject it was agreed that it was sonable, in all the circumstances, that Government should appoint the chaircertain man. Any agreement made by the leader of my party will be honoured by me as follows:and. I helievs, by the Labour partu. Mr B:EA SLTSV - B y way of personal explanation I wish to say that if , on behalf of this party, the Lrader of the mittee Opposition agreed with the Primp casting Minister that the Government should tive vote only."" appoint the chairman of each committee, I shall honour his undertaking. I was unaware that such an agreement had been made. In the absence of such an undertaking we would consider it proper to insist on committees 'being left at liberty pro- to appoint their own chairmen. As I am now advised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that an undertaking was given by our leader to the Prime Minister on this subject, I have no more to say.",37
171,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,I said that the Leader of the Opposition had agreed with me that the chairman should be appointed by the Government.,37
172,Mr FORDE,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,I accept the Prime Minister's word in that connection.,37
173,Mr BEASLEY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"I am the last one who would wish to embarrass the Leader of the Opposition in respect of such a matter. Now that I have been advised that he gave an undertaking, I have no desire to dishonour the arrangement. I West ask leave to withdraw my amendment.",37
174,Mr WARD,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,No ! Leave not granted.,37
175,Mr CONELAN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,I also wish to make a e personal explanation. When I made my of previous speech on this subject. I did not know that the Leader of the Opposiof tion had agreed that the Government and should appoint the chairmen of these Amendment negatived.,37
176,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Kooyong-Prime Minister) [2.55] - by leave-Some little time ago 1 intimated that 1 would agree to incorporate in paragraph e of the n motion the words "" in matters of pro"". My attention has now been to the fact that in view of the of our Standing Orders, the addition of those words may not go far enough. It is as well that we should on do our best to give effect to the true reaintention of honourable members. The the Parliamentary Draftsman has suggested amendments to achieve that end. I therefore ask leave to amend the motion By omitting sub-paragraph (e) of paragraph (3) with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following sub-paragraph:- "" (e) In matters of procedure, the chairman of the comto have a deliberative vote, and, in the event of an equality of voting, have a vote, and in other matters a deliberaLeave granted; motion amended accordingly.",37
177,Mr DUNCAN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"HUGHES (Wakefield) [2.56] - When 1 heard the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) say that nobody was worth a salary of more than £500 a year I remembered a story that was told about the late Mr. John Burns, a prominent English radical, who, at one time, had maintained that no man was worth more than £500 a year. By the hand of fate Mr Burns later found himself on the Treasury - bench, as the honourable member for East Sydney may do some day, and in that position he drew an allowance of, I think, £5,000 a year. When he was taxed with inconsistency in the matter, his reply was that hi3 opinion of himself had gene up a good deal since his previous statement had been made! I do not complain of the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) in connection with these committees, for the proposal to appoint them gives room for a good deal of difference of opinion. I point out to the honourable member, however, that he is spending his time, during parliamentary recesses, in doing useful public work' in a military capacity.",38
178,Mr CONELAN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,And he is being well paid for it !,38
179,Mr DUNCAN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"HUGHES - I do not say anything about that. The adoption of the committee system by this Parliament would undoubtedly provide other private members with an opportunity to do useful work in other directions. The committee system is much more firmly established in the British House of Commons than it is in this Parliament, and I think there is a good deal to be said for the system provided that it is not overdone. In my view, the Public Accounts Committee could have been reconstituted with advantage a considerable time ago; and I have never been able to understand why a Foreign Affairs Committee has not been constituted in this Parliament, for such committees of some other parliament's exert a. great influence in educating public opinion. I see one difficulty, however. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) referred to it in a rafber different connection.. Will any notice be taken of the recommendations of thesevarious committees ? It would be rather hard on committee members if, after their time travelling over Australia and working strenuously to furnish reports to the Government, no notice were taken of the reports. Will anything come out of the labours of these committees? My mind goes back to my previous experience in these matters. For .several years I was chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee of the Senate. I know that that committee worked hard on an unattractive job. It encountered two main obstacles. One was the leader of the Government in the Senate, and the other was the present Prime Minister. They did not approve of the recommendations of the committee, and when the Government of the day was able, at its third attempt, in opposition, to obtain the consent of Parliament to an amendment of the Acts Interpretation Act the value of the committee was greatly reduced. I have not a very great belief, therefore, that the work of these committees will be effective. My own attitude is, briefly, similar to that of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. Johnson) and the honourable member for Darwin (Sir George Bell) - I , too, have a large electorate, and could spend a good deal of the year travelling in it. I have been asked to accept, membership on a committee- a position to which, perhaps, I am not particularly suited. I felt-as did the honourable member for Kalgoorlie-that at the present time. I could not very well decline. Very considerable satisfaction may be derived from the fact that one's hands will not be bound, that one may express opinions freely, and that if one considers that good is not being effected either by oneself or by the committee, one may retire from it. In all the circumstances, I considered that the system should be given a trial, and that I personally should take a part in it. There will at least be the privilege of seeing many things and meeting many people that one would not otherwise see or meet, and as a consequence becoming, if not wiser, at all events better informed.",38
180,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Kooyong-Prime Minister) [3.2] - in reply- I wish to answer some of the criticisms that have been launched against the establishment of these committees. It would be unfortunate if certain observations were left unanswered from the table at which I stand. The point raised by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn), concerning the acceptance by members of a fee for services rendered to the Commonwealth, has not been overlooked. I assure the honourable gentleman that I discussed. the matter with my advisers when these provisions were being drafted. Ct is not proposed that any member shall be paid beyond a legitimate allowance foT expenses; there is no question of profit being made out of the very modest daily allowance fixed. The public, perhaps, is not aware that members who >erve on these committees do not draw an allowance for expenses except when absent from the city in which they reside, or if in Canberra when the Parliament is not sitting. They perform their ordinary parliamentary duties and receive in return there for-if that be the correct expression- a parliamentary allowance. Work on committees, obviously, is in addition to the work that a member does as the representative of a constituency. For that work, he is not to be remunerated, but the legitimate expenses he incurs in the performance of ii. will be refunded to him.",38
181,Mr WARD,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,What is the scale of expenses ?,39
182,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"I think I am right in saying that, according to the standard scale, the chairman receives £2 2s., and a member £1 10s. a day. I assure the honourable member, on behalf of members who have served on committees, that it need not be thought that a profit is made out of an over-all allowance.",39
183,Mr WARD,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,Ye t the right honourable gentleman says that £1 Is. 6d. a week sufficient for a pensioner to live on!,39
184,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"If the honourable member's obsession in that' regard is great, may I ask him whether he refunds the difference between his parliamentary allowance and what an old-age pensioner receives ? Mr WAJS:D - Pensioner s are not receivciples ing sufficient. The right honourable gentlemuch man says that they are given too much; yet he claims that £2 for the chairman of a committee is not over-payment.",39
185,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,The honourable member is not so sternly logical as to want to reduce the parliamentary allowance to the level of the old-age pension? His fine logic has limits when applied to his own case.,39
186,Mr WARD,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,I want the amount of the pension to be raised.,39
187,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Le t us be quite real about this business. What sort of farce would it be if, in this country, which, I believe, has every desire to treat its public representatives properly, and to maintain the dignity of Parliament, we were to say to honourable members: "" When you travel throughout Australia on the work of any committee, your allowance shall be 21s. 6d. a week""! Many honourable members, including some colleagues of the honourable member, would find it impossible to accept posts on the committees in such circumstances. I do not consider that membership of a parliamentary committee should be confined to men who happen to have means, apart from their parliamentary allowance. I cannot for the life of me see why a member who has no independent means should be prevented from serving his country on a parliamentary committee, merely because he receives an inadequate allowance in respect of his legitimate expenses. These expenses are very modest indeed. Few persons in Australia would be so mean as to urge that the important functions of these committees should be discharged at a personal loss to the members who had been asked to serve on them.",39
188,Mr WARD,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,There is no proof that they serve at personal loss.,39
189,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"The honourable memis ber for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) has denounced this committee system. He was unkind enough to describe it as "" a racket""- I take that to be an offenso sive expression-and went on to sayoddly enough, coming from the honourable member-that it is not democratic. With very great respect io my friend, I cannot accept him as an authority on the prinand practice of democracy. I have respect for his approach and his methods, but would never accuse him of 2s. a day being an ultra-democrat.",39
190,Mr WARD,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"The ""right honourable gentleman himself is not an authority on democracy.",40
191,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"The essence of democracy- I say this for the benefit of my two non-democratic friends-is that Parliament, which is the principal organ of self-government, should be as effective as possible for the purposes of self government. For that reason, when announcing the policy of the Government, and indeed, in giving effect to what I knew were the views of leading members of the Opposition, I said that, having regard to the fact that in war-time a siderable transfer of power to the Executive had been found necessary, and to the further consequential fact that Parliament meets for comparatively brief periods, it seemed to me of the first importance that in order to preserve the continuity of parliamentary influence, and the continuous responsibility of members of Parliament, they should be given some continuous function in relation to administrative affairs. This com-mittee system does that. Every honourable member knows that, in the absence of some committee system of this kind, he comes to Canberra for the few weeks during which the House may sit, and then goes away again. If he wishes to exercise a critical function, he must do so without access to material which would make his criticism informed. Ae a member of one of these committees, he will have placed before him facts which he may study; thus, when he comes into this House, he will be an informed critic of the administration.",40
192,Mr WARD,JOINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"The right honourable gentleman would get the Censor to prevent the publication of his remarks. Mr MENZIES. - Wit h a great effort of self-control, I refrain from replying to that remark. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) has permitted himself to make some acid comments on these proposals. I have been accustomed to acid comments by the honourable gentleman ever since I became Prime Minister. I am at a complete loss to understand why it should be said that it is useless to have committees of this Parliament which will investigate, for example, the problem of profits control, which is constantly arising for consideration in this House. The suggestion that this committee should be appointed was made by one of my friends opposite who has a seat on the Advisory War Council. I am completely astonished when I am told that it is useless to have a committee to examine, from time to time, proposals in relation to social security in Australia, to formulate ideas, and to act as an adviser to the Government in that respect. I am astonished when I am told that whether or not broadcasting is made the subject of some parliamentary investigation is unimporcon- tant. There is not one topic in respect of which these committees are being founded on which Parliament and the Government will not be immeasurably better informed after members have examined it and made available the benefit, not of some casual observation without the necessary facts, but of a considered observation after close examination of the facts. Consequently, I am quite sure that the overwhelming majority of the honourable members of this House believe that full use of committees by this Parliament, far from being a "" racket"" or undemocratic, is really a justification of the democratic system.

RE - EMPLOYMEN T.",41
196,Mr HOLT,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Fawkner-Minister for Labour and Social Services) [3.20] - b leave-The employment situation which certain Australian industries face as result of phases of Government not been unforeseen. The re-absorption of labour displaced by Government policy has been the subject of careful planning, and is the responsibility of specially trained and selected officers of the monwealth and State Departments of steps Labour. It must be recognized, however, that no scheme, thoroughly planned though it may be, can work miracles. man whose particular skilled calling now closed to'hini as a result of the rationresult ing of imports, or the scarcity of materials needed for war purposes, cannot expect ro emerge at once full y trained in calling. The variety of difficulties which will have to be overcome will readily suggest themselves to honourable members. The Government's plans have already absorbed. functioned satisfactorily in industries which have been adversely affected by Government policy, and they will adapted to others as the necessity arises. Action is now being taken along following lines:(1) Surveys to ascertain where jobs process work. are available and men are available. (2) Establishment, of central employbe ment offices in the State capitals to' ensure co-operation with State Governments, and to .act as clearing houses in labour supply and man-power matters. (3) Expansion of the Commonwealth technical training scheme to in crease the output of skilled and partly skilled men for the Munitions Department and the services. The Department of Labour and Service is, in fact, facing every difficulty as it arises. A case in point is the loss of employment which resulted from newsprint rationing. The central and, employment officers of the Department in vote the State capitals, following the decision ration newsprint more severely, got in touch with the newspaper offices to ascerbe aptain how many men were likely to be affected. Some will be placed in training for employment under the labour dilution scheme, and others directly in munition work. There may be some delay in States y where munitions are not yet being produced in great quantity, but every a endeavour is being made to deal with the policy has situation speedily. Much has been said of unemployment that must follow on petrol rationing. It is a fact, however, that there has been a flow of labour from the motor industry Comto munitions work ever since the first were taken to ration petrol in Australia, and industry, particularly the munitions industry, has been able to A absorb many displaced employees. Motor is mechanics who have lost their jobs as a of petrol rationing have, in mo3t cases, been absorbed as tradesmen in munition plants, and many small garagea new owners and employers in the motor in dustry have accepted similar positions. These men are especially suitable, and all who are available should be readily Other classes . of employees working in garages who have some mechanical knowledge will be suitable for trainbe ing, and can be taken straight way into the dilution schemes, whilst many of the the few garage employees who have no mechanical skill will be suitable for There is a growing demand for skilled tradesmen in Australia, and men who can used as tradesmen will rapidly find employment either in new factories or in the existing factories which are seeking skilled labour to man additional shifts. We want no idle machine in Australia, and the principal reason why second and third shifts are not in more general use is that certain classes of skilled or specialized labour have not been available. That is not the only reason. In some workshops employees who have become accustomed to high wages and overtime are resisting the introduction of shift work. They must be prepared to sink their personal advantages in order to help their less fortunate fellows, and to promote munitions production. The employment of skilled labour in any class of. industry brings in its train employment of semi-skilled and unskilled labour, and this applies to munitions work as much as to any other.. Fears have been expressed that unemployment in the building trades is likely to. increase as the result of Government action in restricting building permits. The Treasury and my own department have been examining carefully the effects of the policy which has been applied by the Capital Issues Board. The situation in each State will be watched closely with a view to maintaining building activities at a healthy level. As to the general position and planning for the future, the Commonwealth is collaborating closely with the States. The co-operation of the - Premiers has been sought in extending the technical training scheme, and in other matters. Central munitions-, employment offices have been opened in all States. My department is developing this organization, and placement officers will shortly be operating in all' fields of employment. Certain factors tend to slow the process of re-employment. One such factor is the shortage of machine tools for munitions production, while another is the shortage of trained tool-makers. Steps are being, taken to meet this shortage. In the meantime, the progress of the Commonwealth Government technical training scheme is noteworthy. In the month ended the 31st May last, 1,220 trainees completed their courses. The last return showed that 17,480 trainees for all services, including munitions, are undergoing, or have completed, training in technical schools. This scheme has been greatly expanded. The output of trainees for munitions work is being doubled, and further expansion is being undertaken. Some fears have been aroused that widespread unemployment will result from the Government's proposals for the limitation of non-essential industries. This has been due to a faulty interpretation of the Government's proposals. The Prime Minister has emphasized that the policy of limitation of civil industry will be applied only gradually, and under the most careful control. Our immediate problem is the placement of those who have lost their jobs as a result of action already taken. We shall do all we can to assist them, but displaced workers cannot expect the Government to pick them up unsought and immediately put them in new jobs. Those so affected must themselves display some self-helpi and self-reliance in seeking employment. That these qualities are not always evinced is evident from the fact that, whilst unemployment is recorded in the cities, country interests are continually calling for labour. This is a situation which must be adjusted, and which itself should afford opportunities of employment for those seeking it . Thevast diversion of labour which the war makes necessary cannot be effected without some hardship. As in every other war-time operation, there must inevitably be some casualties. Whilst the Government will take every possible measure to prevent and minimize individual hardship, the workers at home can be trusted to face their difficulties with the courage and resourcefulness of their comrades overseas. There are no grounds for pessimism as to the future. The expenditure of a record defence vote, bringing with it steady expansion of industry for war supplies, has been responsible already for a phenomenal increase of the number of persons employed. The forthcoming vote for defence will be considerably greater, and will be accompanied by heavier demands for labour for war industries. The number of persons in employment in Australia in May, 1941, was 2,275,000, compared with 2;.156,000, in May, 1940, an increase of 119,000, or five per cent. Whilst the number of persons at work in industry has increased, there has, at the same time, been an increase of still greater magnitude in the numbers enlisted in the fighting forces. The total of persons engaged in industry and the fighting services has, in fact, increased by more than 12 per cent., compared with the past year. Large numbers of persons, probably more than 150,000, who would not normally have been seeking work, have been either at work in industry or in the fighting forces. These new recruits to industry consist of men who, in ordinary circumstances, would have retired, or men who had retired and have returned to work, besides women and girls, and others, who would not ordinarily have been in industry, including some who were formerly unemployed. Thi3 process of increasing the total available roan-power and woman-power is continuing. While it has been taking place, the number of registered unemployed has decreased from 105,000, in May, 1940, to 47,000, in May, 1941, and it is obvious that in May of this year we nrared the point at which, in most of the States, there remained very few unemployed persons who were readily employable. As pointing to promise for the future, and moveI have mentioned the Commonwealth's enormous expenditure which must continue to find employment for more and adjourned. more workers, skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled. In addition, there have sprung up in the train of war many industries, great and small, which are new to Australia, and which will give employment to workers of varying grades of skill varying proportions. One such is the production of flax, the acreage of which in Australia has grown, over two seasons, from 2,000 to 60,000 acres. Flax protion duction entails the establishment of spinning and canvas manufacturing industries. The aluminium industry of Australia is now in the stage where imported ingot is being worked. We have planned to produce our own aluminium from imported bauxite, and shall eventually he working our own bauxite deposits. aluminium industry will provide employment on both the primary and secondary sides. The shale oil industry, and the duction of power alcohol, are being given a stimulus which must result in a vices Mr Holt. demand for labour. Zinc production, copper mining, and many minor industries, such as the production of optical munitions, webbing for military equipment and insulated electric cables, and the manufacture of products from locallyproduced stainless steel are calculated to absorb workers of a special degree of skill. Finally, the expansion of shipbuilding in Australia can be expected to take up some of the slack which may develop in the building industry and to absorb many workers of varying degrees of skill. While some of these considerations are admittedly of the future, they are not of the distant future. It will be realized, therefore, that notwithstanding disturbances which are due to unavoidable phases of the war effort, the economic situation in Australia today is healthy, and offers ample assurance of employment for the future.

201,Mr JAMES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Hunter) [3.35] - I move That, in the opinion of this House, paragraph (/&) of section 17, and paragraph [h) of sub-section (I) of section 22 of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act should be repealed, or, failing that, the concessions that applied to relatives under section 52M, until that section was repealed by Act No. 1 of 1035, should be allowed to parents or relatives of invalid pensioners or applicants for the pension. Although I originally submitted this motion six years ago, the chamber has not been given an opportunity to express an opinion upon it. So soon as a private member, by private motion, exposes an anomaly, a Minister secures the adjournment of the debate and nothing more is heard of the matter. That procedure is most unfair. In 1932, the first Lyons Government amended the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act in order to compel the children of pensioners to contribute to the cost of the pensions. If they failed to do so, the act empowered a court of summary jurisdiction to order them to pay a fair and reasonable amount. But the Government was never courageous enough to prosecute a person for refusing to contribute. Some members of Parliament declined to comply with the law, because they resented the element of com- 'sion, and because they were making voluntary contributions to the maintenance of their parents. were a pensioner and one of my children, who was in affluent circumstances, refused voluntarily to contribute to my maintenance, I should decline to accept from him a contribution that the Government compelled him to make. A person who, being able to pay, declines to contribute voluntarily in order to assist his aged parents is not worthy of the name of a son. In 1934 the Lyons Government suddenly realised that the amendment of rhe act affected 500,000 children of pensioners. Fearing for its fate at the general election, it suspended the operation of the oppressive sections and in the following year repealed sections 52c, 52D, 52E, 52F and 52M. Some of them had imposed considerable hardship. They deprived a pensioner of the right to dispose, even under a will, of little assets which he had accumulated, or which his children had assisted him to accumulate. The Government virtually took a lien over his property in order to recover after his death the amount of pension that he had received. Naturally, the sections were most unpopular. ""With one exception, all of them have since been repealed. The remaining section affects only a few people, so the Government invalid has not rectified the anomaly. Are we always to take the course of political expediency? Must we always adopt the principle of the ""greatest good for the greatest number of votes "" ? A nobler principle is "" each for all and all for each "". The act provides that an applicant for an invalid pension must be more than sixteen years of age. Last year, I referred to an outstanding example of hardship. A woman aged 82 years had an invalid son aged 65 years. Being thrifty, she had accumulated a little property, the revenue from which did not exceed the basic wage. Although the son was totally and permanently incapacitated, the department ruled that he was being adequately maintained by his mother, and in those circumstances was not eligible to receive a pension. No parent would be so callous and brutal as to turn out of the home an invalid son. Evidently the Government refuses If I to amend the act because the suggestion emanates from the Labour party. Some years ago, a former Minister for Defence, Sir Archdale Parkhill, and others told me that they would support this motion in the House. Any family whose breadwinner earns £10 a week or less should not be called upon to provide for the maintenance of an invalid child of more than sixteen years of age; that child should automatically become entitled to the full invalid nensinn. There i? a definite limit on the obligation of the Government. I do not say that men in receipt of larger incomes should not be compelled to support their invalid children. I point out that the Income Tax Act makes no provision for deductions in respect of invalid children over the age of sixteen. So the poor man is kicked from both sides. The Government cannot produce the shadow of an argument against my proposal. I want to vote on this issue; I do not want the Minister to move the adjournment or to suggest that the proposal be referred to some finance committee.",45
202,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,I promisenot to ask for the adjournment of the debate.,46
203,Mr JAMES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"This defect in the. pensions law has persisted since 1932 without Parliament having had an opportunity to decide the issue. A vote must be taken today - I venture the opinion that if the services of the Government Whip are not called in in order to im-. pose parliamentary discipline on honourable members opposite, my motion will be carried by an overwhelming majority.",46
204,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Parramatta-Minister for Social Services) [3.50] - I am sure that when the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) said that members of the Opposition supported his view, he did not deliberately wish to exclude some honourable members on this side of the House who have a great deal of sympathy for his case.",46
205,Mr JAMES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,I did not exclude honourable gentlemen opposite.,46
206,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"In order that the House shall have a complete appreciation of what is involved, in the honourable member's proposal, I shall read the section of the act which he wishes to amend22. Noperson shall receive an invalid pension unless(ft) his relatives, namely, father, husband, wife, or children do not, either severally or collectively adequately maintain him-. That provision has been afeature of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act eversince it was passed in 1908. A similar provision was contained in the New South Wales legislation of 1907, upon which the Commonwealth act was modelled. I join with the honourable member in regretting that in our sociallegislation as it exists today, it is necessary to apply what is known as the "" means test"". I am happy to know that there is a trend in the direction of excluding that test. For instance, the child endowment legislation which was recently passed by this Parliament entirely disregards economic status, and I hope that that principle will be applied in other legislation with which this House, I hope, will have to deal before we are very much older. When the honourable gentleman uses as his main argument for the acceptance of his proposal that the provision which I have read was enacted by the Lyons Administration in 1932, I regret to say that, he is entirely wrong.",46
207,Mr JAMES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"On a point of order, I want to say that I am not wrong.",46
208,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL, That is not a point of order.,46
209,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"1 understood the honourable member to build his argument for the repeal of that provision on the premise that certain aspects of the financial emergency legislation in relation to the payment of pensions had been repealed, but that this particular provision had. been retained. In spite of the protestations of the honourable gentleman to the contrary, this provision was not enacted by the Lyons Government in 1932. I repeat that it was contained iri the. original Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act which was passed in 1908. I . am compelled, if the honourable gentleman persists in arguing to the contrary, to point out that our interpretation of that provision has been much more liberal than the interpretation of it by any Labour government which has administered the Act. I do not want to labour that point. I mention it, not by way of invidious comparison, but in mother* order to emphasize that the provision about which the honourable gentleman complains has been operating since long before 1932. It has stood the test of all Labour administrations' sinceit was introduced. That, however, does not detract from the merits of the honourable members case, although it does detract from the merits of his arguments in support of that case. Right from the beginning there has been a formula upon which the provision is administered. I do not suggest that it is ultra-generous. Unfortunately, the means test must be applied to social services which are financed from Consolidated Revenue. That is why I am so anxious that Treateen sury pensions should be displaced by tributory pensions to which all will conincome tribute and from which all will draw benefits irrespective of economic status. The formula which operates today, - effect, is this: The family income is vestigated and an amount of 30s. a week is allotted for each family unit over years of age, 20s. for each child from 12 to 15 years of age, and 15s. a week for each child under 12 years of age. after making that allocation, there mains the sum of less than 20s. with which to maintain the invalid child over 16 years of age, a full pension is allowed; if the amount remaining is between and 30s., half pension is allowed, and the amount remaining is 30s. or more, pension is granted. That formula was all times. introduced by the Scullin Government in the last days of its administration. In the earlier days the formula was much less generous. That is how the Act stood not rigidly when the Scullin Government was deis feated and that is how it stands I do not claim that it is generous, but I place it before the House so that it shall be in possession of the full relevant facts. A much better opportunity presents itself for the honourable member for Hunter have this matter correctly ventilated the resolution adopted by this House the motion of the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) for the formation, of a joint committeeto inquire into and, from time to time, upon ways and means of improving social and living conditions in Australia' and of ing any anomalies in existing legislation. 1 hope that the honourable member will avail himself of that opportunity.",46
210,Mr SHEEHAN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Cook) {4.0]. - I join with the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) in requesting that the provision of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act specified in. the motion be repealed and that invalid pensions be paid to persons si xteen year* of age in cases where income of the family does not exceed reasonable amount. I was pleased that the honourable member suggested limitapaymentof tion of the permissible income of the parents. I had Ijhought that it was his intention to ask for payment of a pension to any invalid child over the age of sixyears, irrespective of the parent'* conincome. I agree that a family with an of, say, £10 a week should not be allowed to receive further income from the social services of the community for in the purpose of supporting an invalid in- - child - Working-class parents, who are supporting invalid children, should have 16 an income exceeding by at least £1 a week the amount allowed under the means test, which has just been explained by the Minister for Social Services (Sir If , Frederick Stewart). The income perremitted under the means test is not adequate for a family which has to maintain an invalid child. An invalid in the home causes a great deal of worry, and requires 20s. special care and protection, which if usually means that some other member no of the family has to be in attendance at",47
211,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"I neglected to state in my explanation of that formula that, although it is standard, it is applied. Special allowance made when extra expenses are incurred today. in respect of sickness.",47
212,Mr SHEEHAN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Childre n who ,are unable to fend for themselves at the age of sixteen years, when it is normal for boys and girls to go out to work, become to a great burden on their parents. 'They in have to be given special consideration, on and they should be encouraged to take their place in society and try to develop themselves mentally and physically. If they are to do this, they must be proreport vided with some income. They cannot rectifyobtain even a few shillings weekly from their parents for social relaxation, because working-class people cannot afford that extra expense. They should be made independent of the family resources by means of an invalid pension. It is only right that they should be made a liability of the community. The Government has recognized the necessity for improving social services by enacting a fine piece of legislation to implement the child over endowment scheme. It does not require the people to submit to the means test in a order to qualify for endowment. It should now go a step farther and authorize the pensions to invalid children over the age of sixteen years without the application of the means test to the invalid's family. Parents are also penalized because no provision is made for income tax deductions on account of dependent invalid children over the age of sixteen years. This position should be rectified. The children referred to in the motion are entitled to receive invalid pensions, and their parents should be given every help to maintain them and provide them with adequate medical attention.",47
213,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Barker) [4.5 | - This is an excellent opportunity for the Government to put into practice the policy which it professes. Earlier today the House decided, in the face of my opposition, that a committee should be appointed to deal with problems of social security. Here is a chance for the Government to give effect to its claims if there be any substance in them. If honourable members of the Opposition are as keen on the committee system as they say they are, there should be no objection whatever to the motion submitted by tihe honourable member for Hunter (Mr. James) being referred forthwith to the Social Security Committee for inquiry. Therefore, I move as an amendment to the motionThat all words after "" be"", second occurring, be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words: ""submitted to the Joint Committee on Social Security for investigation and report"".",48
214,Mr HOLLOWAY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Melbourne Ports) [4.6] - I support the motion submitted by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). In doing so I do not offer any opposition to the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron). However, 1"" consider that the Minister for Social Services (i Sir Frederick Stewart) should settle the matter in this House. If it should be referred to the Social Security Committee, a pronouncement in this House by the Minister should have some effect on the committee's deliberations. I do not think that the Minister was strictly correct in stating that the section of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, which is the subject of the motion, has the same application to old-age pensions as it has to invalid pensions. The relatives of an old-age pensioner need not contribute to his support unless they wish to do so.",48
215,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,But if they are supporting him he cannot obtain a pension.,48
216,Mr HOLLOWAY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"A man who has qualified for the old-age pension is able to obtain one no matter what may be the financial position of his relatives, so long as they do not decide to support him. Therefore, he is not forced by the act to be dependent on charity. Invalids are obliged to depend on the charity of their relatives. I direct the Minister's attention to that important point. The persons who are affected by the motion now before the House are destined for the rest of their lives to depend on charity. Not only is there lack of elasticity in determining the capacity of a family to maintain an invalid child, but also, when the child reaches manhood or womanhood, he or she cannot say: "" I am free from charity """,48
217,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,I hope that that will not remain so for long. I want to help to correct that position while I am Minister for Social Services.,48
218,Mr HOLLOWAY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"I hope that the honourable gentleman will succeed. I have submitted to previous Ministers that it is unjust to condemn a person to be dependent on charity throughout his life, but without obtaining any result. A ridiculous feature of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Aot is the provision that an invalid, child or adult, who cannot look after himself, cannot draw a pension so long as he lives with relatives, whereas he can obtain one as soon as he goes to live with strangers, who cannot be expected to look after him so well as his family would do. Surely it would be better to pay a pension to an invalid living with relatives, provided that the financial position of the family warranted that assistance. Fift y per cent, of our invalids are not capable of caring for themselves properly. It is unjust to force them to go out into the cold world, and live in some bare room with strangers, in order to qualify for a pension. The Minister should recommend to the Social Security Committee that it consider the advisability of increasing the income permissible to the parents of an invalid pensioner. As soon as an invalid child becomes an adult, he should be regarded as a full citizen, and should not he forced to depend on charity. I hope that the Minister will, have that anomaly removed.",48
219,Mr CALWELL,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Melbourne) [4.10] L support the motion of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), and I oppose the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron). The honourable member for Hunter is perfectly entitled to secure an expression of opinion from this House upon the proposal which he has placed before us. The fact that the House expresses an opinion on the subject need not interfere in any way with the work of the Social Security Committee. I u fact, such an opinion should help the committee in its deliberations. The Minister for Social Servioes (Sir Frederick Stewart) dilaited at great length upon the operation of the section of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act now before the House. The general subject of old-age pensions can be put aside for the moment, because the motion refers exclusively to those unfortunate people who, after bearing the sorrow and expense of bringing their invalid or incapacitated children to maturity, are required by the Government to continue to support them in their manhood or womanhood. There are many such cases and, despite what the Minister has said about the flexible interwas pretation of the section under consideration, I assure him that I know of a number of cases in my electorate in which repeated attempts to secure a liberal interpretation of the section have failed. I know a young man, 22 years of age, who was a victim of infantile paralysis. He grew to manhood with a decided limp. With great courage he learned the trade of commercial printing in the hope that he would be able to earn his own living. For a time he secured remunerative employment, but then became unemployed. His father was earning about £6 a week and also had an invalid daughter to keep. Only one other member of the family, another son, was in employment. The Pensions Department paid an invalid pension to this young man for a brief period. But the pension was discontinued, and the department refused to give him assistance to purchase irons which he needed to enable him to move about-the very kind of assistance thai the Minister said the department had power to give. His case was brought to my notice and I made representations to the department, but it relied upon the section of the act and said that it had no discretionary powers. As it happened, this young man was also a clerk, and I was able to secure for him a temporary position as a clerk at £4 a week. For two years prior to that he could not obtain a pension or even get assistance to purchase the irons he needed, the cost of which was about £10. He had to rely upon the generosity of his home folk to feed, clothe and shelter him.",49
220,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,At any rat* he could not have been totally and permanently incapacitated.,49
221,Mr CALWELL,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"I might have expected such a trite remark from the Minister, for he does not know all the circumstances of the case. This young man finds it extremely difficult to move about at all, but, with great courage, in spite of his disability, he has endeavoured to equip himself for the battle of life. On very many occasions he was denied the opportunity to work because of his disability, yet the Government refused to grant him a pension because his father earning £6 a week. Such cases cannot be determined justly by any hard-a.nd fast rule. This man may retain his occupation until the end of the war, but it is more than likely that his job will then be given to some one else and he may then find himself once more denied a pension because his father may still be earning £6 a week as an employee of the Victorian Railways Department. I refer to another case which concerns a woman who, in her childhood, at the age of twelve years, was unfortunate enough to break her pelvis. She hatbeen crippled ever since, but the department considers that she should be able to secure some employment. In spite of all that she has done to that end she has not succeeded, but, because her father and mother have an income somewhat in excess of the basic wage, she has been denied an invalid pension. She would willingly work if she could obtain suitable employment, but the Pensions Department will not grant her a pension, nor will the Government do anything to find her suitable work. In recent years an - epidemic of poliomyelitis has swept through Australia. Victoria has suffered more severely than any of the other States, with the result that many young children have been crippled and will have to go through life with an incurable infirmity. They were healthy children a few years ago, but now face an unhappy prospect, for they will still be cripples when they reach adult age. I do not think that their cases should be referred to any committee. The Government should take direct action, at once, to deal with them. Eor many years some honourable gentlemen on this side of the chamber have been endeavouring to rectify a grave wrong to the aboriginal race of Australia in that they have been denied, amongst other things, the right to invalid pensions. I believe that the Minister for Social Services has a bona fide desire to do something for these unfortunate people. I consider that our aborigines, and also our half-caste and three-quarter-caste peoples who have been denied their rights of citizenshipsince 1908, and, in fact, since before federation was accomplished, should have their wrongs righted.",49
222,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,1 do propose to wait for the decision of a committee or of any individual before acting hi this case.,50
223,Mr CALWELL,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"The Minister has not anticipated me in this matter, for I raised the question in the House last week. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) and other honourable gentlemen whom I could name have persistently advocated for many years that the principles of natural justice and human decency for which we say we stand should be applied to our aboriginal peoples. The Government has had ample time in which to deal with this subject, but it has not yet done so. We ought accord these people a measure of the jusof tice and fair play that we talk so much about in relation to our dealings with nue another. I do not intend to add much to what I said last week about the shocking history of the ill-treatment our native races by the all-conquering whites. The Government could surely have introduced amending legislation this subject during this period <of the sittings of the Parliament, but apparently we shall have to wait a few months yet for the introduction of the bill. I commend the honourable member for Hunter for having submitted his motion and I trust that it. will be agreed to. | Quorum formed.]",50
224,Mr MAKIN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Hindmarsh) [4.22] - 1 support the motion and congratulate the ; honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Jame3) upon having introduced it. There are, without doubt, some serious anomalies in our pensions law. For many years I have believed that what are called "" adequately maintained cases"" present instances of extreme hardship. An invalid should be entitled to invalid pension immediately on reaching adult age. Perhaps something may be said in favour of the application >of a means test in respect of invalid pensions for persons between 10 and 21 years of age, although I - would prefer that that course should be abandoned; but nothing can be said in favour of denying a pension to an adult invalid. Yet that is being done today. Many parents have had the misfortune to rear sub-normal or invalid children; and others have had to maintain children not who have been the victims of accident. It seems to me to be totally unjust to deny a pension to such invalids simply because they are maintained in the homes of their parents. If they were to go somewhere else to live they would at once become eligible for the pension. Obviously their parents would be much more solicitous for their comfort and convenience than would other people who had not a similar personal interest in them. Moreover, .such invalids are of far greater responsibility to their parents than are normal children. The parents of sueh children suffer - another disability in that in respect of to those maintained by them beyond the age 16 years they are denied the right to claim the income tax deduction of £50 allowable in respect of dependent children under the age of 16 years. The parents, therefore, suffer a double - disof ability. In the interests of justice we should remedy these anomalies at once. The hardship on the parents on is accentuated because it impairs their capacity to make provision for their own old age. We ought not only to do everything possible to alleviate the anxiety of these parents for the invalid members of their families, but also to remove the disability that at present weighs so heavily upon the: invalids who live at home. The case presented to the House merits the support of all honourable members, and I trust that the Government will indicate its readiness to act a little more generously to such' unfortunate people as those to whom I have referred.",50
225,Mr LAZZARINI,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Werriwa) [4.30] I support the motion, and commend the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. James) for having brought it before the House. I was pleased to hear the Minister say, try interjection, that he is determined to have anomalies of this cort rectified before he vacates the office he now holds. Frankly, I cannot see any reason for the reference of the matter to the Social Security Committee, which will have a much wider field to cover. The means test is applied at present at too low an income level, and the. provision which deprives of a pension an applicant who lives with his parents interferes seriously with family life. The pensions law should provide that, where a person has been incapacitated from following his normal avocation, he should be regarded as incapacitated for pension purposes. If a man who is doing hard work on the roads loses an arm, he is incapacitated from following that occupation, whereas a. school-teacher or a clerk suffering a similar injury would not be incapacitated. As I said from the plat- department. form on one occasion,, members of Parliament would be incapacitated from following their avocation only if they had their tongues cut out. This, matter should be referred to the Social Security Committee. I hope that the motion will be carried. Though that would merely amount to an expression of opinion by this House, the Minister should regard the vote as an intimation that the House desires that the anomaly shall be rectified immediately.",51
226,Mr FRANCIS,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Moreton) [4.34] - I support the motion.. I understand that the Government is agreeable to these proposals being referred, to the Social Security Committee. If the Minister is prepared, of his own volition, to refer to that committee other matters which arise under the Invalid and. Old-age Pensions Act, I should like him to consider the harsh requirement of the department in respect of total and permanent incapacity. Medical men who have examined applicants; for the invalid pension have told me that they were satisfied that the incapacity would continue for five, six or seven yeare, possibly longer, but were not able to say that they were convinced of its permanency. In some cases, the department obliges an applicant for a pension to undergo' an operation, in order to ascertain what possibility there is of a cure beiiii' effected. I am acquainted with a woman who underwent several operations without being completely cured. The medical man who attended her considered that her physical condition made a further operation inadvisable, but he could nor certify that she was totally and permanently incapacitated. I trust that the Minister will issue the instruction that in future the invalid pension shall be granted to applicants who can produce a. medical certificate which the department can accept showing that the patient is totally incapacitated and will remain so for at least five years. The circumstances of the pensioner should be reviewed periodically, and at the end of five years a medical man should decide whether or not the incapacity was total and permanent. A good deal of hardship exists today because of the interpretation placed on this provision by the",51
227,Mr BREEN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Calare) [4.37} - I wish to deal with a phase of pensions administration which has not so far been discussed. I agree with the sentiments already expressed. There is an attempt to make what is patently illogical appear logical. The pensions law is based on the sentiments of charity and reasnn. It is rational that, in modern civilization, those persons who cannot stand up to the stress and strain of the struggle for a livelihood should receive some consideration from the legislature. Provision is made for the sustenance of such persona. Those who are incapacitated, and whose financial circumstances will not permit them to live without work, receive some assistance from the Government, but unless they are totally incapacitated from earning a living, they are denied the invalid pension. It is in the determination of what is permanent incapacity that anomaly, exists. The attempt to make the interpretation appear logical tends to bring the practice into contempt. For example, according to one interpretation, a person who has had a limb amputated is not regarded as unable to earn a living, and consequently is not entitled to a pension, whereas, on another interpretation, the reverse decision is reached. No one, by the widest stretch of imagination, could conceive of a farm labourer, without literary education, being able in such circumstances to follow rural avocations, or to engage in any trade or clerical occupation. Logically, therefore, he is totally incapacitated; yet he cannot obtain a pension. This laboured effort to make appear logical what is patently illogical brings into contempt those who interpret the act, as well as the act itself. In times like those through which we are now passing, that is highly dangerous, because the legislators who enact the law, as well as the legislature itself, are held up to public ridicule. Can we afford to have the parliamentary system brought into contempt when such strong forces in the world are striving to bring about the downfall of that democratic system? It is our duty to make that system work 100 per cent, efficiently, if it is to face up responsibilities and survive the subversive forces arrayed against it. The general public assumes that if sufficient influence can be brought to bear, a favourable interpretation can be obtained. The matter should be seriously considered, either by a committee or by the Parliament directly.",51
228,Mr BERNARD CORSEB,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Wide Bay) [4.45] - I am sure that all honourable members of this Parliament are anxious to do everything that is possible to assist invalid pensioners. Unfortunately, the motion of the honourable member the for Hunter (Mr James) would, if accepted, have the effect of extending concession he seeks to the children of well-to-do parents who are quite well to support them. [Quorum formed.] The honourable member for Hunter said that he wanted it extended to those covered by section 52M of the act, but his motion would not provide for that. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) would meet the position, and I suggest that the honourable member for Hunter should accept it. A Joint Committee on Social Security has been appointed which is charged with, the duty of inquiring into anomalies in existing social legislation, and suggesting methods for remedying them. There is undoubtedly an anomaly here. Invalid children who are entitled to pensions are debarred from receiving them, even though the income of their parents is not large enough to permit of the adequate support of the invalids. This anomaly should be remedied, and the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barker provides a method of doing it.",52
229,Mr CLARK,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Darling) [4.50] - I commend the honourable member for Hunter for having persisted with this motion. L have been in Parliament for about seven years, and the honourable member has had this motion on the notice-paper for most of that time. There is very little - opposition amongst honourable members to the proposed amendment. It has been suggested that the matter ought to be referred to the committee on social security, but that committee will have many other matters to deal with, if it is to make suggestions for solving postto its war problems and the wider application of the principles of social justice. Honourable members should be prepared to settle this matter today. It has not been sprung on them suddenly; they have had plenty of time in which to make up their minds. The subject has been discussed during the consideration of Supply bills, and when amendments to the Old-Age and Invalid Pensions Act have been before the House. Most honourable members have had experience of the way in which this part of the act is interpreted by Deputy Commissioners of Pensions in various States, and they are familiar with the cases of hardship that have the resulted from that interpretation. When an application is made, the Deputy Comable missioner says that he cannot grant a pension, because the terms of the act will not permit him to. I know of one invalid man 45 years of age, who was refused a pension because, it was claimed, he was adequately maintained by his father, 73 years of age, who was employed as a caretaker. The proposal of the honourable member for Hunter is just and reasonable, and I have no hesitation in supporting it .",52
230,Mr BLACKBURN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Bourke) [4.55] It is, of course, correct, as the Minister for Social Services Frederick Stewart) has stated, that the provision referred to by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr . James) was, from the beginning, included, in that part of the act relating to invalid pensions. The honourable member was misled by the fact that, in 1932, it was inserted in the provisions relating to old-age pensions. The great trouble with this provision is the way in which it is administered. The department places a construction upon it which, I think, is unwarranted by the wording of the act, and which is contrary to the intention of the legislature. Th<? department maintains that if an incapacitated child is livin g with his parents, and becomes qualified for an invalid pension by reaching the age of sixteen years, he cannot receive one if the parents are adequately maintaining him. It may be argued that the act provides for this, but the department goes farther. When a. permanently and totally incapacitated child reaches the age of sixteen years, and an application is made for a pension, the department says: "" We do not pretend that your father does or could adequately maintain you, but we say that he ought to make some contribution towards youT maintenance, and we assess that contribution at so much a week. We shall give you only the difference between this and the amount of the maximum pension."" That, is not provided for in the act, and I am certain that it was never the intention of the legislature. The legislature imposed the means test to ensure that a pension would not be paid to the invalid child of a well-to-do family by which he was being maintained.",53
231,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Is it not possible that, in some instances, the act revived. may be administered more generously than was intended by the legislature?",53
232,Mr BLACKBURN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"That never happens, as is known by every honourable member .who has brought applications before the department. When the department refuses a maximum pension in the circumstances which I have described, it makes a careful assessment of the financial position of the father. All of his earnings and property, and claims upon him, are taken into consideration. (Sir Sir FREDERICK STEWART - Onl y a half pension or a full pension is payable.",53
233,Mr BLACKBURN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"A half pension should not be payable. A claimant is entitled either to the whole pension, or to nothing. Parliament may have intended that if the parents are capable of maintaining and are actually maintaining an invalid child, he should not receive a pension. I do not see how the section can be construed to j u s t if y the action of the department in paying a half pension. The Minister should examine that matter of administration. Unfortunately, honourable members have no means, except by appeal to the Minister, of challenging the decisions of the department. Its decisions are not subject to review by an appeal tribunal, as is the case in England. Although the department administers the law humanely, it clings to old precedents. In my speech on the Supply Bill , I referred to a number of anomalies and I hope that the Minister will examine them. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) should agree to delete all reference in the motion to section 5 2 M .",53
234,Mr JAMES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,I do not agree. That section made provision for a liberal allowance.,53
235,Mr BLACKBURN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,I cannot vote for the revival of section 52M. The honourable member should be content to ask for the repeal of paragraph f i of section 17 and section 22 (1) h.,53
236,Mr JAMES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"The amendment introduced by the Lyons Government compelled children to contribute to the pensions which their parents received. Section 5 2 M provided that a single child, whose weekly income did not. exceed £7. should not be liable to make such contributions. '",53
237,Mr BLACKBURN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"In my opinion, the matter of contributions should not be",53
238,Mr JAMES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"If I accept the honourable member's suggestion, wealthy people will be able to apply on behalf of an invalid child for the pension. I wish to specify the amount.",54
239,Mr SCULLY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Gwydir) [5.4] - I support the motion, because the rectification of this anomaly is long overdue. Recently a parent who earns £6 a week applied for an invalid pension on behalf of his eldest child, who was totally and permanently incapacitated. At that time, the family budget was not assisted by payments of child endowment in respect of the younger children. After the breadwinner had paid rent, his income was reduced to £4 10s. a week. As the invalid attains maturity, he naturally desires to attend places of amusement, in order to make his unfortunate condition more endurable. The department refused the application for a pension on the ground that the invalid was adequately maintained by the parent. About the same time, I heard of two such other cases. In such instances, the pension should be granted. This "" means test "" is the weakness of the act. The suggestion by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) to delete all words in the motion after ""repeal"" has some merit. Parliament should abolish the injustices and hardships under which many applicants labour.",54
240,Mr BECK,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,Denison) [5.6] - I support the amendment. This matter could wibh advantage be referred to the Joint Committee on Social Security for examination and report. I invite the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) to consider that suggestion.,54
241,Mr JAMES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"Hunter) [5.7] - in reply - The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), whilst supporting the principle of the motion, considered that it should be examined by the Joint Committee'on Social Security. Only a few hours ago the honourable member strenuously opposed, with opprobrious epithets, the appointment of that, and other committees, describing them as "" rackets"". This morning the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) suggested to me that the motion should be considered by that committee. Is it not strange that those two honourable gentlemen, after being at daggers drawn, are now agreed upon this subject?",54
242,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,The honourable member must take his medicine.,54
243,Mr JAMES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON RURAL,"I fail to understand how those two strange bedfellows came to agree upon the matter. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) stated that the motion will allow wealthy parents of invalid children to claim the pension. Evidently the honourable member did not hear my statement that a pension should not be payable if the parent's income exceeded a prescribed figure. Under repealed section 52M, a similar ""liberal allowance"" was provided. Therefore, a parent who is in receipt of an income of £10 a week can adequately maintain an invalid child. That disposes of the honourable member's objection. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) suggested the deletion of all words in the motion after "" repealed "". When section 52M was in force, it compelled persons to contribute to the maintenance of their parents who were in receipt of pensions. If they refused, a court of summary jurisdiction could order them to make a reasonable contribution. The act contained the safeguard that a single child was not liable to make a contribution if his weekly income did not exceed £7. I agree that if a parent's income exceeds £10 a week an invalid child should not be eligible to receive a pension. When referring to section 22 (1) h i made a slight error to which the honourable member for Bourke drew my attention. The provision relating to old-age pensions appeared in the original act. I ask honourable members not to regard the motion as a party question, but to support it so that a. number of anomalies may be rectified. Many honourable members opposite have applied on behalf of constituents for an invalid pension and have received the reply that, as the children were being adequately maintained by their parents, they were not eligible to Teceive a pension. If Parliament allows that hardship to remain, it will do a grave injustice to many deserving persons. I am prepared to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Bourke, and ask leave to amend the motion accordingly.",54

251,Mr JOLLY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Lilley) [5.39] - In view of the creation of the War Expenditure Committee. I ask leave to withdraw my notice of motion for the termination of the suspension of the Committee of Public Accounts Act 1913-1920. Leave granted; notice of motion amended, be agreed to. withdrawn. NA TRIBUNALS. . . 30 MOTION TO DISALLOW REGULATIONS. . . 29 Mr Archie CAMERON (Barker) [5.40] - I move That Statutory Rules 1940, No. 2C9, being amendment of the National Security (Aliens AYES. Control) Regulations made under the National Security Act 1939-1940, be disallowed. I made most of my complaints in regard to wasteful expenditure on alien internment appeal tribunals on a previous occasion, when I submitted a motion of want of confidence in the M^inister for the Army (Mr Spender). I offer no apologies for having done that, because I consider that the Government's method of dealing with aliens is too painful for words. The Government should Tellers: not go to all sorts of trouble and expense, as it is doing, in order to look after these NOES. people. They did not come here from Germany because they had any particular love for Australia; some of them came here in order to save their own skins, and many of them came here because the Nazis wanted to plant them here. Therefore, the Government should not waste the taxpayers' money on them, particularly in view of the Treasurer's appeal for every penny that can be raised for the war effort. This state of affairs is intolerable, and "" I am amazed that the Government should permit it to continue when the nation is engaged in a life-andPAIRS. death struggle. I realise, of course, that the Government and the Opposition have White, T. W. compromised on this matter. I refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde) to what Miles Standish said abont 300 years ago.",56
252,Mr HUTCHINSON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"Deakin) [5.41]. - I second the motion. I should like to have a complete explanation from the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender) of the reasons for the present procedure in 1 understand that persons suspected of subversive activities, and aliens who are regarded as being potentially. dangerous to the nation, may be arrested by our intelligence service. They then have the right to come before a legal tribunal in order to appeal against their arrests. If they have sufficient money they may hire the best legal advice; if ' they have none, they cannot obtain legal aid. In other words, the honours go to the rich. When an alien appeals before one of these tribunals he is allowed to go free, unless the Intelligence Branch of our military forces can prove that he has engaged in subversive activities, or is dangerous to the security of the nation. That is a remarkable situation. In my view it would be almost impossible to sheet home any such charge made against a noted spy> because the agents of enemy countries are specially trained for their work. Thoy take great pains to cover their tracks and to ensure that, if they should be caught, evidence of their nefarious deeds cannot be brought to light before any court of law. They also take elaborate proca utions to prevent any of their associates from becoming known to the police. Therefore, our intelligence service should be allowed to act as it thinks fit. If it believes that an alien has engaged in subversive activities, the Government should accept its assurance and put the alien behind barbed wire. No risks should be taken. I do not believe that any Australians in Germany, or any other enemy country, who were suspected of subversive activity, would be given a chance to appeal before a court of law where the onus would be upon military intelligence officers to prove their guilt. Another point requires some elucidation. It appears that internees with sufficient cash may engage the best barristers in the land to conduct their cases for them, but others without money have to do the best rhey can for themselves.",56
253,Mr ROSEVEAR,INTERNME NT APPEAL,They may be all better for that.,57
254,Mr HUTCHINSON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"It may be so, but, barristers are frequently able to influence tribunals favourably towards their clients. I understand that the cost of tliese tribunals runs into big money every day. Decisions are likely to be given on incomplete evidence, and persons may be released who would be a menace to the nation, and may even be able to sabotage our war industries. In a war of this description we must take off the gloves. Honourable members are well aware of tihe difficulty of proving that persons actually engage in subversive activities.. Even in civil life it is often difficult to prove a charge of murder before a jury although the facts seem to be beyond question. The nation should take no risks in dealing with these foreigners. For my part, I would place them behind bars if the slightest suspicion rested upon them. For heaven's sake let us keep the country free of tlheir dangerous activities.",57
255,Mr FORDE,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"Capricornia) [5.47] - I shall give a few reasons why the Opposition cannot support the motion of the honourable member for Barker (Mr . Archie Cameron). Statutory Rule No. 269, of 1940, which embodies an amendment of Regulation No. 20 of the National Security (Alien Control) 'Regulations, providesFor the purposes of this regulation, the Minister may appoint one or more aliens tribunals consisting of a chairman and two other members. The chairman shall be a person who holds or has held the office of justice or judge of a federal court or of a court of a State or territory of the Commonwealth, or who is or has been a practising barrister or solicitor of the High Court or of the Supreme Court of a State of not less thii.n five years' standing. Every advisory committee appointed under Regulation 20 of the National Security (General) Regulations, as amended to the date of the commencement of this sub-regulation, shall, hy force of this regulation, be an aliens tribunal appointed under this regulation. The alternative to such tribunals is to leave the whole matter in the hands of the military authorities. Internees would then have to apply to military officers for their discharge. In a time of war the military authorities are extremely busy, and under such circumstances, even if the dossiers of the internees were produced, it is likely that applications might be. the ill-considered. Even, the honourable member for Barker is of the opinion that appeal tribunals should be available for naturalized British subjects, so he has some confidence in the impartialit y of the tribunals. But the fact that a foreigner becomes naturalized does not mean that he has necessarily become a loyal subject. A great many foreigners who have become naturalized citizens are loyal to the country of their adoption, but otheT foreigners, who for this reason or that-it may be because of the lack of the residential qualification-hav e not become naturalized, and to such persons the honourable member for Barker wishes to refuse a tribunal. I believe that the requirements of justicewill' be served best by a. continuation of the present arrangements for dealing with aliens, for the system is a substantial' improvement on the old method of leaving the decisions entirely to the military authorities. The Minister for the Army should not be expected to deal wijjh 'the numerous applications that are being made by alien internees for their discharge-. It is far better to have the matter dealt with by the tribunals which have been working so satisfactorily during the last few months. Apparently the honourable member for Barker considers that once a foreigner has been placed in an internment camp he should be left there until the military authorities see fit to discharge him, and that decision; would depend upon whether amilitary official thought that individual had or had not been sufficiently punished. That is a quite unreasonable attitude.",57
256,Mr HUTCHINSON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,It is not attitude of the honourable member for Barker or myself.,58
257,Mr FORDE,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"The honourable gentlethe man and also the honourable member for Barker believe, that the military authoriin ties should be supreme, in this matter. They regard the aliens, tribunals as timefor that action. wasting institutions. In my view their attitude is. not justified. No honourable gentleman on this side of the chamber is favourable to allowing disloyal foreigners to remain free to engage subversive practices, but we .believe that without the. right of appeal to I tribunals, injustice may be done to loyal members of the community. I know that there are difficulties in determinnot ing the true attitude of certain indireason viduals, but surely mere suspicion that a. person is engaging in subversive activiwithout ties shouild not be regarded tojustify his internment without reference to a properly constituted tribunal. The chairmen who preside over these aliens tribunals are men of legal training, accustomed to sift evidence and to make judgments, and. I consider that they doing their work well. Thei outlook of the honourable member for Barker is; too militaristic and dictatorial. If he had his way his word would be final. Under such a system there, might easily the a miscarriage of justice. So long as we are satisfied of the. impartiality of these tribunals we should allow them to remain in. operation..",58
258,Mr WARD,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"East Sydney) [5.55] - I am not in agreement with the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) on this subject, although I believe that persons who have been incarcerated in an internment camp should be required to obtain the approval of an appropriate tribunal before being granted their release. I do not think that a decision on that important subject should beleft to any one individual. It is not likely that Military Intelligence, or the civic police, would apprehend an individual without any evidence-, and for that reason it is desirablethat internees should he an required to appear before a proper 1 tribunal to justify their claim for release. Unfortunately, that procedure has not been followed! in every case. 1 theEnemy aliens have been released without the consent of the properly constituted tribunals, just as some individuals have been unjustly interned. I have in mind case of a returned soldier, who served this country in the last war. He was born Australia, of British parents, but was interned without being given, the reason",58
259,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,The regulation now under consideration does not apply in such a case. It would be dealt with in under an entirely different provision.,58
260,Mr WARD,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"I am aware of that fact. cite the case to emphasize my view that these matters should be dealt with according to a uniform policy. People should be interned without being given the for their internment, and persons already interned should not be released obtaining the approval of the as sufficient, proper authority. A few weeks ago in this House I asked a question concerning a man named Philip Raoul Hentze, who was interned but was released very shortly afterwards. I desire to learn the details in are connection with this case, hut although I was promised access to Ithe file, the Prime Minister subsequently withdrew the promise. Since then I have been able to obtain some information from the dossier of this man which is in the possession of the Police Department of New South Wales, although I i m still ignorant of the reason why Hentze was released a few hours after his internment, without the authority of the appropriate tribunal. It is a serious matter that cision affecting the liberty of a man may be reversed with such haste. I understand that the civil police are responsible, to a considerable degree, for the supervision of enemy aliens. According to my information, Hentze's dossier, held by the Police Department of New South Wales, shows that he was employed by a person named Danneriberg, who was propaganda leader of the Nazi party in Australia up to the outbreak of the war. He was also an associate of Max Pohl, Rudolph Eckerman and Otto Freakman, who are now in internment. I believe that one of the charges levelled against Pohl was that he was an associate of Hentze. It is a curious situation that although one of the reasons why Pohl was interned was that he was an associate of Hentze, the latter has been released while Pohl remains in the internment camp. I understand that the police dossier of Hentze reveals that he was in a position to obtain information concerning the movements of ships taking Australian wool to England. I wish to know whether it is a fact that the Minister for the Army obtained Hentze's dossier from the Police Department of New South Wales on the 22nd November last year. If so, the honourable gentleman must be fully aware of its contents. I am not setting myself up as a judge of who should be in or out; but there is plenty of room for improvement of the methods employed by the Government in regard to not only enemy aliens but also other persons' who are interned. Every person interned should be entitled to know the charge that has to be answered in order to obtain release. Not in any circumstances should an Australian citizen be interned. If one were guilty of an offence which the Government believed might endanger the national welfare, he could be apprehended; but he should then be properly charged and given a fair, open, public trial. This applies also to aliens who are not classified as enemies. I have placed before the department the case of a Greek citizen, a national of one of our allies. I do not claim to be .a judge of his case. He has been a resident of this country for many years, having arrived in it at an early age. He has references a defrom most reputable people, and is well known for his activities among the trade - unions. He was entitled to a fair, open, public trial, but was not given it. He was placed in an internment camp. The inquiries of the appeal tribunals are held in secret, and a man who wishes to clear himself does not know what charge has been made against him other than from what he can gather from the - examination of himself and the witnesses. The system should be completely overhauled. The Labour party has never objected to the internment of persons who, if allowed to remain at liberty, would be dangerous to the safety of this country; but the most stringent care should be exercised in order to avoid unjust internment. In every case, the Government should have sufficient evidence to support its action. It should not have the power to pick up people, including Australian citizens, who have no enemy origin, and place them in internment, without levelling a charge against them. Its methods are closely akin to Nazi methods, of which we strongly disapprove. Steps should be taken immediately to ensure that no Australian citizen, and no national of an allied country, is placed in internment until properly charged and given an open, public trial.",58
261,Mr DUNCAN,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"HUGHES (Wakefield) [6.4J - This matter raises most important considerations. The regulation in question does not apply to all internees, but relates only to enemy aliens; consequently, Australians are excluded from its ambit. We know perfectly well that there are Australian-born people of different races, and, I regret, members of the British race also, who are not lpyal. We are not now concerned with cases of that sort, but are dealing with enemy aliens, whether they be refugees or others. In approaching this problem, one has to draw a strong distinction between the ordinary civil law, under which we live at all times, and the military law. I have had some experience of the operation of the military law in the field, and, having practised for some years as a lawyer, I also have had some experience of civil law. I came to the conclusion twenty years ago that, on the whole, the military law gives a more just decision than does civil law. Three officers sit on a court martial. Certainly, they are not experts on points of law; nevertheless, they endeavour to do justice to those who are brought before them for trial. They look past all the legal details, in order to arrive at what appears to be the substantive justice of the I have seen something of their results, and am certain that substantive justice is more often secured in a military trial than in civil courts of law, in which a multitude of legal technicalities have to be surmounted in order that a proper decision may be given. Civil lawyers naturally, because of their training and upbringing, require nothing short of absolute truth; they have to be completely satisfied that no injustice can possibly be done. That that is admirable, will probably be agreed, particularly by lawyers themselves. The aim should be to prevent the possibility of mistakes being made in civil actions. But in time of war, especially one such as that in which we are now engaged, and above all in the light of what has happened in other parts of the world, we cannot afford to demand that complete proof be secured and that there is no chance of injustice being done. There is greater reason for the adoption of this attitude hecause alien internees are not really members of our own community, and we have not to be so careful with them as with our own people. That may seem a dreadful thing to say; but as a matter of fact they have not the ordinary legal rights in our community; they have not the right to vote, or to hold land.",59
262,Mr SPENDER,INTERNME NT APPEAL,It is not correct to that they have not the right to hold,60
263,Mr DUNCAN,INTERNME NT APPEAL,HUGHES - That is the position in some of the States. Mr .SPENDER - Not in any State. They have been entitled to hold land from time immemorial.,60
264,Mr DUNCAN,INTERNME NT APPEAL,HUGHES - The statement is not in accordance with my information.,60
265,Mr FADDEN,INTERNME NT APPEAL,They cannot in Queensland.,60
266,Mr DUNCAN,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"HUGHES - The Treasurer agrees that I have correctly stated the position in Queensland at least, and, therefore, am justified in what I have said. We should be foolish if we did not face the facts. We are dealing with men of the highest degree of ability, cunning and shrewdness, who are attempting to outwit us, and are extremely hard to catch. All of us sympathize with persons case. like the unfortunate Austrian Jews, who, having escaped from their first miserable experience, have been confined in. Australia. I know, however, that it was reported that on board most of the ships which brought them to Australia there were at least one or two emissaries of the Nazi party, if the refugees happened to be German, and of the Fascist party, if they happened to be Italian, the duty of whom was to keep an eye on the doings of the refugees, and report to their superiors overseas. At the risk of being described as a reactionary-as the honourable members for Deakin and Barker have been-o r a Fascist, I say that we cannot afford to permit these people to retain their liberty if there be the slightest suspicion against them. This subject is very widely discussed outside this House, if not in if. The experiences of most of the European countries, including Holland, France and Yugoslavia, and the present position of Egypt and Turkey, ought to give us an idea of how widespread and effective is the Nazi organization, which is pitting its wits against ours. If I should be told that what has occurred in other countries cannot happen in Australia, I should point to the warning uttered by the Premier of Queensland about a year ago, namely, that a very great mistake would be made if the dangers which have overwhelmed other countries were allowed to say arise in Australia by reason of the land. growth of a Fifth Column, in which event we should have no one to thank but ourselves. The Commissioner of Police in South Australia made almost precisely the same statement about eighteen months ago. A purely legal body is not the best one to choose to deal with aliens. I should have much more faith in an exclusively military body, or one which consisted of a military man, a. representative of the police department, and a lawyer, as being likely to hold persons who may be a menace to the community, than in three excellent lawyers, who would be intent upon seeing that there was no possibility of injustice heing done. When men have been interned, as has happened repeatedly since the commencement of the war, presumably on the advice of intelligence officers, who are not disposed to intern needlessly, it is calamitous that they should be released after a few weeks or months, because they arc then infinitely more dangerous than they would have been had they not been interned. There are bound to be grounds for suspecting disloyalty before a person is interned. For that reason, I support, the motion of the honourable member for Barker. Rilling suspended from6.J5 to S p.m.",60
267,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"Batman) [8.0] - I do not propose to make a long or deeply considered speech on this subject, though such a speech would not be inappropriate on a subject of such importance. motion before the Chair is that submitted by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), and is as follows:That Statutory Rules 194.0, No. 269, being amendment of National Security (Aliens Control) .Regulations made under the National Security Act 1939-1940, be disallowed. The rule was made under the national security legislation, and I myself was opposed to that legislation, as those who are interested will know. I am opposed also to many of the regulations which have been made pursuant to the powers conferred by that very drastic piece of legislation, and I took my stand on the same principles of law and justice that move me to oppose the motion submitted by the honourable member for Barker. I was surprised and disappointed a.t the speech made by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Duncan-Hughes). was not surprised at the speech made by the honourable member for Barker. I [30] was not. so much surprised or disappointed, at the speech made by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr. Hutchinson). His speech, I thought, was conceived in a peevish humour, and I thought that he did himself much less than justice in the sentiments which he expressed. But my. surprise and disappointment at the speech of the honourable menuber for Wakefield rests on the fact that, though I have always regarded him as a Tory of the old school, I have always believed him to be an honest and a closely reasoning Tory of that school. I have always listened to him with the respect due to those who hold opinions diametrically opposed to one's own for reasons which they are capable of stating firmly and well. The honoraihle member for Barker belongs to the militarist school. He stands by the Fascist theory in opposition to Fascism. He believes in countering like with like. I , on the other hand, believe that if the principles of democracy are worth dying for, they are worth maintaining in the face of death itself. The honourable member for Wakefield admits to being a la wyer. It is an. admission which I heard him make for the first time today, and that i= why I am the more surprised and The disappointed at his speech. The object of the regulations which the honourable member wishes to have disallowed is to enable persons interned, or liable to be interned, to have the charge of disaffection, whatever form it may take, heard and considered by an independent tribunal. In the primary interests of the safety of the nation, ordinary considerations of guilt do not in this case apply. The issue to be decided before these tribunals is whether, in all the circumstances, and having regard to the paramount necessity for preserving the safety of the nation in time of war, it is meet and just that the particular person whose case is presented before the tribunal should be at large or should be interned. In. my view, it is right and proper that that issue should be determined dispassionately by a properly constituted tribunal. The. honourable member for Barker sugI gested that aliens have no rights. I say ""that they have rights, and I , as a citizen of the British Commonwealth of Nations, am prepared to acknowledge the rights they have, because they are rights which we have given to them. The only qualification, the only pre-requisite, to the assertion of those rights by an alien is that he shall have set foot on .British soil. Wo other qualification is required of a person in Australia to enjoy the protection of Australian law than that lie should set foot on Australian soil. Once he is here, he is entitled to the tection of the laws of the country under whose flag he is. Just as he becomes, immediately he sets foot on our soil, entitled to the protection of the law, so at that very moment, he assumes the obligation of obedience to the law. The two things are correlative and intro-active, and they a're immediate in their operation. Whether this person in time of war is designated, under international law, as ""an enemy alien or not, the fact remains unchallenged and unchallen gable that, in war as in peace, he is under an obligation to obey the law, and is entitled to the protection of the law. On raOre than one occasion I have heard the honourable member for Barker, when speaking on other aspects of defence, state what was due by Australians to the British Commonwealth, and to Britain, the mother nation. I gathered that, if there was one thing more than another which inspired him to unswerving loyalty to the central authority, it was what he would call the British tradition, a tradition of which men of British blood are naturally proud, namely, that to the little island of Britain men have come from all parts of the world, and sought and found sanctuary there. It is true that in Great Britain as in other countries there exist more or le.ss arbitrary rules of extradition for the purpose of giving effect to the criminal law,, and to enable the long arm of the law to reach out for fugitives from justice; but it has always been the proud boast of British people that, within the confines of Britain, and subject to the laws of Britain, men could rise in the public parks or public halls and express themselves with greater freedom than in any other part of the world. As in this country, those rights have been largely abrogated in recent times, but in the past the claim was made on just and sound grounds. Mr Brennan.",61
268,Mr DUNCAN,INTERNME NT APPEAL,HUGHES - We are not at peace now; we are at war.,62
269,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"We are at war, and now, just as in time of peace, the enemy alien is required to obey the law. If an enemy alien in Australia were to assault an Australian citizen he would be haled before the courts under precisely the same forms of law, and would, be subject to precisely the same punishment, pro- as if he were a British subject. On the other hand, if he were himself assaulted, he has precisely the same right as has the most eminent British subject to bring also, his assailant before the courts of the country. If he has suffered pecuniary loss, he has precisely the same right to take his assailant before the courts and seek damages. It is for these very principles, which we have always claimed that we reverence in a. greater measure than they are reverenced in other countries, that this war is being fought. It is in defence of these principles that I have protested on every occasion, and in every place, when I have witnessed an. infraction of them. I have never failed to protest when I saw the censorship creeping into corrupt the liberty of the citizen, and to prevent free speech, just as .the Gestapo prevents men from meeting to utter free comment on public questions. The intrusion of Nazism in the form of regulations led me to oppose the National Security Act, and alio to oppose, in the name of liberty, a great many of the regulations which have been made under its aegis and protection. Because I have opposed all these things, I stand for this measure of justice which has been done to a class of - persons in this country who are entitled to the protection of our laws. If democracy is not equal in a democratic country to giving protection to people who are here by its permission, obeying its laws and paying its taxes, and in every way conforming to the duties of citizenshipalthough, for formal reasons that citizenship may not have been formally-granted to them-the n our fight is not for democracy, but merely for a transfer .of the dictatorships. I hope that the motion will not be carried.",62
270,Mr RYAN,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"Flinders) [8.17] - . My excuse for - participating in this debate is the fact that I have .had the'experience of "" running with the hare and hunting with the hounds "". For some years during the last war, and after that war, I was in charge of counter-espionage in 1 certain) countries,- and I know pretty well the. principles upon which counterespionage operates. I do not propose to discuss those principles in detail. 1 merely say that in time, of war the first principle of counter-espionage is to act first, and, if necessary, he sorry afterwards. In addition, I had experience, during the early months of this war, as a member of an alien appeals tribunal in this country. During that trine not many appeals were forthcoming, and I had heard only from 40 to 50 eases, when my service as a member of the tribunal terminated upon my election to this Parliament. Counter-espionage is normally unable to obtain 100 per cent, evidence against anybody. What you have to work on is merely the balance of suspicion as to whether an alien is, or is likely to be a danger to the country in which he happens to be. In many cases we found that the evidence against the alien was extremely slight; and the Army authorities admitted this. In about 36 of the 40 to 50 cases on which .1 sat, the tribunal recommended that the internee be released. That advice, was forwarded to the Minister, who acted upon it in some cases, but took no action in others. The point I emphasize is that the evidence in each appeal was very carefully considered, and in every case the appellant had counsel. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr. Hutchinson) said that it was manifestly unfair that a large number of poor internees should not have the advantage of assistance of counsel. My experience was that however poor an appellant might be, he was ably represented by counsel, who brought out the evidence in his favour to the best advantage. In every case the appellant was given a very fair hearing. The practice of these tribunals differs from that of an ordinary court of law. The tribunals decide their own procedure. They have nothing to guide them; and, therefore, are not bound by precedent. Theycan hear a case m camera, or in public, as they themselves decide. The practice of a tribunal differs from that of an ordinary court of law in another important respect. The tribunal must take into account the circumstances in which a prisoner appears, before it. An ordinary court of law always presumes that an accused is innocent until he is proved to be guilty. The tribunal works on the assumption that a good, strong case is held against an appellant to show that it is not in the interest of the country that he should be released. Therefore, the onus lies on the appellant to prove that he is innocuous to the safety of the country. Of the members of the tribunal on which I sat I think that, on the whole, I . was more lenient towards the appellants than any of my colleagues. A misapprehension seems to exist in the minds of some honourable members concerning the functions of these tribunals. They do not' give verdicts; they come to decisions in the form not, of recommendations which are forwarded in some cases to the General Officer Commanding of commands, and in other cases to the Minister himself! In the last resort, it is the responsibility of the Minister, assisted by his expert advisers, to decide whether the tribunals' recommendationsshould or should not be adopted. Thus, the Army authorities themselves have the final choice as to whether the alien is, or is not, to be released. The only criticism I have to offer against these tribunals is that, as they operate at present, they involve a certain waste of the time of military personnel, and a certain waste of money, insofar as the prisoners generally are brought long distances from internment camps under guard to appear before them. Instead of bringing the mountain to Mahomet we should bring Mahomet to the mountain by arranging for these tribunals to sit at the internment camps. The tribunals themselves are of definite assistance to the Minister, and to the Army authorities. In time of war the Intelligence Branch, and, above all, the Minister, are very much overworked. The reports and information collected about an internee may form a large file-in many cases several files-which, in the time at their disposal, various authorities must find it impossible to study. By the sifting of this mass of material, the tribunals render very great help to the military authorities and the Minister. I , therefore, oppose the motion.",62
271,Mr SPENDER,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"Warringah-Minister for the A r m y ) |S.25j - I desire to make a few observations with respect to the subject-matter of the motion. It involves principles, important in my conception, because I. think that they are part of the warp and woof of the system under which we live and for which we stand. When these regulations were introduced I indicated that .1 would not permit my sense of justice to he blunted during war. .I am not prepared to do so now. I want to make clear to honourable members the distinction between the kinds of tribunals that arc set up. The first is what is known as an Advisory Committee, which deals with Britishborn subjects, naturalized and non-enemy aliens. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), whose views I understand and respect, but with which .1. thoroughly disagree, has no objection to the Advisory Committee. He said so on a previous occasion. At this juncture let me make this observation: If , in respect, of the aliens tribunals, the military authority is to be regarded as the supreme arbiter of the fate and liberty of individuals, why is it considered that non-enemy aliens must be subject to any different rule? Dealing first with the Advisory Committee, I point out-that although 1I have not been very long in charge of this department, I have had suffithat cient opportunity to learn that dosI siers, which are submitted to the Minister, and upon which he either accepts or rejects the advice of his tary advisers, sometimes contain conconsistent tradictory information. Indeed, I have perused dossiers which revealed that, according to one source of informationand, frequently, the source is not in dicated- a person is an associate o.f Nazis, and, on the best possible authority, is a. Nazi. Then, on another page I find someone else saying that, the same person is a Communist, and is very strongly anti-Nazi. I do not say that that is a f example. T mention it to indicate what can, and does, happen. But the fact that it happens in one case indicates only too clearly how necessary it is for a Minister to go through each dossier most caref u l l y . I always endeavour to do so. I say bluntly, and categorically, that I refuse to act as a mere amanuensis in cases put before me by merely signing detention orders because the Intelligence Branch advises me to do so. Although it takes a great deal of time, I seek in every case to weigh the evidence as best I can, bearing in mind the paramount and primary need for security. It is my obligation to seek to give my own judgment in respect of all dossiers submitted to me. I now turn to the Alien Tribunal which is the subject-matter of the motion. As distinct from the practice applicable to the Advisory Committee, the recommendation of the Alien Tribunal does not come direct to me as Minister. subjects It goes, as the honourable member for Barker well knows, to the General Officer Commanding the particular command in which the case was heard. That is provided' for by the regulation. If the General Officer Commanding disagrees with the view expressed or the recommendation made, then, and only then, does it come to mo. These Aliens Tribunals have functioned for a considerable time, and they have heard many cases. Their recommendations have gone to the General Officer Commanding, the m i l it a r y man in charge of these matters, and I do not recollect, more than, at the outside, ten cases that have not been decided and resolved as between the General Officer Commanding and the tribunal. I do know it, is only in an exceptional case that a in called upon to exercise my judgment. What would honourable members ask me to do? Am I to accept purely the view miliexpressed by one side or the other, or, with the principle of responsible government, am I to exercise my own judgment as a representative of the people? I have no doubt what the answer of honourable members would be. Many aliens came to this country at our invitation. They came here in order to escape the Nazi scourge that we are now fighting. We invited them here, a i r gave them asylum, and said: "" He r e is your protection"". I do not say this in any spirit of captious criticism against the intelligence officers, who have a cult task to perform, but, like all humans, they are fallible, and I say quite plainly that I am not prepared to say to them: ""Whatever you say goes .with me"". The decision to establish theses Aliens nals was made by the War Cabinet itself. That is not said in any sense of extenuation. It was a wise decision, which had my complete and wholehearted support, and nothing which has taken the place since those tribunals were estabam lished has persuaded me to deviate from that view. Aliens are: people who are not Britishfor born or naturalized. There are few European countries which at present ledge are not under the domination of Gerone many. Is it to be said that those people, whether they be men or women, invited here or not, whether they have escaped from Nazi oppression or not, are to no righ t of audience at all? I know, and the honourable memlier for Barker knows perhaps better than I do, that i many cases when the dossier, upon which I have signed the detention order, goes before the Aliens Tribunal and is subhim jected to the tost of evidence and the objector to internment is examined and has a chance to defend himself, it has been revealed that the whole dossier upon which his internment is based collapses. .Frequently, the counsel appearing for me of - usuall y a military officer, because it is my jjractice. as the honourable gentleman knows, to appoint, as far as pracAustralian community. ticable, military officers for this duty - ha s admitted that there was not one shred of evidence on which the man could be detained. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr B y a n ) , ing had experience upon an Aliens T r i bunal, is much more experienced than I am in these matters, and he has Aliens supported the principle of the t r i bunals. .Political argument is not quired to prove that not all aliens who came to Australia necessarily ought to he interned. Indeed, it is known that the British subject in Germany is not sarily interned.",64
272,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"All of the aliens in Australia are hot interned, and I have not suggested that they should",65
273,Mr SPENDER,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"The primary concountry sideration is security. On the one hand, diffithe honourable member for Barker has no objection whatever to naturalized' aliens having the right to object to the Advisory Committee against their internment, but, on the other hand, no matter what the cirTribucumstances may be, he objects most strenuously to a similar right being given to aliens, many of whom have been here for too short a space of time in which to become naturalized. In the latter case, military officer's view is to prevail. I not prepared to accept that principle. I have found that in many cases the naturalized British subject has frequently taken out naturalization papers as a cover subversive activities. It seems to me quite inconsistent for any one with knowof the facts to argue that the rule in case is all right, but in the other, hopelessly wrong. There is no need for further argument when regard is had to the regulations. I direct attention to the have matter to which the honourable member for Flinders referred, namely, the heavy onus cast upon the person who objects n against internment. Security is the prime and only consideration which dictates this matter. The obligation is cast upon quite differently fro m the ordinary rule of law to satisfy ithe tribunal(a) tlutit it is neither necessary nor advisable for the public safety, the defence of the Commonwealth or the efficient prosecution the war that the person should continue to be detained; and (b) that the release of the person would not be likely to occasion serious unrest in any The honourable member for Flinders will agree that that is not a simple onus to discharge. The mere recommendation of the Aliens Tribunal, however, does not havconclude the matter. As I have said, it - is only rarely that I am. called upon to decide on the recommendation of an Tribunal, but, on many occasions, - T have seen reason to disagree when the reAdvisory Committee has recommended the. release of men, because I have always conceived it my duty to ensure that, if there be any doubt, that doubt must be necesresolved in favour of the country. I say to the honourable member for Barker that his desires and mine are one, that our objectives are one. I surrender be. to no man my desire to see that this is protected and to see that security is placed first and foremost, but 1 urn not prepared to say that the whole matter of internment should be within the arbitrament of military men. In short, I stand between our system of government and what may be sometimes necessary, martial law in the country. . There is only one other matter to which I desire to refer and that is the case of the man Hentze, to which reference was made by the honourable member for East .Sydney (Mr W a r d ) . first observation is that the man referred to is not an enemy alien. He is a naturalized British subject. Indeed, he became naturalized on the first available opportunity, namely, when he reached 21 years of age. I have already acquainted the House with the facte of his case. It is undesirable to intrude a personal view. I seek to avoid it . To my knowledge the dossier is deficient in vital particulars as to the reliability of the information it contains. Be that as it may, it is sufficient to say that, in accordance with the direction given by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), the dossier, complete in every detail, was placed before the chairman of one of the bodies set up to deal with these matters, and he, in the face of the dossier and irrespective of what views I or anybody else may have with regard to the reliability of the information in that dossier, came to the conclusion that no ground was revealed which could j u s t if y the internment of this man.",65
274,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"Barker) [8.38] - in reply-The case put up by the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender) would be very convincing if it were not for certain other regulations issued by the present Government which I shall read. The Minister has made great play on the fact that there should be, in his opinion, no difference between the treatment of naturalized and unnaturalized persons in this country. I think that in time of war there is a world of difference between the status of, on the one hand a person who was born here, who has naturalized through residence through undertaking certain obligations tb the Crown of England and to the British Commonwealth of Nations, and, on the other hand, an unnaturalized alien. In the case of one, by his change of nationality, his oath of allegiance to the Crown, and his residence in the country, you are entitled to expect that he will discharge certain obligations. Nevertheless, you are not entitled to waive your supervision over him. But the enemy alien is in a different class. The Minister for the Army referred to some of them having been invited to this country. I was a member of the Government that made that decision and I still My think that that decision was wrong. One of the best jobs that Adolph Hitle r ever did for Germany was to push some of those people out of his country. Yet we take them in here. All these things would be interesting if it were not for those regulations to which I referred earlier. On the 8th A p r i l there appeared in the Commonwealth Gazette under the name of the Attorney-General (Mr . Hughes) the following regulation:In pursuance of regulation 4A of the National Security (Aliens Control) Regulations, I , William Morris Hughes, Attorney General and Minister for the Navy, acting for and on behalf of the Minister of State for Defence Co-ordination, hereby exempt from the provisions of the said Regulations all aliens who are nationals of the United States of America or Greece.",66
275,Mr SPENDER,INTERNME NT APPEAL,They are not enemy aliens.,66
276,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"The Minister for the Army says that he stands for security above everything else. I think I am right in saying that the records of his own department show that before this regulation was published, certain Greeks and Americans were in terned in this country.",66
277,Mr SPENDER,INTERNME NT APPEAL,There are Greeks and Americans interned here now.,66
278,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,In the face of which the Attorney-General - signed that regulation.,66
279,Mr SPENDER,INTERNME NT APPEAL,I appreciate the force of the honourable member's remarks. It will not be long before that regulation is altered.,66
280,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"That is become another decision gone overboard like the and Irish sailor's kettle. It is not lost, because we know where it is; it is in the sea. There is another regulation signed by the Prime Minister dated the 20th June. I put this to the Minister as something which ""tops of f "" what he just said. This regulation docs not name any nationality. It is aimed at enemy alien seamen in this country. In case the Minister does not know at which nationality it is aimed, I will tell him that it is the Greek.",66
281,Mr SPENDER,INTERNME NT APPEAL,Than k you.,67
282,Mr AROHTE CAMERON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"This regulation treats alien seamen fo'und in this country today entirely differently from the enemy aliens who may have their objections heard by tribunals. '.Phis regulation saysWithout prejudice to the operation of the provisions of the Immigration Act 11)01-1940 and the National Security (General) Regulations, any allien seaman, whether he has entered Australia legally or not, who deserts or is absent without leave in Australia from the ship on which he is employed, or refuses to sail on such ship or any other ship sailing from Australia on which he has been offered employment, or is reported hy the master or agent of the ship for refusing to perform his regular duties on board such ship, or is so reported for inducing or attempting to induce ythcr alien sisaiucn to interfere i j i - any way with the proper operation of the ship on which they are employed, may, by order of the Minister, be arrested and detained, at such place as the Minister from time to time directs, for the duration of the present war, or until provision may be made for his deportation, or until he is ready and willing and actually proceeds to serve on a ship sailing from Australia. All constables are authorized to give effect to thEse regulations. Paragraph 3 statesAny alien seaman detained in .pursuance of this regulation may be employed on such labour and in such place as the Minister from time to time determines.",67
283,Mr SPENDER,INTERNME NT APPEAL,What relation has that to. the motion before the House?,67
284,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"I say it army officers. has a' very important relation. Alien seamen are to be treated in a different way from certain other aliens caught in this country. There is no consistency in the Government's attitude on this matter. I shall have more to say on this aspect of the question when I move another motion at a later stage today. It is about time that the Government began to take a realistic view of this matter. I have heard some of the Free French leaders talking on this tion, and I know the stories of the i filtration into Franpe and the low counhas tries to which the honourable member for Wakefield' (Mr Duncan-Hughes) referred to-night. I have heard of the condition's which existed in Norway and Poland, prior to their invasion, and no doubt the same stories will come from the Balkans in due course. There is no doubt that before Adolf H it l e r moved, against Russia, that country was absolutely honeycombed with German agents. One would think from the milk and water attitude adopted by the Government that every alien who came to this country had a pair of snow-white wings folded under his coat and was ready to develop as an angel whenever the Government wanted him to do so. As I informed honourable members when making this motion, I had the advantage of spending five interesting, but I am afraid, wasted weeks hearing appeals before these t r i bunals, and for the special benefit of the honourable member for Batman (Mr . Brennan) I should like to point out that the aliens are not charged with anything when they come before these t r i bunals. They are appellants, and the Commonwealth appears in the ridiculous position of a defendant before its own tribunal, defending "" itself for having taken necessary steps to ensure the security of this country in time of Avar. The position is Gilbertian. The Minister said that army officers appeared on behalf of the Commonwealth, but I attended the meetings of the tribunals in Melbourne for five weeks and never once was the Commonwealth represented by an army officer.",67
285,Mr SPENDER,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"I said that at least 80 per cent, of Government representatives appearing before these tribunals were",67
286,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,That must be a recent development.,67
287,Mr SPENDER,INTERNME NT APPEAL,It is not.,67
288,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"I could give the Minister the names of the members of the Attorney-General's Department who appeared. They were not army officers, nor were they appearing as such, but six or seven army officers had to hang around these tribunals, instead of being engaged on some more important queswork. So far as I am concerned, an n - enemy alien caught here in time of war no rights other than those which this Parliament chooses to give him. It is ridiculous to talk the way the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) does. If the British Empire goes down in this war or in any other war, it will do so for the simple reason that it is not prepared to square up to things like this. It is impossible to live in a world of make-believe in time of war. If the Government does not change its course in regard to these internees it will have an awkward incident or two on its hands. I appreciate the difficulties of the situation very well, but this is not a time for talking about our sense of justice being blunted. My opinion is that it should be particularly well sharpened in time of war. No risks whatsoever should be taken. Aliens are not interned, because they have done something, but because they might do something. It is not a question of a man having blown up a factory or a railway bridge, or wrecked a train.",67
289,Mr SPENDER,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"If there are grounds for suspicion in the case of any man who comes before a tribunal, he is interned.",68
290,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,That depends on the tribunal.,68
291,Mr SPENDER,INTERNME NT APPEAL,And on the military officer if the matter be left to him.,68
292,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INTERNME NT APPEAL,"Who is responsible for the security of this country, but the police and the army? A Minister may be nominally responsible, but he cannot ensure security unless he has the police and the army organization behind him. Although I realise that the majority of honourable members are against me in this matter, I say that this is not the way in which this important work should be conducted. In time of war, there is only one guiding principle, and that is "" don't take any risks at all "". I am afraid that sooner or later some risks will be taken. Question resolved in the negative.

293,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"Bourke) [8.47] I move That Statutory Rules 1941, No. GO, being amendment of the National Security (General) Regulations made under the National Security Act 1939-1940, be disallowed. In submitting that motion, I am exercising the right conferred upon individual members of this Parliament to challenge regulations made by the Executive. Regulation 42A set out in these Statutory Rules is substituted for a former regulation which the honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt) proposed to challenge. That regulation has been repealed, and this new one inserted in its stead. ] do not propose to discuss the previous regulation unless in reply to statements that may be made by honourable members or by the Minister in the course of the ensuing debate. The new regulation 42A will follow regulation 42, which, so far as it is relevant, provides-!2 - (1) A person shall not(a) endeavour, whether orally or otherwise, to influence public opinion (whether in Australia or elsewhere) in a manner likely to be prejudicial to the defence of the Commonsaid wealth, or the efficient prosecution of the (2) A prosecution in respect of a contravention of this regulation shall not instituted except with the consent of the Attorney-General. Tliat regulation has already been beEvatt) fore the High Court in the case Francis and Rowan, and I think I am right in saying that the construction placed by the High Court on the words which I have read was that in order commit an offence, a person must conmembers sciously endeavour to affect opinion. If he does that and the things he says tend to prejudice the defence the Commonwealth or the prosecution of the war, then, whether intended his remarks to have that effect or not, he is guilty of an offence. As shall subsequently show, that regulation is a much more drastic and punitive than the corresponding regulation i operation in Britain , and it differs f regulation 4 2 A in two main respects. First, under regulation 42A, a person may be convicted of an offence, although he has no conscious intention of affecting public opinion at all, and secondly, whereas a person cannot be prosecuted under regulation 42 without the consent object to it . of the Attorney-General (Mr Hughes) no such consent is required in the case of regulation 42A. Mr SI*EN:DEK - A regulation is about to be promulgated which makes prosecution conditional on consent being obtained fro m myself or some other Minister nominated by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies). It goes a part of the continued. way in that respect.",68
294,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"It goes a part of the way, as the Minister says, but I submit that it is much fairer to have the consent of the Attorney-General, because when the words "" the Minister "" are used, providesa Minister can usually delegate his power. I do not see anything that gives Attorney-General the same right to delegate his powers. That does not dispose statements of the substantial objection to regulation 42A. It may afford considerable protecsuccess tion to members of Parliament and inOT air ; fluential persons. I am convinced that the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin could have been convicted for what they about danger from the North; but I war; am satisfied that the Attorney-General would never have consented to a prosecube tion. Similarly, the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) and the honourable member for Barton (Dr could have been convicted for the of joint statement issued by them and published in the newspapers, but there again no Minister, and certainly not the Attorney-General, would have agreed to to a prosecution. I am satisfied also that of this Parliament could have public been convicted for many things they have said during the Boothby elecof tion campaign, but the Attorney-General efficient would never have consented to such he prosecutions. Under the new regulation as it stands before the amendment is I made, all sorts of unimportant persons can be prosecuted whether the Attorneyone General's consent is obtained or not. n During the war of 1914-18 regulations r o m sucfh as this is were used against uninfluential persons in the beginning, and when the hand of the law became stronger, it was laid on the representatives of the people and organizations of Labour. W it h that as an introduction I come to the regulation itself, and explain why I Debate interrupted. ORDER OF BUSINESS.",69
295,Mr SPEAKER,NATION AL SECURITY,Hon. W. M. Nairn). - Order ! The time allotted for the consideration of general business has expired. Ordered That the consideration of general business be SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES . MOTION TO DISALLOW REGULATIONS. Debate resumed.,69
296,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"Regulatio n 4 2 A 1. A person shall not, by word of mouth, the or in writing, or in any paper(a) spread false reports or make false or reports, or statements intended or likely to cause disaffection to His Majesty, or public alarm,- or to interfere with the of His Majesty's forces by land, sea As that is drawn, the casual reader might be induced to believe that the only per) sons who could be prosecuted under that regulation were those from whom false statements or reports had emanated. But that is not so. Under the regulation, although a statement may be perfectly true and not intended to have any of the effects condemned by the regulation, if a count considers that the words used tend to have those effects, the person who has uttered them has committed an offence. I believe that I am right in saying that this regulation provides that any person ""who uses words which are regarded by a court of law as tending to create alarm, to prejudice recruiting, or to lower the morale of the people, commits an offence for which he can be punished under the National Security Act. That is the chief cause of my objection. The regulation means that nobody can safely discuss the war policy of this Government or of the Imperial Government, or anything which in any remote degree is connected with the war, unless, of course, he is prepared to ""endorse, in its entirety, the Government's policy and its method of conducting the war effort. Paragraph (1.) (o) of the regulation continues(6) spread reports or, make statements intended or likely to prejudice the recruiting, training or discipline of any of His Majesty's Forces; I object to the words "" or l i k e l y "" . In my view a person who intends to do something which is opposed to the policy of this Government as laid down by law may reasonably enough be prevented from doing so or punished for doing so. But the regulation goes farther than that, and provides for the punishment of person who may not have had in his n-.iy intention of doing anything which the law discountenances. That meaning was assigned to words such as these during the war of 1914-18. The regulaannexations tion continues(c) make any statement advocating couraging any action intended or likely to prejudice or discourage recruiting; (d) make any statement in relation to war which is likely to lead to a breach of the pcn.ee: or (e) make any subversive statement. My objection to this is that the framers of the regulation entirely disregard the or speaks. state of mind, or the intentions, of any persons who so speak or write. They merely judged by what a court may think is the tendency of the words that Mr Blackbivrn. have been used. Similar provisions came before the High Court during the war of 1914-18, especially in the case of Sickerdick and Ashton. The matter in question in that case was a pamphlet, which had been published on behalf of the Labour party, advocating that the war should end with a peace concluded without annexations and without in demnities. The publisher of that pamphlet was the Industrial P r in t in g and Publicity Company of Melbourne. The publisher was prosecuted before a police magistrate at Melbourne. The magistrate held that, there was nothing in the words of the pamphlet prejudicial to recruiting. The Commonwealth appealed from that decision to the High Court of Australia which, on the facts and the law, reversed the decision and came to the conclusion that, on its construction of the regulation, the words published were prejudicial to recruiting. The following is an extract from the decision given in that case by Mr Justice Barton:The question is: Are these statements calculated to cause any who believe them to decide not to enlist? If so, they are likely to prejudice recruiting. . . . It is not to the purpose to consider what the respondent desired or intended to be the effect of his statements. The question is not whether he intended to prejudice recruiting but whether he printed something containing statements likely, that is calculated or tending to, prejudice recruiting. The attitude adopted by the High Court can be explained in these words:- "" Here we have a recruit undecided whether he a shall enlist or not. The effect upon him mind of reading this document may be that he will decide to defer his enlistment until he learns whether Great B r it a in is prepared to conclude a peact without and without indemnities."" Mr Lazzarini! - That was a bit or enstrained, was it not?",69
297,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"I believe that the it was the result of the use of the word "" l i k e l y "" in the regulation. The difference betwen "" intended "" and "" likely "" is that "" intended "" is concerned with the state of mind of the person who writes",70
298,Mr SVENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,That is the most diffiare cult thing in the world to prove.,70
299,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"The word "" l i k e l y "" is concerned merely with the effect of the roan's words upon his hearers or readers. One of the most important provisions of Regulation 42A is that it is an offence for a person to make any statement in relation to the war which is likely to lead to a breach of the peace. That merely means that, if the court before whom a man is brought, thinks that his hearers might have been provoked by his words to break the peace he is guilty of an offence, no matter how innocent his intentions may have been.",70
300,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,But a court is not entirely without common sense.,71
301,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"I am quite sure that police courts are very largely devoid of common sense in time of war. I speak as one who saw what was done in this country during the last war. The regulation also provides that a person shall not, by word of mouth, or in writing, or in any paper, make any subversive statement. In section 5 of the regulation, we see what persons are prone to call a definition but it is not a definition of "" subversive statement"" all. The eff ect of those words in section 5, beginning with "" subversive statement "", is that in addition to its natural meaning, certain other things may be included within the definition of the term. That is the result of the use of the words "" subversive statement includes "". When a draftsman uses "" includes "" he intends to convey that, in addition to its natural meaning, a term shall also cover certain other things. One of these things which is included in the meaning of "" subversive statement"" :isany statement intended or likely . . . to interfere with the national effort hy loweringthe morale of the civil population or of His Majesty's Forces. This regulation is said to be much milder than the former regulation which, instead of using 'the words "" lowering the morale"", had the words "" disruption of the morale "". Obviously any interference which brings about the disruption of morale is a much more vigorous interference than one which merely brings about the lowering of morale.",71
302,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,That view was not held by the honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt) with whom I discussed the alteration.,71
303,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"The Minister is very unfair to refer to the honourable member for Barton when he is not in the chamber. Had the Minister told the honourable gentleman that he intended to refer to him in this way, he would have been here to deny what the Minister has said. I have the very best reason for believing that.",71
304,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,The Advisory War Council also agreed to the alteration.,71
305,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"I also have the very best reason for believing that the Advisory War Council did not agree to it. I have a statement by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) to that effect. Section 5 goes on to say that "" subversive statement"" includes any statement intended or likely(b) to cause unlawful resistance to or interfere with the enforcement or adminis : tration of any law of the Commonwealth or any other part of H is . Majesty's dominions relating to naval, military or air forces or the training of any of those forces; Olio) to undermine public confidence in the currency of the Commonwealth or the at securities of the Commonwealth or of any State or to prejudice the successful flotation of any Commonwealth loan during the war. An intention to bring about some of the things included in paragraph b could fairly be punished. Paragraph c may mean that a person who says that it is hot necessary for the Commonwealth to borrow money on interest, as many honourable members and a number of senators have said, will be found guilty of an offence. The Minister says that he will amend the regulation so that the consent of the Attorney-General shall be.required before a prosecution can be launched. The degree of persuasion which would induce the Attorney-General to prosecute a member of Parliament would be much greater than would be necessary to induce him to prosecute some person outside of Parliament. In my opinion the effect of this regulation is that no person can safely discuss any point of Government policy which has a bearing upon the conduct of the war. I agree that a person who consciously intends to hamper the war effort should be punished by law, whether it be by regulation or statute. However, my objection to the regulation is not that it' deals with the person who intends to bring about certain results, or whose object in speaking or writing is to bring about certain results, but that it deals with a person who uuiy not contemplate such results.  brings about the same results.",71
306,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"When the honourable member hears what Great Britain has done in relation to this, I believe that he, as a born Briton, will he proud of the country that he has left, and ashamed of the country of his adoption and the opinions that he now expresses. In order to show how carelessly this regulation has been drafted, I refer to the proviso thatReasonable and temperate discussion in good faith of any existing laws or measures shall not be ddunicd to be a subversive statement within the meaning of this definition. That means that, once a law has been passed, reasonable and temperate discussion on those matters in good faith is permitted, but, when a law is proposed, a person has not the same protection. You can reasonably and temperately discuss in good faith the policy of conscription for home service, but you arc not protected if you discuss reasonably and temperately and in good faith the policy of conscription for overseas service. Mr SI'KSOKH,-Would the honourable member's objection be met by including after the word "" existing "" the words "" or proposed ""?",72
307,Mr BLACK BURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"Th at particular objection would be met, but I am drawing attention to this matter in order to show the careless way in which the regulation is drawn. I now turn to discuss certain ancillary provisions of the regulation. It states that the proprietor of a newspaper shall be guilty of an offence if he publishes a. statement spread or made in contravention of the regulation. That means that a person who prints or publishes a newspaper containing a. statement which, on prosecution, is held by a magistrate to be likely to cause public alarm, to prejudice recruiting, or to lower civilian morale, is guilty of an offence which is punishable. Then the regulation continuesA person shall not, without lawful excuse (proof whereof shall lie upon him ) , his possession any paper containing a report or statement which is or has been spread or made in contravention of this regulation. Taking those two provisions together, the regulation means that it may be alleged that a newspaper contains an article or a paragraph which tends to produce some effects which the regulations condemn, and that the owner of the newspaper and also the printer and publisher may be deemed guilty of an offence and punishable accordingly. Not only may they be guilty of the offenoe, but any person who has that newspaper in his possession may be found guilty of an offence, unless he can prove that he had a lawful excuse. Merely to say that he bought the newspaper would not be regarded as a lawful excuse. Mr Sr-END»K - Why not?",72
308,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"If the regulation intends that a person having in his possession a newspaper which he has bought has a lawful excuse for its possession, the regulation should say so. If it means that, it is entirely ineffective. I cannot conceive of any person, prosecuted for having a newspaper in his possession, pleading that he had bought it, and being upheld in his contention that that was a lawful excuse. The regulation does not mean that at all. Honourable members have suggested that a statement written or spoken, which a. court may think has a tendency to discourage enlistment, to discourage people from putting money into loans, to produce public alarm or to lower civilian morale should be punishable, and that the writer or speaker should he punished. I submit that that is wrong, and would achieve the result which the Prime Minister disclaimed when he said that he did. not want ""muzzled or silent criticism"". I. believe that this country suffers from a lack of criticism, and that no person except the sacrosanct member of Parliament or newspaper proprietor, will be free to criticize after this regulation has been enforced a little longer. My objection is, in essence, that such repression will lower the morale of the people. My objection to regulations of this kind is that they debase the free atmosphere in which the people have lived, making fh«m accustomed to greater and still greater invasions upon, and deductions have in from, their liberty. We are told that when Hitler arose he took freedom away from the German people, but that is not so. The German people were not free. For years they had been living under a system by which, their rulers destroyed their own liberty. I quote from a passage in a book by Professor J. H . Morgan, who was a brigadier-general with the Inter-Allied Militar y Commission of Control in Germany from 1919 to 1923. Writin g in 1924, he saidThe powers of the Keiuli'a President under article 48 of the constitution far exceed, any of the prerogatives of the Kaiser. They cover suspending and dispensing powers, for a parallel to which we shall have to go hack to the earlier Stuarts. During the four years I served in Germany there has not been a period in which, taking Germany as a whole, these powers have been dormant. When Chancellor Bruening governed Germany from .1.930 to 1932 the lieichstag was closed,, Germany was governed by military decrees, and in a Germany which had lost its freedom, and. whose sense of the value of freedom had disappeared, Hitle r rose to power . To a smaller degree that observation applies also to Czechoslovakia. Regulation 42, which I read at the outset of my remarks, was part of the original British defence regulations, and we copied it, but it is not part of those regulations today. It is remarkable that the farther one gets from the real seat of danger the less jealous one becomes of civil liberties. In Great Britain , liberties are preserved because the people there believe that they are fighting for liberty. The masses of the people of Britain, who endure the ghastly clew of death that is corning clown on them at all seasons, have nothing to lose except liberty. Three-fourths of the people of the North of England and of Wales have not in peace time enough food. Every year 50,000 preventable deaths occur in the North of England and in Wales. The people of Britain are not resisting Hitle r in order fo defend their evil material conditions. They are resisting because they believe that they are fighting to defend a liberty which is the common possession of all of the community. When the regulation was passed in Great Britain it provoked snclh an outcry that it was modified. Although the war position has become more and more critical for Great Britain , that country has not gone back to the old regulation. I have here a copy of Butterworth's Emergency Legislation Service, which gives the whole of the British regulations up to Bhe 28th .February of this year. The regulation that corresponds fo our Regulation 42A provides- . No person shall(a) endeavour [by means of any false statement, false document or false report] to influence public opinion (whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) in a manner likely to be prejudicial to the defence of the realm or the efficient prosecution of the war . . . . and it shall be a defence to any prosecution in respect or a contravention of this paragraph to prove that the person by whom the contravention >"" alleged to have been committed had reasonable ca.use to believe that the statement, document or report iri question was true. Under Regulation 42A the Government prosecutes a man for making a statement without regard to whether it be false or - true, but in Britain it is held that the prosecution must prove the statement to be false, and even then the accused is not punished if he can prove that he reasonably believed the statement ro be true. That is the position in B r it a in today, where the ]jeople are in a. much greater state of danger than are the people of Australia. The rulers of B r it a in wane to show the people there that the principle for which they are fighting is real liberty, which they endeavour to maintain in times of war as well as in times of peace. But in Australia we destroy that liberty. I. submit that anybody who favours the regulation which I have read in this House approves of a system under which there will be a. virtual reign of terror in nhis country so far as the free expression of opinion is concerned. As I !i::ve said, nobody will be free to express any opinion at all. If that opinion relates to matters concerning the vital interests of the country, such us the war effort and the proper way to finance the war, any discussion of those matters will expose persons who have said or written those things sections to prosecution. It is true that if the Government makes its proposed amendment, the prosecution can be brought only with, the consent of the Minister, but that is not freedom. The Minister can exempt certain persons from prosecution and can have others prosecuted, but that is not the road to free discussion and criticism. Where would B r it a in have been with regard to the production of munitions during the Great ""War if Lord Nor.tholiffe and his press had not defied the regulations? They defied the legulations and won. Under regulations such as that now under consideration, no one, who has any regard for his own liberty, and for the interest of his own occupation, or for the interests of his wife and children, will dare to engage in criticism unless he is one of the highly protected class of press magnates, members of Parliament or members of the Ministry. If the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) dared to say outside this House what he has said here he would be liable to prosecution. If (he honourable member for Bendigo (Mr. Rankin) were not a brigadier-general, but were only an ordinary citizen, and dared to say outside anything like some of the things he has said here-- ",72
309,Mr RANKIN,NATION AL SECURITY,"I have said more outspeech. side than here. . Mr BLACKBURN - But the honourable member knows that the Minister for nlie Army is not likely to prosecute him. He is not likely to prosecute even me, at present, at any rate. At the beginning of the last war it was said that the persons prosecuted were revolutionary socialists and religious men. In the course of time members of this Parliament were prosecuted, trades halls were raided, officials of labour organizations were fined and in some instances sent to jail. It was for that reason that I used the words "" at present "". Strong supporters of the Government are not likely to be prosecuted by the Government.",74
310,Mr RANKIN,NATION AL SECURITY,"'Some persons who are presidents and secretaries of unions should be put behind bars with the people who are running the Broken Hill show, as I said last night.",74
311,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"I admired the speech of the honourable member for Bendigo last night. He had something for everybody. He was against conscription, which will please the workers of Bendigo; he wants something done for the farmers, so that will satisfy rhe farming community; he favours assistance to small industries so that, will ensure that the small business people in his constituency will support him! Altogether, he has made an admirable observation from the point of view of a politician. It is a great pity that it was not made on the public platform.",74
312,Mr RANKIN,NATION AL SECURITY,It was the speech of a man.,74
313,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"I agree with the honourable member ; but there are men of all kinds. I have no desire to quarrel with the honourable gentleman, for I have always regarded myself as being on personal and friendly relations with him, and I desire that situation to continue. I have no animus whatsoever towards the honourable gentleman. Nor, for that matter, have I any animus towards the Minister for the Army. What I dislike is the policy of the Government as expressed in this regulation which I hope the House will disallow.",74
314,Mr WARD,NATION AL SECURITY,"East Sydney) [9.36] I. second the motion and reserve my  support the attitude of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn), towards the regulation embodied in Statutory Rule No. 69 of 1941. I am prepared to go much further than the honourable member has gone. Any regulation which restricts, in any way whatsoever, the expression of public opinion in this country, under either peace or war conditions, is, in my view, calculated to injure this country in its fight against Fascism and other subversive forms of organization detrimental to the public. T have expressed myself emphatically on this subject on other occasions and I shall not speak at any length. We are a people with opportunities for education and most of us possess some reasoning faculties even though we all may not have had the advantage of a secondary education. The first purpose of education is to equip every individual with the capacity to reason for himself. People who are given the opportunity to reason should also be given the right to express their opinions. I consider that one individual has as much right as another to express his opinion and to advocate any particular line of action. After all, the peril and terror that we are fighting today has arisen through the suppression of opinions contrary to the views of authority which attempted to stifle freedom of speech and action. The absurdity of regulations of the kind under notice is shown by the final proviso of the regulation which reads:Provided that reasonable - and temperate discussion in good faith of any existing laws or measures shall not be deemed to be a subversive statement within the meaning of this definition. My reading of history tells me that the great movements that have arisen from time to time for the emancipation of mankind have not had their origin, or won their way to success, by means of reasonable and temperate discussion; in Fact, in many instances the opinions of the persons favouring emancipationist movements have been intemperately and even violently expressed. the individuals concerned been satisfied with temperate language the movements in which they were interested would probably have been unsuccessful. Free expression of opinion implies freedom of decision. Generally speaking, discussion is. for the purpose of influencing decisions. It may be that the decisions are good; they may sometimes lie bad; and at other times they may be in between.",74
315,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,Thos e usually are heat decisions.,75
316,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL SECURITY,"The honourable member for Ballarat is not always reasonable and temperate in his utterances.  saying that the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) is not always reasonable and temperate in his statements. He should remember that the time may not be distant when the members of the Labour party will be seated on the Government side of the House. When that time comes it may be that a regulation of this description may be operated to place behind bars the honourable member himself and others who hold similar opinions which are considered to be subversive of the best interests of the nation. Personally I should never be tempted to take action of that kind however much I disliked the views of a man, unless he indulged in violence or incited, other people to violence. Whether I consider a person's statement fair, reasonable, stupid or simply inane I would not suggest that violent action should be taken against him. Naturally. I expect other people to adopt a similar attitude towards me. As I hold these views. I am naturally opposed to this regulation, and I have no hesitation in vigourous.ly denouncing it. To show how farcical provisions of this kind really are, I point out to honourable gentlemen, that statements have been published in the journal of the Empire Parliamentary Association, of which I am a member, which, if published by private individuals or certain other journals, might easily be regarded as subversive and prejudicial to recruiting. I have actually read statements in the journal of the Empire Parliamentary Association which, in the opinion of some old judge or magistrate, might be Had calculated to undermine the morale of the people. I have noticed with sorrow that certain magistrates of this country have imposed what I regard as savage sentences on some individuals who have made statements which, though stupid, could not in the circumstances in which they were made, be regarded as prejudicial to recruiting or to the war effort. I have in mind a particular case which has not, I think, been given much publicity in the the press. A returned soldier was alleged to have said in a bar in a Melbourne hotel: "" To hell with the King. Hitler will win this war "". No doubt he was somewhat under the influence of liquor at the timeI n any case, it would be ridiculous to suggest that a statement made in such circumstances could prejudicially affect either recruiting or the nation's war effort. Yet that unfortunate individual was required to appear before a suburban court in Melbourne which sentenced him to six months imprisonment. I regard that as a savage sentence imposed by a savage magistrate.",75
317,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,"My recollection of the case is that the words went much further than the honourable member has suggested.  that they did, it is unlikely that the utterances of a man in such a condition would prejudicially affect recruiting or undermine the morale of the people in the hotel bar where the words wore uttered, or anywhere else. I should have given such a mail 24 hours in the "" cooler"", or have required him to put lOi. in the poor box. That would have been a sufficiently severe punishment for him. We are fighting for democracy, and we ought to do our best, to preserve for people the right of free speech. I know that some honourable members opposite think very differently from myself on some questions, and probably they would like to prevent me fro m expressing myself freely. It may be that some honourable gentlemen on this side of the House greatly dislike the views expressed by some honourable gentlemen opposite and would, if they could, prevent the ances-of such views. I do not favour such action. I hope that I am sufficiently intelligent to be able to judge between right and wrong and to conduct myself as a reasonable man. The history of this country, and of other countries for that matter, shows that the rights and privileges of the people can be preserved only if freedom of speech is preserved. For that reason I express my hostility to the regulation before the House and I hope that it will be disallowed.",75
318,Mr CALWELL,NATION AL SECURITY,"Melbourne) [9.44] I have been inspired to make some remarks in support of the motion of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr . Blackburn) because of the eloquent, forcible and aptly illustrated speech just delivered by the honourable member for  to which objection is now being taken may not always be interpreted by reasonable and fair-minded men. We had an example this morning of the maladministration of the censorship regulations which showed us that it is not safe to assume that severely exr>ressed regula- but tions will always be interpreted temperately and reasonably. Apparently the dangerous people in the community cannot be caught under regulations of this kind. The only ones who are caught are those who either are foolish or are not responsible for what they say. The case referred to by the honourable member for Ballarat was that of a man named Moore, who in a Melbourne hotel made some extraordinarily stupid statement. Moore is the victim of experiences which he went through at Gallipoli. I have known him for twenty years. He has been reduced to the state of a human derelict. It would be better if he were put in a home, and kept there for the rest of his life. He is not responsible for his actions. I-have known hi m to say our extraordinary things in conversation in the street. He is such a. public nuisance that he is avoided. Under the influence of liquor, he made an outburst for which he was haled before the court and publicly stigmatized as an enemy of the nation, a saboteur,' a fifth columnist, a provocateur-on e of those people who disturb the sleep and terrorize the waking moments of the honourable member for utter- Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) and others. 'He was treated with the due severity of the law which a most conscientious magistrate thought fit to impose upon him. Under whatever regulations he acts, the Minister should see that magistrates take a reasonable view of all the circumstances of the case. The practice is that only police magistrates handle these cases. It is felt that police magistrates or stipendiary magistrates are better fitted to weigh the evidence caref u l l y and see that justice is done, than are honorary justices. Honorary magistrates are generally drawn from suburban bumbledom, and my experience of them and of police magistrates and stipendiary magistrates is that there is not much to choose between them. On the one hand some police magistrates develop extraordinary idiosyncrasies. For instance, some of them take a particularly keen interest in imposing heavy fines on starting price bookmakers. Others impose very high penalties on people who are found i u hotels after trading hours, yet have a tender solicitude for those who k ill their fellowmen whilst speeding in motor cars. . On the other hand, some magistrates impose most severe sentences on persons who are guilty of motoring offences. To my mind, none of these people, taken by and large, can be relied upon to deal out evenhanded justice in a moment of crisis or public excitement. I listened to the submissions of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Duncan-Hughes) and particularly to his reference to the uniform fairness of military tribunals. I am not enamoured of military courts, but neither do I like the justice which is sometimes meted out by courts of petty session. I support the motion of the honourable member for Bourke.",76
319,Mr WARD,NATION AL SECURITY,"East Sydney) [9.50] - 1I have only one or two things to say regarding this proposal. First, I endorse the action of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) in moving for the disallowance of this regulation, and I compliment him upon the excellence of the case that he has presented to the House. As evidence of its excellence is the fact that the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender) is silent and has no reply to offer to his criticism. The honourable member for Bourke referred to the effect that this regulation may have on parliamentary representatives. I agree with him that, for a time, parliamentary representatives need not be afraid that they will be affected by this regulation. The great majority of the people have not been affected, and are not likely to be affected, by it. But the mere fact that the regulation is so embracing will be a threat to any member of Parliament, trade union leader, or member of the genera] public, that the Government has the power to take action against him i so desires. Moreover, the regulation is inconsistent with the statement by the Prime Minister when the war commenced that the last thing that he desired was a muzzled Opposition. If this regulation remains, and the Government cares to muzzle the Opposition, the power to do so will be there. With the regulation in existence, practically no criticism could be levelled against the Government without incurring risk. From time to time honourable members circulate the speeches which .they make in this House. Both here, and on the public platform, I have made statements which 1 imagine could, if the Government so desired, be construed to be an infringement of this regulation. On various platforms I have said on many occasions that the best way to lose the war is to keep the Menzies Government in office. The Attorney-General (Mr Hughes) would probably regard that as a subversive statement. I have also said that members of the Australian Imperial Force are underpaid, that some of them have been ill-treated in various military camps, that many of them have not been properly fed, and that they were sent into action ill equipped. It. could be said that those statements had the effect of retarding recruiting. My criticism of those members of this Parliament who have given themselves military rank, or drawn military pay whilst members of this Parliament, could be said to have the effect of influencing in some way men who would be likely to offer for service in the defence forces of this country. I have also referred to the treatment of men in one of the detention camps. I have also pointed out that the Government was not anxious to penalize Captain Lees, a high officer at the Holdsworthy camp who was guilty of a deliberate breach of the regulations. I have criticized his transfer to another sphere. These things could be said to have been prejudicial to recruiting. I want to see this regulation completely disallowed, not amended; but whether it be disallowed or not it will not affect my general attitude. Nor will that attitude be affected by any threat which the Government may make. In any statement which I make outside the f it Parliament, I always adhere strictly to the truth. Should I make a statement outside this Parliament, and should that statement be repeated by some person who hears me speak, it would bo rather illogical to convict the person who repeated what I had said and yet for no action to be taken against me. There is also the possibility of prejudicing the successful flotation of a Commonwealth loan. Members of my party, including myself, have always protested against the present system of financing the war. We have said that it is against the best interests of the people. It may be said that my statements regarding orthodox finance are prejudicial to the floating of a. loan. Clearly, therefore, this regulation, is designed, not to protect the welfare of the community, but to protect the Menzies anti-Labour Government against the criticism of Labour representatives, trade unionists, and Labour leaders outside Parliament. I am a member of the Labour party, which has ideas which differ fundamentally from those e.poused by the Government. I am not here to assist the Government to pass this regulation even on the promise that members of Parliament will be given immunity or because the Attorney General will have to approve any prosecution. I say to my colleagues that it is a paltry bribe and an insult to their integrity and to their standing amongst the workers of this country. I appeal to all who are true believers in democracy and in the right of free discussion to join with the Opposition in carrying the motion for the disallowance of this regulation.",77
320,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,"Warringah-Minister for the Army) [9.57] - I shall confine my remarks to the arguments advanced hy the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) which give point to the whole of the issues which have been raised in connection with this regulation, and I hope that the House, after consideration of them, will reject the motion. It will be remembered that this regulation was introduced after a previous regulation had been objected to by the same honourable member. Certain discussions - I shall not say more than' that at the moment-too k place between myself and the honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt), following which the present regulation was gazetted. I do not desire to indicate the nature of those discussions, becausie there is a dispute apparently between that honourable member and myself as to our recollection of what took place. I say, however, that if one examines the regulation, it will be found that it is intended to deal with matters which affect the security of the State and the prosecution of the war. The honourable member for Bourke does not object to regulation 42A 1 a insofar as it relates to the words, "" A person shall not, by word of mouth, or in writing, or in any paper, spread false reports or make false statements or reports intended to cause disaffection to His Majesty, or public alarm, or to interfere with the success of His Majesty's Forces by land, sea, or air."" Thie objection taken is to the words ""or statements"". The honourable member for Bourke referred to the English legislation. I would, however, point out that a statement can be such as not to contain any statement of fact at all, and so not be capable of being proved to be either false or true. A person may say, for example, ""would - you not be a fool to-offer your life for your country?"" or ""would it not be foolish for you to go overseas and fight? "" Neither of those statements would be a statement of fact, but it would be a statement intended to cause disaffection or public alarm. I give those examples, because it seems to me that the English legislation does not go far enough, and that the statement should not necessarily be false in order to be punishable. I think it will be accepted, upon consideration, that false statements, or any statements intended to disaffect or to cause public alarm, should come within the ambit of the regulation. I have now to deal with the words "" or likely to cause "". Those words are common to paragraphs a, b, c and d of subregulation 1, of Regulation 42A. They are well-known words, both in legal acceptance and in ordinary parlance. They are introduced because it is very difficult indeed-as the honourable member for Bourke will acknowledge-to prove intent. Probably that is the most difficult thing in law to prove. It has been well said: "" The devil himself knoweth not the mind of man "". A man can be judged only by what he does. To prove his state of mind is exceedingly difficult. I say with respect, that if the regulation were to have deleted from it the words "" or likely to be "", it would be completely emasculated.",78
321,Mr ROSEVEAR,NATION AL SECURITY,Do not the use of those words make defence very hard?,78
322,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,"I shall come to that. I submit, with respect to the honourable member for Bourke, that probably the majority of cases would be not capable of proof because of the impossibility of proving the state of mind of the individual. The words "" or likely to cause "", are determined in an objective sense. The honourable member for Bourke has rightly said that the interpretation of the courts is, first: Has the speaker:-o r writer, as the case may be-intende d to persuade public opinion?",78
323,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,That is under the existing regulation.,78
324,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,"Exactly . The application will, I apprehend, be substantially the same under this. Secondly: In these circumstances, are the words which he uses likely to produce the result which you are seeking to prevent? With respect, I submit that, upon examination., it - will be admitted that the extreme cases mentioned become insignificant; because the case is determined not by minutiae-by what, on an extreme view, could be brought into the regulation - bu t upon what, on a fair interpretation, is iikely to be covered by it. The protection exists that, if so desired., no prosecution shall take place without the consent of the Attorney-General. I think that I am fair in saying, without expressing any yiew as to whether or not the regulation is acceptable to the Labour party, that at least the Government was urged to make any prosecution under it subject to the condition that the consent of a Minister- I believe that I was the Minister indicated-shoul d first he given to its being launched.  ter say, "" I have not time to deal with it ; let the court deal with it? """,78
325,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,"Quite the contrary. Quite a number of these cases have been put to me-the Attorney-General first puts them to me-and I have always looked at the facts. I have agreed to prosecution in. some cases, and have refused to agree to it in other cases. I am, however, prepared to make any prosecution subject to the consent of the Solicitor-Generalan officer quite independent of the Government-firs t being obtained. With that provision, all of these cases which have been mentioned as cases in which injustice might occur, would be amply safeguarded. I pass .to sub-clause 4, which providesA-person shall not. without lawful excuse (proof whereof shall lie upon him), have in his possession any paper containing a report or statement which is or has heen spread or made in contravention of this regulation. It was urged by the honourable member for Bourke-doubtles s as an extreme case for the purpose of testing the matter-that the mere possession of a newspaper containing matter in contravention of this regulation would itself be an infringement of the regulation and. therefore, punishable. My comment is, that the words "" without lawful excuse"" must be given, some meaning, and u definitely clear meaning-in which respect I am apparently at issue with the honourable member for Bourke. T put it to him-no t in any sense as a challenge to his judgment upon a question of law, but in. order to test the matter-Why should it not come within the words ""without lawful excuse""? 1 cannot conceive that the words would be given such a limited interpretation as not to cover the case of a person innocently in possession of a newspaper containing subversive matter. I repeat that the rules of interpretation require that words, when used, must be given some force and effect. Assuming that I amwrong, the brake-if I may use that term-whic h I suggest, would be introduced by the consent of the Solicitor General being a pre-requisite to a prosecution, would dispose of any difficulties along those lines. The further argument was advanced by the honourable member for Bourke that under sub-clause 5 the definition of "" subversive statement"" is not completely exhaustive; that it includes certain actSj but does not exclude other acts. It is quite apparent that there could be clear cases of subversive statements which do not come within paragraphs a, b and c of subclause 5. Those paragraphs are limited in their character, for the purpose of making it quite clear that the matters mentioned are to be regarded as subversive. As a matter of law, subversive statements are fairly clearly defined; but these matters in particular, it is intended, should clearly be .brought within the definition. In this respect, also, I say that, in any event, protection would be afforded by the suggestion I have already made. The last comment relates to the. proviso to sub-clause 5. which readsiProvided that reasonable and temperate discussion in good faith of any existing laws or measures shall not be deemed to be a subversive statement: within the moaning of this definition. The purpose of that is to prevent its being urged that mere temperate or reasonable discussion conld be regarded as being the subject, of an offence. The point has been made that it refers to any existing laws or measures. It might not be of much use to say that I find it difficult to believe that any discussion which takes place is not based upon existing laws or measures; but as the point has been raised, and I have given the undertaking that, if the - regulation be accepted, I am prepared to provide that the consent of the Solicitor-General shall be a pre-requisite in respect of any prosecution, I am willing to insert the words "" Or proposed"" after the words "" any existing "". That, I believe, disposes of the specific matters mentioned by the honourable member. I urge honourable members not to be carried away by any --uggestion that minor matters will be dealt with under this regulation. If it i * suggested that it could, I say with (-very respect that no prosecution may be launched without the consent of the Solicitor-General completely disposes of the contention that the regulation could be used by political parties for the purpose of stifling political discussions or for purposes not solely concerned with the security of the country.",79
326,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"Bourke) [10.11]. - in reply-The Minister says that the English legislation does not go far enough. I repeat that regulation 42,\ is a copy of regulation 39& of the British regulations. tion 39b was amended as I have suggested on the 23rd November, 1939, and has not since been altered. Minister says that it is difficult to prove intention. Intention is inferred not merely from what a man says he is going to do but as a necessary consequence of what he is doing. If it be difficult' to prove that a thing"" is intended to hav° an unlawful effect, it is too easy to prove^ that it is .likely to have an unlawful effect. In trying to avoid Scylla we f all into Charybdis. In trying to say that we will punish offenders who use words likely to have unlawful effect because we cannot prove intent, we shall punish the innocent critic of legislation.",80
327,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,Would he not be protected by the provision that the Solicitor General has ifirst to give his consent before a prosecution can be launched.,80
328,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"I am dealing with the points I make in my own way. The Minister is at issue with me about the words "" without lawful excuse "". I cannot see how the fact that a man had bought a newspaper would be a lawful excuse for his possession of the newspaper within the meaning of this regulation. If that be so, a man could never be convicted under this regulation. In the raids made upon people's houses, even waste-paper baskets were searched. In one instance acopy of Progress, a journal published by the State Labour party of New South Wales, was taken away ae being a suspicious circumstance in connection with the man whose house was searched. I agree that the words "" subversive statements"" have a well known meaning; but the regulation tries to suggest that the words are limited to apply to the acts set out in paragraph 5 whereas they mean everything enumerated in the regulation. The Minister endeavours to conciliate the Opposition by suggesting that prosecutions could not be launched without the consent of the Solicitor-General. That, of course, is better than the consent of the Minister, but it still means that people in this country are holding their freedom of speech upon the will of one man. That is not liberty. There is no freedom when some person in the community has the power to punish "" A "" and. to exempt the equally guilty "" B "" . This is, in Regula- effect. :i power to dispense with laws. The provision that the consent of the Solicitor-General is a condition precedent The to prosecution does not conciliate me. 1 repeat that, some of the things that thi= regulation seeks to do arc fit and proper things for the law to do. A. person who makes false statements intended to bring about unlsnvful effects or other statements intended ro bring about unlawful effects should be punished. The person I am endeavouring to protect is the 'innocent person who, like myself, may make statements likely to affect the people. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr . Ward) spoke of his attacks on the Menzies Government. In the course of judgment in Franr.in and Rowan it was said by judges that the statement that the Menzies Government was a representative nf monopolists was a subversive statement. Mr MENZI.KS - It was most untrue but not subversive.",80
329,Mr BLACKBURN,NATION AL SECURITY,"To say that the Menzies Government was a minority Government was also a subversive statement in the view of one of the judges. Whilst I am dealing with Francis and Rowam, may I say that that case decides that existing regulation 42, which the Government thinks is insufficient, requires, first of all, proof of endeavour to affect public opinion, and after that that the words used are deemed by a magistrate as. likely to produce theforbidden results. The regulation which I am trying to eradicate goes beyond regulation 42. It does not require proof of conscious intention to affect public opinion. Let ns consider the case cited by the honourable  a drunken man in a bar who makes statements to the people with him. Can anybody believe that he was consciously intending ro affect public opinion by those statements? Yet that is the kind of person this regulation has brought into the dragnet of the law. In asking the House to reject, it. I believe I am protecting not only the freedom of members of Parliament and press magnates, but also the right, of the ordinary man in the street fo speak hi.s mind on things concerning the welfare of the country.

331,Mr FORDE,NATION AL SECURITY,Capricornia) [10.25] The Prime Minister might be good enough to indicate to honourable members when the Government expects Parliament to be summoned to meet again.,81
332,Mr BHENNAN,NATION AL SECURITY,"The Government put a limit on the recess on a former occasion but did not adhere to the arrangement. .. 22 Mr Forde -'That is so. On this . . 21 occasion, however, I realise that as Supplywas passed for a period of two months the Government is bound to summon .Parliament to meet before the end of AYES. August.",81
333,Mr MENZIES,NATION AL SECURITY,"I should think it would be towards the end of August. It is impossible to fix an exact date. The next period of the session will be devoted to the budget, and naturally it will be held as early as possible, because the Government wants to get in its revenues.",81
334,Mr FORDE,NATION AL SECURITY,"Obviousl y it does not suit the right honourable gentleman to fix an exact date for the reassembling of the Parliament. I want to guard against NOES. our being called together and given probably only one day to pass a Supply Bill. We should not again be given insufficient time in which to consider a. bill authorizing the expenditure, of millions of pounds, if, by summoning Parliament to meet a week earlier honourable members could be given an opportunity to scrutinize that expenditure and prepare for a nioi-e lengthy discussion of the bill. These discussions are of increasing importance as the war expenditure rises and as the seriousness of the international position grows. Consequently, I think it is only fair that the Prime Minister should indicate more specifically the date upon which the sittings are to be resumed. the right honourable gentleman will do that, honourable members on this side of the House will be satisfied. On a previous occasion, the Prime Minister gave an assurance thai: Parliament would be called together not later than a certain date. The sittings of Parliament .should not be so limited that honourable members have only a few hours in which to consider the business placed before them. We sat until nearly 3 o'clock this morning. It appears that we shall have to sit late again to-night, and honourable members even then will not have time to debate properly the various matters that are to come before the House. I am told that we are to be asked to pass Supplementary Estimates providing for the expenditure of more than £2,000,000. It is true that the expenditure was incurred in the financial year ended the 31st June, 1.940, but Parliament has not previously had an opportunity to scrutinize it. I have the Auditor-General's report dealing with this period, but I have had no time to consider it. I ask the Prime Minister fo afford honourable members sufficient time, when Parliament is called together again, to consider the budget without, restriction.",81

341,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL SECURITY,"Barker) [10.33] - I move That Statutory Kules 1941, No. 75, being amendment of the National Security (Supplementary) Regulations miadc under the National Security Ac.t 1939-1940, be disallowed. This regulation, to my mind, is an unusual one. No reason has been advanced by the Government for this extraordinary departure from precedent and tradition. The facts are that the regulation sets out that any alien, not being an enemy alien, may be granted a commission in the Army, Navy or Air Force at the discretion of the Minister concerned. I do not know much about legal matters, but there are in Cabinet one or two legal men, one of whom is the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender) above whose signature this regulation was issued, and I should like him to tell me how the King can sign a commission to an alien, how he addresses his "" trusty and well-beloved "" when the recipient of that commission does not owe allegiance to him ? I understand that section 95 of the British Army Act, unless it has been repealed recently, lays it down that a commission shall not be granted to an alien. An alien may be enlisted in the British Forces, but the number of aliens in the Forces shall not exceed one man in 50, and they shall not receive promotion beyond the rank of non-commissioned officer or warrant officer. The section does not expressly exclude the granting of commissions to aliens, but it does expressly limit the.promotion of aliens beyond the rank of warrant officer, which is one rung below commissioned rank. With all the force 1 can summon 1 put to the Minister and to every honourable member this question: Are we so short of leaders in the Army, Navy and Air Force that we have to enlist and commission aliens in order to lead our men into action? When we ""are enlisting forces to go overseas we ought to provide that those forces shall be led and officered by men of our own nationality. I understand from little (things that I have heard that the Minister will probably argue that this regulation is necessary in order to overcome some difficulties in regard to citizens of the United States of America who may desire to serve in the British Forces. If that be the position, I ask the Minister to put the hoot on the other foot. Would an Australian who wanted to serve in the army of the United States of America - be permitted to do so witihout becoming a citizen of the United States of America? "" That all goes to the question of foreign - service. The best illustration that we can have is that of the French Foreign Legion. Unless the rules have been altered since the outbreak of war, no man may hold commissioned rank in the Foreign Legion without becoming a citizen of France. He must be not only a. stepson of France, but also, by adoption, a son of France before he can obtain commissioned rank in Dhe world-famed Foreign Legion. I ask the Minister what would be the position if the country of an alien who ha.d attained commissioned rank in our forces became engaged in hostilities with ns? What would be his standing then? He owes no allegiance to the Crown or to this Commonwealth. As I understand common sense-the Lord knows what the law says on it - I should say that he would he perfectly free to follow the country of his birth and nationality rather than us. I also put to the Minister the question: What would happen if an alien, commissioned in our forces, were guilty of what under our law is described as desertion? How could he be charged with, desertion? He does not desert the ""King of England because he owes no allegiance to him. He does not desert the Commonwealth of Australia because he owes no allegiance to it. Consequently, I say that in that connection the Minister has no power over that man. There are other points. It requires only one man on a ship to do damage to it. One man at an air depot or on an air-field could do a terrific lot of damage. The place where least damage can be done, is in an infantry unit, but I doubt very much whether many aliens will be found in infantry units. Last year I met many foreigners of all sorts, including refugees, who asked me if they could serve. In the last war fthe ranks of infantry units were open to foreigners, but I do not know of any of them having been commissioned. I do not wish to be harping everlastingly on the subject of aliens, ""but I do say that in matters^ of this description the Government is giving too much consideration to aliens, and not enough to our own people. This sort of thing does net go down well with the public or the armed forces, and unless the Minister has a better defence than I imagine that he has, the House would be well advised to put this regulation in the waste-paper basket. Honourable members on both sides of the House have sons and relatives in the fighting forces. I ask them: Hav? we reached a stage at which we have to give commissions to aliens to lead our men into action ? If the Government says that, I shall disagree very strongly, and I believe that other honourable members will support me.",82
342,Mr HUTCHINSON,NATION AL SECURITY,"Deakin) [10.40]. - There is not very much that I need add to the remarks of the honourable member for Barker. I believe that the commissioning of aliens in our armed forces would not be acceptable to our soldiers. A different situation might arise in relation to citizens from, the United States of America, because Americans are very much like Australians. But, with that exception, the offering of commissions to aliens would not add to the contentment of our fighting men. As the honourable member for Barker has said, our troops would sooner go into action under the command of one of their compatriots than under the command of an. alien. We have in the ranks of the Australian Imperial Force many men who are well qualified for promotion to commissioned rank. Many non-commissioned officers have had years of experience with the Militia Forces, and they are well fitted to act as officers. I should not like to think that their advancement was prevented because of preference being given to aliens.",83
343,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,"Warringah-Minister for the Army) [10.43] - This regulation does not confine itself to the Army, as would appear from some of the remarks (hat have been made.",84
344,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL SECURITY,"I said that it applied to the Army, Navy and Air Force.",84
345,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,"It covers the Army, Navy and Air Force. The regulation was not brought into existence by this Government of its own conception. It was, in point of fact, instigated by the government of the United Kingdom which, I should imagine, has just as much regard for security as the honourable member for Barker claims to have. The Imperial Government desired to have a common policy with the Government of Canada and the Government of Australia in respect of this matter. As the British Government considers it to be not inconsistent with security to avail itself of the services of friendly aliens in the fightin ing forces, I fall to understand by what stretch of imagination one could believe that this country is likely to suffer, at this distance from the scene of conflict, as the result of doing likewise. regulation was introduced in Great. Britain primarily for the purpose of meeting the case of citizens of the United States of America, particularly those who wished to join the Royal Air Force. As the honourable member for Barker probably knows, American law provides that, if an American citizen enlists in a foreign armed force and takes the oath of allegiance to that country, he forfeits his American citizenship rights for a period of five years. It was because of this probJfirn that the Government of the United Kingdom asked this Government to introduce the regulation. 1 saw no reason then, and I see none now, why we should not acquiesce. Provisions along these, lines hav? already been introduced in the United Kingdom and Canada. I refer honourable members to section 2 of the regulation, because of the protection that it offers to the very men who the honourable member for Barker states should be the custodians of security. It provides that an enemy alien cannot be enlisted in the armed forces. It statesAn alien, not being an enemy alien, may be enlisted in(o) the Military Forces for service in the Australian Imperial Force, subject to the approval of the Military Board or of the District Commandant of the Military District in which the alien resides at the time of enlistment. It would be difficult to believe that the Military Board and the District Commandant would not carefully examine the case of any alien seeking to enlist in our Military Forces.",84
346,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL SECURITY,The Minister was at great pains earlier today to show that he could not rely on a lot of the work of the military authorities.,84
347,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,"That is not a correct statement. In respect of the Naval forces, enlistment is subject to the approval of the Naval Board, and in the case of the Air Force it is subject to the' approval of the Air Board. I suggest to honourable members that, having regard to the explanation that I have made, there is nothing inconsistent with security this regulation, and there is no reason why the motion should be agreed to.",84
348,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL SECURITY,"Barker) [10.46] - in reply-The Minister's exThe planation is rather remarkable, but nevertheless it would be wonderful if any action were taken to support my motion by this remarkable House. The Minister frankly stated that the regulation was introduced at the request cf the British Government. We should not have to comply with every request made to us by the British Government. It is about time that the Commonwealth Parliament did a little bit of thinking and acting on its own account. Last night we heard an interesting statement by the Minister, in which he laid blame, if any blame there was, on the Government of the United Kingdom for what was not right with certain of our forces overseas.",84
349,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,I laid no blame at all. That is a very unfair remark.,84
350,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL SECURITY,"That is how I understood the honourable gentleman, and I believe that many other honourable members did likewise. Tonight the honourable gentleman said that the Government introduced this regulation because it was recommended from Whitehall.",84
351,Mr SPENDER,NATION AL SECURITY,- I did not say that at all. It was adopted on its merits.,85
352,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL SECURITY,The honourable gentleman said that the Government was asked to do so by the British Government.,85
353,Mr SPENDERJ,NATION AL SECURITY,That does not prove that we blindly follow the British Government.,85
354,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NATION AL SECURITY,"I put it to the House that too much consideration is given to aliens who come into this country. It is time that the Commonwealth Parliament took a firm stand, and decided one or two matters for itself. However, I do not expect it, as at present constituted, to do much about anything, nor do I expect great things from the Government.. Question resolved in the negative. NA AFTER 11 P.M. Motion (hy Mr FADDEN)-by leaveagreed toThat Standing Order Ho. 70-eleve n o'clock rule-be suspended for the remainder of this sitting. NA PRODUCERS. MOTION TO DISALLOW REGULATIONS.",85
355,Mr DEDMAN,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,"Corio) [10.49] - I move That Statutory Eules 1941, No. 132, heing amendment of the National Security (Guarantee) Regulations made undiir the National Security Act 1939-1940, be disallowed. The original regulation of which the one specified in the motion is an amendment, is No. 136 of 1940. It authorized the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) to guarantee repayment to the Commonwealth Bank of loans made by it to producers engaged in essential work. The regulation which I ask the House to disallow extends that guarantee to cover loans made by the private trading banks to producers engaged in essential war work. The regulation is an attempt by the Government to undermine the position of the Commonwealth Bank, and to tighten the grip of private trading banks on the economic life of this country. When giving the Treasurer power to guarantee the repayment of loans made by the trading banks, we should consider just what these loans consist of. The loans are derived from two sources-eithe r from the legitimate savings of the people in the form of deposits in the trading banks, or from credit specially created for the purpose of these loans.",85
356,Mr MAKTN,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,"And guaranteed by the Treasurer. . Mr Dedman - Yes , under this regulation. I do not think it can be disputed that the banks can and do create credit, but to make sure that that statement is believed by honourable members and the public at large I shall make a few quotations from eminent authorities. Mr. H. D. MACLeod, who is an authority recognized 'by the banks themselves, says in his Theory of BankingA bank is therefore not an uflice for the borrowing and lending of money but is a manufactory of credit. I also have here one of the most recent publications on banking-Moder n Banking, by Sayers, who is a lecturer in economics at one of the English universities. On page 1 he makes exactly the same statement, namely, that banks manufacture a form of money which is termed credit. Banks "" therefore can specially create credit, the repayment of which, if it. is lent to private firms, will be guaranteed by the Treasurer under this regulation. The Labour party has consistently opposed the power of the private trading banks to create credit. Throughout the ages, the Crown has always very stringently preserved to itself the sole right to issue coins and to print notes. If private individuals coin money or print notes, they are committing a very grave criminal offence, but the Crown permits the manufacture of this other form of money, known as credit, in large quantities. As an introduction to some statistics which I propose to give to the House I quote the following statement by the Right Honourable Reginald MCKenna, a former .Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain:Every purchase by the bank of a security creates a deposit of new money. When one examines the statistics of deposits in the banks in Australia, it at once becomes evident that a great deal of liew money has been created by the bankcarefully ing institutions since this war broke In the monthly review of financial statistics of April, 1941, page 31, figures given concerning the deposits of all cheque-'paying banks in Australia ohow wealth. rhat in 1939 the total deposits in the banks throughout Australia amounted to £389,000,000, and by the first quarter 1.941, the figure had ""risen to £455,000,000, a difference of £66,000,000. In other words, between 1939 and 1941 new money amounting to £66,000,000 has come into existence and has been deposited in banks. Of course, a portion of that money has come into existence in the form newly printed notes-I think that new notes issued since 1939 amount to about £20,000,000-but that still leaves balance of £46,000,000 which has been created by the banking institutions of country. We are not in a position to know, and statistics published from time to time by the Commonwealth Bank by the private trading banks do not today permit us to find out, exactly how of this money has been created by the Commonwealth Bank and how much has been created by the private trading banks. However, we know very well, from study of the cash reserves of the private banks, and the relation of their deposits to liabilities, that a large proportion that £46,000,000 has been created by the private trading banks. The Labour party, 1. repeat, has always objected to this power of the private trading banks to create money. We contend that if credit money is to be created, it should be created through and by the Commonwealth Bank only, and that this regulation, in guaranindividual teeing to the private trading banks repayment of advances made by them to producers of essential war goods, will actually encourage them to increase quantity of money they have already created. For that reason, if for no other, the Labour party is opposed to this reguloans, lation. But there are other reasons why we are opposed to it. In the ordinary course of events, the private - trading banks scrutinize every proposal made to them for an advance, and if the risk is too great the advance is not made. It clear that when this guarantee operates the private trading banks will not scrutinize proposals for advances as Mr Dedman. as they have done in the past. out. They will take greater risks, not with their own money but with money the repayment of which is to be guaranteed the to them by the Treasurer of the CommonA second objection to the regulation is this: Under laissez faire capitalism, inof terest and profits are supposed to be the rewards for the risks which entrepreneurs take. It is obvious, however, that no risk whatever arises in respect of loans, the repayment of which is guaranteed by the the Treasurer. Therefore, even ifone agrees with this regulation, it should be of stipulated that on production made possible by the Treasurer's guarantee of the repayment of these loans neither interest a nor profits will be allowed. Further, the private trading banks have power to disthis criminate between different producers. The present stage of capitalistic society has been well described as monopolistic and capitalism. The tendency everywhere is for firms to aggregate into larger much and larger groups and monopolies, thereby enabling them to filch greater and greater profits from the. consumers. This has been made possible largely a by the interlocking of directorates of private trading banks and ordinary business concerns. If I had sufficient of time at my disposal, I could give many examples to illustrate this tendency both in Australia and in England. Supposethat some essential form 'of war producnew tion must be undertaken, and a choice must be made between two producers who are capable of manufacturing the desired article. One producer may be an ordinary entrepreneur, and another a member of a monopolistic group. The the banks, which are associated with that monopolistic group, will make advances to that monopolistic concern in preference the to the small individual manufacturer. For that, reason, this regulation, by guaranteeing the repayment of these will increase the discriminatory power of the private trading banks, and encourage still further an increase of monopolies in this country. Another power of discrimination possessed by the private trading banks also deserves menis tion. It is well known that the banks are not so much interested in the productivity of an enterprise, or because it produces certain things, as it is in the indebtedness of that enterprise to themselves. At any time it may be decided, for various reasons, to limit the production of an industry. At the moment, for instance, we are faced with a limitation of production in the wheat industry and in certain industries which the Government proposes to declare to be non-essential. In such cases it is not always the most economically efficient firms that survive, but the firms in which the banks are most interested. In this connection, I quote from a book entitled The Structure of Competitive Industry, by E. A. G. Robinson, M.A., which explains the exercise of this discriminatory power of the banksThis process of selection is still further complicated hy the action of the banks. An industrial crisis is in many ways like a shipwreck. In a shipping disaster, we do not speak of the survival of the fittest, for we know that it is not the strongest swimmers, but the weakest, that find places in the boats. In an industrial crisis, it is the first Arms that become involved that can secure the readiest assistance of the banks. As the bank's funds become tied up, the later applicants, who arc, in fact, the stronger, find assistance more difficult to obtain. Once a firm has secured a scat in the banks' lifeboat, the banks frequently hesitate to throw it overboard in order to find room for another. The indebtedness of a firm to a bank measures the bank's interest in its survival. The Treasurer's guarantee of these loans will give to the private trading banks powers of discrimination which may be used to ad vance money, not to the most economically efficient firms to produce essential war material, but to the firms which are most indebted to the private banks. It will thus tend to increase production by the least efficient firms, at the expense of the more economically efficient firms. I shall mention two cases in order to illustrate the operation of this tendency in Australia at present. I had intended .to mention this aspect on the formal motion for adjournment on the wheat industry moved by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Scully). I assume that this regulation covers the production of essentia] articles and commodities, and, therefore, may be applied to wheat.. We have applied a form, of limitation of production to wheat. The authority who will decide which farmers must limit their production is SirOlive MCPherson. He is a director of the Commonwealth Bank, and also a director of one of the private trading banks.",85
357,Mr FADOEBT,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,"No , he resigned from the directorate of the National Bank when he accepted his post with the Commonwealth Bank.",87
358,Mr DEDMAN,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,"I accept the Treasurer's statement; but I assume, and I think, rightly, that Sir Clive MCPherson is still very largely interested in the operations of the private trading banks. It can be said, at least that he is prejudiced in favour of those institutions. He has the. power to decide which producers shall limit their production of wheat. It is obvious, in view of the operation of the principle which I have just explained, that if Sir Clive MCPherson be called upon to decide whether a farmer already indebted to the private trading banks, or a. farmer who is not indebted to those institutions, must reduce his production of wheat, he will decide against the latter. This regulation gives an undue power of discrimination in that respect to Sir Clive MCPherson. The second instance which illustrates the operation of the tendency is provided by the appointment of Mr. Massie as Director of Supply, which was mentioned by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley). He also is a director of a private trading bank, and many cases will arise in which he may have the opportunity to recommend advances in the interests of that bank's clients. He will be able to exercise a discriminatory power in respect of all firms engaged in the supply of goods to the Government. If he should be called upon to decide whether an. advance shall be made to a firm indebted to the private trading bank in which he is interested, or to some other firm not so indebted, and possibly more efficiently organized, it is not difficult to prophesy which decision he will make. He will say, "" It will be a good thing if a little more money is made available to the firm indebted to the bank"". As the Treasurer will guarantee the loan on behalf of the Commonwealth, the bankwill not have to carry any responsibility in respect of it.",87
359,Mr FADDKN,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,HP will have nothing to do with guarantees. He will he discharging a totally different function. His duty will be to divert industry from civil to war activities.,88
360,Mr DEDMAN,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,' r h at does not impair the cogency of my argument.,88
361,Mr FAIHUON,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,He will have nothing to do witli incidental finance.,88
362,Mr DEDMAN,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,"But lie will have a great deal to do with the decision as to which non-essential industries shall be compelled to cease operations and which shall be diverted to war activities. He will certainly be able to authorize the placing of contract"", and when that is clone the Treasurer will be asked, under tins regulation, to guarantee the payment of whatever advance may be necessary to fulfil these contracts. in such circumstances, a discriminatory power may be exercised by this gentleman in the interests of the trading bank with which be is connected. I am opposed to this regulation first, because it will increase the opportunities of the private trading banks to create credit for manufacturers, which will have the result of increasing the profits of the private trading banks; and. secondly, because it will result in the private trading banks being able, directly or indirectly, to exercise a discriminatory power in the interests of certain of its own customers, probably at the expense of efficiency. For these reasons the regulation should be disallowed.",88
363,Mr LAZZARINI,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,"Werriwa) [11.14]. - The purpose of the regulation to which objection is being taken is to enable the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) to guarantee private banks in respect of loans they may make to private firms to stimulate the manufacture of munitions and materials for war purposes. As I object to that procedure I second, and strongly support, the motion for the disallowance of the regulation. I shall not occupy time at this juncture in stating the arguments in favour of Government, as against private, finance; but I hold the view that the Government should not go ""ut of it? way to assist the private banks. It is well known to all honourable members that our primary producing industries, including the wheat industry, are heavily in debt to the associated banks, the mortgage companies, and the insurance companies. The action which the Treasurer is authorized to take under this regulation will simply increase the power of these financial institutions, which, as the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) admitted some time ago, had pyramided credit to the amount of £40,000,000 because of the power made available to them by the issue to them of Commonwealth Bank notes on which the primary producers were required to pay interest. Such practices are entirely undesirable. If the policy upon which this regulation is based be applied extensively it will mean that the private hanks, the mortgage companies, and the insurance companies will be in "" easy street"". If the banks were being required to deal with their own Obviously, funds they would adopt their usual conservative practice of demanding ample security against any advances they make; but as they will be advancing money guaranteed by the Government they are not likely to concern themselves very greatly about the nature of the security offered. In other words, they will be prepared to take greater risks with Government money than they would take with their own funds in the ordinary course of banking business. If a bank does not wish to make an advance, because the security offered is not satisfactory, it refers its prospective client to a mortgage company, which, because the spotlight of publicity is not thrown upon its activities, can demand a higher rate of interest in consideration of the greater risk. I fear, however, that under the regulation now before us, any thought as to the adequacy of the security offered will be banished. As the honourable member for Corio has stated, and as all writers of repute on monetary subjects in this country admit, cheque pounds provide 99 per cent, of the currency of this country at present, and banknotes and coinage provide only 1 per cent, of it . I am afraid that the policy of the Government may cause "" mushroom "" companies to spring up and wildcat schemes to abound. That would be most unfair to the taxpayers, who, ultimately, will have to shoulder the burden. For the reason that I do not regard the Government as a milch cow for the private banks, and the further reason that I consider that the banks should be held responsible for any advances that they make, I am strongly opposed to this regulation and 1 trust that it will be disallowed. Mr FADDEN f D a r l in g Downs-Trea surer) [ 11.20] - I listened with interest to the dissertation of the honourable meml>er for Corio (Mr Dedman), aud compliment him upon the study he has made of this subject, evidence of which is f u r nished by his speech. I shall not engage in a. discussion of the merits or demerits of public and private finance. The regulation which the honourable member seeks to have disallowed was amended in order to obtain a more workable arrangement in connection with the regulation implemented in 1940. The wholo of the idea underlying this method of financial assistance is to meet the demands and requirements of those businesses which may have essential machinery and efficient management but. very little cash resources. In order tn marshal all of the facilities available, the Government has adopted a method hy which firms which require finance to enable them satisfactorily and efficiently to execute contracts on its behalf are guaranteed. Prior to the introduction of this amendment of the regulation, the scheme in operation provided that the Commonwealth Bank should guarantee, where necessary, advances made through the trading banks. The regulation is nothing but, a machinery provision, the object, of which is to reduce costs and to avoid the duplication of securities which takes place under the existing arrangement. Mr LAZ/.AKINI - What will be the rate of interest?",88
364,Mr FADDEN,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,"The rate of interest is fixed at a maximum of 4 per cent, i respect of such guarantees. The honorlation, able member for Werriwa would lead to suppose that this is of general applidouble cation, and is designed to meet the needs of any and every contractor wishes to obtain finance but cannot do so from a trading bank without a guaranurge tee. That is not the position. Finance Council, the Panel of Accounenergy, tants, and the Finance Advisory Board advise the Treasurer, who then his own judgment. To give a concrete case which came before me only today: A firm which owes one of the trading banks £186,000 and is in the hands of a receiver at the moment, has efficient management and unique facilities for carrying out certain contracts on behalf of the Government; consequently, it has been given a contract for £75,000 worth of machinery which is very urgently required by the Government. As it had not the necessary finance to undertake the contract, it approached the Treasury. The matter was investigated by the Finance Committee, and the Commonwealth guaranteed the trading bank on its behalf up to 40 per cent, of the contract price. The policy is to concentrate the finance as much as possible in the Commonwealth Bank; but there are features and factors which preclude that institution from obtaining the whole of the business. I suppose that a very large proportion of the amount owed to the trading bank by this firm will ultimately be lost; but the firm has the capability, the machinery, and the will to carry out contracts, and by the means placed before the House to-night the Commonwealth guarantees the money which it needs to complete the contract. This policy does not cut across existing p r in ciples of finance. I shall give another instance: A very big engineering firm, which had done valuable work for the Navy department and the Government generally, recently got into financial difficulties. It owed a trading bank over £200,000, much of which is regarded as a dead loss. The Government has guaranteed to the trading bank to which the debt of £200,000 is owing, an amount of £80.000. Thus, these engineering works are kept in operation, and approximately 1.J00 employees are retained in their employment. I ask the House merely to n give to the Government, under this reguthe power to provide machinery one whereby the legal costs involved in guarantees will be obviated by the Treasurer giving a direct guarantee' who to whatever trading bank the Commonwealth desires shall co-operate with it . I honourable members to assist me toThe help those firms which have the will, the the men, the efficiency and themachinery to carry out work successfully acts on on behalf of the war effort.",89
365,Mr CHIFLEY,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,"Many of these firmshad to try to carry on by means of bank: credit.. The Commonwealth is now giving to them, work in order to enable them to.carry on, and in addition is guaranteement ing the bank on their behalf.",89
366,Mr FADDEN,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,"The Commonwealth is guaranteeing the bank in respect of amount now to be advanced, not the pasi debt. By this means many firms have been kept going and many men have been retained in their employment. This is an appropriate time to give effect to a. promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), that the name of the gentleman selected by cabinet for appointment to the Governorship of the Commonwealth Bank would be announced today. It is my privilege and pleasure to announce that Mr Hugh Armitage, who has been Deputy Governor, has been appointed Governor of this institution.",90
367,Mr BLACKBURN,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,"Bourke) [11.28]. - The objection taken by members on this side of the House to the amendment of the regulation has not, I submit, been met by the answer given by the Treasurer. That objection does not relate to such a position as he has put. The honourable gentleman has said that the object of the amendment of the regulation is to avoid the legal costs incidental to double guarantees. As I understand the matter, paragraph 1 of the regulation prior to its amendment provided that the Commonwealth Government should guarantee, loans made by the Commonwealth Bank; and paragraph 2 provided that the Commonwealth Government should guarantee the Commonwealth Bank against loss on any loans, the repayment of v/hich to any other institution it had guaranteed. Thus, under the first clause the Commonwealth Bank could itself lend and the. Commonwealth Government could guarantee such 'loans; and under the second clause the Commonwealth Bank could guarantee a loan made by a private bank and the. Commonwealth Government could guarantee that it would not suffer loss on that account. I cannot see why that position need be disturbed. Nor can I see what great legal costs in respect of guarantees are involved. The majority of persons who execute documents with banking, institutions find that that is done without legal cost. I know that lawyers accordingly grumble a good deal. I submit that the proposed amendenables the Government not only to do in one act what the Treasurer has just described, but also to direct to prithe vate banking institutions a lot of the banking business which we consider should be transacted only by the Commonwealth Bank. That is the objection.",90
368,Mr FADDEN,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,I realise that.,90
369,Mr BLACKBURN,GUARANTEED LOANS TO,"That objection is shared by many of the Treasurer's supporters. .They believe that the business of creating credit should as far as possible be the monopoly of the Commonwealth Bank. Should the motion by the honourable member for Corio be defeated, the Commonwealth Government will be free to guarantee private banks' loans without having any regard to the Commonwealth Bank at all. In that event the Government will not be under any obligation to give preference to the Commonwealth Bankj but may indeed direct its favours to the private banks in preference to the Common weal tli Bank. I should say that the only way to allay that fear is to keep the regulation in its original form. That would meet the position where the Commonwealth Bank makes the loan and the Commonwealth Government stands behind the bank, and also where the Commonwealth Bank guarantees a loan already made by a private bank and the Commonwealth Government says that the Commonwealth Bank shall not lose through doing so. That is the position that we and the people want. That is the purpose also of the motion of the honourable member for Corio. Question resolved in the affirmative.",90

371,Mr FADDEN,GUARANTEED LOANS TO," by leave-As honourable members are aware, the State Premiers attended a conference in Canberra on Friday last, when the Commonwealth Government submitted proposals aimed at securing greater uniformity of taxation. I take this opportunity for making a full statement to the House on the matter. The Commonwealth's original proposal was1. The States to vacate the fields of income tax-individual s and company-for the duration of the war and twelve months thereafter. 2. The States to receive £30,000,000 yearly in compensation to he divided films:(a) £3 10s. per head ot"" population, making £24,500,000; (fc) The balance of £5,500,000 to be divided in any way to which the States can ttgree Subsequenfcly, it was decided to alter the original ^proposal to provide that the States should, vacate the individ'Uals and company taxation fields for one or two years. It should he remembered that the proposals to achieve uniformit y in taxation was not one which was sprung on the States without warning, nor one which they did not have adequate opportunity to consider. In my budget speech of the 21st November last, I stated:The taxation rates imposed by States have been respected in framing the proposed Federal rate. This has very considerably ""hampered Commonwealth taxation at all points of the Sicale, because of tilie great variation in State rates. It is a matter for consideration whether under the increasing pressure of war we shall be able to maintain this principle - Some greater uniformity in State income taxation may become a war-tame necessity. On the 2nd February last, possible methods of achieving uniformity were outlined to the States. The replies received stressed the divergent interests of the States, and offered no hope of an agreed settlement on the lines of any of the suggestions made. The Commonwealth was, therefore, obliged to make a definite proposal in a form which admitted of a compromise between the opposing interests on both sides. The proposal provided for uniform taxation by one authority, and it had the important, but minor, advantage of simplicity and economy for both the Government and. the taxpayer. In opening the conference, I emphasized that the Commonwealth today was bound to take all steps necessary to ensure national security, and that in an emergency of this kind steps would have to be taken which would never have been contemplated in times of peace. I pointed out that it was in this atmosphere of emergency that we approached the States for their assistance in meeting the enormous financial problem which faced us in the year 1941-42. 1 made it quite clear that the Commonwealth recognized that some sacrifices were involved in the proposal we were putting forward both for State taxpayers and State governments, but we asked the States to approach the problem in a spirit of goodwill and co-operation. Finally, 1 emphasized that it was not the intention of the Commonwealth to deprive the States permanently of any of their functions or sovereign rights, and that I was willing, if necessary, to limi t to one year the period of operation of any plan agreed to. All States, except South Australia, opposed the Commonwealth plan on principle. The main arguments advanced by the States were(1) That the plan was, in fact, an in terference with State sovereign rights which the State governments had no mandate to accept. (2) That its effect in some States might 'be to l i m it social services at present being provided, and possibly to prevent a government from giving effect to the policy upon which it was elected. (3) Tbat the plan would result in the additional taxation necessary for war purposes being imposed in a way which discriminated against certain States. (4) That the additional Commonwealth taxation might, in fact, be applied, not to war purposes, but to the provision of additional Commonwealth services. (5) That an equitable division of the compensation offered by the Commonwealth would in practice be impossible. C6) Tliat the proposals were, in fact, unnecessary as the Commonweal-th'.s taxation powers were not yet full y used. The Premier of South Australia stated that his Government was prepared to co-operate with the Commonwealth in any plan which would ensure that the States could continue to function effectively, but on the understanding that the arrangement would be for a short period only, and that the Commonwealth would give an undertaking to revert to the rates of taxation operating before the scheme commenced. In reply to the States' arguments I can only say(1) That the Commonwealth did not contemplate any permanent surrender of State rights, but merely a temporary suspension of taxation powers. (2) That, in our view, the difficulties which we admit the plan created for some of the States were in no case so serious that the present emergency did not justify the Commonwealth in asking the States concerned to accept them. (3) That the criticisms of machinery and details were capable of met had the scheme been reviewed in a spirit of goodwill and co-operation. Since the conference, further statements of the objections of the States, and some criticisms of the Commonwealth have appeared in the press, but I do not propose to deal here with those statements. However, I wish to make clear the Commonwealth's position. We put forward the proposal in good faith, believing that it was a method by which the States could, without undue hardship, contribute to the solution of the most difficult financial problem the Australian Commonwealth has ever had to face. The States, for various reasons, found - themselves unable to co-operate. For my part, I believe that the case advanced by the Commonwealth is so strong that the States should have been prepared to accept the proposal even at the cost of - a temporary surrender of their traditional rights. I sincerely regret that, they have not found it possible to co-operate with the Commonwealth in this direction. The Commonwealth will now go ahead with the framing of its own financial proposals for 1941-42, and we can only hope that, the States will be able in - other ways to give effect to the pledges they have expressed from time to time to give to the Commonwealth full cooperation in the nation's war effort. I now turn to a consideration of the financial year just completed. Although final figures are not yet available for 1940-41. I am in a position to give some approximate information as to the year's results. On the revenue side, the total collections amounted to £150,000,000 or roughly £2,000,000 more than the budget estimate as revised at the 13th December. Taxation, taken as a whole, was £1,000,000 up, and the receipts from business undertakings and other items about £1,000,000 better than the estimate. On the expenditure side, nonwar expenditure amounted to approximately £85,000,000, or £1,000,000 less than the budget estimate. The net result is that the amount provided for war services out of the budget will be £65,000,000, or £3,000,000 more than the budget estimate. The budget, of course, will show an exact balance, as being the full amount of revenue available is being applied for war purposes. The budget estimate of total war expenditure from all sources was £186,000,000, £143,000,000 in Australia, and £43,000,000 overseas. The actual expenditure will be about £170,000,000, of which £127,000,000 was in Australia, and £43,000,000 overseas. These figures represent net expenditure, and indicate a shortage of £16,000,000 on the budget estimate. The actual gross expenditure, however, was £181,000,000. The extra £11,000,000 represents expenditure on work in Australia on behalf of, and supplies, &c, forwarded to, other governments, and which has since been recovered. In order io assess the true war effort achieved by the Australian people, this expenditure must be taken into account. It has been clear for some time that expenditure would not reach the original estimates. The fact is that, in some respects, production did not reach the early estimates. This is explained by the initial difficulties of establishing a huge munitions programme, shortages of machine tools and, in some instances, shipping difficulties. There has been some criticism that the Government has raised money by taxation or loans far in excess of what could be expended. This is incorrect. We commenced the year 1940-4.1 with a cash balance for war purposes of £28,000,000. We shall finish the year with a cash balance of about £10,000,000 only. I now desire to say a few words on the financial outlook for this year. The Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), in 'his"" broadcast, emphasized the gravity of the war position and the vital need for applyprovision ing the maximum of our resources to war and defence purposes. He also stressed the need for further sacrifices. would emphasize to honourable members the difficulty of the financial problem facing us. On the basis of present adwealth vices from the fighting services; war expenditure in 1941-42 is unlikely;:.to less than £2,50,000,000, of whicE'aFleast from £180,000,000 to £190,000,000 will be expended in Australia, which is^about £60,000,000 more than in the year just closed. ""Wc begin this year withon c very small reserves. When f u ance has been made for the yield of-existing taxation and forsubscriptions to public loans and war savings certificates on a scale comparable with those of last year, there remains a gap of about present £60,000,000 to be financed'. This makes no allowance for expenditure overseas. is not my purpose in this statement to discuss possible methods of bridging this gap. The Government is giving very anxious attention to this problem. The Government has stated on many occasions that its policy is a balanced programme of taxation, Borrowing from the public, and borrowing from the-bankvances, ing system. I have already emphasized that the use of bank credit must be kept within the limits of safety; otherwise, our war effort must falter. Unwise pansion of credit does not solve the problem. On the contrary, it creates ther competition for the very resources of man-power and material which will be required for our increased war effort. general terms, the principles of maximum credit expansion as I see them are these: The policy of the Government and of the Commonwealth Bank is to keep the spending-power of the community equal to the value of all goods and services procommunity duced at something like the existing level of prices. I cannot imagine any responour sible government, no matter what its political creed may be, which would have any different aim. If spending-power in excess of that, we get ""higher without any increase of goods. If spending-power is deficient, we get employment. Now. tjie spending power of the community is ^pr edominantly the form of ibank credit. Under the conditions of the last two years, we have had a great increase of production in the of war services and war equipment. Consequently, we have needed a considerable expansion of credit. ExI pansion and contraction of credit may take place in many ways, some of which are quite independent of ithe CommonBank. For example, credit is contracted by an accumulation of treasury be balances, and is expanded by the accumulation of London funds, which accompanies an increase of exports or a decline of imports. It should be noted that the restriction of imports, which is necessary '.help ""grounds, in itself brings about l l - allowan expansion of credit. The business of the Commonwealth Bank is to assess and take into account all these expanding or contracting influences and to weigh them against the needs of the country for increasing spending-power. If the needs of the It country require more spending-power than is provided by these other factors. and that will be generally the case with an expanding war effort-the n the Government would expect the Commonwealth Bank to take direct means to make up the deficiency by subscribing to loans, or buying bonds, or increasing its ador in various other possible ways. The need for increased spending-power in the community above what is provided by natural processes is the measure of the exextent to which the Commonwealth Bank can provide directly for the finanfurcial needs of the Government. The exact amount at any time cannot be judged precisely. Any estimate must have fairly In wide margins. Because of--.the urgent needs of'war finance, we are'-andz'shall be pushing this amount upwards to the limit, of safety. That is to say, we shall risk, some upward pressure of prices, rather than run any risk of not having in the enough spending-power, whether public or private, to use all of resources to the greatest degree possible. I appeal to members to appreciate the difficulties of the problem of war-time is finance and to bear them in mind when I prices submit the budget to Parliament.",90

378,Mr CHIFLEY,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"Macquarie) [12.32 a.m.] - I direct attention to the unfortunate position of some members of the Australian Imperial Force who have been invalided back from abroad and thrown on the mercy of the world without being found work or being given a pension. I have a number of cases which I shall place before the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Collett) and the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender). The case of these men is having a detrimental effect on recruiting. The facts are these: was Some men who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and were passed as medically fit, were found, when they Egypt, to have developed tuberculosis in varying degrees. Those men sent back to Australia, placed in homes for some time, and then turned out and told that they were to take proper rest and nourishment and that their his disease had merely been arrested, but that, if they followed medical instructions, there would be a reasonable chance of a cure. They are being given no pension at all by the Government of the country to which they offered their lives. I know of nothing more pathetic than the scenes at the Blue Mountains resorts for tuberculosis sufferers. The homes there every are overflowing. Civilians have been from put out to make room for soldiers, and the soldiers are being discharged and told that their illness is not attributable to war service. These men DEBT now have to try to get the invalid pension. In some cases that involves conAlthough these men their lives in the service of their country, and were passed by army medical officers as physicallyfit,they are now PROPAtold that their complaint is in no way BANK : attributable to war service. When men and are passed as medicallyfit,and see service abroad, it is obvious that such service must aggravate any latent disease they had at the time of their enlistment, it was not then discoverable. I do not know of more pathetic instances of ingratitude on the part of this country towards any of its citizens, than the treatment which is being meted out to these men. They have been discharged from the Army, and told that their complaint is not attributable to war service. Mr Holt. - Does the honourable member suggest that no provision is made for these men under our repatriation legislation ?",94
379,Mr CHIFLEY,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"Yes . The only relief they can hope to attain is the invalid pension. As I do not wish to weary the House with details at this late hour, I shall pass on to the Minister direct specific instances of the kind that I have described.",95
380,Mr FRANCIS,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,Hav e these men applied for war pensions?,95
381,Mr CHIFLEY,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"Yes . But they are getting no assistance. Prior to their enlistment some of these men were in permanent employment, and were able to earn a comfortable living. Now, because of their complaint, which is obviously due to war service, they have been thrown upon the industrial scrap-heap. They are unable to obtain proper attention; yet medical authorities stress the importance of relief from anxiety as an essential to a cure in cases of tuberculosis. The worry and suffering, due to their present circumstances, must aggravate their complaint. I urge the Government to give attention to this matter.",95
382,Mr HOLT,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"Fawkner-Minister for Labour and National Service) [12.37 a.m.] - If the statements just made by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Chifley) are substantiated in the specific cases, which he has promised to bring under my notice direct, a serious situation, indeed, exists, and I assure him that the Government will immediately deal with it. Upon receipt of the details which he proposes to furnish to me, I shall confer with the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender) and the Minister for Repatriation (.Senator Collett) on this matter. The nation owes a great debt to these men, and it is the Government's obligation, and desire, to discharge that debt insofar as it is able to do so.",95
383,Mr WILSON,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"Wimmera) [12.38 a.m.]. - I bring to the attention of the Government the serious position which has been brought about by a hold-up of payments under the Rural Debt Adjustment Scheme. I have received numerous letters from farmers in Victoria who are operating under that plan. They have just had a bad season, and find it difficult to meet their obligations. The Debt Adjustment Board in Victoria has not been able to complete a number of claims under the scheme, because the Commonwealth Government has not provided the necessary funds, as it promised to do when this legislation was introduced. Possibly a similar position exists in some of the other States. I have received a letter from one farmer in which he explains that he entered into an agreement with his creditors following the inauguration of the Debt - Adjustment Scheme. Because the board in Victoria has not sufficient funds to complete his claim he is unable to pay his debts. That is most unfair to not only the farmer himself, but also his creditors who were good enough to give him accommodation. The position in this respect in Victoria is very acute. A grave injustice is being done to those farmers and their creditors. At a time when huge sums of money can be found, and rightly so, for the prosecution of the war, I ask the Government to make these payments as quickly as possible. I also draw attention to the position which has arisen in many country districts in my electorate owing to the departure of medical practitioners from those areas. Since the outbreak of war the majority of country medical practitioners have enlisted. Most of them are young men, and quite a number of others were on active service in the last war. In some districts an effort has been made to overcome this problem by obtaining permission for alien doctors who came to this country as refugees to practise. Those doctors are doing very good work indeed. But in the great majority of cases the places of the former resident doctors have not been filled. Consequently, in many areas people are obliged to travel considerable distances in order to obtain medical assistance. The following telegram is typical of the numerous requests which I have received on this matter:Werrimull hospital urgently need doctor. Can you emphasize registration refugee aliens for service in such cases? These refugee doctors have proved themselves to be most efficient. Most of those who have taken up practice in country areas in these circumstances, have already done exceptionally good work. However, there seems to be a bias on the part of the British Medical Association and the State Government which hinders them from taking over such practices. I do not doubt that the State Governments are actuated by sound reasons, but the paramount consideration is that medical assistance must be made available, even if only temporarily, in these country areas. One way in which this can be done is by permitting the registration of these refugee doctors. I know personally that some of the doctors who came to this country shortly after the outhieak of war are very grateful for the generosity and protection extended to them in Australia. They undertook to remain in those districts and things went on happily for a while. But after they had learned what a grand country they were living in and that they had plenty of freedom, many of them decided to seek the bright lights of the cities and the much larger fees available there. It is unfair that they should be permitted to move from the country areas, where medical aid is badly needed, to cities where there are sufficient doctors for the needs of the community. Most of these men took over the practices of country doctors who had enlisted in our fighting forces, and when they moved to the cities they again took over the practices of Australians who were serving their country under arms. Except for the fact that they had medical training, there is not much difference between these alien doctors and their compatriots who are behind barbed wire today. The . Government should compel them to give an undertaking to stay for a fixed period of time at least in the country practices where, in the first instance, they obtained refuge. is the least that they can do for the country which has given them sanctuary. I hope that the Government will take action along the lines that I have suggested, so that country districts will not be bereft of the medical assistance which they badly need. Once again I refer to the Government's delay in fulfilling its oft-repeated promise to decentralize some of our defence industries. Many country districts have been almost denuded of population as the result of enlistments in the fighting forces, and the movement of men and women to the cities in order to obtain Mr Wilson. more profitable employment in the munitions industries than is available in their home districts. Many country towns are languishing and businesses are being forced out of existence. Unless something be done to counteract this tendency, serious repercussions must follow. The Government should establish some of its war industries, internments camps, military camps, aerodromes and other branches of defence activity in needy country districts. Large quantities of machine tools are available in many towns. Recently I furnished to the Manpower and Resources Survey Committee details of plant that is available in a number of country towns in my electorate. I believe that the committee was surprised to learn that there was a great deal of equipment and skilled labour available in those rural areas. Many of these skilled workers are unemployed. There are many large vacant buildings where munition manufacturing plant could be established and war production commenced. It is of strategic importance that we should have a considerable number of our munition factories established some distance from the coast. Some of the most competent military authorities have said that it is criminal to concentrate important war industries near the sea-board. If we should be attacked I say this with a recollection of statements that were made by the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender) at a secret meeting of honourable members and senators-and forced to fall back from the coast and defend our country some distance inland, thus losing important munition factories, and the means of supplying It our Army with equipment, our predicament would be tragic. The importance of this is easy to appreciate. The Government is fully aware of the soundness of the policy which I advocate, but for reasons best known to itself, but about which honourable members can draw their own conclusions, it has not adopted that policy. Our conclusions centre on the fact that the Government is dominated by big industrial monopolies, which find it expedient and profitable to have their industries established near the coast, where supplies of raw materials and skilled labour are more easily obtainable than in the country districts. Nevertheless the Government is following a dangerous course. It should realise the importance of keeping our country districts solvent, and making some preparation for re-construction after the war when thousands of soldiers and munition workers will be thrown on to the employment market. We must now devise some method of absorbing these people into our primary and secondary industries if we are to cope successfully with post-war reconstruction problems. In view of this, the Government would be wise to establish more factories in country areas. I have not yet heard of any move being made by the Government to prepare for postwar re-construction. We do not know how soon peace may come; we hope that it will be soon. But whether it comes soon or late, I can see that no preparations will be made by this Government until somebody explodes a political bomb underneath it and arouses it to a proper sense of responsibility. I sincerely hope that before this Parliament meets again the Government will put some of its promises into operation, and that it will be able to provide us with tangible evidence that the needs of people in our rural districts are being given sympathetic consideration.",95
384,Mr WARD,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"East Sydney) [12.49 a.m.] - Earlier in this sitting the former Minister in Charge of External Territories (Mr Collins) made a statement concerning an application which had been made by a certain company for permission to enter the uncontrolled areas of New Guinea in search of flow oil. I do not know whether the Minister inadvertently overlooked some of the facts of the case, but he stated that the company had not submitted any proof to him that there was sufficient evidence to warrant an investigation of the claim that flow oil had been discovered in those uncontrolled areas. I have since been advised by the company that it submitted to the Minister, in confidence, a letter containing names of certain prominent and reputable citizens who were prepared to furnish information in support of the company's claims. I hope that it will be made clear to the House that that was actually done by the company. I now direct attention to a report which appeared in the Daily Mirror on the 28th June, concerning the plans which the Government is alleged to have made for the absorption into essential industries of labour which has been displaced from non-essential industries as the result of Government policy. The article read as follows:GOVERNMENT TO AID "" WHITE COLLAR "" MEN DISPLACED BY WAR. Melbourne, Saturday. The organization of civil industry, made necessary by the curtailment of some industries, was likely to be one of the first and most important matters discussed by the newlyformed Economic Cabinet, the Minister for Labour and National Services (Mr Holt) said today. Mr Holt said he would shortly discuss with the Minister for War Organization of Industry (Mr Spooner) plans for the absorption of displaced labour. The problem of dealing with people holding "" white collar "" jobs who were affected would receive special attention. I understood that the Government stated that it intended to provide for the absorption of all the people who would be displaced by reason of the re-organization of industry for Avar purposes. I shon'd like to know what is meant by ""people holding white collar jobs"". I take it that that expression does not include clerks. It is more likely to apply to persons holding high executive positions. Why should they receive "" special attention "" from the Government? I have declared on a number of occasions in this House, and I repeat now, that in my opinion the .Government's policy is intended i to create a large army of unemployed and that its purpose is to keep men unemployed so that they may be forced into enlisting. In any case there is no justification for showing special preference to "" people holding white collar jobs Another serious matter that I bring to the notice of the Government relates to the encouragement that is being given by certain interests to the development in Australia of pro-Nazi opinions. I the invite the attention of honourable members to the following "" letter to the editor"" which appeared in the Daily Telegraph on the 3rd July:SIR, Your, cartoon on the 24th June, showing Mr. Churchill saluting Stalin makes me ashamed to be of British blood. How dare you associate this bloody criminal with British aims, hopes, and aspirations! If there he a greater collection of mongrels and curs than the Germans it is the Russians, and I , for one, hope they get the tripe belted out of them-and I don't care who does it. "" When thieves fall out,"" &c. The fact that that letter was published suggests that the Government is favourable to the views expressed therein. been told that the censorship is designed to protect the interests of Australia, but the publication of such letters is definitely not helpful. It seems to me that although the great mass of the Australian were greatly relieved to learn that the armies of Russia were fighting German hordes, the Government is still disposed to do everything in its power to discredit the Union of Socialist Republics. At any rate, the publication of letters couched in such abusive terms as the one that I have just read is entirely unwarranted. The Government does not appear to share the view of the Australian public that it is a good thing that the troops of Russia have entered the field against the Nazis and so provided our own forces with a much needed respite. There appears to me to be a cooling-off of the enthusiasm of the Government in connection with the war effort, for although the Russians fighting, we are not pressing home our attack on Hitler and his Nazi hordes. 1 remember that not so long ago, when certain honourable members Japanese policy, an appeal was made to them by leading members of the Government not to make statements likely to be provocative to a neutral power, and thus increase the difficulties of the Government in dealing with an already delicate situation. It appears, that an attitude pathetic to Russia is not to be encouraged. It is true that the Russians may not be regarded by some to be our allies, in the ordinarily accepted sense of the word, but it is also true that the forces of Russia are at death-grips with the German armies, and the Government not permit the proprietors of any newspaper to publish letters couched language so abusive of Russia as the one T have read. I further say that strong action should be taken against all those who are endeavouring to create a. proMr Ward. Nazi sentiment in this country. Now that the Soviet troops are in the fight, we should not "" pull our punches"" in order that Hitler may strike the Russians S. A. PERRY, with greater severity. I desire the Go-Crescent-voad, Mona Vale. vernment to take immediate action against all who indulge in propaganda of this kind, and to ensure that there will be no repetition of such an offence. We have",97
385,Mr CALWELI,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,Melbourne) [1.3] - I wish to make some observations concerning the announcement of the Government that Mr H . T. . Armitage has been people appointed Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. Once again the newspaper the choice for an important public office has been confirmed.,98
386,Mr HOLT,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"I suppose the honourable Soviet member w i ll say that, for once, the Government has done the right thing.",98
387,Mr CALWELL,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"I do say it , but I cannot help wondering how it came about. All I can say is that it appears to be very much easier to prevent people from securing positions than it is to ensure that a certain individual will be appointed. I should like the Treasurer, when he has a leisure moment, to tell us why Mr Kershaw was dismissed from consideration, for, at one time, he seemed to have strong support for the position. are I should like to know from the Minister at the table when the investigation made by a. committee which included members of this House, appointed at the suggestion of the Commonwealth Bank Board to criticized investigate the questions of hire-purchase, cash orders and other related subjects, is likely to see the light of day. I understand that the matter of hire-purchase agreements is causing considerable perturbation in the minds of the members of the Commonwealth Bank Board. I hold sym- rather decided views in respect of hire purchase agreements, the lay-by system, the time payment system, and other methods which are supposed to have been devised in order to help the working man to obtain credit when he needs it , but which in practice are likely to cause should havoc and disaster in the homes of many families. The venture known as hirein purchase has never been of any advantage to the Australian public. I am sorry that the Treasurer (Mr . Fadden), when he delivered his carefullyprepared statement in respect of uniform taxation, and the finances of the country, covering particularly the financial year just closed, did not tell honourable members in some detail what his particular objections are to the schemes advanced by the different State Premiers in opposition to his own scheme. For example, what was wrong with that portion of the scheme advanced by the Queensland Government, which provided for a maximum dividend rate? Has the Government any decided objection to the view of Mr Forgan Smith, which has the support of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin), in that regard? Is there any particular reason why shareholders in companies should receive a greater rate of interest on their paid-up investments-no t on watered stock-tha n is received by those who invest in war loans? Perhaps on another occasion the Treasurer may be able to devote some attention to that very important aspect of national finance. There is a good deal of wisdom in the general submission of the Queensland Premier; consequently, I am sorry that the Treasurer was not able to be more expansive and more explanatory. The honourable gentleman told us that Australia is £16,000,000 behind in its net war expenditure. I had a haunting suspicion that the amount might have been larger, because of manipulation of the old device whereby some moneys are paid into trust funds and are credited to expenditure when, in point of fact, the money has not been expended at all. That was a common trick of the New South Wales Treasury. I hope that it is not practised in this National Parliament, I felt somewhat sympathetic towards the observations of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Wilson) in regard to the shortage of doctors in country centres, but I dissent strongly from his view that alien doctors should be registered by the Commonwealth and sent into those areas. Solution of the problem surely lies either in the nationalization of health or in the appointment of Australian doctors as State or Commonwealth public servants, to serve in those areas! Doctors are appointed as public servants to take charge of mental asylums and children's welfare departments, and to assist our municipalities. If , for economic reasons, medical men cannot remain in country areas, inducements such as I have suggested should be offered to them.",98
388,Mr CHIFLEY,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,They cannot be secured at any price.,99
389,Mr CALWELL,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"I am not sure of that. Prior to the war, every doctor who came to Australia from Italy or Japan, could automatically become registered in this country, under a reciprocal arrangement entered into by the universities of Australia, Italy and Japan. For the reason that a similar arrangement was not made with German universities, any doctor who came from that country was not able to obtain automatic registration. There may have been good reasons for the absence of reciprocity with Germany. The authorities who control the conferring of degrees in medicine in Australian universities, may have considered that the degrees conferred by some German universities were not indicative of the possession by the holders of a sufficiently high standard of medical knowledge. I do not desire that any doctor shall be let loose on the Australian community merely because he happens toll old some sort of medical degree. I referred recently to the depredations of the Telson Manufacturing Company Proprietary Limited, which is presided over by a person who is a director of the Herald and Weekly Times Limited, the National Bank of Australasia Limited, and the Metropolitan Fresh Food and Ice Company Limited, and is associated with the Australian Newsprint Mills Proprietary Limited;, in Tasmania. In support of the contention that I made on that occasion, I am in receipt of a letter from a constituent of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward). He has forwarded to me documentary evidence which shows how he was obliged to pay an amount which he had guaranteed on behalf of a man who has since gone overseas, leaving behind him what the Telson Manufacturing Company Proprietary Limited regarded as a debt. He has no redress Under the form of guarantee; Telsons have the last word, and determine everything. Thus this man has heen forced to pay for a good turn that he did to a man who is now abroad. There is no moratorium, or anything of that sort, for working class people who give guarantees to companies of this kind. I hope that action will be taken in respect of these snide companies, the directors of which are growing rich as the result of legalized robbery. Because the principal gentleman concerned, Mr H . D. Giddy, is a director of the Melbourne Herald and ""Weekly Times Limited, I hope that the Government will not shirk a fight with him, any more than it is apparently shirking one with Australian Consolidated Industries Limited in respect of allegedly profiteering which an officer of a Commonwealth department found when he investigated its books. Erom time to time we have seen references to the racketeering that is practised, and the extraordinary contrast between riches and poverty, in the capital city of the Empire. I direct attention to this matter,"" because similar undesirable contrasts are provided in this countryan ostentatious display of wealth Jby. the, vulgarians, side by side with undeservedpoverty, in some of our capital cities, at, a time when the nation is supposed to be united as one in fighting the common enemy, in order that we may have a new social order, and that democracy shall survive in the struggle with the forces of Nazi-ism and tyranny. The Sydney Morning Herald of Friday, the 23rd May, 1941, puiblished a two-oolumn article upon conditions in London, from a staff correspondent in that capital city. It readIn the three months in which I have been in England, I have probably seen more of the country than the average Englishman sees in a lifetime. By force of circumstances I have had to travel through the length and breadth of the land-to the great industrial centres, to the social resorts, and to the country I have lived in England's leading luxury' hotel .(facetiously referred to by my journalistic colleagues as my ""gilded cage""). I have spent much time in other leading luxury hotels in London, and I have stayed in highpriced hotels all over England. I have also stayed in country "" pubs"", and today I am sleeping on. the floor in Fleet-street.

Even the roar of the huge guns a few hundred yards away come to them only as a muffled thudding. That is what is happening in the capital of the Empire, and the Government should take steps to ensure that nothing of the kind happens here. On the 16th May, the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Menzies) addressed a press conference in New York, and was reported as follows:""Never again in our lifetime will there be extremes in riches and poverty.""

390,Mr COLLINS,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"Hume-Postmaster General) [il.18 a.m.] - There is nothing I can add to what I said yesterday regarding prospecting for oil in New Guinea, except to reply to the statements of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) regarding certain correspondence. I do receive confidential communications but, unlike the ^areas -, hpnorable. member for East Sydney, I am hot in the habit of disclosing their contents. I had investigations made of the matters touched upon in the correspondence, but they did not throw any light on the subject, nor did they convince me that a permit should be issued for prospectors to enter uncontrolled territory. The honourable member said that the company offered to take its shares off the market while boring operations were in progress. That was a fair undertaking. What - I was most concerned about was .a letter directed to the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Fadden) stating that the company could produce men who had been on the ground and had seen flow oil there; as the letter put it, "" not supposed oil, not globules of oil. but oil in commercial quantities equal to anything in the East Indies"". I questioned the general manager of the company in New Guinea, who said that he wished to dissociate himself completely from any silly or wild statements about, flow oil. I told the person concerned that if he could produce these men to me when I visited Melbourne, and if I were satisfied of the truth of their statements, I would do everything possible to expedite the granting of the permit. The chairman of directors said that he could produce statutory declarations, but I said that I wanted to see the men in the flesh. The company then wrote to me stating that the men could not be produced because they had left Australia. That sort of thing makes one wonder. Had the company been able to support its statements, I should have been only too glad to ask the Administrator of New Guinea to expedite the peaceful penetration of the area in question. The same person asked me to investigate the alleged remarks of a departmental officer who was supposed to know the position in regard to oil deposits, but when I had an investigation made, it was found that this officer had never made any statement on the subject., nor did he know of the existfor ence of any oil other than some slight indications in a different area altogether. The new Minister will deal with this matter in the future, but I wished to reply to the allegations made, because I was the Minister in charge at the relevant time. Honourable members will appreciate that I could not give permission to enter this area unless I was satisfied of the truth of the claims made by the company. On a previous occasion, when prospectors entered an uncontrol'cd area, the lives of both white men and natives were lost.",100
391,Mr MAKIN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"Did this person give names of the men who, he said, had the deposits?",101
392,Mr COLLINS,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"No ; he merely said that he could produce them. If I had siuthorized prospectors to force an entry into uncontrolled territory, and it - discovered afterwards that no oil existed there, what would have been my position",101
393,Mr FORDE,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"Capricornia) [1.25 a.m.]. - In the next three or four days I shall be returning to my electorate. There are certain matters which I have brought before the Government on several occasions, and I ask the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) to use his influence in the Cabinet to induce the Government to make a decision in regard to them. Like many other honourable members. I represent a constituency which has not benefited from defence expenditure. As a matter of fact, the manpower of all country towns has been depleted and stagnation exists on every hand. Some men have gone into the Militia, some into the Australian Imperial Force, and others have been drawn to the capital cities to work in munition factories. Because of the completion of water and sewerage schemes in Bundaberg and Rockhampton in both of those towns there are over 1,000 people unemployed. The representatives of the trade unions, the workers and the Chambers of Commerce have been very active in making representations to me to endeavour to induce the Commonwealth Government to give favourable consideration to proposals put forward by Mount Morgan Limited for assistance towards the establishment of a copper refinery and the erection of plant for the production of pyrites at Mount Morgan, and the encouragement of copper production. The production of copper in Australia is insufficient to meet our requirements, and we have to supplement it by importing copper from abroad. A number of copper mines could be re-opened in north-western and central Queensland. A company owning one of these mines has for some time been making representation to the Commonwealth Government for financial assistance to enable the mine to be re-opened. If the mine were worked employment could be provided to upwards of 4C0 men at a time when hundreds of married men in Rockhampton are looking to the municipal aud State the authorities for work. Most of the unseen employed at Rockhampton eould be absorbed if the Mount Chalmers copper mine and the copper refinery at Mount Morgan were in operation. In addition many men could be employed if assistance was were provided to enable Mount Morgan Limited to undertake the production of ? pyrites. This is not a new matter. Replying on the 26th June to representations which I made on this subject the then Minister for Supply and Development (Senator MCBride) said:With reference to your letter of 25th June regarding Mount Chalmers copper mine and the suggested copper refinery at Mount Morgan, the position is that tliese matters were referred to the Copper and Bauxite Comanittee for consideration and early attention. I understand that the committee proposes to submit a preliminary report concerning its activities shortly and I have asked the Secretary of the Department of Supply t and Development to have me kept advised on this matter. I have been receiving letters of that kind for the last six or eight months. Naturally the unemployed and the people interested in this enterprise are becoming impatient. When I arrive in my electorate within the next few days they will want to know if the Commonwealth Government has come to any definite decision in regard to the matter. one knows belter than the Treasurer the conditions which exist in northern and central Queensland. I ask the honourable gentleman to give favourable consideration to these requests. I do not intend now to go into the whole question of the production of power alcohol in Australia. I merely ask the Treasurer to see that no time is lost in putting into operation the scheme outlined by the Minister for Supply and Pevclopment on the 25th June, when he said that the Government had decided as a first objective to aim at a production of 22,000,000 gallons of power alcohol per annum, of which 7,000,000 gallons would be provided from anhydrous distilleries, 5,000,000 from existing rectified spirit distilleries, and 10,000,000 from new distilleries to be erected. My complaint is that the decision of the Government in regard to this matter does not meet with the approval of the Queensland Cane-growcrs Council. Mr R. Muir. the secretary of the council, who was also a member of the Power Alcohol Committee of In q u i r y which inquired into this try, issued a circular letter on the 27th June last which contained the following paragraph:Xaturally all engaged in the sugar industry will be somewhat disappointed that the Commonwealth Government has not seen fit to include this State in its programme to spend fl,100,000 to provide new distillery capacity. Mr Forde. I have no objection to what has been proposed in the way of new distilleries for the production of power alcohol from wheat in New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia. My only complaint is that provision was not made for additional distillery capacity in Queensland where there is such an acute over-production problem in the sugar industry. As the result of the increasing difficulty of getting shipping space to take our surplus sugar overseas the problem is becoming accentuated. I content myself now by asking the Treasurer to reconsider the advisability of providing additional distillery capacity in Queensland. The shortage of liquid fuel is a matter of first-rate importance today and it will become of greater importance as it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain petrol from overseas. . I stress the importance of these matters and ask the Treasurer for some definite assurance that No they will be dealt with by the Government at once.",101
394,Mr BLACKBURN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"Bourke) [1.33 a.m.] - Whil e the Treasurer (Mr. Fadden) was Acting Prime Minister I brought before him certain correspondence from the Victoria n Refugee Migration Appeals Committee relating to the interned refugees who were sent to Australia from Great Britain . The honourable gentleman informed me that the matter was receiving consideration. A great number of refugees were interned in England following the disturbances and the terror of May, 1940. Some were subsequently sent to Canada, and others to Australia. There are now about 2,000 of them in the internment camps at Hay and Tatura. It is now admitted by the British authorities that the wholesale in ternment of refugees in May and June, 1940, was a mistake, and that a great number of these people should be at liberty. There were some tragic cases. There was that of an Austrian musician who was in England at the outbreak of the war at the invitation of English indus- musicians. He was interned during the terror of May, 1940. Whilst he was in the internment camp he contracted tuberculosis and died. There is a general demand for the release of many of these unfortunate people; but we can do nothing about it without the consent - of the British Government. The Commonwealth Government merely acts as their custodian. Had it been possible to provide transport facilities many of them would have been back in Great Britain by now. But it is not possible, and their only hope is the United States of America. In that connection, however, a difficulty has arisen, which, I hope, will be overcome, aud that is that the United States of America will not grant visas to any person whose release from internment is merely conditional. Unconditional release is a p re-requisite to the Consul of the United States of America granting visas for migration to that country. I should like the Treasurer to give his attention to this matter with a view to representations being made to Great Britain.",102
395,Mr DEDMAN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"Corio) [1.36 a.m.] I should not have risen at this late hour but for a matter which I consider to be of supreme importance. Certain constituents of mine, members of the Militia Force, have received notice that they will be required for continuous military duty for the duration of the war. I have not made any bones about where I stand in regard to conscription. I am opposed to conscription for home service as well as for service overseas. I . am opposed to it on religious grounds, because I do not believe that any man or any government ought to force any individual to take up the art of killing his fellow-men. But apart from that aspect, I take up the case of my constituents now because many of them have dependent mothers, sisters or younger brothers. It is totally unfair and inequitable that a sacrifice should be demanded from those individuals, whereas other individuals make no sacrifice at all. The men concerned are members of the 10th Anti-aircraft Battery stationed at WiUiamstown racecourse. It is merely by chance that they are not in the infantry, where they would be called upon to serve two periods of three months each year and be free for the remainder of the year to earn good wages in order to meet their commitments. I suppose that the Minister will say that it is necessary to call these men up for the duration of the war because they are members of a technical unit in which the period of training is long. My answer is that if the Government gave a sufficiently high scale of pay it would get all the volunteers it needs for any branch of the Services. It always strikes me as anomalous that this Government which is so enthusiastic about the capitalist system runs away from that system when it comes to the payment of those who fight for us, because the theory of capitalism is this: The reward for work done or services rendered is always just sufficiently high to draw the necessary number of men needed to do that work or to render that service. The correct thing to do under the capitalist system would be to offer a sufficiently high reward to attract sufficient men into the fighting services. I am concerned, too. about another aspect of the matter, and I am sorry that the Minister for the Army (Mr. Spender) is not in the chamber to hear what I have to say. When these young men complained to me I immediately rang up the commanding officer of the unit concerned. . He was not particularly pleased about it. He said that the men had no business to come to me. I deny that. This is a very serious thing; they had every right to come to me as their member. I do not concede the right of soldiers to approach members of Parliament about trifling matters of military routine, but in such an important matter as this they had every right to come to me. As a sequel to my talk over the 'phone with the commanding officer the unit was paraded and the men were told that on the next occasion they approached their member in connection with military matters they would be dealt with. I ask the Treasurer to take this matter up with the Minister for the Army, because no officer in charge of a unit has the right to adopt such an attitude. In fact, I understand that the Minister for the Army has issued instructions that the practice must cease. I brought the matter of the calling up of these young men for the duration of the war to the notice of the Minister for the Army today, and he gave me a reply which does not satisfy. The last paragraph of that reply reads:Any cases of hardship can always be considered on their merits and it is within the rights of those who may be affected to make application through the commanding officer for leave or exemption from such full-time duty. Just imagine the treatment that they would receive from their commanding officer if I told them to pursue that course. I have been in the Army, and I know how difficult conditions can be made for individuals who are unpopular in the eyes of those in command. I do not think that the young men, 25 in all, will from now on receive a very fair spin. ""Whatever may happen in the future, I appeal to the Government to release these men from service for the duration of the war. All of them did two three-monthly training periods last year, and their regular camp training this year. So to a large degree they have discharged their duty to the country. I urge the Government to give instructions for the release of these men from the obligation to serve for the duration of the war. I treat this matter very seriously indeed. Last night the Government was given a taste of the pressure which members of this party can bring to bear when it mobilizes its numbers. I want the Government to understand that if it does not take action favourable to the men, I shall do my best to repeat that performance. - Six months ago, the Government announced, in response to requests from all sides of the House, that it would appoint a Standing Committee on Taxation. For six months, the Government did nothing, but a few days ago it announced that it would appoint a committee. The personnel of the committee was then disclosed. The Labour members of that body had been chosen nearly six months ago. Shortly after tihe Government announced the personnel, the chairman of that committee, a government supporter, resigned. It was only late last evening that I learned the terms of reference of the committee, which are much more restricted than we on this side understood that they would be. They confine the work of the committee to an examination of the anomalies of the sales tax legislation, whereas it was distinctly understood that the committee was to be asked to review the whole field of taxation. I, personally, have given this matter a great deal of attention during the last six months, with the result that I had prepared several important suggestions for increasing the revenue. For instance, one idea I had in mind, which I mentioned in the House Ifr. Dedman. this week, was that the Treasurer should consider the imposition of a special tax on the holders of £500,000,000 worth of securities which were converted in 1931 under the debt conversion legislation. The holders of these securities have not yet paid Id. towards the cost of the war by way of tax on the securities - they hold. I had several other suggestions, to make with the same end in view. However, the Government has restricted the work of the committee to the consideration of the anomalies of the sales tax. For that reason, I decided to-night that no useful purpose could be served by my continuing as a member of that committee, and I ihave forwarded my resignation from that body to the Prime Minister.",103
396,Mr DRAKEFORD,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"Maribyrnong) [1.49 a.m.] - Althoug h I have many matters which I should like to raise at this juncture, I propose, in view of the hour, to deal with only two of them. Recently, I pressed the Government to release an internee whose qualifications fitted him to play an important part in our war effort. I was then told by the Minister for the Army (Mr. Spender) that the matter would be looked into. .Representations have been made in respect of similar cases over a long period, but nothing seems to have been done. I appreciate the fact that certain difficulties confront the Government in a matter of this kind. I again urge the Government to give prompt attention to my request that tihis man be released. He is capable of rendering the form of assistance which our war departments are seeking. As the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) pointed out, it is now generally admitted that many of the people who were picked up in England during the threatened invasion of that country last year, and sent out to Australia where they are now interned, should never have been interned at all. However, one difficulty is that if they are released ways and means must be found to transport them to other countries which will accept them. I emphasize that the man to whom I have referred particularly, is not only able, but also willing to participate in our war effort in a sphere where technical skill is urgently required. I repeat that he is strongly antiNazi. Surely the Government can find a way to utilize the services of a man who possesses his high qualifications as a tool-designing engineer. I , personally, know of this man's qualifications. I also desire to draw attention to the delays which are still taking place in the settling of disputes in the Arbitration Court. The information contained in the announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) that the Government proposed to postpone the introduction of the amending Arbitration Bill in an endeavour to evolve a scheme suitable to all parties in order to bring about a smoother working of our arbitration machinery, commends itself to honourable members: I point out, however, that in the meantime, considerable irritation is being caused because applications for war loadings are not being dealt with in a Commonwealth Court, although similar applications have been granted in some of the States. Judges, of course, do not make explanations. The fact remains that the men interested in these claims are not receiving a hearing. Complaints are also being made about delays being experienced in getting decisions from the reference boards which were set up for the purpose of promptly settling minor disputes. I know of cases which have been held up for twelve months. I do not blame the chairman of the Board of Reference who is responsible for giving decisions. Obviously, he is not being given the assistance in his work which he so urgently requires. It seems strange that any substantial delay should occur in giving decisions after the hearing of evidence has been concluded. One aspect of the matter is that as these decisions are subject to appeal, the chairman will not give a decision without very careful consideration of each case. I ask the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) to bring this matter to the notice of the Attorney^General (Mr. Hughes) and to remind his colleague that it has been brought up in this House on many occasions. I ask that the fullest possible assistance be given to the men of the Boards of Reference. It is useless to attempt to pacify the men by merely reminding them that these boards have been established. The men want decisions. When such serious delays occur in the announcements of decisions after the completion of the hearing, these boards appear to be somewhat farcical. I am not being unduly critical; I merely ask the Treasurer to bring it under the notice of the Attorney-General, who, no doubt, will act immediately and have the position remedied. Perhaps I am too optimistic. If something be not done, we shall have a very good case for taking action in order to ensure more prompt decisions by Ministers.",104
397,Mr FADDEN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"Darling DownsTreasurer) [1.56] - in reply- I have listened with interest to the observations of various honourable members. Their submissions will be brought to the notice of the appropriate Ministers. However, I shall refer now to several matters that were raised. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) has been consistent and persistent in his efforts to obtain the best possible results from the exploitation of the mineral resources of central Queensland. As the result of representations which he made, I was encouraged to establish a special committee to investigate the copper and bauxite resources of the whole of Australia. That committee has visited various places, including Mount Morgan and Mount Chalmers, and its report will be made available to the Government in the near future. The Mount Chalmers mine was visited by Mr. Mawley, a technical officer of the Commonwealth Government, who found that there were 28,000,000 gallons of water in the mine. He is at present evolving some scheme to remove that water. Until he succeeds, nothing can be done to put the mine into successful operation. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also referred to power alcohol. The honourable gentleman must know that there is no need to arouse my sympathy in the power alcohol industry, because I have been an ardent advocate of its development since 1931. But, whilst those persons engaged in the sugar industry of chairQueensland may be disappointed with the immediate recommendations of the Power Alcohol Committee of Inquiry, they can at least afford to be patient. The Government had to take many factors into consideration, including priorities with regard to machinery and distillery equipment. It had to relate the production of power alcohol to the petrol supply of this country, in order that it could establish an economic blend. Another factor was the perilous condition of other industries apart from the sugar industry. For that reason the wheat industry has been given something which the sugar industry has had for many years-that is the right to convert its surplus crop into power alcohol. Therefore, the sugar industry has no just grounds for complaint. The production of 22,000,000 gallons a year is the first step towards the implementation of the maximum recommendations of the committee for the production of 50,000,000 gallons a year. I assure the honourable gentleman that the sugar industry will receive sympathetic consideration because the Government recognizes its value as a potential producer of power alcohol as a liquid fuel.",105
398,Mr FORDE,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"What about my request for assistance for the establishment of an electrolytic copper refinery at Mount Morgan, and a plant for the production of pyrites?",106
399,Mr FADDEN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"That matter has been raised before by the honourable gentleman and has received the consideration of the Government. I am hopeful that something - will be achieved in that direction very soon. I was sorry to hear the honourable member for Corio (Mr Dedman) announce his resignation from the Taxation Committee. I ' believe that some misunderstanding must exist in connection with the terms of reference of that committee. With his knowledge of the incidence of taxation, the honourable gentleman must realise that it would take many months for a parliamentary committee to make a full inquiry into the subject of taxation as a science. Royal commission after royal commission has inquired into this very complex subject, and the last royal commission took four years to arrive at a finding. In this time of emergency, the incidence of sales tax and the task of rectifying anomalies deserve serious consideration; the honourable member could give very valuable service in that direction before the next budget is introduced. I regret that I have to refer to a matter which was mentioned by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Drakeford), who took my department to task last night. I know that the honourable member did so on the basis of information that he had, but he must have been misled. I appreciate the fact that his attack was not directed at me personally, but in all fairness to myself and to my department, I should make the position quite plain. The honourable member referred to a loan for £10,400 which the Braybrook Shire Council desires to raise for road construction. On the 31st March, the shire secretary wrote to the honourable member and pointed out that it was necessary to obtain the consent of the State Treasurer to borrow the amount required. The correspondence was forwarded to me on the 4th April. My reply, dated the 7th April, stated that the necessary inquiries would be made. This matter was not within my jurisdiction, but in accordance with the promise made, the Commonwealth Actuary, on my instructions, forwarded ful l particulars in writing to the Victorian State Treasurer. No written acknowledgment was received, and the Actuary telephoned the State Treasurer's office on the 14th May, when he was informed that the details had been submitted by the State authorities to the Co-ordinator-General of Works. This information was given to the honourable member by telegram immediately on its receipt, and any delay which may have occurred cannot rightly be attributed to me or to the Treasury officials. Under the provisions of the National Security (Capital Issue) Regulations, loans by local authorities for less than £25,000 can be approved by a State Treasurer, without reference to me. Consequently this loan, as pointed out by the honourable member's own correspondent, did not require my consent. As a matter of courtesy to the honourable member, the details were forwarded by me to the State authorities, and as the matter was solely within their jurisdiction, the further information supplied by the State Treasury was given to him. In quiries made today revealed that the loan has been included in the Victorian gramme for borrowings in 1941-42 for submission to the Co-ordinator-General.",106

What amount of money has been issued free of any charge from the Commonwealth since the outbreak of war? MR . FADDEN - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as 1 and 2. The Government's policy in regard to this matter has been stated very clearly on a number of occasions.

Why were such Supplementary Estimates not introduced during the financial 194041 ? 3. Is it normal in this Parliament, and does it involve any violation of any act of Parliament for Supplementary Estimates any financial year to be delayed beyond next succeeding financial year to which they refer ?",108
409,Mr FADDEN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"The answers to the honourable member's questions follows:1. To-day, the 3rd July, 1941. 2. It is customary that Supplementary Estimates be not introduced into the House before the report of the Auditor-General for the relative year has been received. That report was received in time for introduction towards the end of the last sittings in March, but pressure of parliamentary business prevented their introduction. 3. No. POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERIES.",108
410,Mr MENZIES,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"On the 1st July, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) asked a question, without notice, in which he suggested that consideration be given to the matter qf establishing additional power alcohol distilleries in Queensland. I now inform the honourable member that full consideration was given to this matter when the Government decided to proceed with the expansion of (the power alcohol industry. As a first objective, the government programme provides for the production of 4,000,000 gallons of power alcohol in Queensland-the production in that State is now only 1,250,000 gallons-4,000,00 0 gallons in New South Wales, 4,000,000 gallons in Victoria, 3,000,000 gallons in Soufjh Australia, and 2,000,000 gallons per annum in Western Australia. Ten million gallons of this will be produced from wheat, while the remaining 7,000,000 gallons will be produced from molasses supplemented by 44,000 ,tons of raw sugar per annum. In fixing these quotas for each State consideration was given to the question of the quantity which could be absorbed with petrol on a rationed basis to provide an optimum mixture.

417,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,Endowmen t may not be paid in any case after the child attains the age of sixteen years. Generally speaking the fact that the child has l e ft school and is employed will be disregarded. There may be comparatively few instances where the conditions of employment such as abnormally high remuneration or the provision of board and lodgings complicate the question. These cases will be determined on their individual merits after an examination of all the facts. FREE SCHOOL REQUISITES.,108

If so, what action has the Minister taken or docs he intend to take?",109
420,Mr HARRISON,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"The answers to the honourable member's .questions are as follows:1.

421,Mr RYAN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO,"the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the operation of the laws regulating the immigration into Australia of German and Italian subjects is suspended for the duration of the war only? 2. If so, what will be the position at the end of the war of the German and Italian nonmilitary subjects now interned in Australia?",109
422,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO," answers to tihe honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Since the outbreak of war the entry of German and Italian subjects into Australia has been suspended. The whole question of [32] administration of the immigration laws after the war will naturally be a subject for the Government to determine. 2. There would seem to be no relation between question 2 and question 1, but no decision has been reached as to the position at the end of the war of enemy aliens interned by the Commonwealth authorities. So far aa internees received by the Commonwealth Government on behalf of the United Kingdom Government are concerned, the arrangements made with the United Kingdom Government provide that they will not be retained in Australia at the end of the war.

437,Mr FADDISN,PORT AUGUSTA TO KALGOORLIE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions ' are follows:1. The pay and allowances, including the allowances to wives, made to members of thu fighting forces abroad are exempt from taxaof tion. Subject tn the answer to 2 below, the pay and allowances to members of the home forces are subject to taxation provided and allowances are in excess of the statutory exemption of £200. Generally speaking, pay and allowances to members of the home forces arc not liable to taxation in the case of those under the rank of sergeant. 2. No. The .value of meals and quarters supplied to members of the Militia Forces called up for compulsory training is not added to their pay for taxation purposes. 3. The civilian earnings of members of the forces prior to IJieir enlistment are not exempt from taxation. It is quite possible, therefore, that in certain cases men now serving in the Army are receiving assessment notices in respect of their civilian earnings prior to enlistment. If the members of the forces affected are not in a position to pay the taxes assessed, they should submit their financial position to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation concerned, who will sympathetically consider any extension of time desired for payment of the tax.
