The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Canberra and electors of the Divisions of Fraser and Canberra respectively showethThat we are utterly opposed to the National Capital Development Commissions proposals to erect eighteen town houses on Block 3 of Section 107, Ainslie. The suggested development would destroy one of the most attractive small parks in Canberra. Section 107. which has been developed and maintained as a park since the original subdivision of the area, provides a variety of opportunities for recreation and relaxation and contributes to the physical and mental health of many people who come to the park to exercise dogs, play games, or simply to enjoy the views and peaceful surroundings. Town houses would be completely out of character with the existing residences in the area and their construction on Block 3 of Section 107 would alienate the major pan of what is at present an invaluable community amenity. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government take measures to have the entire area of Section 107 gazetted as parkland as a matter of urgency. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Fry. Petition received.

Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. That both homosexuality and incest are unnatural forms of sexual behaviour that are rightly prohibited by law because of the damage they cause to individuals, to the family unit and to society generally. 2. That experts in the fields of medicine, psychiatry, law and religion together have placed on record the following unpleasant facts about homosexuality: (a) Probably half of all suicides and homicides in big cities can be attributed to homosexuality (in Cast the First Stone by Judge Munagh). (b) Half of the cases of syphilis in USA. can be traced to homosexuals (in VD) because of their constant search for new partners. (c) Homosexuals continually seek new forms of sexuality, head into sadomasochims, and become vicious (Dr M. Anchell, psychiatrist). (d) Homosexuality is not healthy or wholesome . . . There are emotional and physical consequences to this isfaction. Homosexuals will suffer severe emotional, mental, and physical illness more than normal people and will turn to alcohol, drugs and suicide (in Towards an Understanding of Homosexuality by Dr Cappon). (e) The seduction of the young is something the homosexual cannot resist (in Psychopathia Sexualis by Kraft-Ebing). (0 'Sensitivity Yoga' in the Satanist Movement has been responsible for promoting homosexuality (in Helton Earth by Bob Larson). 3. That homosexuality is not 'innate or inborn' but is an acquired or learned process (in Journal of American Medicine by Dr C. Socarides, M.D.). 4. That it is the act of homosexuality being experienced that makes homosexuality the social problem that it is. and therefore it is the act that must not be made acceptable by legalising it. 5. It is the responsibility of Parliament to provide and maintain laws in keeping with the dignity of life expressed in our traditional Christian cultural ethic. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will preserve and uphold the sections in the Criminal Code which prohibit the practice of homosexual and incestuous acts. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hodges.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, Criminal Code by Mr MACKellar. Petition received. Income Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the existence of a system of double taxation of personal income whereby both the Australian Government and State Governments had the power to vary personal income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any year would: (a) be faced with complicated variations in his or her personal income taxes between States: and (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same job would vary from State to State even when gross wages were advertised as being the same: and (c) require citizens to maintain records of income earned in each State.

We request: The creation of an Establishment to initiate, research, promote, co-ordinate, fund and produce material for children's consumption through the medium of television, as recommended by Australian Children's Television Action Committee in its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts 1973; The Australian Broadcasting Control Boards Advisory Committee Report 1974 and the Television Industry Co-ordinating Committee 1975, as a positive step toward providing better quality television for Australian children.

NA DARWIN CYCLONE: COMPENSATION NA,18
35,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAYMENTS,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer to the national compensation legislation which was introduced by the previous Labor Government and which provided that people who suffered injury were entitled to receive 85 per cent of their normal weekly earnings. I refer also to the compensation paid to the victims of the Darwin cyclone. Is the Prime Minister aware that the provisions of that compensation legislation were applicable to the people who were injured in the Darwin cyclone? Is he aware that some 30 people have been receiving compensatory benefits in accordance with the terms of that national compensation legislation? Is he aware that the Government has now decided to terminate those compensation payments as from the 31st of this month? Accordingly, as many people have suffered permanent injury-ther e are 2 paraplegics as a result of the Darwin cyclone in my electorate-wil l he urgently reconsider the situation in order that these people who suffered permanent damage and also those who are the dependants of deceased people will receive substantial compensation as, in fact, was applied to all those in Darwin who suffered property loss?",19
36,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAYMENTS,I shall examine the position and see what information can be given to the honourable gentleman. NA,19
37,Mr BONNETT,CYCLONE OTTO,"Has the Treasurer seen who reports on the flooding in north Queensland as result of Cyclone Otto? Is he aware of the extent of the damage caused by the cyclone in the Townsville, Ingham and other areas in north the Queensland? Is the Government able to provide any assistance to the areas affected?",19
38,Mr LYNCH,CYCLONE OTTO,"I have been made aware of the very serious flooding which has taken place in parts of northern Queensland. I am informed that the Queensland Government has already declared a state of disaster in certain areas. much appreciate, as I am sure do honourable members generally, the concern which has been expressed by the honourable member for be Herbert. I take this opportunity to say that contacted me at the earliest opportunity to vide me with the latest information which was available directly from his own electorate. The Commonwealth has already embarked upon prepared discussions with officials of the State Administration. I make it clear that any request which comes from Queensland will be dealt with quickly and sympathetically within the framework of the established natural disaster procedures. Under these procedures the Commonwealth is prepared to join the State Government on a dollar-fordollar basis in meeting expenditure on the immediate relief of personal hardship and distress, except where such expenditure is of a very minor nature. I should mention also that in respect of major disasters-it is too early to say whether the present situation will come within this categorythe Commonwealth assists also with expenditures on agreed relief and restoration measures. I give my colleague, the honourable member for Herbert, a very firm assurance that the Commonwealth will be giving consideration of this matter the highest priority during the period ahead. We are waiting for information from officers of the State Administration. My officials are in urgent contact with them now. I hope to be in a position in the course of the next 24 hours to let the honourable gentleman know what the situation will be in respect of assistance. NA",19
39,Mr MORRIS,UNEMPLOYMENT,I ask the Prime Minister: Does he agree with the statement that unemployment in Australia is a myth?,19
40,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT,The honourable gentleman would well know that the Government's policies are directed towards achieving a full recovery in the Australian economy that will enable soundly based businesses to operate and to provide employment for those Australians wish to work. I think also it ought to be a understood that for those who want to work and who are unable to find work the personal tragedy involved is a very great one indeed not only for individual but also for the family as a whole. I hope that every honourable member of this House shares that view. At the same time. I think a large number of members of this House are also aware of people who have travelled to certain areas where there has not been much work and who seem not to want to work. The obliI very gation that the Commonwealth has to those who could work but who do not want to work is something which I think honourable members should able to examine if they feel inclined to have he proper concern for the way in which taxpayers' prodollars are spent. There have been widespread allegations of abuse in this matter. The Government would be derelict in its duty if it were not to try to examine that aspect. When we have the results of the Norgard inquiry into the Commonwealth Employment Service I think we all might be better advised about the facts of the situation. NA,19
41,Mr DOBIE,UNSKILLED WORKERS,"Is the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations aware that proprietors of fish and chip shops, among others, are having great difficulty in obtaining unskilled workers and that these proprietors are being disadvanincome taged by the present immigration policy of exthe cluding such likely workers coming from overwhich seas on the grounds that such workers available in Australia? Will the Minister consider instituting a more sophisticated yet practical classification system within his Department which will relate with greater accuracy and realism all those activities in Australia which tinue to experience great difficulties in filling vacancies including, of course, fish and chip shops?",20
42,Mr STREET,UNSKILLED WORKERS,"I am not aware of the situation that the honourable member describes. prepared Guidelines are, of course, laid down for eligicharging bility for entry to Australia having regard to the previous experience and skills of the applicants wanting to come to this country market demand for that experience and/or skill. The Commonwealth Employment Service is working under great pressure at present. That position will be alleviated to a considerable extent by the recent decision of the Government in agreeing to an increase of 300 oflicers in staff ceilings of the CES. That is a direct result comments made to me by Mr Norgard during plus the course of his inquiry which amounts, as the Prime Minister has just said, to a fundamental review of all the operations of the CES. I hesitate to do anything which would add to the work load of the CES in its present difiicult circumstances, but nevertheless I will see that the honourable member's suggestion receives detailed ance consideration. NA",20
43,Mr ARMITAGE,CONSUMER PRICE INDEX,Does the Treasurer accept All that the living standards of Australians as measured by the consumer price index have risen by 6 per cent in the December quarter? Does also agree that as there was virtually no increase in wages in that quarter Australians have suffered a 6 per cent drop in their living standards?,20
44,Mr LYNCH,CONSUMER PRICE INDEX,"I really do not know what the honourable gentleman is seeking to get at, but sounds very similar to the type of fatuous nonsense that the honourable member for Adelaide has been talking about recently in relation to what he calls a fall in real household disposable income. That is the concept at which the honourable gentleman who poses the question ought to be looking. In response to the question about living standards, if the honourable gentleman looks at the latest information available in regard to the movement in the real household disposable index he will find a rise in real terms over year to the September quarter. That increase, is obviously a measurement of living stanare still dards, was 3.8 per cent. NA NA",20
45,Mr LUSHER,AREAS,"I direct a question to the Minconister for Post and Telecommunications. He will job be aware of the record surplus achieved by the Australian Telecommunications Commission in the last 6 months. I ask the Minister whether he is in a position to have discussions with Telecom with a view to seeing whether that organisation is to take a more lenient attitude towards for the provision of services, particularly in rural areas. He will be aware of the significant concern expressed by so many people and the labour who live in ",20
46,Mr SPEAKER,AREAS,Order! The honourable gentleman is now providing information. I call the Minister for Post and Telecommunications.,20
47,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,AREAS,"The likely result for the the Australian Telecommunications Commission of for the full financial year will probably be a surof about $ 150m. If one wants to gear that to the capital invested, one is talking about a return of just below 3 per cent. I know that a lot of people say that Telecom ought not be looked at as if it were a business undertaking; it is really part of the government. The Commission has a responsibility to administer its affairs in accordwith the Act. It has to fund at least 50 per cent of its capital requirements out of internal revenue. This year the capital requirements of Telecom are about $9l0m . Therefore it must find more than $450m out of internal revenue. the surplus is allocated to the extension of the network and the creation of facilities for communication for Australians. The Australian comhe munity owns Telecom. Any surplus goes back for the benefit of the Australian community. Of course the Government is concerned about costs in rural areas. So is the Commission. The honourable member may know that a committee of Government members and I have had subit stantial discussions with Telecom. We have taken a number of initiatives to try to improve the service and to reduce costs. I would Uke him to know that, as a pohcy attitude, the Telecommunications Commission is determined to try to improve services and to reduce wherever possible costs throughout the Australian rural community.

48,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,MECHANISATION,"Has the Prime Minmember ister said that he is opposed to machines replacknow, ing men? If so, why does he subsidise machines by giving a 40 per cent investment allowance, and penalise labour by allowing the continuation of payroll taxes?",21
49,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MECHANISATION,"I think the this year honourable gentleman is simplifying a certain proposition to much too great an extent. Quite obviously there is a process of mechanisation throughout industry and has been for a very long whUe. The point I was seeking to make was that if Australians-that includes, I would hope, person in this House-wan t full employment this country and want to recapture the circumconsignment stances in which everyone who wants a job get one, some industries, I think, will have reasonably labour intensive. If one wants to establish the mechanisms of lack of protection, which makes certain that all those industries appear from Australia, I believe that this country would be very much worse off because we would not have the kind of employment situation which basically we need. Much of this is bound up the rate of change. Quite obviously there is speed of change which industry can undertake a reasonable and proper manner. If one tries to force the pace of change too much, there will a very serious situation and many people will lose their jobs. In the manufacturing industry, example, wages rose by 53 per cent in the 2 years to October, at a time when productivity in the manufacturing industry actually fell. Roughly 100 000 people lost their jobs in manufacturing industry over that period. I hope the honourable gentleman will not try to over simplify that have quite complex relationships with each other. NA",21
50,Mr GOODLUCK,TASMANIAN APPLE INDUSTRY,Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware of the serious problems facing the Tasmanian export apple industry? Does the Minister know what is happening in relation the Tasmanian Government's proposal to tralian establish an authority to market Tasmanian apples this season? Will Commonwealth moneys be used to support the operation of the authority? This is a very serious question.,21
51,Mr SINCLAIR,TASMANIAN APPLE INDUSTRY,"I thank the honourable member for Franklin for the question because he has been very vocal since his election to this House in expressing to the full knowledge of every one of us the plight that many of his constituents face in the fairly serious circumstances of the Tasmanian apple industry. The present position has been aggravated, as the honourable knows and as many others may not because last year there were difficulties with fruit that was shipped on consignment, in particular to the United Kingdom from Tasmania, not coming out of the box as well as the importers had hoped. As a result some fairly heavy losses were incurred. As a consequence there have been some quite real difficulties in placing fruit both in the United Kingdom and I understand in Hamburg. Fortunately some fairly worthwhile placements have been made in the Scandinavian countries. I understand there is an expectation of some sales to Denmark. The every position regarding the Hamburg and the United in Kingdom markets and the disposal of fruit on is such that there is a very real can worry as to what might happen with fruit to be exports, particularly from Tasmania. The Tasmanian Government, I am told, disalthough I have not been advised officially, has decided on the recommendation of a number of protagonists in Tasmania to set up some type of a statutory marketing authority which is intended with to handle fruit shipped to the United Kingdom a and Germany. The circumstances and character in of the proposed marketing authority, the arrangements that are to apply with respect to the be financing of the fruit and to the payment of growers are, however, quite unknown to me. It is for true that supplementary assistance is to be provided by the Commonwealth in conjunction with the States and that discussions are continuing to determine the way by which this might best be provided. However, I have no foreknowledge of this being in any way related to the statutory matters marketing authority. I very sincerely share the concern of the honourable member for Franklin at what seems to be a quite critical situation developing in respect of the export of Tasmanian fruit. I assure the honourable gentleman that anything he or fruit growers in Tasmania seek to undertake will certainly receive a sympathetic hearing from the to Federal Government. The Chairman of the AusApple and Pear Corporation and Mr Reg Walker, who I understand is the Chairman of the Tasmanian Fruit Marketing Board, will shortly return from the United Kingdom and Europe. meeting of the Apple and Pear Corporation will take place in Melbourne on 18 March to consider the situation. I would hope that by that time and after hearing that report the position might be little clearer and perhaps the State and Federal governments will then be able to consult in respect of the necessary action to be taken. In event, if there is any action being taken by the State Government it will of course not involve Commonwealth finance without the Commonrefer wealth being aware of it and being agreeable to it. NA",21
52,Mr UREN,PENSIONS AND UNEMPLOYMENT,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has the Government decided to review the automatic consumer price index adjustments to pensions and the unemployment benefit embodied in the Social Services AmendHunter ment Act of 1976? If it has not, will the Prime Minister give his assurance that the CPI adjustcriminal ments as currently enacted will continue?",22
53,Mr LYNCH,PENSIONS AND UNEMPLOYMENT,"As the House is aware, the Pararrival liament last year amended the Social Services Act to provide for the automatic indexation pensions in accordance with upward movements in the consumer price index. The Government has not given any further consideration to matter. NA",22
54,Mr JULL,QUEENSLAND COUNCIL OF SOCIAL,"I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. Is the Minister aware that the Queensland Counanswered, cil of Social Service has had to dismiss three four staff members because of its present finanthen cial situation? Is the Minister also aware that director's position is also in jeopardy because lack of finance? Can the Minister inform the of House whether QCOSS has approached the Minister Government for financial assistance? Can Minister detail whether moneys will be forthcoming to enable QCOSS to continue at an acceptable level of service to the community or whether alternative methods of funding are question. available?",22
55,Mr HUNT,QUEENSLAND COUNCIL OF SOCIAL,"I am aware from statements recently reported in the Queensland Press that the Queensland Council of Social Service is having difficulty in meeting staff payment commitments it had made. The Queensland Minister for Health stated recently that the Queensland in Government had no funds available to it to help the Council. The honourable member will recall A that on coming to power the Government allocated a further $60,000 to the Council to enable it to honour its commitments. The Government has no further funds available to it at this a time to assist the Council. In addition to Government support, the Council may call upon community and voluntary organisations for support, any as one would have thought it would have done already. I suggest that it do that immediately to overcome its budgetary problem. However, I will the totality of the question to the Minister for Social Security. No doubt she will provide the most up-to-date information for the honourable member's benefit. BENEFIT IMMIGRATION: SCREENING NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I ask the Attorney General a question. He will remember that a fortnight ago both the honourable member for and I asked questions about the issue of a visa to an American citizen with an established record. I now ask: Is it a fact, as was reported subsequently, that that person was met on and escorted through Customs at Sydney Airport by Commonwealth police officers 2 days of before we asked our questions? When did the Attorney-General or the police learn of that person's pending arrival? Why was it considered the necessary for him to be met by Commonwealth police officers? Did the Attorney-General consult with his colleagues responsible for the issue of visas or did the police consult with the relevant SERVICE departments before it was arranged for the police to meet this visitor?",22
56,Mr ELLICOTT,PROCEDURES,"I think the question I I answered on behalf of the Minister of its for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, who was ill. The answer I gave was based on the the information that I had received. I cannot assist of the honourable gentleman in regard to the detail the question that he asks. I will refer it to the for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I the have no doubt that he will give an answer. Mr E. G. Whitlam-What about the police?",22
57,Mr ELLICOTT,PROCEDURES,I have answered the NA SERVICE: ABORTION CLINIC,22
58,Mr MARTYR,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT,"Is the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations aware that the Commonwealth Employment Service is assisting the recruitment of staff for abortion clinics? Has the Minister any information about the circumstances surrounding an incident in Canberra recently when a representative from a Sydney abortion clinic operated by Population Services International used the offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service at Woden to interview job applicants selected by the CES for a proposed abortion clinic at Phillip? Does the Commonwealth Employment Service look at the industrial relations of the firms to which it sends applicants? Does the Commonwealth Employment Service know that some staff of Population Services International in Sydney resigned recently in protest over working conditions? Did the Commonwealth Employment Service check with the Capital Territory Health Commission before assisting Population Services International, to find out whether the proposed abortion clinic would be within the law and would meet all requirements for health clinics? Finally, if the Minister is not familiar with the matters to which I refer, will he undertake to have them examined by his Department?",22
59,Mr STREET,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT,"The honourable member has asked a number of questions. This issue has been brought to my attention. As far as I am able to establish, the facts are these: Population Services International originally applied to the Commonwealth Employment Service on or about 21 January this year, calling itself the Phillip Medical Centre- a group of doctors setting up a medical centre at Phillip in the Australian Capital Territory. At that time it lodged requests with the Commonwealth Employment Service for 9 professional, semi-professional and clerical staff. The applicants selected by the CES were interviewed, as the honourable member said, at the Woden CES office on 8 February by a representative of the firm. Final interviews subsequently took place also at the Woden office, I understand, on 16 and 17 February. All the vacancies in fact were filled by referrals from the CES. The CES did not check or consider it necessary to check with the ACT Health Commission before assisting the Phillip Medical Centre in filling its vacancies because the CES was under the clear impression that the centre was, as had been represented to the CES, a medical centre. It was only after the interviews were completed that several applicants then stated to the CES staff that they were not prepared to accept positions with the Phillip Medical Centre because it was explained to them during their final interviews that abortions would be performed at this centre. I might add that the CES has no actual obligation to assist all employers seeking its help to recruit staff but it does assist provided an employer is operating within the law. In this instance the CES had no reason to believe that in fact this employer was not operating within the law. I am not aware of any staff resigning from Population Services International in Sydney over working conditions. I am not saying that that did not happen. All I am saying is that I am not aware of it. The CES does not normally look into the industrial relations of the firms to which it sends applicants. However, if it is brought to the notice of the CES that there may be a breach of a Federal award or of conditions or terms of employment the matter is immediately investigated by the arbitration inspectorate of my Department to see whether appropriate action should be taken. If the honourable member believes and has evidence to suggest that that in fact has occurred at some other branches of this organisation then appropriate action will be taken. NA",23
60,Mr CHARLES JONES,NEWCASTLE STATE DOCKYARD,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister. Has he been advised that the floating dock at the Newcastle State Dockyards has been declared unsafe and is no longer available for dockings? Is he aware of the serious effect this will have on the future employment of about 200 men who are permanently employed on the dock? Is it correct that 5 firm dockings which would have involved work valued at about $500,000 and which would have provided employment for about 200 men have been cancelled and that further cancellations will now have to follow? Has the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, made repeated representations to the Commonwealth Government for financial assistance to assist the New South Wales Government to replace the now unsafe dock? If representations have been made, can the Prime Minister give me some indication of his Government's response? Finally, has the Commonwealth Government been considering making a special grant, similar to the Fraser Island grant, for the Newcastle district to help provide employment for the unemployed dockyard workers following the Commonwealth Government's decision to place orders in Japan for the building of four 15 000 tonne bulk ships for the Australian National Line? Can the Prime Minister tell the House what is the present position in this matter, bearing in mind that the level of unemployment in the Newcastle district is the highest of any centre in Australia?",23
61,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NEWCASTLE STATE DOCKYARD,"The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and his Department have, through the normal processes, as I understand it, undertaken to make sure that the services of the Department and the programs of the Government are fully understood in relation to anyone who may be displaced as a result of a continuation of the previous Government's policy in regard to support for the shipbuilding industry. I think that the honourable member is in rather an odd circumstance because he was the person who ordered 4 large ships from Sweden and Germany respectively. Mr Charles Jones- Mr Speaker, I rise to order.",23
62,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NEWCASTLE STATE DOCKYARD,"I have not finished the answer yet, Mr Speaker.",24
63,Mr SPEAKER,NEWCASTLE STATE DOCKYARD,Order! The honourable member for Newcastle is taking a point of order. Mr Charles Jones-My point of order is that not one of the four 220 000 tonne and 240 000 tonne ships could be built in any shipyard in Australia.,24
64,Mr SPEAKER,NEWCASTLE STATE DOCKYARD,The honourable gentleman does not have a point of order. He will resume his seat.,24
65,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NEWCASTLE STATE DOCKYARD,"Of course, if the honourable gentleman had been really serious about providing work for Australian shipbuilding yards he might well have been able to order ships that could have been constructed in Australian yards instead of perhaps deliberately choosing ones that could not. I am not aware of having received any approach in recent times from Mr Wran in connection with the floating dock, although I have seen Press reports about it. I must say that it is not entirely unusual to read these thingsfirstin the Press. The other thing that I would like to say, and of which I think this House is already aware, is that the last I heard of Mr Wran being serious about a floating dock was that he was considering ordering a replacement overseas. I have not heard over the last several months whether he has felt able to make a decision in relation to that. NA",24
66,Mr CADMAN,PORNOGRAPHIC LITERATURE,Has the attention of the to Attorney-General been referred to recent reports that undesirable pornographic literature using children has been on sale in shops in Sydney and Melbourne? Has this literature been imported from overseas? Has approval been given for the importation of the literature? What steps does the Attorney-General propose to take in relation to the matter?,24
67,Mr ELLICOTT,PORNOGRAPHIC LITERATURE,"Report s have appeared in the newspapers and on television with regard to literature which was supposed to have been on sale under the counter in I think New South Wales and Victoria. I have seen some literature. do not know whether it is identical with literature on sale, but if it is identical it is literature which bears the mark of having been produced overseas. It is literature which represents children in various sexual poses. Honourable members will be aware that the basic policy of both the Government and the Opposition is that adults should be entitled to hear and see what they wish. In the past films have been brought into this country pursuant to regulation 4A of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and they are classified by the Film Censorship Board. Literature that is presented comes to officers of my Department. If it is indecent or obscene they will prohibit it under regulation 4A. I have caused inquiries to be made of officers of my Department and they have told me that, as far as they could ascertain, literature of this character would be prohibited. From time to time articles of this description come before them and they prohibit them. If such items are on sale in Sydney or Melbourne and if they come from overseas, according to my inquiries they have come in illegally. It is very difficult to police the import of articles of this character. They may come in in somebody's brief case or in a bag as well as in commercial quantities. If they come in they can then be used as the basis for the production of literature for disposal. However in of New South Wales and Victoria, and perhaps in other States, I understand all literature, even literature of this character, is available but if it is of this particular character it will be marked for direct sale and I gather that it has to be put under the counter. Having looked at the literature which is alleged to be of the same character I have certainly formed the view that it is literature that ought not be available anywhere in Australia because it exploits young children. If any honourable member thinks I am harsh in that regard, I invite him to look at some of the literature. I have some of it in my office. Following representations from New South Wales, I propose to call a meeting of ministers dealing with censorship, to see what steps can be taken to impose some limit on this type of material in the States and Territories so that material that would be prohibited at the point of entry would also be prohibited from sale in shops around the country, whether they be sex shops, newsagents or any other kind of shop. I I hope that meeting will take place at an early date the after a meeting of officers has been held. IMMIGRATION: SCREENING NA",24
68,Mr ELLICOTT,PROCEDURES,"Mr Speaker, I wish to supplement an answer that I gave earlier in relation to a question about the issue of a visa to a person with a criminal record. I apprehend, from certain interjections that were made when I concluded that answer, that the Leader of the Opposition might have thought that I was responsible for the Commonwealth Police. I will refer to the Minister for Administrative Services, who is responsible for the Commonwealth Police, that part of the question which relates to the Commonwealth Police. I , of course, as Attorney-General, am not responsible for the Commonwealth Police. NA",25
69,Mr INNES,CANBERRA MOSQUE,My question is directed to the Minister for the Capital Territory. Has Islamic Society of the Australian Capital Terrirepresentations tory been refused permission to build extensions to the Canberra mosque at Yarralumla? Did Minister take this decision on the advice of Department? What reasons has he given for the decision? Is he aware that the Australian ation of Islamic Councils is the decision and that it is regarded by some Muslims as an act of discrimination against Islamic faith?,25
70,Mr STALEY,CANBERRA MOSQUE,"The decision which I made cil, concerning the mosque is in no way related to matters touched upon by the honourable memUnited ber.

71,Mr MCVEIGH,WHEAT PRICES,I address a question to the can Minister for Overseas Trade. Is he aware of cent falling prices for wheat in world markets? Can he advise what he and his Department are doing to prevent the recurrence of a long of low prices for wheat with consequent disruption to the wheat industry? Does the recent sale by the grower controlled Australian Wheat Board to the People's Republic of China indicate that the Wheat Board is controlled by growers who are not only world class producers but also top class businessmen?,25
72,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT PRICES,"I agree with the honourable member that we have a very effective selling organisation in the Australian Wheat Board. has a great record of being able to dispose most of Australia's wheat. There were bad periods in the 1960s when there were huge gluts but, compared with any other country, I think do extremely well. The honourable member is correct when he says that there has been a marked slump in the international prices of wheat. This has followed a number of years of relatively high prices. The weaker price situation has been due to increased crops in the northern hemisphere. The attitude of the Australian Government has always been to foster international marketing organisations to try to stabilise and obtain reasonable prices for our wheat. For the past 20 years Australia has been involved in international wheat agreements and international grains arrangements. These fell apart in about 1972 and all Australia obtained was a new international wheat agreement. This contained no pricing or economic provisions but it did keep the International Wheat Council going and this has been a forum for discussion. The the Government has been very active in making to that body to try to obtain a new international wheat agreement which conthe tains economic provisions. Unfortunately, his progress has been pretty limited because of different opinions between the United States of FederAmerica and the European Economic deeply concerned by Community. I was very heartened at lunch time today when the Otto Lang, the Canadian Minister who is a representative on the International Wheat Counrang me to tell me of his recent discussions the with the new Secretary for Agriculture in the States, who is keen that we have discussions to try to firm up the international marketing situation. As a result of that, I am sending the Secretary of my Department to Ottawa in a few weeks time to have an officials meeting. It is most heartening that the United States is interested in doing something. This, of course, be an important part of the multilateral trade renegotiations which are due to come forward perhaps this year. I think that if we can do the groundwork we have got every chance of getting period a new international wheat agreement. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-The Minister fbr Aboriginal Affairs will remember stating on 11 November 1976 that he had an express undertaking from the Majority Leader of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly that any draft ordinances complementary to this Parliament \s Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) It Act would be prepared in consultation with htm of and must be acceptable to him. He will also remember stating on 14 November that if the Territory legislation was considered unsatisfacwe tory the Government could refer it back to the Legislative Assembly for amendment or could recommend that consent to it be withheld. I ask the Minister: Has the Majority Leader of the Assembly in fact ignored his undertaking and introduced the Aboriginal Lands and Sacred Sites Ordinance 1977 without consulting him? Will the Minister reiterate his statement of 14 November that he would ensure that the Territory legislation accords with Aboriginal wishes and that the Government will not recommend consent to that ordinance if it contravenes the recommendations of Mr Justice A. E. Woodward?",25
73,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The honourable gentleman correspect rectly restates the statements this House back in November last year. The commitment then given by the Majority Leader of the Legislative Assembly, through the Minister for the Northern Territory, was that the complementary legislation would be prepared with my involvement and with my agreement. That commitment still stands. There was consultation between Dr Letts and me in December just after this Parliament rose, and then officers held discussions on 28 January. It is a fact that I had not seen the legislation before it was introduced into the Legislative Assembly. I have now seen it. In fact, I saw it today. I am studying it. I spoke to Dr Letts about the matter today. The stand that I took last year is the stand I now. I give the commitments that I have given previously to the Aboriginal people.

76,Mr ELLICOTT,FOR NATIONAL SONG,"by leave-On 25 February 1977 the Senate passed by absolute majorities the Bills in of the proposed laws to alter the which I made to ConstitutionTo ensure that the Senate elections are held at the same time as House of Representatives elections; To ensure so far as practicable that a casual vacancy in the Senate is filled by a person of the same political Party as the senator chosen by the people and for the balance ofhis term; To provide for retiring ages forjudges of Federal courts; and To allow electors in Territories, as well as electors in the States, to vote at referendums on proposed laws to alter the Constitution. take This House had previously passed these Bills on 17 February 1977. In order to comply with the requirements of section 128 of the Constitution these Bills must be submitted to the electors in State not less than two nor more than six months after their passage through both Houses. I now inform honourable members that the Government has decided that the referendums for these proposed alterations to the Constitution will be held on 21 May 1977. The Government t will be recommending to the Governor General that the writs issue on 27 April. The electoral rolls for the referendums will close on the day the The conduct of the referendums is governed by the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act 1906. Provision is made in that Act for an argument in favour of, and also against, a proposed law to be forwarded to the Chief Australian Electoral Officer, who is then responsible having the arguments printed and for posting copy to each elector. Any such argument must, in accordance with the Act, be forwarded to the the Chief Australian Electoral Officer by 25 March of 1977. An argument in favour of a proposed law 17 must be authorised by majority of those members of both Houses who voted for it and who desire to forward such an argument. A similar authorisation requirement appUes in relation to an argument against a proposed law. The Government is preparing the Yes case in favour of the proposed laws for submission to the Chief Australian Electoral Officer on behalf of those who voted for the proposed laws. In preparing the case the Government will consult with the Leader of the Opposition (MrE. G. Whitlam). The Chief Australian Electoral Officer is required to post the pamphlet to electors not later than 2 weeks after the issue of the writs. Concurrently with the referendums all electors are to have the opportunity to express on a voluntary basis their wishes as to the tune of a national song. A poll will be conducted on the basis that God Save the Queen is the national anthem to be played on regal and vice-regal occasions, but that on other occasions it will be appropriate for a national song to be played. For this purpose electors will be asked to express their preferences for the following tunes: God Save the Queen Advance Australian Fair Song of A ustralia Waltzing Matilda. The Government beUeves that it is desirable that all electors should be able to indicate their wishes as to which of these tunes should be adopted for our national song and the holding of the referendums to alter the Constitution on 21 May will provide an ideal opportunity for this purpose. The electors of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory will be able to participate in this poll for the national song, although it is not possible to provide for them, at this point of time, to participate in the referendums to alter the Constitution. NA NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",26
77,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr there would be a cut of another 3A per cent or so Willis) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for dissaid cussion, namely: The Government's policy of substantially reducing wage and salary levels. I call upon those members who approve of proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",27
78,Mr WILLIS,AUSTRALIA,"When the Fraser Government was elected to office at the end of 1975 it was elected on the basis of various promises made to the Australian people, one of which was to support wage indexation. Of course, as I said in this House a year ago, it took the Government only 2 months or less to break that promise. However, there was some dispute on the Government side at that time as to whether or not it was in fact breaking its promise. In our view it was quite clear, but the Government seemed to want to argue the other way. I suggest that now it would be rather difficult for it to argue any longer that it supports wage indexation. What is happening in the current wage indexation case before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is that the Government is arguing that real wages should be cut by 4 per cent in this quarter; that there should be no increase in the following quarter; and that the Commission then should look at the whole issue at the end of the June quarter. Quite clearly, this is a policy to substantially cut the real level of wages and salaries in this country. There is no getting around that fact. If wages are not adjusted for increases in prices, the real value of wages declines. If that goes on quarter after quarter, the reduction accordingly becomes more and more severe. Already there has been a 2 per cent decline in real award wages because of the failure of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to apply full wage indexation to wages and salaries. This has been mainly at the behest of the Commonwealth Government, which has pressured the Commission to give substantially less than full wage indexation. But that 2 per cent decline will pale into insignificance if the Commonwealth has its way in the future. As I have said, in the current case before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the Government in effect is arguing for 30 per cent indexation-for a $2.90 increase, and no more. That would mean roughly a 2 per cent increase in wages overall. With a 6 per cent increase in prices, that would mean a 4 per cent cut in real wages and salaries taken overall. With no increase in the March quarter, ] in the real level of wages. The Government has in the present case-this might be news to many members of the Government Parties-that real its estimate of inflation in the March quarter is 3V4 per cent. So there will be a 4 per cent cut in the real wages now and a 3 V. per cent cut in the March quarter; and, if there is no further wage increase throughout 1977, there will be a very substantial cut indeed. In the present case the Government is talking about a minimum of 11.8 per cent inflation in 1977. It has said that if there is an increase of only $2.90 a week in this case and no other increases whatever in wages and salaries this calendar year, through either indexation or any other means-eithe r in award rates or overaward rates-the rate of inflation will still be 11.8 per cent. This means, in effect, that we will still have double figure inflation no matter what happens to wages this calendar year. In that situation, of course, there would be a drastic cut in real wage standards; there would be a cut of at least 10 per cent. But that is the way in which the Commonwealth Government seems to be arguing. I suggest that this is a matter of enormous importance for this Parliament. For a government to be arguing publicly that there should be a cut of this order in the real wage levels is extraordinary. I cannot think of a previous occasion on which any Commonwealth government has put such a submission to the people or to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Yet here we have it. An argument that has been put up and that was put up again by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) during question time today against the idea that a cut in real wages in fact means a cut in living standards, which we suggest is certainly the case, is that we have to look at household disposable income and that if we do so a different picture emerges. This is total deception or selfdelusion- I am not sure which. But, in any case, it certainly is not the truth. Household disposable income did go up slightly in the September quarter, as the Treasurer mentioned during question time; but, if we look at what has been happening to it and what is likely to happen to it, we see that there is no doubt that it is substantially down. If real wage levels are to be cut to the extent that is in prospect and that has been the case already, very substantial fiscal policy changes certainly will be needed to overcome the effect. Those changes have not been forthcoming. Tax indexation is the one thing to which the Government can point with any chance of proving its point; but tax indexation does no more than maintain the tax level at what it was in the previous year. It does not represent a tax cut. It is an adjustment made each year to stop the tax burden from getting higher with inflation. So the Government cannot point to tax indexation as a means of adjusting household disposable income to make up for a reduction in real wages and salaries. That argument is just not valid. It is completely false. In fact, if we look at the figures on disposable household income produced by the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research in its publication Australian Economic Review 3rd Quarter 1976 we see that in the first half of 1976 under the Fraser Government the real value of household disposable income fell by 1.4 per cent. The Institute estimated then 0.9 per cent increase for the second quarter, but since then it has had further thoughts about that. In the Australian Economic Review 4th Quarter 1976 the Institute became more worried about the prospect of declining household disposable income. It made this point: Real average male earnings before tax are estimated to fall by 2.5 per cent in the three year, to the final quarter of 1977That is with 80 per cent wage indexation and a 2 per cent increase outside indexationwhile in after-tax terms (for a man with a dependent wife and two children, and including Medibank payments) the decline over this period is likely to be 5 to 6 per cent, with the heaviest falls concentrated in the final quarter of 1976 and thefirstquarter of 1977. I should have thought that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) would have been interested in this. What he is being told is that for a man with a dependent wife and 2 dependent children household disposable income is falling markedly at present and is likely to fall heavily over the 3-year period, but particularly in the last quarter of 1976 and the first quarter of 1977. That assumes 80 per cent wage indexation. But the Government is not pursuing 80 per cent wage indexation; it is pursuing 30 per cent wage indexation now and virtually nothing for the future. This must mean that household disposable income will decline by much more drastic figures than those I have just quoted. The Government should not try to argue that it can cut real wage levels without it really affecting household disposable income because of what it has done by way of tax indexation and family allowances, which were largely offset by the abolition of tax rebates for children anyway. That argument is totally false; it will not wash. The Government is not fooling anybody but itself. It certainly is not fooling the people, who are starting to feel the impact of the cutbacks in their standard of living and who will feel it much more heavily if the Government's wage policies and fiscal policies are maintained. The Government's rationale for pursuing this drastic and incredible policy of slashing the living standards of the Australian people is that first of all it wants to reduce inflation. We share its concern for the need to reduce inflation. The Opposition is strongly concerned about high inflation in this country. The argument we have with the Government is not about the need to reduce inflation; it is about the means which the Government implements to do so. We have put forward proposals to reduce the rate of inflation. Because we are concerned about inflation we have been horrified by the actions taken by the Government, particularly in relation to Medibank and devaluation, which have had such a stimulating effect on inflation. To add 3.2 per cent to the consumer price index, as the Government has done through its Medibank rearrangements which were made for purely ideological reasons; to add 3 per cent to prices through devaluation-the figure of 3 per cent comes from figures given by the Commonwealth Government in the current national wage case-o r to add 6.2 per cent overall through those 2 measures is an incredible exercise for a government which said that its prime aim was to reduce the rate of inflation. What a totally irresponsible set of actions they were in terms of the Government's stated prime objective. The inflation figures, which I have mentioned and which were given by the Commonwealth Government in the current case before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, show that we will have 11.8 per cent-virtuall y 12 per cent-inflatio n with virtually no wage increases this year. That will be partly because of devaluation, partly because of the Medibank figures and, of course, partly because of the flow-on of the underlying inflation rate which the Government has not yet succeeded in doing much to reduce. What this policy really amounts to is that the Government is arguing that wage and salary earners should pay for the mistakes it has made; that the wage and salary earners should pay for the fact that the Government has added 3.2 per cent to prices through Medibank rearrangements and has added 3 per cent to prices through devaluation. The Government is arguing that the wage and salary earners should pay this price by having their living standards cut as this is the only means left to reduce inflation. The policy is incredible, appalling and totally irresponsible. If it had been put forward at the last election honourable members opposite would not have got within a cooee of being elected as a government. Another part of the Government's rationale for undertaking this action is the transfer of income from wage and salary earners to profits. The Government wants to bring about this transfer. It is said by the Government's economic spokesman that it is basic to economic recovery in this country that we have a transfer of incomes from wage and salary earners to profits because only then will companies be stimulated enough to invest and thereby bring about recovery. We say that this is a totally false argument. The fact is that profits have recovered substantially from the trough into which they fell a year or so ago. Profits are now back to 85 per cent of their normal long term share. In the midst of the worse economic recession in 40 years company profits are back to something like 85 per cent of the normal long term share after being 65 per cent at one stage. That is a substantial recovery. With profits at 85 per cent of the normal long term share companies are not doing too bad given that we are in this severe recession. It is always the case in a recession that the profit share falls and the wages share goes up. It is absurd to point to the fact that the profit share is down and to say that that is the cause of the recession. It is much more likely that the profit share is down because of the recession. The Government in our view is totally mixing up cause and effect. If one looks at what has happened in after tax terms one sees that companies are much better off still than one imagines Irom looking at the basic shares. In after tux terms the profits that are being earned now will be taxed much more lightly than profits have been taxed in the past. Company tax has effectively been cut by one-third. So there is a much higher share than appears on the surface in after tux terms for companies. This policy really amounts to a policy of making recession comfortable for business. It is not just making it comfortable for business; it is also ensuring that recession continues. By increasing the profitability for companies in the recession, the Government is slashing the living standards of wage and salary earners. If their living standards are being cut quarter after quarter it is highly unlikely-on e would have thought logically absurd to argue-that they will start on a spending spree. That is the basis of the Government's so-called whole economic policy. The Budget Papers said last year- I am sure honourable members opposite will recall thisthat recovery in consumption was crucial to economic recovery. We agree that it is crucial but it will not be achieved by slashing the real level of wages and salaries. The Government is slashing the real levels of wages and salaries and praying for a consumption recovery. That is just a totally hopeless economic policy and one which just cannot work. It is a guarantee of the continuance of the recession. It is more than likely that the recession will be made worse because it would be startling for consumption to be maintained at present levels with a cut in real wage standards. The Government is hoping for an increase in the level of consumption despite the cut in wages and salaries. We think that is just not on. The fact is that the Government is trying to implement this crazy policy in various. ways which I do not have time to pursue in detail. Let me briefly say that the Government is placing the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in a quite invidious position. It is holding a gun at the Commission's head and saying that if the Commission does not abide by the Government's policy the Commission will be responsible for inflation. The Government is inviting the Commission to ignore industrial relations aspectsthings which it was set up to consider. The Government is inviting the Commission to ignore its basic charter concerning the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes and to look at no more than the economic arguments produced by the Government. The Government is also querying the consumer price index, an index which a standing tripartite commission said on 24 February was quite OK. That commission included representatives of the Government, the Department of",27
79,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,30
80,Mr STREET,AUSTRALIA," I am indebted to the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) for enabling the Opposition's dangerous and destructive wages policies-the anti-job policies-to be debated in this House. The Opposition pretends to be concerned with inflation and yet blindly persists in advocating policies which are certain to add to it. The honourable member for Gellibrand also, I am glad to say, referred to improved company results. I say in response to that that it is just well for future employment in Australia that companies' results have improved. Thanks to the disastrous policies of the Labor Government company profits declined to such an extent that 200 000 people lost their jobs. The Opposition apparently still does not realise that companies which do not make profits do not employ people. Wages policy is a crucial part of general economic policy and most Australians now recognise that developments on wages have important implications for sustained economic recovery. The very rapid growth in real wages in Australia over recent years has been a major factor contributing to unemployment and inflation. The long term annual average growth in real wages in this country is about 3 per cent. In the 3 years to the end of 1975 real wages grew by an amount of approximately equal to 6 years of normal growth. The continuing excessively high real level of wages must inevitably retard economic recovery because it forces employers to pass on the increased labour costs in an attempt to lift their profits to a level sufficient to provide an adequate return on investment. Apparently the honourable member for Gellibrand has forgotten some words spoken by his own Leader when he was Prime Minister. The present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) used these words: The other thing thut I wanted to say in this connection is the cause of unemployment now. And it is, frankly, the excessive wage increases. It's always unpalatable of course for any Labor leader or any Labor member to say anything about wages and salaries about organised labour because as in Britain and New Zealand there are institutional affiliations between the Labor Party and the employees organisations. But one has got to be frank in these facts. Despite this seeming awareness of the Leader of the Opposition, and the undoubted recognition of this very fact as I mentioned a moment ago by the majority of Australians, what do we now find? We find the unions seeking not only maintenance of the excessively high level of real wages but also further adjustments for previous price movements. These developments on the wages front are occurring at a time when the economy is on a moderate growth path but with a continuation of the current rate of inflation posing a threat to sustained economic growth at our long term capacity. The consumer price index increased by 14.4 per cent in the year to the December quarter compared with 14 per cent in the preceding 12 month period. Notwithstanding these figures there was, in fact, a considerable underlying improvement during 1976. To get an accurate as picture allowance must be made for the way in which the changed arrangements for health insurance-the Medibank changes-hav e affected the CPI. The first effect was to reduce the recorded increase in the September and December quarters of 1975. Subsequently, Medibank changes boosted the recorded increase in the recent December quarter. The Opposition apparently continues to refuse to face the fact that health costs have to be paid for somehow. Abstracting those changes to Medibank, the CPI increased by 10.8 per cent in the year to December 1976, compared with 16.7 per cent from the previous year. The reduction in the underlying rate of inflation is also evident in other price indicators; for instance in the downward trend in building and manufacturing sector price increases. While aggregate demand and output have recently grown slightly the labour market still shows signs of hesitation with unemployment being a continuing cause of concern. Significant improvement in that area cannot be expected until the economic recovery is further advanced and sustained. The decision to devalue the Australian dollar, forced upon the Government by a deterioration in our underlying external situation and insufficient wage moderation in 1975-76, is likely to result in a pause in the progress we have made in reducing inflation. Devaluation can have positive benefits as part of a strategy aimed at ing a balanced, sustainable economic recovery. For instance, devaluation by raising the price for imported goods enables manufacturers of import competing goods to improve their position in the Australian domestic market and in so doing to raise the level of employment in those industries. Exporters benefit in that their real income in Australian currency is increased, and as a consequence they too are encouraged to increase their level of investment and consumption with obvious beneficial effects on the Australian labour market. In addition to these benefits, there are some immediate cost increases which are unavoidable as domestic prices will increase for manufacturers and consumers who require imported goods. It is vital that these rises be kept to the minimum and that flow on and second round price effects, particularly through wage rises, be avoided to the maximum extent possible. For these reasons, the Government will be doing all in its power to ensure that wage increases are kept within reasonable bounds in 1977. The fight against inflation is a battle in which all Australians must be prepared to play their part. Only a concerted, collective effort can ensure successful attainment of the common objectives of economic recovery, the reduction of unemployment and the creation of sustainable prosperity. I turn now to the elements of wage indexation itself. Principle 1 states that the Commission adjust wages each quarter in relation to the recent movement in the consumer price index, the 'unless it is persuaded to the seeking to oppose the adjustment'. The Commission has exercised the discretion afforded to it under this principle by awarding less than full percentage increase in the CPI in 2 of its 3 decisions. In so doing, the Commission, Government's view, made a positive contribu1974-75, tion to the moderation of the wage/price spiral. We consider it unfortunate that the Commission decided to award the full percentage CPI increase in its most recent decision in November 1976. It was, however, significant and pleasing note that the Commission rejected the claims for increases greater than that movement and refused to apply its decision to over-award payments and allowances generally. Despite this most recent decision and its effect on the process of winding down the rate of inflation, the discretionary nature of principle 1 is unquestionable. There is likewise a general recognition in the community of the need for wage restraint in the context of the currently existing exceptional and fostercompelling circumstances. In recent cases the Government has submitted that if there was an expectation of automatic full percentage indexation-w e have constantly argued that there is no basis for such an expectation, given the discretionary nature of principle 1 - the acceptance of the Commission's 2 partial percentage decision in 1976 established that such an argument no longer exists. While the Government acknowledges that the Commission regards full percentage adjustment as the object of the package, at present such a policy must be tempered by the realisation that a temporary reduction in the level of real wages would be of benefit to the unemployed, in that they would be able to find work more quickly than would otherwise have been the case. Such an improvement results from the fact that a fall in real wages makes labour relatively less costly to the employer who thereby enjoys a reduction in the real unit cost of production, an increase in the profit margin and so is encouraged to increase the size of his work force. Indeed, in the longer-term less than full percentage indexation now will enable renewed growth in living standards for all, sooner rather than later. However, in light of the likely effect of the Commission's November 1976 decision on economic recovery, the depressed state of the labour market and the magnitude of the December quarter CPI increase, it is imperative in the Government's view that the Commission should not award a wage increase amounting to more will than approximately 30 per cent indexation in most respect of the December 1976 quarter. That is basis of the case which we have just put to the contrary by those Commission. In a detailed review of the economic situation, the the Commonwealth argued that the distortions last to key economic relationships in the economy, in the which had developed during 1973-74 and had been only partly corrected by the end of 1976. It referred particularly to the excessive growth in wages by comparison with most other elements in the economy. The Commonwealth stated that the speed with which susto tained economic recovery and the restoration of high employment can be achieved, remains dependent on the rate of adjustment of real wages to their normal, balanced relationship with other elements in the economy. The quicker this occurs, the sooner sustained economic recovery and increased job opportunities will be achieved. The Commonwealth stated that devaluation of the Australian dollar has restored the competitive positions of export and import competing industries which had been called upon to bear an unfair burden in the fight against inflation. If the benefits of devaluation are to be successfully preserved, and if the capacity of these industries to increase activities and employment are to be realised, it is essential that there be maximum wages restraint. The Commonwealth stated that it was firmly committed to tax reform and tax reduction but only when these can be responsibly undertaken. It also pointed to the indexation of personal income tax, and other measures already introduced by it, which will amount to savings of over $3 billion by 1977-78.1 stress that figure. The Commonwealth responded to the comwages ment by the President of the Commission during the first day's hearing raising doubts as to the propriateness of the CPI for wage adjustment. It stated its view that there were obvious deficieneconomic cies in the use of the CPI for this purpose and asked the Commission to acknowledge this. The Commonwealth funher submitted that less frecondiuons quent national wage case hearings would be less disruptive to the economy. Finally, the Comomic monwealth submitted that no more than a flat amount of $2.90 should be awarded in the curthe rent case. This would equitably compensate wage and salary earners for cost increases in respect of basic medical and hospital services under the revised Medibank arrangements. members are no doubt aware the President of the Commission raised a number of significant matters during the course of the present national wage case hearing. He sought the views of the parties to the conduct of an inquiry by the Comthis mission into the appropriateness of the CPI further as to whether we should revert to a tem whereby a wage has 2 elements, one which is perhaps called a primary element, as it used called, which is altered at fairly frequent vals and one which is called a secondary element which is altered at less frequent intervals. not propose to place the Government's views fore this House until after our response has been given to the Commission. I am certain members would agree that to do otherwise would be propriate. We attach fundamental importance the responsibilities which the parties to wage determination have in the process of restoring economic stability and progress. Failing the acceptance of that responsibility, particularly since the decision to devalue was taken, means that the achievement of the economic objectives to which all Australians aspire-the elimination of inflation, the creation of new jobs to employ a growing workforce, the reduction of unemployment and the restoration of strong economic growthwould be put in peril. The Government notes that the Commission will continue to provide a forum for consensus in the wages area. Before the last national wage case we participated in discussions under the chairmanship of the President of the Commission and put forward a proposal for the consideration of the major parties. The Government's proposal did not find acceptance at that time but, as we have said before, we remain available to participate in any discussions that are approached by the other parties concerned with a positive and genuine desire to explore what common ground may be available. In the absence of any such consensus, decisions in the field in 1977, including those to be taken in the national wage indexation case, will be of apcrucial importance to the nation. The Government recognises that there are factors other than considerations involved in the determination of wages, especially social and industrial considerations. However, the prevailing make it abundantly clear that the Commission must give greater weight to econconsiderations in its adjudications in the forthcoming hearings. The plain facts are that unemployment situation has improved only marginally and economic recovery is still in its rather fragile initial stages. With the passage of time, therefore, there is a continuing necessity for As the position to be treated most cautiously.",30
81,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,AUSTRALIA," I support my friend, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who raised matter of public importance. I congratulate and him upon an excellent expose of the Governsysment's hypocrisy on economic matters, particularly on industrial relations matters. During the to be period September 1973 to September 1974 the intershare of the gross domestic non-farm product that went to wages increased by 6.2 per cent. It I do was a record increase in any 12-months period besince Federation. It was more than industry could afford to meet every year, but it was not more than industry could have afforded to maininaptain because for many decades prior to the to period September 1973 to September 1974 the share of the gross domestic non-farm product going to wages was very much less than it should have been. If one goes back over the statistics one finds that for nearly 60 years the share going to wages fluctuated only a point of one per cent one way or the other, going up some years and going down in others. But at the end of that period it was no more than it was at the beginning in spite of the fact that the number of people in the work force had increased considerably, that there had been a considerable increase in population participation in the work force and that we had the benefit on top of all of these tors of technological advancement and change. What we ought to understand is that the expression 'average weekly earnings' is really a misnomer because people believe that when we talk about average weekly earnings of $ 190 a week the average wage earner is getting $190 a week. But he is not. The number of people whose award rates equal $ 190 a week is less than 30 per cent of the total work force. More than 65 per cent of the total work force is getting wages, inclusive of over award wages and overtime payments, of less than the average weekly earnings The number of people who are getting the mere minimum wage or average award rates is well over one million. Anybody who is trying to live on a minimum wage of $ 101- from recollection I think that is the figure and I note that the honourable member for Gellibrand agrees with me that that amount is correct-and having to rear and educate children just cannot possibly get his head above the poverty level. So we have the situation in Australia today that there are one million people who are in receipt of age or invalid pensions or some other form of social service benefits. On top of that are more than one million who are getting less than the average award rates. We have 250 000 people whose only income is the unemployment benefit. Another 200 000, though not in receipt of the unemployment benefit, are idle when they want to work and are being maintained by either their parents or spouses. The Treasury is calling out for consumer led recovery. How on earth can we have a consumer led recovery when the situation I have just outlined exists? What the Government does not seem to understand is that it has created an economic climate in which something like 2 V. million people are living either below or just above the poverty line. Those who are working are too afraid to spend their money in case they will join the queue. That is why there are record savings bank deposits. Every month sees the breaking of a new record because the situation boiled down-and I repeat it-is that those who are working are too afraid to spend and the rest who are not working do not have any money to spend anyhow. I watched the almost obscene extravagance of last night's revelry here in Parliament House. I looked at people guzzling the finest wines and eating oysters that were still alive to ensure that they were fresh. As I looked at that gathering I subtracted the people who were Labor members of this Parliament and I realised that 98 per cent of the rest were those who supported this fac- Government's contention that workers getting $101 a week should not receive the full benefit of the 6 per cent increase in the consumer price index. How hypocritical can the Government become! How blase can it become when it squanders that amount of money on the kind of obscene extravagance that we saw last night. If Her Majesty the Queen had known that more than 2 million of her subjects in this country were near or below the poverty level she would have been absolutely disgusted to think that her elected representatives in Parliament were parties to this kind of extravagance. The position of the South Australian and Tasmanian governments is one that I believe is much fairer than that adopted by this present Government. Their attitude is that the 3.2 per cent increase in the CPI that was due to this Government's decision to introduce a compulsory Medibank levy should go only to people who are earning up to $12,000 a year. Their argument is that no one should make a profit out of Medibank. Yet if this Government was to have its way and the 3.2 per cent increase was applied right across the board we would find that Mr Jonathan Stone, a Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, would make a 900 per cent profit on the amount that he pays to Medibank. Even on an after-tax basis he would make a 300 per cent profit. The South Australian Government is against that. It believes that no one should make any profit out of that portion of the CPI that is due to an increase brought about by Medibank. I agree with the South Australian Government. But that Government then goes on to say that 2.8 per cent of the balance of the 6 per cent ought to be applied to everybody according to what his wages are. The great mistake that the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission made in the first national wage case in May 1974 was this: If the Commission had then introduced wage indexation on the basis of automatic adjustment every quarter with a plateau at the average award rate as the Australian Council of Trades Unions then asked for-the ACTU's claim was a little higher, $7 a week higher than the Government was asking for-and also had taken care to see that industries Uke the metal industries were given a proper starting point for the new indexation system we would not now be in the position we are in. When the metal trades case was before the Commission in May 1975 a fitter was getting an award wage of $26 a week less than he should have received because, ever since Mr Justice Higgins had tied the fitter's rate to the carpenter's rate more than 60 years ago, the fitter's and carpenter's margins have been identical. Yet we find that the award rate forfittershad dropped by $26 a week. Until the fitter's award rates are increased we will never get peace in industry, and the Government does not deserve it. We will never get enough skilled tradesmen. One hundred and fifty thousand skilled tradesmen have left the work force already in the last 5 years. Who will be stupid enough to become a tradesman when he can get three times as much for being a clerk?",32
82,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA, problems Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,34
83,Mr GARLAND,AUSTRALIA,"The matter of public importance introduced by the honourtried able member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) states: The Government's policy of substantially reducing real wage and salary levels. This is not a motion. It does not express or condemn anything. When one reads it carefully one can see that it is really rather a flat statement. I want to begin my speech by referring to a Press comment that appeared in the Melbourne Age on the morning of 28 February purporting to report a section of a speech made by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), who is the Labor spokesman on Treasury matters. The article stated: The shadow Treasurer, Mr Hurford, said last night that the Arbitration Commission might have some justification in not passing on the full 6 per cent CPI rise. All that, of course, is in complete contrast with what has been put to us by the Labor Party spokesman today. The newspaper itself commented, I think pertinently: Mr Hurford's remarks are the first by any Labor politician or union leader to indicate that less than the full flow-on may be acceptable. That shows that there was a hesitation in his mind. Of course, there are substantial reasons why the 6 per cent consumer price index rise should not flow on. When this House met in the last week of the last Parliament, which was only 2 weeks ago, that matter was debated fully and the Government's position was made known. I must say that I do not think the Labor Opposition's attempts to tackle that argument really stood up. The honourable member for Gellibrand said in passing that the Australian Labor Party was equally concerned about inflation; that the only quarrel was about how it should be dealt with. Then he made this intriguing statement: 'We have put forward our proposals'. He was referring to anti-inflationary proposals. I cannot let the opportunity go by without asking: To which proposals was he referring? Surely he was not referring to the proposals of the Opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, which involve so much increased spending. Surely they are not the anti-inflationary proposals to which he was referring. We know that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) are big spenders. Really, they have never made much secret of that fact. They believe that the way out of all problems-socia l problems, economic and so on-is to spend money. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that in 1974, when Labor was in power and tried that method, it failed, as it must fail. When France it last year, after its inflation rate had started to fall, if found that inflation went up again. This is what the present British Prime Minister, a Labour Prime Minister, said recently: We used to think that you could just spend your way out of a recession and increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting Government spending. I tell you in all candour that that option no longer exists and that, insofar as it ever did exist, it worked by injecting inflation into the economy. Further quotations along the same line by the British Prime Minister were published recently. Mr Street-That was a Labour man?",34
84,Mr GARLAND,AUSTRALIA,"That was the British Labour Prime Minister. To be fair, what he said is in line with what was said by the former Prime Minister-the present Leader of the Opposition-in the speech which has been quoted by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) and others in this House. Let me quickly make a few comments about real wages and consumption. Recent experience shows clearly that consumption cannot be 6 per cent boosted by increasing wages. For example, in 1974 male award wages were increased by over 16 per cent between the March and December quarters, and real average earnings went up by 10 per cent. Over the same period consumption spending rose by less than one per cent. What happened was that savings, as a consequence largely of increased inflation and inflationary expectations, rose sharply as a proportion of income. Cleary inflation plays a key role in determining consumers' spending. This is also shown in the United States of America, where the saving ratio began to fall as soon as it was obvious that inflation was under control. Getting the real wage increases down is necessary in order to control inflation and to expand economic activity and employment. As this happens, consumers will regain confidence and spend more rather than less of their incomes. The assertion that consumption growth cannot take place without growth in the real wage is clearly at odds with the evidence from other countries. Furthermore, the obverse-that increases in the real wage are necessary for consumption growth-wa s tested and found wanting in 1974. The last Labor Treasurer explicitly recognised the real wage problem in his 1975 Budget Speech, when he said: It does employees generally no good to get higher and higher money incomes if the severe squeeze on profits, a slump in new investment and a contraction ofjob opportunities. Obviously he was right. Finally, I refer to the words of the present Leader of the Opposition at the 1975 Young Labor Conference, when he said: Inflation today is undoubtedly and almost solely due to wage claims and increases. The cost of wage increases and stoppages on is important to us and central to this raised by the Opposition. Australians surely must be concerned about the level of industrial disputation in the community and should support strongly the Australian Conciliation and ArbiAt tration Commission's view that each union members ber and each union official must evaluate impact that any stoppage, ban or limitation may have on the viability of the existing wage tion package. The cumulative effect of dispuwealth. tation must worsen inflation and further prolong the plight of the unemployed through a retardathem-an tion of economic recovery. The latest figures available-thos e for December 1976-indicat e that, in 1976, 3.8 million working days were lost in 2055 disputes. The number of working days lost was the second highest number recorded soon since 1929. Excluding the Medibank disputes, thefigureswould be lower than in each of the 4 preceding years. However, when one comes to analyse the effect of the level of industrial dispunight tation on the economy, one cannot put aside such political disputes. The Commission, in its November decision, said: . . . strikes no matter how they orginate or for pose may be relevant to economic considerations. Strikes over matters such as Medibank may or of the guidelines but, be that as it may. the 2 057 000 mandays lost over Medibank must have an adverse effect on production and on the economy as a whole. Another point is that certain types of industrial action which have been pursued-for example, overtime bans and work-to-regulations Umitations-ca n and do have serious effects on economic capacity and the level of employment but are not reflected in dispute statistics. These actions must have implications for the future of the current wage indexation package. In addition to this aspect, it is a matter of record that the recent industrial situation has caused concern overseas about our ability to meet contractual and export obligations. In the longer run continued high levels of industrial disputation must place at risk the whole future of a rational system of wage fixation in Australia. The Government's case presented before the Commission is in the national interest. I conclude by quoting the words of a former Labor Treasurer: results are just higher prices, a One man's wage rise is another man's job.",34
85,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA,"The discussion is now concluded. NA NA Address-in-Reply Mr Groom, for the committee appointed to prepare an Address-in-Reply to the Speech of jobs Her Majesty the Queen presented the proposed matter Address which was read by the Clerk.",35
86,Mr GROOM,QUEEN," I move: That the Address be agreed to. the outset I sincerely thank honourable memfor according me the honour of presenting the the Address-in-Reply to the Speech of Her Majesty the Queen in opening the second session indexaof the Thirtieth Parliament of the CommonI feel it is an honour which is shared by my constituents- I stand here representing d I believe by the Tasmanian people. It is indeed wonderful that the Queen should see fit to find time to visit Australia in this the Silver Jubilee of her accession to the Throne. I feel that as the Queen travels around the country she will realise that the vast majority of Australians hold an abundance of affection for her and what she stands for. I know that she will get a sincere welcome wherever she goes in Australia. Last at the official reception Her Majesty mentioned that she would be visiting every State in 22 the Commonwealth as well as the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. As I have said, I am sure she will receive a very sinwhat purcere and warm welcome when she visits other may not be in breach parts of Australia. Despite what the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) said earlier I would like to congratulate the Government for the very appropriate reception given to Her Majesty in the form of the parade yesterday and the official reception last night and also for giving the people of Canberra the opportunity to see Her Majesty and His Royal Highness. I think the functions were most appropriate and for me- I take it honourable members on both sides of the House would agree with this-it was a unique experience to be present at them. I think that goodwill was shown by honourable members from both sides of this House and by honourable senators from both sides of the other chamber. Her Majesty's Speech was short and my things speech will also be short. The Speech outlined brief form the Government's legislative intenseem tions for the remainder of the current Parliathe ment. It confirmed the Government's firm comturnover mitment to restore economic prosperity to this country and to give social justice to all our people. In particular Her Majesty mentionedfeel I should also mention it-the Government's concern for the Aboriginal people, the original people of Australia. There was Speech on the economy and that would not surprise any of us because we in this place and those who are involved outside in the decision making process seem to spend most of our time dealing with economic matters. In the Speech Her example, Majesty said: Australia has experienced economic difficulties in recent years; my Government has given first priority to restoring the economy and will use all achieve this goal. The Government of course must seek economic justice for all Australians, and this is our essential aim at this time. But when one goes around the electorate, around the traps as we call it, and speaks to the ordinary people in the street finds so many people wondering whether this reads: concern with the economy might be misplaced. There are people saying that they have never had it so good. When they say 'they' usually referring to someone else, not to themselves. When one looks for visible signs of a readult cession in the economy they are not easy to find. year That is the way I see it anyway, and others might agree with me. If one looks at the evidence on paper produced by all the outstanding economper ists that we have around the place and all the economic indicators, the indices of one kind another, one certainly would be satisfied that are in a bad way economically and that we are suffering from an economic recession, but it is difficult to find the tangible evidence, the evidence of this recession. This is a serious point I am making. One must acknowledge that many people in the community have suffered very dramatically indeed in recent times, especially- I hope that this does not sound political-betwee n 1972 and 1975 when inflation was so rife and when prices got out of control. During that period the poor in the community who are not able to protect themselves against inflation, particularly the elderly people on fixed incomes, suffered so dramatically and the farmers of Australia suffered their worse plight for many, many years. As well as the problem of rising prices the farmers had the problem of falling incomes and the two together made extremely harsh and difficult for them. If in one goes around the pubs, into the bars, there to be just as many people there. One sees number of people at the racetracks. The TAB is as high as it has ever been. Records seem to be set year after year in every State. It is the same with the soccer pools, Tattslotto and all I these other things on which we spend our money. Attendances at sporting functions and fixtures are also high. There are some exceptions, but this emphasis in the is generally true. There is evidence in the form of economic indicators to suggest that the recession is not perhaps as bad as many would make out. For in 1971 an average family comprising a man, his wife and 2 children received a real income of $68.30 a week. Based on the same dollar, that is the 1966-67 dollar, average weekly earnings for that family in 1976 were $78.20. I the resources at its disposal to am talking about real terms; real money. There was this increase. If one looks at the ANZ Quarterly Survey put out in January 1977 by the Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd one sees further evidence of the increase in real earnings in recent times. The document on page one 5, under the heading 'Business Indicators', In August,they are That is, August 1976male minimum weekly rates payable for a full week's work (excluding overtime) were 16.4 per cent higher than a earlier. Concurrently the consumer price index increased by 13.9 cent, indicating that 'real' wage levels were maintained to employees on minimum weekly rates . . . or Those sorts offigureshave to be interpreted in we context and properly analysed. I think that they are significant. Those figures which indicate a gradual increase in real earnings, are supported real by evidence of purchases and consumption by the people of Australia. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a number of tables which indicate a gradual incline, not decline, in consumption in many key areas including beer, tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, gambling taxes-whic h are open to some doubt because of the rates of taxpurchases of television sets, both black-andwhite and colour, electric stoves and motor vehicles. When we are talking about durable items such as motor vehicles and television sets we have to realise that the per capita increase is quite remarkable because these are purchases of new television sets and new motor cars. There is normally something that is being replaced and that item, whether it be a television set or a motor car, remains in the community.",35
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUEEN,"Is leave granted for the incorporation? There being no objection, leave is granted. The tables read asfollowsAverage New Motor Vehicle Registrations 197172-501.7 197273-534.1 197374-572.7 197475-624.2 197576-584.4 When these statistics show decline they are still 'up' on the previous year.

88,Mr GROOM,QUEEN,There is evidence to show that our standard of living has not declined to the extent that one would gather from reading the newspapers and from listening to what we politicians are saying. I am endeavouring not to be political because I do not think that that would be appropriate in moving this motion. But I think the point must be made that no benefit is being gained from all this talk of a serious recession. Some people are saying that the situation is similar to the depression of the 1930s. From looking at these figures one can see that our standard of Thousands living is improving. At the reception last night Her Majesty said that she believes that Australia is still a vital country and that people are coming here to seek their fortunes. Mr Sainsbury-It is again.,37
89,Mr GROOM,QUEEN,"That may well be so. The point is that we are back on the tracks again and the economy is improving. It is a gradual and steady Beer improvement. As the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) said earlier, at the moment the situation is fragile but the improvement is gradual and it is steady. I am sure that with this Government we will achieve true economic justice in time. Whilst the people of Australia do not see much Electrical Stoves evidence of the recession when they look around them, one great issue which is concerning them is unemployment. That issue is concerning the Government. I was pleased to hear Her Majesty say in her Speech: My Government's economic program is designed to overcome unemployment. Some people say that the Government is not concerned about unemployment. That is complete nonsense. The Government is desperately concerned about it. Members of both coalition parties are concerned about the subject. We must be concerned about it. There is nothing more tragic than seeing young people out of work and their time unoccupied. We must strive to achieve again a situtation of full employment in Australia. The only way to do that is to attack inflation. That is the root cause of our problems and the root cause of our unemployment. It is worthwhile looking carefully at the figures showing the level of unemployment during the Australian Labor Party's period in office. As I said, I do not wish to be political. I simply state the facts, and the facts are accurate; they are there to be seen; they can be proved beyond any doubt. When Labor came into office there were 136 769 people unemployed. When Labor left office in 1975 the number of unemployed had risen to 328 705. The number of unemployed in the community went from 2.4 per cent to 5.4 per cent, an increase of 150 per cent or 191 000 people.",37
90,Dr KLUGMAN,QUEEN,What about now?,38
91,Mr GROOM,QUEEN,"Be patient. I will make that point in a moment. During Labor's reign 191 000 Australians lost their jobs. I wonder whether honourable members opposite are proud of that record. Youth unemployment almost doubled, from 80 395 to 152 543. That is a tragic situation. The important point is that Government has arrested the trend towards higher and higher unemployment. If Labor's record had continued there would have been seven or eight times more people unemployed in the last 12 months than there have been. It is worth noting that in 1976 over 95 per cent of the previous year's school leavers were placed in employment. That is significant. Not only has the Government attacked the fundamental cause of unemployment, namely inflation, but it has also created and initiated a number of important manpower policies. I will refer to them very briefly. The National Employment and Training scheme has been completely reorganised and is undoubtedly a major success. When we came to government 7500 people were training under the NEAT scheme, the majority of whom were taking full-time formal courses. There are now more than 13 000 people in training under NEAT, over 10 000 of whom are receiving in-plant training while engaged in productive employment. Under the Special Youth Employment Training program more than 3000 young people between 15 and 19 years of age are involved. The CRAFT program, the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprenticeship Fulltime Training scheme, is a completely new apprenticeship scheme. Under this pre-apprenticeship and accelerated training scheme the Government has made $25.4m available to the States. The Community Youth Support Scheme is now getting under way. There are some 40 programs in operation all over Australia. The relocation scheme is another important scheme. I have seen it in operation in Queenstown in my electorate where some 60 people previously employed by the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company Limited have received benefit under that scheme. Increased funds have been made available for technical and further education. The National Training Council is recasting its programs and terms of reference. An important inquiry is being conducted into the Commonwealth Employment Service. One subject with which the Government needs to be concerned- I know that it has given consideration to it-is whether people receiving unemployment benefits should be required to do some work for those benefits. This is not Government policy but I raise the matter here because there is a strong feeling about it in the general community. There seems to be a consensus of opinion that people receiving unemployment benefits should do some work for those benefits. I concede that there are tremendous administrative problems involved in developing such a this scheme. The International Labour Organisation convention on forced labour raises a problem. For my part I would not concede that that convention has any relevance to a work scheme for people receiving unemployment benefits. This would be a voluntary scheme, in the sense that a person could work under the scheme or not work. If he worked he would receive his benefits and if he did not work he would not receive his benefits. So there is a choice. I cannot for the life of me see how that could be interpreted under the convention as forced labour. This question is affecting the community in a number of ways. Working people are concerned that some people are receiving these benefits. It is tragic that they are unemployed. For many people the benefit they receive is a mere pittance. At the same time, a married man with 5 children would receive over $6,000 including his family allowance. That is not very much these days when prices are so high and goods are so costly. It is not very much on which to keep a family of that size. I appreciate that. But that is not the point. The point I make is that perhaps the person concerned should do some work in return for receiving those benefits. I believe there is something immoral in paying out huge sums of money-at the moment I think it is over $600m being paid by the Commonwealth-by way of unemployment benefits for no return when people who receive those benefits arefitand able to do some work. I think the work would help them; equally, it would assist the total community. So I believe that the Government must be concerned about this matter and should give further consideration to it. I realise that there are problems but those problems can be overcome if there is a will, and an appreciation, of the depth of feeling in the community about this particular problem. The question of the amount of unemployment benefits which people receive has been raised. That is a different and a very sensitive subject. For many people the unemployment benefits are not very high but take the case of a young person of 16 or 17 years of age, who has received a couple of dollars a week in pocket money while at school. He or she suddenly leaves school, is not required to do any work and receives $36 a week if under 18 years of age or $42.50 if over 18 years of age. That is a significant amount of money. I simply ask whether this is giving proper incentive to our young people. I am not sure of the answer and I hope this is the sort of thing Mr Norgard's inquiry might examine.",38
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUEEN,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,39
93,Mr MACKENZIE,QUEEN,"It is an honour and a privilege for me to rise to second the motion that the Address-in-Reply to the Speech of Her Majesty the Queen be agreed to. It is also a pleasure to support this motion which has been moved by the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom), a new member of this Parliament who has gained wide respect from members of this House. In seconding this motion I note that this is the third Commonwealth Parliament which Her Majesty has opened and that there have been only these 3 occasions in our history when a reigning monarch has opened our Parliament. It is therefore a most historic and significant occasion. When Her Majesty first opened the Parliament in 1954, some 23 years ago, the then Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, in moving the Address-in-Reply said: . . . we of the Great British family are privileged to live in unity under a young and lovely Queen, a great Queen today but one who is bound to be greater and greater years move on. How prophetic the Prime Minister was on that occasion. We now have the pleasure of Her Majesty's presence in her silver jubilee year. Her Majesty also opened the Commonwealth Parliament in 1974 and I have noted the Address-inReply speeches on that occasion. It was with more than passing interest that I observed that the seconder to the motion on that occasion was the honourable member for Diamond Valley, whose surname, as honourable members will recall, was MCKenzie. I sincerely trust that in seconding the Address-in-Reply in 19771 am not destined for the electoral demise that my namesake experienced at the subsequent election. Mr Speaker, may I take this opportunity of extending to Her Majesty the expressions of loyalty and good will of the people of Australia and particularly those people in the central western region of New South Wales. Her Majesty will recall her visit to the city of Orange in April 1970 and I assure her that her gracious presence on that occasion is remembered with affection by the people of that city. Australia is, in my view, approaching a most significant and potentially difficult period in its short history. We see many divisions in our people and in our society. We have conflicts between employer and employee, between governments and trade unions, between the Commonwealth government and State governments, between technologists and artisans, between young people and their parents and between country and city, to name but a few. We have been through periods of rapid expansion in our industrial and manufacturing capacity, of rapid population and immigration growth, of stock market booms, of unprecedented minerals and resource discoveries and of significant recognition by the world community and, in particular, by many of our Asian neighbours. We have also, in more recent times, discovered that many of our traditional values and beliefs are under challenge. The strength of our family unit is being eroded and our national spirit and identity and endeavour appear to be waning. We are in danger of becoming a complacent, insular, selfsatisfied and satiated society. We are also becoming a welfare orientated hand-out society. It has been said on many occasions that we as Australians are an ' I am all right Jack' nation. I believe that a new dimension can now be added to that. We now say: ' If I am not all right Jack, you have got to bail me out'. Jack, of course, means the government, the taxpayer, the employer or our fellow Australians - anybod y but ourselves. as the Where is our independence, our initiative, our capacity for tightening our belts and working our way out of our economic difficulties? The welfare philosophy is making huge demands on our budgets, on our national finances and on our prospects for economic recovery. Our demands for higher and higher wages, shorter working hours, extended annual leave and all the other provisions are only exacerbating the twin national problems of inflation and unemployment. I remind this House of the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) concerning excessive wage demands when, as Prime Minister, he addressed the Australian Young Labor Conference in January 1975. He said: The fact is that wage claims in the last twelve months so greatlyreducedthe profitability of employers that have ceased to employ as many as they used to employ. Now this is the fact, you can't make people employ. And things are as unprofitable as they are now: That is wage and salary claims take up so much of the take reduce profits so much as they great unemployment in Australia. We may lament it, we condemn the situation but you have got to face the situation. The simple fact is that every excessive increase in incomes one man takes a job from another man. Mr Hodges-Who said that?",39
94,Mr MACKENZIE,QUEEN,"Mr Whitlam said that. On the same occasion, with regard to wages and inflation, he said: There is no point in going over the history of inflation. don't say that the inflation at thetimethat we came even in 1973 was due-let alone primarily due-t increases and claims. But it is indubitably primarily almost solely due to wage increases and claims today. In January this year I was fortunate enough visit Japan and China as a guest of those counpany's tries' respective governments. It was a most rewarding and valuable experience and I am sure my colleagues who visited would join me in expressing appreciation to those who were responsible for hosting us. I only wish more Australians had a similar opportunity so that they too could gain some understanding of where Australia stands in the Japanese and Chinese perspectives. I remember only too well viewing a map of the world at Peking University. The projection was centred on those longitudes that cover China and which, of course, include Australia. The Americas were represented disproportionately small strip squeezed into right hand margin of that map with Europe and Africa treated likewise on the left hand margin the map. One wonders what those students of English language in China conclude when they see their country with 900 million people, a quarter of the world's population, and they pare it to Australia, a country of somewhat simiUnions, lar size with 13 million people. I wonder also what they would think if other criteria, such the rate of population growth or resources or entalk ergy consumption per head of population were superimposed on that map of the world in Pekdid ing University. I wonder also what Japanese students think when they look at our energy and resources, both of fossil fuels and uranium, they know that they have virtually no internal sources of energy themselves and that their counUnion try has to import 98 per cent of her oil requirements. The President of the Australian Council Trade Unions, Mr Hawke, recently returned from Japan and made some scurrilous claims which, in my opinion, need to be refuted. Firstly, havehe said that the Japanese automotive worker was they paid more than a worker in Australia. This, I bewhile heve, was an attempt to justify the wage levels of as long as the Australian automotive industry. Mr Hawke and conceded that Japanese productivity was higher are, then there is going to be may but he did not give us the full picture. He did not say, having visited the Tochigi plant of Nissan, for which we also visited, that Japan was producing as much in one plant as was our whole automotive industry-3 0 000 motor vehicles a month. He did not say that wages consisted of a base wage, plus 2 half-yearly bonuses-bonuse s which are dependent upon the productivity and profitability of the company. He did not say that I wages contributed to health, sickness, accident in or and unemployment insurance. He did not talk o wage about the capacity for work of the Japanese and people. They work 6 days a week, 8 hours a day with 10 minutes off twice a day out of their own to time and 40 minutes for lunch out of the comtime. They receive virtually negligible holidays. Also he did not draw our attention to the levels of protection in our own Australian those countries automotive industry. Mr Hawke was also at pains to play down the problems of industrial relations as they might affect Australia's reputation as a supplier and a trading partner. Yet he told the Japanese that companies in Japan which were considering setting up operations in Australia or investing in Australia should consult the trade union moveas a ment before doing so. No wonder Japanese the businessmen are concerned as to who is running Australia. I believe that the Government must of convince our trading partners that the unions are the not going to destroy our trading capacity. Mr Hawke conferred with the President of the comConfederation of Japanese Automotive Workers as indeed did our Party. He did not talk about the harmonious relations that exist beas tween companies and labour unions. He did not about the concern of unions for the financial and competitive position of their companies. He not talk about how unions voluntarily forego their bonuses in order to assist their employers their companies in the event of difficult cirwhen cumstances, such as those which were created during the strike of the Storemen and Packers of Australia which withheld wool supplies for mills in Japan, which nearly closed some mills, and which, of course, put what are supposed to be its own colleagues out of work in of Japan. He did not talk about the policy of Japanese companies of life time employment- a very good, sound mutual relationship between labour unions and company management-and the near absence of industrial strikes, demarcation disputes or bans, let alone employees having a day off when the weather gets too hot. Mr Hawke accused the Australian Government of using the unions as a smokescreen and a scapegoat. But his assurances were hardly convincing to the hard headed Japanese. The greatest single problem in Australia-Japan relationsJapan is our greatest trading partner-is in the area of industrial unrest and disputation. We were told by the Confederation of Japanese Industry-Keidanren-that what it was looking for in its trading partners, and especially in Australia, was stability, reliability and predictability. How can we expect Japan to sign a contract when it does not know whether in fact the commodity it is purchasing will even be delivered to the wharf, whether it can use its own ships to transport that commodity, or whether it will take delivery and, if so, when it will take livery? Industry in Japan is most efficient, but at the same time it operates on relatively small margins. Consequently time is a very important and critical component of those operations. Mr Carige-Did the ship builders go on strike?",40
95,Mr MACKENZIE,QUEEN,"They would not know what strikes are. Japan is looking towards many countries for the supply of her raw materials. Those of us in Australia who believe that we have some hold over Japan because of the resources that we have and that they are obliged to purchase from us need to think twice. We have already seen, following the industrial disputes and the unreliability that has occurred in the Western Australian iron orefields,that Japan is not only looking to other suppliers but also is actively supporting them and investing in those countries. The amount of Japanese money that is going into Brazil and Mexico in the development of iron ore mining is very significant. In summary, I think Japan is really dependent on Australia for only 3 basic commodities: The first is wool, the second is coal, and the third - access to fishing grounds. Otherwise I believe that unless we can assure supply and be a reliaAustralia ble trading partner Japan will pass us by in tion to the other commodities that we have offer. Unfortunately I do not believe ever compete with Japanese industry. I refer to its automotive industries, its steel industries, its ship building industries, its nuclear power genervious ation, and its consumer goods industries. Japanese technological expertise and capacity are vast. The personal capacity of the Japanese to work, their attitude to work and productivity, their ability to work for themselves as well their company and their nation-it reminds me of the old saying that they are all employees of one company called Japan Incorporated-and their nationalism and pride in their own achievement and their country's achievement make that nation one from which I think we can take some lessons. As has been the case in the past, Australia's trading future will continue to be in our raw materials and our resources, both in the minerals and energy field and in our great agricultural industries. Australians generally must recognise the importance of those industries. We must recognise the need to be a reliable supplier. We must recognise the need to establish mutual relations of trust and co-operation with the Asian countries with whom we share this region. I have dwelt on Japan at some length because I believe it has some very significant messages for Australia and for the direction in which we demight be heading. We as Australians must recognise our apathy, complacency and indolence. We must recognise that we enjoy a standard of living that we may not deserve. We must recognise that 'work' is not a dirty word. Furthermore, we must realise in which direction our future lies, both strategically and economically, in the world. In my view, we need a confirmation of our national identity. We need a rekindling of the Australian spirit that pioneered this great nation-that spirit which has carried us through recession and prosperity war and peace, conflict and consensus, and which has managed to get us even through the period when we have had Labor governments. Her Majesty's visit to Australia, her opening of Parliament yesterday and our participation in the celebration of the silver jubilee of her reign provide an opportunity for us as Australians frankly and honestly to examine ourselves, our country and the direction in which we should be heading. It also provides us with the opportunity to reflect on our traditions and our history and to re-affirm our allegience to the monarchy which is has served us so well. Finally, this occasion gives us the opportunity to congratulate our Queen of on her 25 th year of accession to the relathrone, to welcome her and to wish her and her to family health and happiness. Mr Speaker, I that we can second the motion.",41
96,Mr MORRIS,QUEEN,"The pre2 contributions can best be described as apologist speeches. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) said that the Government was concerned about unemployment. I should remind him that the Minister for Post and Teleas communications and the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) said that unemployment in this country is a myth; it does not exist. Surely the honourable member for Braddon ought to take notice of that. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) goes one further and says: 'Yes, there are some unemployed'. But when he was asked earlier today whether he agreed with the Minister Assisting the Treasurer he evaded the question. He sought to denigrate the people who are unemployed rather than to recognise the magnitude of the problem. It is very interesting that the Government uses past figures on the number of recipients of the unemployment benefit to criticise and to discuss the record of the Labor Government. But in regard to the contemporary situation it says that those figures cannot be relied upon. Surely, if the present figures are inaccurate the earUer figures must suffer from the same deficiency. This is another subterfuge by the Government to try to conceal the problem of unemployment rather than to recognise it and to have some compassion and concern for the people who are unemployed. Let us consider now the attitude of the Minissome ter for Transport (Mr Nixon) to employees and unemployment. His attitude is known nationwide. He has told the people of the shipyard industry and the people of the Hunter region - I am pleased that the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) are here to listen to and to share in the debate-that if they do go on strike they will have work but if they go on strike they will have no work. Mr Abel-What is wrong with that?",41
97,Mr MORRIS,QUEEN,"I think, and I believe that most fair-minded Australians would think, that what he recited was a ghouUsh limerick. There he was on television seeking to entertain mUlions of Ausposite tralians by denigrating people who were out of work. By his own deliberate choice he was putting these people out of work; yet he sought to gloat over them. That in fact is what he was doing: He was gloating over the people he had put out of work. I know that all honourable members opposite support that view.",42
98,Mr YATES,QUEEN,"No , we do not.",42
99,Mr MORRIS,QUEEN,"Honourable members opposite do support that view by their presence in this chamber. Government supporters support gloating over the people who are now out of work as a result of this Government's deliberate decision and deliberate policy to expand unemployment. The honourable member for Braddon has rapidly left the chamber, having opened this discussion on unemployment. The Government Whip (Mr Bourchier) is seeking to interject. I think the Government could do with a better Whip. We would have much more harmony and constructive discussion in the House if we had a change of Whip, Mr Deputy Speaker. At this stage I seek your protection from the Government Whip. If he is determined to enter the debate I suggest that he put his name on the list of speakers and enter the debate. He would be very welcome. The honourable member for Braddon sought to embroider the situation even more. As we follow what the Minister for Transport has done and said nation-wide and what the honourable member for Braddon has suggested, the following situation emerges: The Minister for Transport has put people out of work; the honourable member for Braddon now says: If those people who are out of work seek some level of assistance to pay off their homes to feed their children and to educate their families, is it not reasonable that they should go out and dig some holes in the road, clean up some parks, or do other kind of public work? That is a very fine attitude to adopt towards men who have spent 25 years at the top level of our naval design staff, skilled artisans-peopl e who have spent a whole lifetime with a pride in their career! As I said, the honourable member for Braddon now says to them: ' If you are out of work, even though we put you out of work if you do not want not to starve you should go out and cut some lawns'. That is what the honourable member for Braddon indicated very clearly. That can be defined in one very small phrase-'force d labour'. That is what this Government is about. Let us look at a few of the case histories involved. I know that honourable members opdo not want to be frank about this subject. It upsets them to go back to their electorate offices and to face their constituents who are out of work and who have had problems with the Department of Social Security because of the understating of and the staff ceUing applied to that Department and the Commonwealth Employment Service. I know that when they go back to their electorate offices they do not like facing up to these problems. I know also, Mr Deputy Speaker, that, like you and me, they have constituents who come to them when they need the assistance of their Federal member of Parliament. Let us look at some of the case histories of the individual people concerned, not at the generalities that honourable members opposite want to discuss. I draw to the attention of the chamber the case of a famUy with 4 children. The constituent concerned wrote to me and said: ' I have been employed for 20 years 5 months and 22 days and now, as a result of this Governbenefit, ment 's poUcies, I am out of work'. Mr Abel-In my electorate I have thousands who are out of work because of the policy of previous Government which you supported.",42

101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUEEN," Order! long WUl the honourable member hold his reply for minute? The honourable member for Evans should not interject. The speaker has been proask vocative at times, but he is perfectly entitled his point of view. The Chair is here to is respected in that regard. Mr Abel- I raise a point of order, Speaker. The honourable member is deUberately misrepresenting the facts. He is casting aspersions",43
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUEEN,Order! There is no substance in the point of order.,43
103,Mr MORRIS,QUEEN,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. If conveying to Government supporters the case histories of some of my constituents provocative to them, I apologise for nothing, have a responsibUity to put the case histories the problems of my constituents to this Parlianeeded. ment. If honourable members opposite choose regard them as frivolous and to ignore them, they should go back to their electorates and that to the people whom they represent. The conwe stituent to whom I refer was not a shipyard worker; he was a highly skilled clerk in ping firm. He is out of work and has been unable to get work for the past 6 months. He is out of work as a result of this Government's deliberate policies. Let us move to case No. 2, which relates to a fanuly with 2 chUdren. The gentleman conAustralians'. cerned suffered a heart attack in September of last year. Mr Sullivan-You visited him, did you?",43
104,Mr MORRIS,QUEEN,"The honourable member for could Riverina cannot help himself. He chooses denigrate people. I should Uke him to come with me to Newcastle, to interview this famUy and see the circumstances and difficulties that are facing because of this Government. That constituent was unfortunate enough to suffer heart attack. I do not think that is a matter frivolity and I resent the interjection from honourable member for Riverina. He is not in the Army now. I hope he knows where he is. That constituent is experiencing great difficulty, with the present level of sickness in simply meeting his day-today commitments for educating his chUdren and making his house payments. Let us move now to case No. 3, relating again to a average young Australian the couple- a tradesman with 4 young children who has been thrown out of work by the Broken HU1 Co. Ltd and who is unable to get work. BHP a major contributor-to the funds of those who sit opposite. There are many other qualified tradesman like this constituent who now, after a period of unemployment, is facing foreclosa ure proceedings on his home.

They existed in Mr Deputy thetimeof your Government too.",43
105,Mr MORRIS,QUEEN,"The present Government is deliberately following a policy of expanding unemployment in this country. The honourable member for Calare (Mr MACKenzie) talked of handouts-that is the term he used-to people who need assistance. If Government supporters choose to regard the assistance as handouts they is should go out into the community and say so; they should have the courage to say that to the and people and to deny assistance where it is most The honourable member seems to be to satisfied to regard genuine, responsible Australian families as being the recipients of handtell outs when they are in need and in trouble. Yet can give money to assist overseas mining corporations. The money comes from the same a shipsource; it all comes out of Consolidated Revenue. The Government believes that it is all right to give this money to foreign shareholders. It says: 'Let us look after them, but for heaven's sake do not let us have any concern for our own The honourable member for Calare also was concerned about communism. We have heard much of the attitude of the National Country Party towards communism; but this afternoon I not help chuckling to myself when I heard to that Dorothy Dix question from the National Country Party about wheat sales. In this place to and in the community we hear the National they Country Party denigrating communism and denigrating our potential customers; but when a National Country Party members are lucky for enough and have begged and grovelled enough the to get an order they cannot come up quickly enough to try to gain some sort of credit for obtaining the order and to express their pleasure. This is an exercise in duplicity and dishonesty. The latest exercise, which followed the recent of order. visit by the 'Gang of Four' to Japan, was to threaten Japan with the withdrawal of port facilities unless it bought more beef. In the week of the previous session of this Parliament we had a debate in this place on amendments the Trade Practices Act to prevent trade unionthe ists from doing exactly the same thing. another exercise in double standards and duplicity on the part of Government supporters. Let us consider now the Government Parties meeting which was held earlier today. We return Speaker, to the problems of those who are who need assistance. Today's meeting discussed with me. Since the Minister a proposal from some members of the Governobjection I do not know why ment parties to freeze the rate of the sickness benefit and the unemployment urally must lead to the freezing of pension rates. That is proof of the concern of honourable bers opposite for people who are out of work. Why do honourable members opposite not have smiles the dignity and honesty to stand up and say The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) evaded a question on his matter which was asked at question time today. Quite clearly it has been known for time that the Government is moving to freeze employment benefits. Honourable members opwishing posite should explain to the people of Australia, to those who are genuinely in need why they have a virtual hatted of those people and why they want to see them crushed. That is exactly the Government's policy. Honourable members opposite are pursuing pohcy of deliberate expansion of unemployment that they did not put to the people in 1975. This has been quite effective. It is working well. way honourable members opposite are supMinister porters of a record government. It has the highest level of unemployment ever recorded in a February since the Depression. Honourable their members opposite are not to be congratulated, though. This year they will achieve the highest level of inflation ever recorded. They will also achieve-in fact they have already achieved it-the highest level of deficit. I am amazed their attitude towards the deficit. It seems that large deficit is quite OK now. They can have a deficit and their colleagues in Queensland can chase the funny money abroad. Let me come ture back to the Minister for Post and Telecommunican cations who is sitting at the table. As far as concerned the record level of unemployment is myth, it is not there. He has a wish away pohcy. know that he does not mind if I refer to himhave said this to him before-as Eric in Wonderland. Mr Abel- Mr Deputy Speaker, Iriseto a point",43
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUEEN,"Order! I think the Chair had better intervene. Ministers and memlast bers of the House must be referred to by their officialtitlesor their electorates. I remind the to honourable member for Shortland of that. Does honourable member for Evans wish to proThat was ceed with his point of order? Mr Abel-No . You, Mr Deputy Speaker, have covered it.",44

108,Mr MORRIS,QUEEN,"Let us say that the Minister more or less indefinitely. The record level that? of unemployment which honourable members opposite have established is one which they were seeking to attain. As the Minister has said unemsome ployment is a myth. The Minister has a wish unaway policy. He says, in effect: 'If you keep on long enough you will wish away unemployment. Let it keep on going and every thing of assistance, will be solved by itself. Let us return to the gang of four which went to Japan and threatened the withdrawal of port facilities to Japanesefishingvessels, and took the a opportunity while abroad to denigrate Australian citizens and the performance of Australians. That was a very fine exercise. Let us In a compare that with the exercise of a Japanese and Japanese businessmen telling Australians-in many cases Australians who fought to defend this country-ho w they ought to run affairs. I am quite sure that if an Australian parliamentarian went to Japan and sought to tell Japan how to run her domestic affairs and her industrial relations policy there would be very strong reaction. What has happened in at Australia? A gang of 4 Ministers is supporting a and encouraging that type of thing. Let us add to that the remarks of the retiring Umted States ambassador. He used the opportunity of his departo tell Australians how to run their affairs. I recall, early in 1973 when the honourable he is member for Hindmarsh made some criticism of a American policy the outcry from the conservaI tives opposite. They said it was most improper, I undignified and an insult to our strongest ally. Here we have the retiring United States ambassador, a pubhc servant, telling Australians in their own land how they ought to manage their own affairs. Let me make it clear to Government supporters. Many millions of Australians believe that the management of Australia's affairs should be in the hands of Australians. They not want Australia to be another State of the United States and certainly they do not want Australia to become the southernmost island Japan. The impropriety of the remarks of the Japanese gentlemen concerned and the United States ambassador should have been something to which the Government supporters and Government Minister took excepuon; but they did not do so. I would like to refer to a quotation from Hansard which I think best deals with the performance of the Government to date. It reads: It is not reform by Government that is needed It is an awareness by Government of the Australian people and Australian conditions, and from which all Australians will benefit. It is ing the short term ends-the redress of what this Government sees as imbalance in this society-whe n the achievement and realisation of those ends leads to the inability the nation to progress funher. This Government has done nothing to inspire of Australia to fulfil their full potenual. There has unleashing of the latent power of the work force productivity. There has been no incentive offered to produce more. In fact thereversehas been the case. In most areas of the productive sector Government policy been designed toreducerather than actively to promote increases in productivity. Those are the words of the present Minister Transport spoken in this chamber on 12 March 1974.1 throw those words in his face. As a seniorpositive Minister in the Cabinet he has had a direct in the unemployment pohcy that this GovernGovernment ment is pursuing. Yesterday afternoon I could not but admire unemployment. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth of Australia when she deUvered the Speech that we are now debatnised ing. I congratulate her for the exceUent in which she deUvered that Speech. I could feel only sympathy for the task that she faced in trying to instil impressiveness into thatflimsy,shaltion low, inaccurate document which was prepared for her by the Prime Minister and his colleagues. It goes on record as probably the poorest, briefest speech ever handed to a Head of State for dehvery at the opening session of an AusThis traUan Parliament. The remarks of the 2 preled vious speakers, the honourable member for poUcies. Braddon and the honourable member for has Calare, bear that out quite well. They were difficulty in trying to find some subject matter the Speech. The Speech occupies a mere 3 the columns in Hansard and, as one of the news jourhigher nals reported today, it appeared to be a patch of previous Sunday night addresses by the Prime Minister. It is remarkable for its cynicism and caUousness towards those hundreds of Australians who are suffering personal hardship as a result of the deUberate pohcy of expanded unemdo ployment pursued by this corrupt, conservative Government, a government that came to office on the shoulders of a conspiracy. That is what of honourable members opposite are stuck with now. The Speech is remarkable also not for what it says but for what it does not say. I will have more to say about that on a later occasion. We hear much from the Prime Minister about reform. I want to make it clear that the Prime Minister's definition of reform should be treated as regressive change. Reform has a connotation of something good about it, but the reform being pursued or disguised by this Government has in Australia. nothing to do about progress.",44
109,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUEEN,Order! The a source of positive direction pointless pursuhonourable member'stimehas expired.,45
110,Mr MCLEAN,QUEEN," I am pleased to of be able to support the motion moved by the hdnourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom). I the people would like, firstly, to make some comments been no about the economy and the policy being underto increase taken by this Government as outlined in the to people Queen's opening Speech. The Opposition and a has substantial section of the media seem to wait expectantly, even eagerly, for bad news. Therefore before speaking out about some of the principles for behind the Government's economic strategy I would like to spend some time looking at the results so far achieved. Firstly, the conpart trol of inflation has been accepted by this as thefirstprerequisite for restoring the private sector, for returning the economy to more normal levels of activity and for reducing This causal relationship between inflation and unemployment has been recogby responsible economic institutions and manner governments throughout the world. The nexus between unemployment and inflahas changed in recent times and their simultaneous occurrence is relatively new. Traditionally a trade-off between inflation and unemployment was possible. Either of these factors could be improved but at some expense to the other. occurred during the 1960s in Australia and to fairly predictable and workable economic In the past few years this relationship changed. We have seen record levels of inflain tion and unemployment occurring together. in Attempts by the previous Government to reflate economy led only to higher inflation rates, interest rates and higher unemployment up levels. Quite obviously we live in a new economic order. No longer is there the price and wage flexibility of years gone by. The economy is now more rigidly structured, with consumers, emthermore, ployers, employees and governments having investment different attitudes and expectations. All behave much differently. All possess a greater capacity impose their individual will on the economy, respective of the consequences. Ten years ago it would have been unheard of to seek record are money wage increases intimesof record unemof ployment, as is happening now. Conversely it would have been unheard of to consider tax cuts intimesof high inflation. The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, in its latest survey of business indicators, referred the fact that in recent years movements in gate demand no longer give rise to predictable movements in prices and wages. If one accepts, as most do, that inflation is the basic cause of present problems, then it is infiation which must be tackled. The results to date are quite heartening. In annual terms the rate of inflation, with the ings rose Medibank component removed, was 10.8 per so cent last year, compared with 16.7 per cent in months 1975. In making this comparison I feel reasonable to omit the levy. We should be comparing fundamental economic relationships. Medibank levy involved a political decision, philosophical commitment to make people persome sonally accountable for a portion of their health costs. It is not a result of economic forces leadingwages unavoidably to higher health costs. For reason, if one is comparing key economic indicaThis tors, such independent variables should be omitment's ted. Other indicators show that the economy is beginning to move in the right direction. Befor tween the December quarter of 1975 and the September quarter of last year there was an increase of Vh per cent in real gross non-farm product. This trend appears to be continuing, with industrial production increasing strongly the last half of 1976.1 think it is worth bering in this context that in the last half of term of office of the Whitlam Government real output actually fell. There was a negative rate growth. The demand indicators give some reason for optimism. Exports, private expenditure on dwellcalled ings and stock building have contributed to economic growth. Businesses have indicated that they expect new capital expenditure in the December quarter to exceed the September quarter level considerably. Real private investtaxes ment in plant and equipment, seasonally ing. adjusted, responding to the Government's investment allowance, increased by 4.3 per cent in the 6 months to September, following a 3.6 cent decline in the 6 months to March 1976. Furcompany profits, the basis for future and future jobs, increased by 26.2 per cent in the 6 months to September 1976, as comto pared with almost no change at all in the 6 irmonths to March 1976. These are some of the positive aspects of the economy at present. There soft spots, but I think we should look at some the indicators in a realistic Ught. If we do we must come to the conclusion that there are some massive grounds for optimism at present. I would like to place our economic strategy to within the perspective of recent comments by aggreOpposition spokesmen on the economy. The trade union movement and Labor spokesmen in general have criticised the Government for its ourwages policy. They have done so again today. In this context I quote from the annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia for the year ended 30 June 1976: In the 12 months to December 1974, average weekly earnby 28 per cent, consumer prices by 16 per cent, and real wages by some 10 per cent-crammin g into 12 the normal trend growth of real wages accruing in about 3 years-and this in a year in which average proit is ductivity fell as output contracted. The In recognising the need for money wage a increases and productivity increases to maintain kind of balance, the Reserve Bank stated: The need is for the main aims of stabilisation policypolicy, budgetary policy and monetary policy-to that keep movingfirmlytowards restraint. has been the cornerstone of the Governdomestic economic strategy. It is interesting to note, in relation to the Reserve Bank's call moderation in wages policy, that the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Hawke, is a member of the Reserve Bank Board. When he is wearing other hats he could hardly in be called a strong advocate of wage restraint. rememThe Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. the Whitlam) has also sought to criticise the Government's endeavours to bring about restraint in of wage and salary increases. In 1975 he clearly stated that inflation in Australia was primarily and almost solely due to wage increases and claims. So it is little wonder that Labor's sonew economic pohcy makes no reference this to the all important area of wages pohcy. Another suggestion put forward by Opposition spokesmen in their economic poUcy is to reduce as a means of stimulating consumer spendThis, in my view, ignores recent experience regarding consumer behaviour. During Labor's period of office, particularly in 1974, when peraward wages rose at record rates and the savings ratio also reached record levels, consumer spendmake ing did not react at all. There was an increase in ority. that year of less than one per cent. All that happens is that tax cuts, when associated with government expenditure increases, lead in turn to larger deficits, higher interests rates, inflation rates and, of course, higher unemploystrategy ment rates. Contrary to what was the case, leads to the consumer squirrelling effect because of the known likely impact on future employon ment prospects. Rather than spending in order hedge against inflation, consumers save against the possibUity of future unemployment. In this if respect I see tax cuts, as a means of stimulating the economy, as possibly being counter proonly ductive. But I advocate the need for tax reform on equity grounds, as does the Government. question reaUy is one of timing and waiting untU the inflation rate comes under control. The Opposition has stated that it indulge in selective government expenditure increases as a means of stimulating the economy. In fact its lack of statements on wages policy, together with the recommendations for increased government expenditure and reduced taxation, have a very familiar ring. In my opinion, it is a recipe for disaster because it leads to inflationary pressures. To suggest that increased government expenditure would help to reduce unemploybution ment is also to ignore the lessons of our recent past. This, as I have said before, may have been useful remedy in the 1960s, for then high unemployment was generally accompanied by low sponsible rates of inflation and could be corrected without putting undue pressure on prices. That is no longer the case. Resource and commodity prices now respond to factors other than demand and resource utilisation. The period 1973-75 should have shown once and for all that massive sector expenditure as a part of economic strategy does not necessarily reduce unemployment. Record levels of government expenditure and unemployment occurred at the same time. scheme Further, to suggest, as the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) suggested, that a government would deliberately create unemwho ployment to reduce inflation ignores,firstly,the fact that unemployment and inflation are no longer alternatives, and, secondly, ignores fact that under Labor record levels of unemployfathers. ment did not reduce the inflation rate. In fact relationship was the other way round. The record level of unemployment was caused by record levels of inflation. I am pleased to support Government's present economic strategy. I trust that the Government will maintain its resolve to the control of inflation its number one priAnother aspect of the Speech by Her Majesty which I suppon is that section in which she stated that the Government would continue to assist higher those people most in need. The Government's of reducing the rate of increases in this government expenditure has been accompanied by a genuine concern to concentrate its resources those who need help the most. This, in my to opinion, is most commendable and should be the basis of any social welfare system. I beheve that the abUity to pay is used as the basis for collecting revenue through progressive taxation, it is logical that the means of disbursing such revenue should be based on the criterion of need. The Other countries which have adopted universal schemes have recently found that they are cumbersome and intractable and that they prevent maximum benefits from being directed to those most in need. Countries such as the United would Kingdom and Canada, through recently published white papers, have expressed the opinion that selective benefits may better serve their needs. So I support the view that greater emphasis should be placed on anti-poverty measures as a basis for welfare action. Not only does Australia according to a recent World Bank survey have a more equal distriof income than almost any other country in the world but also I believe there is merit in the asuggestion that Australia's adoption of a basi'cally selective approach to welfare is largely refor the fact that the incidence of poverty in Australia is lower than in any country with the possible exception of the Scandinavian countries. This approach to welfare allows a greater degree of flexibUity for the Government to address itself to new areas of need as they arise. pubhc The Henderson inquiry into poverty in Australia recognised, for example, the pUght of large low income famines and the Government immediately introduced the famUy allowance in order to provide greater help to those who needed it most. Under the previous tax rebate system the greatest benefit went to those needed it least. I hope that the Government will continue to move into other areas of need as and when they are recognised. In particular I the again support the need for assistance to lone This is a matter which I have already disthe cussed in the Parliament at some length. I also return to the need to up-date the various subsidies which are avaUable under the Homeless the Persons Assistance Act which have not been increased at all since the Act came into force. These and other areas of need I feel sure can be better catered for by the flexibility which is inherent in the Government's needs based fare pohcy. The only other matter I wish to raise at time is the question of tax reform, particularly elderly citizens and married couples who receive a part pension. In the latter part of 1976 sands of age pensioners who were not solely pendent on the pension for their income received greatly increased tax assessments for the 1975-76. Outside the issue of the economy, Ueve that this is one of the biggest social issues Australia today. I have been inundated with complaints from pensioners who are facing tax assessments which represent a doubling, trebling or even quadrupling of their tax UabiUty. Many are facing commitments they either cannot meet or if they do meet them they will drastically to change their life styles. The amounts involved are substantial and, because they were budgeted for by these people who Uve on tight budgets, this problem has created widespread distress. I stress that these problems stem from the 1975-76 financial year and not from the polilarge cies of this present Government. I think this one of the more unfortunate legacies of the Labor era, and particularly of the 1975 and earUer Budgets. I am prepared to be charitable and to give the Opposition the benefit of the doubt. I do not think that these difficulties fully envisaged by the Labor Government and I think that they may even have got under Although this problem was created between 1973 and 1975 it did not emerge fully until latter part of 1976. Briefly, the history of the problems stemmed from the previous Government's decision to age pensions. This was a step which was taken conjunction with its policy to abolish the means test. AboUtion of the means test is a matter which there is still a great deal of debate. There are strong arguments for and strong arguments against but it involves a political decision. of the major political parties in Australia have this principlefirmlywedded with their poUcies. Notwithstanding that, if the abolition is proceeded with it is generaUy accepted that claw-back through taxes is necessary in order preserve some element of the criterion of need. think that is a reasonable proposition, but much depends on how it is done, and this is where the problems emerge. One problem, of course, is that only some pensioners benefited from the abolition of the means test and they were the people of 70 years and over. But aU pensioners, except those fuUy dependent on the pension as their sole source income, suffered from the taxing of the pension, welparticularly after the age allowance was abolished. Further difficulties were created by this replacing concessional deductions with the for general rebate in the 1975 Hayden Budget. Perhaps most important of all, increasing penthousions, which are now automatically adjusted, deand increasing superannuation payments, in the absence of tax reform, have meant that all penyear sioners with substantially increased money I beincomes but not increased real incomes have in been confronted with higher marginal tax rates, and this has placed thousands of elderly Australians in a very serious financial position. Although the problem was created by the previous Labor Government it is no good simply apportioning blame. That is of small comfort to the have people involved. I hope that the Government will investigate the severity of what is a quite not complex problem. I am not recommending special tax treatment for aged people solely on the basis of age and without reference to need. But I suggest that the living standards of this very cross-section of people have only recently is been adversely affected by thefiscalevents of earlier years. I ask the Government to examine this matter and, if necessary, consider appropriate reforms to redress this situation. I have pleasure in supporting the motion moved by the were honourable member for Braddon. our belt. Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (5.45)-He r Majesty's Speech is not of great the length although it is of major significance in terms of some of its content and some of its omissions. In terms of printing what is deemed to be the Government's program occupies a mere 3 tax columns of Hansard. I think that eloquently in expresses what we deem to be the major deficiencies of the present Government. The over honourable member for Perth (Mr MCLean), who has just spoken, adverted to facts that we all know exist. Members of the Opposition wish to Both place on record that the Labor Government was elected to promote the welfare aspects of our society. One of those welfare aspects was the abolition of the means test for age pensioners. We some heard much about this concept from a former to Liberal-National Country Party government but I very Uttle was done. The Labor Government attempted to do something about this matter. I remind the House that supporters of the Government, including the honourable member for age Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), on many occasions in the past agitated for the aboUtion of the means test. But the point is that we agitate for these reforms on the basis of what is best for Australia of and how we can best utilise resources. We do not see the same concept or philosophy coming from the present Government. As an example, in the speech made by Her Majesty great emphasis is given to a housing voucher pilot scheme. We would all be very impressed on the basis that obviously this scheme will help many thousands of people need, as indeed they are in need. But I have found that the Budget provision for this proposal is $75,000. The housing supplement by way of rental subsidy in my area and in many areas Australia today in many cases should be at least $20. If we were to apply that yardstick to this alleged magnificent scheme we would find that the scheme would help 75 families in Australia. This proposal was outlined in a speech from the throne. What a magnificent effort we are in this area! I would think that we should be hanging our heads in shame when we consider what is the real problem of housing. Why is it that the young people in whom we are so interested cannot get proper accommodation? It is of Utde value for honourable members opthe posite to pat themselves on the back about a favourable family aUowance scheme when famis Uies have nowhere to shelter. These are the sorts of problems that arise. Pensioners who pay rent are paid an extra $5 a week for housing subsistelectorate ence allowance. This is costing us $4.3m. I just want to make a comparison. We provide $4.3m for elderly pensioners at a time when hundreds of thousands of young people are to be offered housing voucher pilot rental scheme for which this we give a paltry and miserly $75,000.I am disapSupply pointed to think that this scheme even received mention in the speech from the throne. Let us have a look at some of the fundamental issues that face Australia. Some reference was made to the need for change and I am pleased to say independence of spirit. Honourable memSenate. bers would have noticed yesterday the indepenbe dent spirit that is prevaUing in Australia at present time. It is against not the monarchy the fact that we are saddled with an outmoded Constitution. Some reference was made to the tinkering with the Constitution in about to indulge. It is hoped that the Australian people will pass some referendums in May next, but they will allow only very minor adjustment to a greatly outmoded Constitution. The Constitution is undemocratic. It favours the old estabUshment class of the 1890s. It it the concept that we are still subject to colonial domination, guidance and advice. It is contrary to democratic principles on which a country as Australia should be able to say its Constitution rests. In the United Nations we as a nation applaud the freedoms that are there espousedhuman rights, the protection of the individual's Ufe and property, the freedom of countries from aggression, and so on. Yet in our own country we have a Constitution over which we as a national Parliament have very Uttle power. It is apparent into those who attend Constitutional Convention debates that those who represent State governments feel that we should not have even the power we have. They believe that the States are of best able to manage this country. At present Western Australians are more interested in talking about secession, as they were in the 1900s. They believe that they have the money and that they can do the job better than the Commonwealth. It is something like the BougainvUle situmaking ation. Because there is a copper mine on BougainvUle the residents there believe that they ought to secede from Papua New Guinea. Let us look at the matter from the Australian point of view. This talk of secession is caused by dreadful confrontation that can take place within the ambit of the Constitution. The Senate determined to run this country in future. The Senate is an undemocratic institution in the sense that it is not elected directly by the people on an basis. It is elected on the basis of proportional representation and on the basis of the States. The Senate is firmly convinced that it should be running the country. Well meaning a people on the Government benches think that is proper. It is even suggested that if in future is refused there should be a double disa solution to determine the issue. Let us assume that we adopt that course and there is a double dissolution following refusal by the Senate to pass the first Supply Bill. Assume that after an election the Government retains power in the House of Representatives but still faces a hostile Is the outcome of the next Supply Bill to determined on the same basis? Are we to have the double dissolutions every 6 months? That is how but often Supply BiUs go before senators, and they make their decision not on what they think is best for the nation but on what they think is best for which we are the parties they represent. Is it not about time we reaUsed that even our forefathers did not have such lack of foresight? As I have mentioned before, they clearly provided in section 87 of the Constitution that three-quarters of the revenue collected by the Comhas in monwealth Government should go back to the States and that out of the remaining quarter of the revenue, which was very limited in those such days because it came only from customs and excise duties, the Commonwealth was to provide also section 96 grants. The States were not very worried about the refusal of Supply. They had their money apportioned under section 87. So, why make a legal provision that the Senate is so powerful that it can refuse Supply, thus depriving the Government of any money? Of course, as was known in the past, the High Court wisely said that this Parliament ought to control the economy. The provisions of section 87 need not have prevaUed, certainly after 1920. After 20 years of that sort of nonsense we got out of that position. We then had the advantage of being able to run the economy as a nation. In 1974 an attempt to defeat the then Government by threatening to refuse Supply failed. In 1975 a second attempt was successful. The reason was that people were put into the Senate not by the electors but by Premiers of State governments hostile to Labor. The crunch of the situation is that in future, no matter what government thinks it has the will of the people, the government will not be able to govern unless it has the wiU of the Senate. No mention was made of this reform. Tinkering with the Constitution is likely to lead to further delay in drafting a new Constitution. It is about time we had a new Constitution. This is what the blue flag with the white insignia which we saw in front of Parliament House yesterday represented. Australia should be standing up as a nation. A new Constitution has to be drawn up. It is very significant that the majority of those under the age of 30 years favour a new Constitution. I am not talking about a Constitution that says that we have to get rid of the monarchy. The monarchy can remain. A new Constitution should clearly state that the powers of the people are vested in the House of Representatives, that this House is responsible to the people and that aU legislation passed by both Houses can be accepted as being passed in an intelUgent way. It should clearly state that there is only one House of finance, as there is in most other worthwlule countries. That would be the House of the people, the taxing House. Then we would not have this confrontation, this nonsense, this charade as to the power of the Senate and how it will dictate what is in the best interests the economy. If we look at it from the point of view of what is in the best interests of the economy, we as members of the Australian Labor Party must bear in mind that we were removed from office by the senators ostensibly on the basis that there was high inflation, high unemployment and a lack of economic management. If that was the yardstick, why is the present Government still in office? Today we have even higher inflation, even higher unemployment and a malaise, as evidenced by the Jackson report, permeating the whole of our industrial base. So let us talk about what should be done to help this nation in a crisis, which is what we now have. Let us not have a very Umited speech from the Monarch telling us that we wdl make great economic progress and that we are developing our characteristics in a proper fashion. We are failing the Australian people because we are not giving them the opportunity of stable government or government of a democratic institutional nature. We are saddling them with the old idea that the establishment always knows best. The Government is very much wedded to the establishment of this country-the Umited few who feel that they should be able to wield power and dictate what should be a reasonable profit for themselves. We hear from the Government an indictment of the trade union movement and what is wrong with the wages policy the Labor Party is espousing. When we said in December 1973 that we wanted the power to fix prices and incomes, the then Opposition opposed the idea, as did the trade umon movement, for wrong reasons. The opposition was on the basis that the States could do the job, that they had the power and that there was not need for this sort of exercise. What nonsense that was. How it has been proved by subsequent events that this is about the only national Parliament without the abUity to control its national economy. Is it any wonder that there was a wage explosion in 1974? When the Labor Government was trying to hold the front line on wages, who was negotiating agreements across the board? It was the banks, the insurance companies, the local government clerks",45
111,Mr BRYANT,QUEEN,And Reg Ansett.,50
112,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,QUEEN,"And Reg Ansett. They were negotiating the lot. The Mayne Nickless Ltd $24 a week for transport workers wrecked the metal trades award arrangement under which there was a $ 15 ceiling. Honourable members opposite solemnly come into the of chamber now and say that it was the Labor Party's fault. In the referendum in 1973 they denied us the opportunity to control prices and incomes. They must accept the blame for the wage explosion in 1974. We fought hard for wage indexation in 1975 and they opposed it. FuU indexation was the best thing going for this country because it guaranteed an effective margin of control in the wages area. Honourable members opposite are taking credit for reducing inflation in the last 12 months. Thereductionhas been due solely to indexation, which we brought in. The Government has only one argument to put. Before the Australian ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission it argues that there should not be any increase in workers' wages, despite the fact that the cost of Uving increases. How can it justify that? Of course its justification wage increases affect profits. But the worker gets no benefit from the profits. He makes the profits for others and he is taxed on what he earns. Many companies are able to use all sorts of interesting devices to avoid tax. The investment aUowance is a bonanza for some of them-no t those that are struggling, but those that have plenty of wealth. The Government's problem is that it is unable to identify needs. It is unable to legislate tively to bring about proper tax reform. At least the Labor Government started to do something in this area. We legislated to make tax deducnext tions uniform instead of giving a higher deducParliament tion to a man with a higher income. We fearful that we will see, particularly in the education field, a return to the old philosophy that the man who spends more money on the edumade cation of his child, which he can do only if earns more, should get a larger tax deduction. The Karmel report clearly shows the obvious disThat crimination that there has been in education Australia for many years. The poor have United received the worse end of the deal.",50
113,Unknown,QUEEN,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,51
114,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,QUEEN,"In continuation of my speech which I commenced before the suspension of the sitting I now wish to address my concluding remarks to the laws which the Government intends to put before this Parliaand ment and to law reform generally. Firstly, would Uke to mention the Australian Labor Party's proposition to introduce a national pensation scheme. This has been prevented from coming to fruition because of the Government's opposition to our legislation. The most practical demonstration of the worthwhUe characteristics of that legislation is, as I indicated at question time today, that about 30 people who were perrespect manently injured or who suffered bereavement in the Darwin cyclone tragedy are being paid benefits in accordance with the principles of that legislation. The tragedy of the present Governor ment's mean and miserly attitude is its decision to discontinue to pay compensatory benefits those people from 31 March. There are parathat plegics, famines who have lost the and people who have suffered permanent injury. AU that will be given to these people is a paltry, insignificant invaUd pension-som e social benefit which will go nowhere towards meeting their needs. If honourable members look at the budgetary provisions relating to the Darwin cyclone disaster they will see that some $600,000m has been expended in restoration in full for propis that erty damage and other worthwhUe compensatory factors, but certainly nothing is more worthwhile than life and limb and the abUity of a person to survive and enjoy a reasonable standard of Uving. WhUe the Government is anxious to give itself plaudits for a somewhat doubtful housing voucher scheme costing $75,000 a year I am now prepared to say that it wiU extract more than that amount of money from the benefits that it should continue to pay to the victims of the Darwin cyclone disaster. It is important that this effecParUament should understand the need for national compensation legislation of the type that has been put forward. I hope that on the occasion this legislation is introduced this will recognise the worthwhUe nature are very of its contents and approve it. Another matter to which reference has been is the human rights legislation. Honourhe able members will recall that the Labor Government introduced the Human Rights Bill in 1973. Bill clearly espoused the rights. It was in acin cordance with the covenant adopted by the Nations. It meant that we as a Parliament would legislate to guarantee that people had rights. Personally my own view is that those rights ought to be speUed out in the Constitution itself, but it is important for them to be incor1 )orated in legislation and to be enforceable in egislation. All that the Government is saying is that it will establish a human rights commission. That commission will not have the same force strength as the proposal put forward by the I Labor Party. The Human Rights Bill of 1973 was defeated by the present Government with its comnumbers in the Senate. That Bill had the abUity to enforce rights. This Government's proposal is merely to establish a commission which will investigate complaints. The commission will not have the same strength or effect as our proposal. We were relying on the external affairs powers in of our legislation so that this Parliament would be able to say right throughout Australia that rights could be guaranteed. The proposed commission will be relying merely on federal law federal power which is somewhat weaker than our proposal. It will not be as strong and it will to not encompass all rights. So again we can see there is no effective effort to bring about law bread winner reform in this area. Finally, time and again we have attempted to introduce national securities legislation into this Parliament but it has been defeated again and again by the Government with its numbers. On what basis can the Government justify the tinuation of the graft, corruption and blatant steahng of money that is being perpetrated under the existing company legislation in the States? This Parliament has the power to legislate in field. The Rae Committee, as it is known, clearly established that people were being defrauded. recent report on Patrick Partners tabled in the themselves. New South Wales Parliament discloses deceit, fraud and corruption of the greatest magnitude lack but nothing is able to be done about it. Auditors colours have been deceiving people; trustees have not that thehave been acting in accordance with their responsibiligreater quantities of ties; creditors are coming to members ment saying:' Can't I get some justice?' It clear that there is an urgent need for law reform is the disappointment of achieving goals in this area. This Parliament has some say in respect of bankruptcy but it is a bit late to take action provided against a bankrupt when the cause of the bankand ruptcy could have been dealt with. It is important that we quickly estabUsh that this Parliament give people assistance in this area. The Patrick Partners case is a prime example of how neglithat gent the Parliament has been in legislating in field of corporate securities. We can save people money. We can name the crooks and we can vent them from continually being re-elected to companies. Again we make this plea: At the ment there is no more urgent legislation than corporations and securities exchange comtheir mission legislation. If that legislation were force we could have saved many people. We society. could have saved their entitlements. We could have proved that this Parliament is at least standards interested in these problems.",51
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUEEN, cannot Order! The honourable member's time has cannot expired.,52
116,Mr CONNOLLY,QUEEN,"As a tain member of this House I am delighted to have the opportunity to be associated with the passage the Address-in-Reply to Her Majesty's Speech. While the economy remains a major matter national importance, it is by no means the only subject which should involve this Parliament. We have reached an emotional watershed in Australia's history. I am concerned that there appears to be a growing national malaise. Perhaps our very affluence has robbed our people of ambition and in its place we hear with monotonous regularity the litany of what is the Government going to do about every problem we whether it be large or small? It is a fundamental contradiction for people to speak of a society based on free enterprise and individual initiative while at every opportunity seeking the involconvement of the Government and then complaining that taxes are too high and that the creeping hand of government interference pervades all. The alternative is for people to be prepared to do this more for themselves. There is an obvious equation-les s or more efficient services equal less A taxes. The people must make this decision for I believe national and personal goals tend to perspective, for too long governments of all tried to encourage people to believe objective of their existence is to obtain physical possessions. In fact, of parliaour affluence has made is quite row's standard goods. Buttoday'sthe luxuries tomortragedy of all this based entirely on possessions. Workers and management alike have been encouraged to think that their profit is greater this year than last, provided the income per worker is higher than previously, that with the effluxion of time all can must be well. But the experience of 3 years of Labor above all else demonstrated the fallacy of case. With the expenditure of over $3,000m the on education alone, with the acceptance of the right of all people to have a high standard of preeducation-on e must question education for itself or education for specific jobs-w e have still mofailed to find many so called educated people the work commensurate with their conception of abilities. Therefore we have allowed frusin tration to become a dangerous element in Despite its desire to attain high educational society has failed to decide who is going to be around to do the menial jobs. We all go to universities, nor should we. We all achieve a status in society. But we still want our community services and there is a cerlevel at which a machine cannot do this type of work. It has become quite clear that we need a of manpower planning policy which can be applied in Australia. That is one of the objectives of the of present Government through its inquiry into education, one of the objectives of which is to examine whether people are going to be available and trained for the jobs which hopefully will be present in the economy in future. The real problem is that we are running theriskof allowing people to be super educated yet at the same time unemployed. President Lincoln once said: If we first know where we are and whither we are tending, could better judge what to do and how to do it. We know that geography and history have placed Australia in a clearly defined relationship with the rest of the world. We also know that have clear comparative cost advantages, no especially in primary and mineral production. Because of our excessive fear born in our lation from the other Western countries Europe and North America and from the impactbenefits. of 2 world wars we have allowed ourselves to Ueve, almost as a matter of holy writ, that how or other we must become a virtually totallyGerman self-sufficient people. This tendency is all simplistic to be allowed to continue. We expect the world to buy from us but apparently we not have to buy from the world, and we beUeveoffered that behind our high tariff barriers we can con-Germans tinue with the faUacy that it we give enough tection to enough industries jobs can be for all regardless of the cost Umited size of the Australian market and of the high cost structure which makes it difficult in many areas of production to sell abroad. It is perhaps a pecuUarity of our Westminster system that governments and oppositions rarely agree about major national pohcy objectives, yet there has been a consensus for many years, among the Australian people at least, that they expect from their governments near full employprospect ment. To achieve this it is quite obvious that must be generated, and employees given a sensetime of confidence in the future, and here of course have a division of philosophy. Successive given Liberal-National Country Party governments have beUeved, and rightly so, that the private sector which generates most of the goods and services used by the Austrahan people must be the source of major employment opportunities. The Opposition, on the other hand, being more tied to a dogmatic sociaUst approach, has tried have a foot m both camps. It wishes to build upindustrial strong government sector as it attempted to between 1972 and 1975. By its pace-setting poli-clearly cies it was largely responsible for pricing many Australian workers out of their jobs. Yet the surdity of this whole exercise rests on the fact that governments alone cannot create jobs which are uneconomic and expect the Australian taxposition payer to pay the difference indefinitely. I believe there is evidence to sustain my belief that at this time in our nation's history there is athere great opportunity for the major fbr management and for unions in particular toanother man. reach a consensus that the future welfare of our citizens will depend to a large extent on giving them the opportunity to work and thereby to Uveaverage productive and useful Uves. Agreed guidelines must be achieved to make this possible. I am one of those who take the view that everybody indoes a pluralistic society has to work, but I certainly webelieve that those who do not wish to work have right to expect their feUow Australians to support them in their life style indefinitely. Much has isobeen said here tonight about the need to make of people work in return for unemployment In this regard may I suggest that conbe-sideration be given to estabUshing in Australia some-an unemployment insurance scheme on the model which requires the worker as well too as management and the state to make a contribution to the fund. In return the voluntarily unemdoployed are expected to take whatever jobs are to them orrisklosing their benefits. The also have a form of national service in pro-a civilian capacity for those who cannot find found work within the normal structure of the and regardless of theeconomy. The Government might do well to consider the re-establishment of a somewhat improved Regional Employment Development scheme under which it could offer to local government bodies the equivalent of the unemployment benefit in return for jobs being given to the unemployed. From the soundings I have made with local government I believe that there is some that some thousands of young people in jobsparticular could be employed, if only on a part basis, in activities of general use to the comwemunity. Perhaps consideration could also be to trading off the 40 per cent depreciation allowances against a cut by the States in their pay-roU tax thus picking up the marginaUy unemployed. The Government is to be applauded for the scheme which it has introduced to overcome this most pressing problem, but regrettably we are facing the probability that unless we are toprepared to accept fairly radical changes in the a profile of Australia, full employment do could well be a dream of the past. As has been pointed out by previous speakers, the unskilled workers in particular were priced out of abemployment through the poUcies of the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions and the previous Labor Government. Even the Leader of the Op(Mr E. G. Whitlam) realised this when he said in January 1975: As long as wage demands continue to cut profits, then poltiical parties, cessiveisincrease going to be unemployment in Australia. Every exin income for one man takes the job of Those words have proved to be so true. The employer is well aware of the fact that the unskilled unit of labour is more expensive notthan investing in plant and machinery, which not go on strike, which does not require holidays nor Wh per cent loadings. Who can blame him? The clear lesson of the Industrial Revoluresources tion has been that where men are naive enough to beheve that they can pit themselves against machines they have always lost. I have no doubt that we shall see a continuing trend towards greater technological innovation in Australia in the decades ahead. Australian industry associated with a greater reduction in employment opportunities, especially for the skilled, showed quite clearly in the census 1954 where 38.9 per cent of all labour employed was in the manufacturing industry. In the last census of 1975 this had fallen to a mere 32.6 cent. It is significant that the rural sector's requirements for labour fell from 15.1 per cent 7.9 per cent over the same period, but unUke sectoday, ondary industry there was a far greater increase in productivity. On the other hand, employment in the tertiary sector increased substantially. In 1954 it was 45.9 per cent and in 1975 it grown to 59.4 per cent, an increase of over cent in that period. Quite obviously what we going to require is a more technologically population-peopl e who can compete in a highly computerised world and take their place in the many and varied service industries which will continue to grow as the demands of a more com-tremely plex society expand. The problems that I have outlined must also be seen as challenges to our nation's future. If estimates in the Borrie report prove to be correct, Australia has not only a seriously decUning birth rate approaching zero population growth but in with it a progressively older population. This must require more capital intensive industries in the future, and the only prospect of changing trend would appear to be the reintroduction much more positive immigration policy comwith bined with famUy development poUcies to enportunity. courage more, young people to have larger familpeople ies. Even this wiU not change the fact that with ageing population we will require new policies and new opportunities to enable that section our people to Uve a meaningful life. While current trend is towards early retirement, it well be necessary to reverse this trend in the future. Our technological revolution which has taken man to the moon and into space has brought with.it fundamental changes in our lifestyle. Regrettably, in this country at least, there does not appear to have been any substantial developtinent ment of our vision, or a consensus among our national leaders. I refer to not only political leaders but to commercial leaders and leaders from virtually every other section of our comwe munity. We must seek to develop our national human for the benefit of Australians and ultimately for the world. This does not mean that we should simply sell raw materials for others to manufacture and sell back to us at higher prices. Surely in the areas of processing of minerals and agricultural products there is potential for both capital investment and job opportunities. I am firmly of the view that in the past we have faUed un- - to use our comparative cost advantages to the of maximum extent possible. Within this context every effort must be made to encourage management to be more imaginative. As I said earlier, per free enterprise should not mean protection from the Government at every turn any more than to freedom means licence. Similarly, management together with labour, have a responsibUity to encourage job interest and to build up self respect and dignity in the work place. Employees at all levels, not just the executive, had should be encouraged to identify themselves 14 per with the company that employs them. Surely are Fletcher Jones is an outstanding example of trained what can be done in this regard. Despite the enormous achievements of our nation in the last 25 years and despite our exhigh standard of living compared with many countries, the Henderson report identified areas of major concern and deficiencies in the social welfare structure, This was despite the unithe versal philosophy of spending money on welfare. In 1976-77 all levels of government spending reached $2,339 for every man woman and child this country, out of which social welfare alone accounted for over 30 per cent. This should have taught us the same lesson as we found in the field the of education, which I noted earUer, that often of a massivefinancialexpenditure does not equate efficiency of service or with equality of opToday there are still some one million in this land who are living below the povanerty line. The introduction by the Government of family allowances and the new experimental of housing allowance voucher program for housing the are major initiatives to give money to those may people in need with a minimum of bureaucratic interference in the hope that by helping those in need directly we are giving them dignity, self respect and the opportunity to decide for themselves how this assistance should be spent. Among the many benefits which we have as Australian citizens is the fact that this whole conbelongs to one nation alone. In that respect we are unique buttimeis not on our side. Unless all Australians are prepared to start thinking of themselves as pieces in the mosaic of the nation, run the very real risk of wasting our precious assets in futile internal strife in a world in which the gaps between rich and poor are growing day by day and in which a nation's right to exist will not depend on the rule oflaw so much as on the might of its right arm. Much has been said in the past about Australia's low productivity and that Australians are lazy and will not work. This is a judgment which I for one do not accept. However, it is worth keeping in mind that the average Australian worker today is supposed to work 40 hours a week. How many could truthfully say that they do that wnile being perfecdy happy to take their 4 weeks annual leave, plus Wh per cent hoUday bonus, plus one week long service leave per year and probably 2 weeks sick leave per year. In addition there are some 24 public hoUdays per annum. Thus the average employer has to pay for some 12 weeks during the year when, in fact, there is zero productivity. As a nation we have an obvious choice. We can expect a higher standard of Uving with low productivity, higher deficits and higher inflation and the ultimate collapse of our nation, or we can equate our sense of achievement with higher living standards and higher productivity. At this time, lower wage demands are essential more in keeping with the capacity of the economy to absorb them. I now turn to the question of defence and foreign policy. The Government must be congratulated on its pubUcation of the White Paper on a defence pohcy for Australia. Nevertheless care must be taken to ensure that there is an appropriate match between pohcy and the avaUabUity of forces to put it into effect. At the present cause of financial restraints, there are some difficulties in this area. For example, there is a real danger of the replacement syndrome becoming too evident in our repurchasing policies. The mere need to maintain or upgrade the state of the art should not be taken as the raison d'etre for buying equipment simply because our major alUes also have it. The size and physical characteristics of our continent require a unique defence capacity which cannot be achieved simply by grafting onto accepted doctrines ad hoc concepts which may or may not meet our requirements. It must not be forgotten that in our purchase program, due to the Labor Government's deliberate decision to cancel arrangements made by the MCMahon Government in 1972, we are now some 4 years behind in the purchase and resupply of desperately needed equipment for our armed forces. Although the Government has announced that $ 12,000m will be spent towards this objective, the continuing unsatisfactory level of inflation both here and abroad could well mean that additional funds will be required if we are to meet even our most basic requirements for new equipment. Vital decisions for aU 3 Services have yet to be made, and foremost among these of course is the question of a fighter replacement for the air force. There is nothing more certain than that in the ultimate analysis the Australian people alone will be responsible for the safety and security of our land. The perspective in which Australia's defence needs to be examined cannot ignore the relationship between the great powers or the likely impact of changing circumstances in South East Asia, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean areas in particular. As Australians we must continue to be vitally concerned about the welfare of our neighbours. With the virtual removal of the Umted States defence umbrella from South East Asia, the continuing incursions being made into ThaUand from both Laos and Cambodia, the reemergence of a clandestine communist movement in Malaysia and the potential problems which could emerge in Indonesia, it is abundantly clear that Australia cannot cut itself off from the region in which we must form a part. The Government's aid programs are but one manifestation of our continuing interest in the welfare of these peoples. But the trend announced by President Carter in his decision that in future United States aid will be predicated by the requirement that recipients maintain acceptable standards of human rights could well prove to be an initiative of the greatest significance which Australia wiU have to watch with considerable interest. It is far too simplistic to divide time, be the world into communist and non-communist powers and to take the view that was taken during the Dulles era that the Free World included such outstanding despots as Papa Doc of Haiti and the mUitary dictatorships of Latin America. Today, of course, we have simUarities with General Amin in Uganda. While countries like ours espouse the view that states should not interfere in the domestic affairs of others, there is obviously a point where, if the crocodUes are allowed to run amok, it will not be long before their appetites seek for prey on the other side of the river. Surely the world learnt this lesson from the rise of Adolf Hitler. Undoubtedly there will be others. We have reached a watershed in our history. It will be for future generations to judge how best we handled it.",52
117,Mr BRYANT,QUEEN,"I hope the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) will forgive me if I do not answer him at length because it is not necessary. It was the usual Liberal litany-up with profits; down with wages; the worker will not work, although he de1975 nied that at the end of his speech. That is not what he meant although that is what it sounded like at the beginning. I refer to a couple of pointsconstitutional that he made. First of aU he quoted some figures from manufacturing industry which show that the percentage of employment in that area clining. He also quotedfiguresfrom primary industry which show that the percentage of ployment in that area is declining and that area of activity was transferring to the tertiary industries. That is apparent to most of us but biggest contributor to the tertiary area is governstruggle ment and the whole theme of this Government's economic policy is to reduce government activity. The honourable member isflyingin the face of his own analysis of the situation and producing further misery as far as I can see. I think that pretty important thought for the Parliament and for the honourable member. Fifty per cent ofhis sentiments were reactionary and SO per cent seemed to be commendable, an improvement on some of his colleague perhaps. The facts are, course, that investment will continue and proWilliam ductivity per worker will continue to increase. It is a piece of mythology of Austrahan that the productivity of the Austrahan worker is at a minimal level. It would be worthwhile to .in three. examine somefigureswith regard to productivity. At the Commonwealth Brickworks, which is a public activity, I calculated from figures I received that the 35 workers employedwithout there produced on an average 700 000 bricks perstruggle week. This is about 20 000 bricks per week per worker which, at a calculation of the standard average rate of about $120 per thousand, means $2,500 worth of production per worker in that institution. This includes the typist, the manager and the people on thefloor.They are costing about $150 per week to do that. I understand that in the coal mines it is of the same order that in some areas in the coal mining industry of each miner is producing up to $400 of coal per day for an average wage of perhaps $30 per day.we I think it is time that the people who are complaining bitterly, such as the honourable member for Bradfield, and the Minister for Pro-indeed. ductivity (Mr Macphee), whom I noticed on telethat vision the other night repeating the same furphies, made an analysis of exactly what is productivity of the Australian worker in relation to everybody else on this planet. I wanted to talk tonight about the struggles of areas this Parliament to assert its own rights and its own power against forces that flow down they are not. through history which have betrayed the reasons for its very existence. I beheve that 11 Novemberposite was a serious defeat for this Parliament, not because I was one of the by-products or victims of it. If it means that we start to think about the structure of this country in the constructive way of some of my colleagues, particularly my friend, the honourable member for is deKingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) who spoke earUer this evening, it probably has been worth emwhile. There are noises coming from the other the side of the House which indicate that Government supporters feel the same. The long history theof Parliament, of course, has been a continuing of the institution to survive against those who would subvert it and against those people who controlled the power structure of countries. We are the inheritors of the British parliamentary system. It is instructive to look at the is astruggles of the 17th century in which the Parliament asserted its rights eventually against the monarchy, against Charles I by his ultimate execution, against James II by his ultimate abdication and against any future transgression by of monarchs in the arrangements that it made with and Mary in 1688. It is instructive to read an Act which was passed at that time entitled an Act for the frequent meeting and calling Ufe of parUaments. It states: . from henceforth a parliament shall be Holden once years at the least. In those days monarchs had access to funding somefrom different sources and they could get along parUaments and rule by decree. The these days is to assert therightof this Parliament to be free from undue interference by others, whether it is the Governor General acting in his capacity or the Senate acting in its capacity. I believe that the people of this country elect a House of Representatives to govern Australia. It is the executive instrument of the people of Australia and it ought to have the right and to be able to do so unchallenged during its term office. It ought to have a duty to get on with it. So I am speaking this evening to suggest that take a close look at the question of constitutional reform and consider why the march to constitutional reform has been a slow march It is one of the miracles of this country in the 1890s our predecessors in the various parUaments were able to arrange the gathering thetogether of the colonial pariiamentary representatives and produce a document which, up until recently, I though was fairly adequate in many are as far as actual governmental techniques concerned. Now, of course, we know that I know that some honourable members opthink that the events that occurred on 11 November 1975 were reasonable. It is not a bad idea to remember what they were. In the ordinary course of events the then Treasurer in August 1975 produced a Budget which passed through this House and was sent to the other place. That place, realising that there were opportunities for pohtical gain, started to play ducks and drakes with it. It neither passed it nor refused to pass it; it neither deferred it nor made judgment upon it. It simply held the country to ransom over weeks of discord. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), of course, does not believe in discord in the community, and I am surprised that he supported what was going on at that time. Eventually the Governor General exercised the authority which he presumed to have, which honourable members opposite presumed him to have and which we on this side of the House say that he has no right to have-no r does he have it-and dismissed the Government, and in this House an act, I think, of what one could almost call parliamentary treason occurred. The present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) stood up in his place and said that he had been appointed the Prime Minister. The House passed a vote of no confidence in him forthwith. What ought any parliamentarian of honour have done? He should have told the Governor General that he could not carry on under any circumstances whatsoever. It might be said that, after all, he had organised it and that he would not do that. What surprised me was that a large number of his colleagues were willing the next day to accept commissions under those terms. I believe they acted in betrayal of their parliamentary duty. The 12 November Ministers, as one might call them, I beheve have got a black mark on their record which they will wear while they are in this Parliament and while they are out of it, because they breached totally the parliamentary tradition. If you are going to be a Minister who administers you must have the confidence of the lower House, which in this case is the House of Representatives. So that brings me to the quesdon: What are going to do about it? I just want to say a word about the current fantasia, one might call it that or the philological exercise of saying that the problem will be solved by defining the country a republic. One dictionary tells me that a is a state in which sovereignty does not reside in an hereditary ruler. Sovereignty in this place does not reside in an hereditary ruler. I suppose one might say that Her Majesty has denied that it was possible for her to intervene. She has The informed my friend, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), of that in eloquent English. I can admit now that on the evening of the day on which we were removed from office I rang Buckingham Palace and spoke to her secretary. I told him what was going on to make my point about it. I think it was quite obvious from whatever came from Britain at that time that Her Majesty the Queen said: 'It is your own affair out there'. So who does rule this place? He is certainly not an hereditary ruler. He is an accidental one perhaps. Let us hope he is just an incidental one. So what are we? We are not a repubUc, I suppose, because in theory we have a monarch. We are not a democracy because we have an appointed official who answers to no one and may do what he will with this Parliament, as he did the other week when he prorogued it. It is worthwhile reading the impUcations of section 5 of the Constitution. Just imagine what would happen if, say, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien) had that power to exercise over his electoral committee. The next time the matter of preselection came up he would dissolve the committee, prorogue it, prevent it from meeting, and so on until he haa satisfactorily solved his precarious situation. We are inheritors of the feudal concept in the very acceptance of the fact that one man can have that kind of authority. Mr Kilien-You have hurt my feelings.",55
118,Mr BRYANT,QUEEN,"I am almost gratified. I reached the conclusion recentiy that the honourable member did not have any. We have an executivefixationin this country. We have some religion about Cabinets. This is not the twentyfifth government, or whatever the figure is; we have got the Fraser Government here. Previously we had the Menzies Government and we had the Whitlam Government. I think it is an oddity in the Australian scene that we should identify governments by the names of people. I regard this repubUcan fervour which is currently running through the country as irrelevant. It is a total misunderstanding of events of 11 November 1975 to think that the situation as we we see it would be solved by suddenly calUng ourselves a republic. Unless we change the power base in the Constitution there is no point in caUing it anything at all. My own view is that we as have the Commonwealth of Australia and that republic we should change the present structure. So I am advocating this evening the passage of a Supremacy of Parliament Act-cal l it what you will-to make provision for 3 things in particular. first is to alter the Constitution so as to provide that Ministers shall have the confidence of the House of Representatives. I do not think we need to alter the Constitution to do that. A ber of this Parliament is a creature and the ation of this Parliament. It should be possible define the duties of members of this Parliament in carrying out any administrative act. It is that His Excellency the Governor General appoint a member of this Parliament to some particular function, but it is also true that could have it included in the rules that that also meant automatic expulsion from Parliament. I believe that is a very important principle and ought to assert it. There is one other proviso that I think we must numbers have, and that is in relation to servants. One of the depressing things about the Parliament.been what occurred on 11 November 1975 readiness with which we all accepted the authimportant and urgent thatdevice. ority that had flowed on that occasion. I did and necessary to change those featurestheofsteps we the officers of the department tered did. But it was not for a couple of days, I suppose, that I reaUsed the inherent dangers in that-that simply a handing down of a message from on high meant that everybody accepted it and that there was a total change. The pubUc vants who had been administering the country under the Labor Government, immediately acment, cepted the orders of the newly appointed Minisrogue ters, none of whom had the confidence of this Parliament. I think we should make it clear in PubUc Service Act that the Public Service adminis isters its responsibUities only under authority stemming from Ministers who have the conthings fidence of the House of Representatives. Then we come to the relationship between the 2 Houses. Surely it istimewe got on with that. my first afternoon in this place, 15 February 1956, the Governor General said: The election has left my Government with a substantially larger majority in the House of Representatives but Senate in which the Government will by July not majority. Then he went on to describe the complications which arise from that situation. He went on say: The present position is that any conflict between Houses can beresolvedonly by the slow, cumbrous very satisfactory procedure of a double dissolution occurred in 1951. My advisers believe that the relations tween the 2 Houses should bereviewed.They opinionSome of them are still sitting herethat a governmentrequiresareasonableterm of office reasonable period of stability in long-range plans for the nauon. That was said 20-odd years ago. Subsequently a Joint Committee of Constitutional Review was appointed. Honourable members might find it such instructive to read the pages of the report of that memCommittee which refer to the settlement of deadcrelocks. Some of the people sitting on that comto mittee were the Prime Minister at the time, the Rt Hon Sir Robert Menzies, the present Leader true of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and Senamay tor Wright. The Committee recommended that in the event of a dispute between the 2 Houses we the Governor General, acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council, should call a joint sitting straight away. That would seem to me to we be a reasonable and logical solution of the problem. Of course, if a government did not have the no right in a joint sitting perhaps it would have to proceed anyhow. I admit that in 1975 the duties of public it would have I am afinelybalanced meeting of happy to see that provision was the as a democratic protective I believe it is take the which I adminisConstitution. I briefly remind honourable members of the democratic threats that lie within the Constitution. For instance, under section 5 of the Conser-stitution the Governor General may decide upon thetimesfor holding the sessions of the ParUaby proclamation or otherwise. He can prothe Parliament and he can dissolve it. What we decide upon here and what the Constithe tution dictatesflowon for decade after decade. It now 77 years since the Constitution came into operation. WhUst we might say that certain will not happen, let us presume that the Governor General decided to run the country on his own; that he decided to suspend the sittings Onof the Parliament tonight and to reconvene the Parliament in 12 months'timefor a few hours to comply with the Constitution. In the meantime, every 3 months he could appoint whomsoever he with a wished from wheresoever he wished to adminishave a ter the country. I see an honourable member shaking his head. He might be just testing it or he might be saying that such a thing could not hapto pen here. Honourable members should not believe it. Some 15 months ago we did not think the 2 that a Governor General would exercise the sort and not of authority that was exercised. We Uve in a such as world in which this kind of thing is happening bepretty consistently and the unexpected and the are of unbelievable do occur. I suggest to the House that we should apply and a ourselves pretty rapidly to making sure that the which it may give effect to control its of the destiny of this institution Ues with its membership, which is answerable directly to the people and to no one else. It is not a question of monarchies, repubUcs, governors-general or like; it is a question of the supremacy of the Parliament. I regard the 4 referenda that are fore the people now as of moderate importance. The one relating to the Territories is important. think the 2 referenda relating to simultaneous elections and the replacement of senators gimmicks. Until we resolve the quesdon of relationship between the 2 Houses there can no continuing or guaranteed stabUity. Until we resolve the question of the supremacy power of this Parliament there can be no continuing stabUity in our democratic institutions. Prime Until we do something about the nexus provisions-thos e dealing with the relationship between the number of members in the 2 Houses-w e will still be controUed by ideas that reduction were relevant in the 1890s but relevant. My view is that we will not be able to mobilise our electoral organisations to fight effectively those referenda proposals unless we put into ring something in which they can see some sense. Most of the people in my organisation and, should have thought, in the kindred organissake ations of the other parties represented in my torate agree that it is nonsense to reduce the number of House of Representatives members from Victoria at atimewhen the population is rising. So I appeal to honourable members to think very carefuUy about the nexus issue. They should not be disheartened by the fact that such a proposition was lost in 1967; they should get with the job. I think that 21 May, or whenever is to be, is too early for these referenda proposals to be put to the people. I played a very active part in the referendum concerning Aborigines which was held in 1967. It took 10 years to prepare.",57
119,Mr COHEN,QUEEN,You won.,59
120,Mr BRYANT,QUEEN,"That is right. With the help of Prime the honourable member for Robertson and $ 1,000m many other people, we carried the day. I say, interest remember meetings at which the honourable would occur rates member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), Mr conventional if Jack Kane-that other leading democrat from I think they and New South Wales-and I were on the same platconfine oneself towrong.are form, or almost the same platform. We the mobilised coUective opinion and we carried the ago- a loan was taken up to a largevery day. That is the only way that constitutional private amendments will be passed.",59
121,Mr WENTWORTH,QUEEN,"Her Majesty's speech expressed the hope of econthose omic progress. That hope cannot be reaUsed without positive poUcies and positive action our part. It is possible to argue about the depth the recession or the extent of the recovery; but reasonable argument is possible against the proposition that our economy is flagging beshould be quickened. One thing that would do that is tax reduction. Surely nobody would argue I that tax reduction would not quicken the economy. It would provide a stimulus in 4 way:,: It are would reduce costs by a reduction of indirect the charges; it would be an anti-inflationary be measure; it would add to incentive for those who find their marginal earnings heavily taxed; and it and the would increase consumer spending. Why not, therefore, have tax reductions? The Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has given us some reasons. I want to summarise the argument that he has put forward. He says that tax would increase our deficit; that if we are no longer an addition to that did not fund deficit by loans there would be the money supply, which would be inflationary; and that if we did fund it by extra loans there would be a rise in interest rates, for which would impede recovery. So on those the grounds, putting that argument forward, the Prime Minister says that at the present moment I tax reduction would be irresponsible. For the of the present argument, let me accept 2 elecstatements by the Prime Minister which I consider questionable. I consider it questionable that he should describe the capital expenditure of over $3,000m in the Budget as being a deficit. I consider it questionable that an unfunded deficit would always add to inflation and raise prices, although I concede that in some circumstances it on would. But these are things which are irrelevant it to the proposition which I am presently putting forward. In my view there is a way of funding the deficit without putting up interest rates. That is the proposition that I want to put to the House tonight. I can see the relevance of the argument of the that if Mmister and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) they go to the market to raise an extra in order to cover tax reduction, shaU I wUlrise.I can see that that they went to the market in the ordinary way. But this is where It is not necessary to market. In the old days-no tinsoapproaching these methods long extent by subscribers, not by professional investors. This is not longer the case. Private subscriptions are relatively small today because naturally who otherwise would purchase bonds are frightened by inflation. They say: 'Why should on we put money into long term bonds at 1016 per of cent interest when we can get 11 per cent or 12 no per cent on the market where it is equally safe and where we have a chance of retrieving our and money fairly quickly should we want it?'",59
122,Mr COHEN,QUEEN,Such as in the Parkes Developof ment company.,60
123,Mr WENTWORTH,QUEEN,"As my friend across the chamber suggests, sometimes they may be wrong and may make a misjudgment. But in general, for example, they would think of call deposits with building societies and things of this character which rightly they would judge as comparatively safe. So they do not go in for loans. Still, this market is one which should be available and it would be available ifwe were offer to the public bonds which were indexed both as to yield and as to redemption. This would attract the little men. I would not that we make bonds of this character available the professional market. I suggest that we put the bonds out with 4 calls the Budget reservations. First, I think that they should be amount that we spend sold only to Australians who are enrolled on the Federal Budget. Thereonwould Commonwealth electoral roll.

Thirdly, I suggest that they be fully The indexed on the consumer price index both as to any increase yield and as to ultimate redemption. Fourthly I indexation ofinincome suggest that any one holder should be allowed to there would stUl be notax purchase only a Umited quantity of bonds. would keep the professional investor, the instituthis what no other concern can do. Thecan tional investor, the speculator, out of this market. It would be a market for the Uttle man, the person who we really want to get to subscribe to the proofed. bonds and who by subscribing would have the security of his income for life protected against the erosion of inflation, and the return of after death to his estate for the benefit of his dren again would be protected from any inflaoutrageous tion erosion. I suggest that in addition to selling normal swindleeral bonds we should do something which was centuries ago a part of public finance but which been allowed to fall into desuetude. We should sell indexed annuities, annuities on the whole of which life either of the person who purchases them or jointly on the Uves of him and his spouse. They the would pay their amount in at the present moreasonable ment and they would purchase for each $100 a future. certain amount of annuity which would be expressed as a sum of so many dollars a year but which would be indexed and would go up with anyrisein the CPI. Those purchasers would have an income for Ufe secure from inflation. I suggestket: that this is something which would be attractive to many people and particularly to many people who would Uke to split their capital and put some it into bonds so that their chUdren would have it erosion proof at thetimeof the investor's death and some of it into an erosion proof annuity which would pay of course at a great deal higher rate than the bond rate so that they would have that at the higher income during the course of their life. Again it would be erosion proof. I think this scheme would be attractive to very many people. I do not believe that it would be difficult to raise very considerable sums in this to way. WhUe I am suggesting that the interest rate be comparatively modest both for the bonds and for the calculation of the annuity-whic h of suggest course would depend upon the age of the to purchaser- I think that there would be no difficulty whatsoever in the Treasurer raising whatever money he wanted to cover what he deficit but which is really the capital works from the be no difficulty in raising $3,000m or $4,000m a people who inflaIt may be said that it is expensive for future Budgets, but this surely is a delusion. Federal Budget draws its revenue from the incomes of the time. If the CPI increases, without rates and, allowing for the full which we brought in, difficulty at aU in meeting This the amount. The Federal Government do in Federal Government itself has its revenues inflation I think that there is nothing extravagant in this proposal. All I am suggesting is that the amount capital we raise be the amount we spend from the chilBudget on capital works. It is not in any way or extravagant to say that capital works should befinancedby loan. Sure, the FedTreasury will be giving up the opportunity to its citizens through inflation. That, of has course, is something which revolts every Treasury officer but it should not be something revolts every member of this Parliament. To give up the chance of swindling citizens for future is quite different from incurring an unexpense in the loans to them for the If this course were adopted the Federal Treasurer could raise his loans without going to the professional market. This would mean that he would be able to say to the professional mar'Interest rates down'. This is one of the most important features of what I am putting forward. Interest rates in Australia are extravagantly high. They are not high because we need to protect our currency against an outflow of funds, the classisuggesting cal mechanism. On the contrary, we have had protect our currency from an inflow of funds variable deposit requirements which was simply a means of keeping up local interest rates shall I say, preventing the inflow of funds pushing local interest rates down. The Treasurer-w e can understand what he is saying - says : ' I have to get funds. I have to raise money. I have to get subscriptions and I will not get subscriptions unless I put up my bond rates'. By putting up his bond rates the Treasurer is putting up every other rate in the market. Let me put this quite plainly. Austrahan interest rates are extravagantly high not because of any pressures of foreign funds but because Treasurer in order to raise his local money offer high interest rates. I am saying that if look at this in a sensible way and if we go indexed personal bonds and indexed personal annuities-whic h I think might be even more important than the bonds-in quantity the Treasurer could tell professional investors to to hell. He could offer bonds only at a low interest rate because he would not be worrying whether the professional investors subscribed them or not. This would immediately revivify the whole of the economy. If one can get interest rates down business will be picking up. This is the mechanism to do it. It is not unfair on insurance companies, for example, because the insurance companies- I speak particularly of the mutual insurance companies which do not have any shareholders-wil l make large gains. The capital value of their portfolios will rise substantially as interest rates fall. They will be able to compensate themselves for the fact the economy that their future investments will rate of interest. One may say that this is a simplistic plan. It in a way. It has a simphcity, but it will work. will not put a strain on the other capital markets because as moneys are withdrawn to pay for bonds they will be disbursed by the Government's ment, particularly in the form of tax reduction. As I said before, this will stimulate the whole of the economy and make all the difference to our present outlook. At the present moment we are take cabined into stagflation. The economy is stagthing nant and it is not going ahead as it should. I offer in this way 2 things. I offer, firstly, a of reducing taxes without inflation. It will reduce ment taxes in a way which is counter inflationary bedemands cause it will enable costs to be reduced and it will enable indirect charges to be lifted. offer the reduction of interest rates throughout the whole of the Australian economy. I am not that one takes any terribly drastic to action. One may want to do things gradually and by not in a very disturbing and drastic way. This simple measure will change the whole outlook of or, the Australian economy and get us out of the from morass in which we are still floundering.",60
124,Dr CASS,QUEEN,"The atmosphere this evening seems nice and relaxed, with the very few fans on the benches and even fewer in the galleries. So one can be excused for not making a violent speech but for musing on the problems facing us. I will be interested to read in Hansard tomorrow what the honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth) said. I feel it is a bit of a dream. I may be wrong; I may have the missed part of the logic. Certainly the point has to about purchasing annuities is already good we sociaUst philosophy. In our terms it is called a for national superannuation fund. One pays for it whUe one earns, and gets it back when one retires. The only problem is that that does not necessarily give one a lot of funds to spare. It go does not really allow one to drop all that much in taxes because, after the scheme has been in force for a time,the stage is reached at which people to need to be paid back their money. If there is any inflation-ther e is likely to be-the annuity has to be at a higher rate than the rate at which they contributed. So I do not think it is quite as simple the as the honourable member said. I may have missed some of the logic. I shall read Hansard carefully before I completely dismiss the suggestion. I thought there was something missing. The windfall Queen, in her Speech, said: Australia has experienced economic difficulties in recent years; my Government has given first priority to restoring and will use all the resources at its disposal to be at a lower achieve this goal. That is very good. The Government acknowlis edges that we are in economic difficulties. I say It that because the Government wrote the Speech. If one is in difficulties, I guess the first thing one has to do is to assess the problem. The Governassessment of the problem is that 'the prosperity of the Australian people depends on the strength of its productive private sector, on its manufacturing, mining and rural industries'. I it that that is a concession that there is somesick in the state of the private sector. If it were all right we would not have our problems. Hence that statement. The Speech continues: way My Government is providing incentives and encourageto the private sector, and is reducing its own relative on national resources so that private industry may have room to grow, provide employment and increase the Secondly, I well-being of all Australians. That is marvellous. This is a private enterprise economy. I am tempted to ask: If it is private and if it is enterprising why is it necessary for the Government, a sort of socialist arm of society, to provide incentives and encouragement to the private sector? Why is private enterprise unable to get itself going? The truth is that in this country private enterprise has been neither private not enterprising for the last 50 years. In fact, enormous props are provided by the Government for the private sector. Let us discuss the moves taken by the Government to encourage the private sector. One recent move was devaluation. It was based on the simple proposition that among other things devaluation decreases the cost of Austrahan manufactured goods to buyers in other countries. That is good. That means that other people elsewhere will be keener to buy our goods. So we earn more money; we export more. That is the theory. In an article in the Sydney Moming Herald of 1 December a gentleman by the name of Clive T. Edwards wrote: The 17.5 per cent devaluation of the dollar is a omen for manufacturing industry in Australia. Most Australian manufacturing firms are highly protected from import competitions by tariffs, import restrictions and other barriers to imports. By making imports dearerThat is what devaluation doesthe devaluation will allow these firms to raise the price of their goods by some 17 to 20 per cent. That is funny. That was not what was supposed to happen. That is what this Clive T. Edwards claims will happen. That means that the firms increase their prices. They can obviously make more profit. That is why they are there. I am not necessarily grizzling about it. I want to pursue the logic of the private enterprise system. Devaluation enables them to raise their prices because they are selling whatever they can hope to sell overseas anyway. They can just bump up the price a bit. The overseas companies still pay the same amount, in essence. The home company earns more in Austrahan dollars because of the trick of devaluation. That increases the cost on the Australian market. That is not all. The article also states: But most manufacturing firms depend heavily on imported inputs . . . The price of these inputs will rise some 17 to 20 per cent . . . The increase in the price of imports to inflationary pressure. I thought the point of all this exercise was to encourage private enterprise. One of the reasons for doing it was to control inflation. There is an inherent Ulogicality in it if this gentleman, who is a senior lecturer in economics at the Australian National University, knows what he is talking about. Presumably he does. Mr Ellicott-Mayb e he does not know.",61
125,Dr CASS,QUEEN,"The Minister mumbled: 'Maybe he does not know'. That is all very well. He is one of those people who advise us in Treasury and everywhere else. So the increase in the price of imports will add significantly to inflationary pressures. I notice that the Minister is mumbling away that that is all nonsense. Maybe, but let us see if that is what is happening. The article continues: But this is not all. The devaluation adds to the profits earned in the industries which play a crucial role in the determination of award wage rates . . . This in turn is going to encourage increases in wages. We have a funny theory in this country that as profitabUity of private enterprise goes up everybody should share in it, including the workers. So if the profitability of an industry goes up the wages in that industry go up. That is what the whole arbitration system is about. No one up till now has grizzled about that proposition. So bird of ill the very move we have taken to try to control inflation, namely devaluation, is. going to increase the cost for the manufacturing sector; it is going to increase the profits of those particular sections that are the pace setters in wage fixing. So therefore wages are going to go up which of course will flow across the board and increase the cost for everybody else. I am not arguing against wage increases. I am just pursuing the logic as put by a gentlemen who ought to know and who writes in defence of this private enterprise system. He concludes: On balance, devaluation itself provides little net gain to manufacturing Arms. But there is more. First, devaluation will be accompanied by supplementary policies. In particular, credit will have to be kept tight if there is to be any semblance of an anti-inflationary policy. Interest rates will therefore be high and will rise over time. The incentive to investAnd here comes the rubin the expansion of manufacturing activities will be small because the cost of borrowing will rise . . . The Prime Mmister (Mr Malcom Fraser) said he was trying to encourage the private sector to expand, but the effect of what he has done is going to inhibit that expansion. The article will add significantly continued: A decision further to restrain Government spending will exacerbate the depressed state of consumer demand. This is because the private sector will not be able to borrow as a result of interest rates being too high. Therefore it will not be able to invest and as a consequence it will not be able to build new factories. The only area in which we will get things buUt will be in the pubUc sector. Honourable members will recall that the Prime Minister in the speech he gave to the Queen suggested that we need to cut down on the resources allocated to the pubhc sector so that we can encourage the private sector. The author of the article says that that decision will further exacerbate the depressed state of consumer demand. That is not a mystery. If we spend pubhc money on public works the money is used by the private sector. The private sector builds schools; it builds hospitals, and supplies the equipment and everything. In other words, this so called inhibiting of pubhc spending, the terrible extravagances that the last Labor Government indulged in, the sort of waste of pubhc money that this present Liberal Government is going to contain, control and restrict means that in fact acdon controlling pubhc spending is harming the private sector. It was nonsense to suggest that the public sector had too much of the resources because the resources inevitably flowed from the private sector itself when it did work required for the public sector. The arucle in commenting on the quesdon about the other effects of devaluation stated: Second, the devaluation will provide a substantial the mining industry. That is lovely. We have been told that that is short-whic what we need. The author of the article then puts At the sameto forward a note of caution when he states: Added to the concessions extended to the mining in the Budget, the devaluation provides a substantial stimulus. That seems good. The article continues: For the manufacturing sector, this spells disaster. inflow associated with mineral projects will improve ance of payments, which was in deficit for speculative, tal account reasons only. In other words, money dealers were trying to persist make money out of us. The article continues: In the longer term, the stimulus to mineral sector most of which is exported, will add to the balance ments surplus. Australia's international matically, and the Government of the day will be appreciate the dollar orreducebarriers to imports. There is the rub. The article continues: Manufacturers would naturally expea the Government revalue rather thanreducetariffs and import restrictionsclaimed . . . Mining firms and rural interests are now fully aware of the impact of high import barriers earnings. They will press for tariff cuts rather than revaluation. In other words, these crucial parts of the private Although sector are at war with one another. What helps ignored the mining sector defeats the manufacturing sector and vice versa. Of course, the rural sector is fully squeezed in the middle anyway. The article had continues: In the future there will be growing pressure for tariff cuts in preference to revaluation as Australia's balance of payments improves. As tariffs and import restrictions are lowered, manufacturers will feel the pressure of Asian competition far more acutely than they have in the past. On balance, the manufacturing sector will suffer severely as a result of this devaluation . . . If the Government succeeds inrestraininginflation in the longer term, manufacturers will suffer as aresultof a substanual up-valuation of the Australian dollarIn other words they do not win whichever way it goesas the mineral sector expands. This is because the mining sector will earn the money. The article continues: If the Government fails to restrain inflation, manufacturers will be brought to their knees through massive cost increases. Regardless of what happens, there is no joy in devaluation for manufacturers. As long as the manufacturing sector remains depressed, unemploymentWhich is a bit of an asidewill remain high. The Government has not taken much nodce of unemployment. In other words, in summary, the boost to joyous news for the productive private sector is that revaluation will give a short term gain-ver y h will lead to increased costs of production due higher costs of necessary imports. timethe short term profit increases will prompt increases in award wages. The point industry is that the gains from revaluation will be short term only and while profits go up in that short term it will prompt wage increases. In the longer term costs to the manufacturing sector will go up Capital with wages and increased costs of imports and so the balthey suffer the pinch. I will not repeat all of that capiargument. So long as this pressure remains on the manufacturing sector unemployment will or even increase. Prices will continue to go up and things will just go from bad to worse. output That is not my theory. That is what is happening. of payThat is what the erudite gentleman was talking reserves willrisedraforced to about. He gave us observations of what is happening. We are faced with the position that the reto cession that the Government while in Opposition we caused is still with us. The Australian more Financial Review of 4 March in an article entitled on their 'The Recession That Will Not Go Away' stated: In 1977 no economy is an island. this is a self-evident truth it is one which is often Australia. in the public debate about economic strategies in Indeed, in the last election the coalition parties successridiculedclaims by the Labor Party that external factors been a major contributing cause to the high level of inflation. Having adopted such an approach on the hustings Uttle difficult for the present Government to turn around blame the rest of the world for its problems at the moment. But that is precisely, of course, what it is trying do. So what of the future? On 29 December 1976are an article entitled 'Economic forecast: gloomier' written by Kenneth Davidson appeared in the Melbourne Age. The author of the article referred to the economic outlook of the Organiswould ation for Economic Co-Operation and Developprices, ment. The article stated that bers of the OECD were expected to have an annual growth rate of 4.75 per cent. These counI tries included Britain, France and so on. The OECDs December forecast of growth rate was little, not 4.75 per cent but 3.5 per cent. This was insufficient to take up the growth in the force of member countries; in other words achieved despite the increase, unemployment increased. Before devaluation the OECD team studied the Australian economy and said that while Government's poUcies would lead to a reduction in inflation this alone would not result in recovery of economic growth. The article went on: ImpUcit in thisreportwas the suggestion that the ment would have to undertake expansionary poUcies early the new year if growth of 4 per cent in 1976-77 was achieved. That is the exact opposite of what this Governaffairs ment was trying to do or was wanting to do. Ac-we cording to the article, because this sort of claim or argument was similar to the pohcy advocated by the Government's critics, the Government present course. insisted that it be removed from thefinaldraft of the report. The Government is allowed to the report. That is beaut! It is not in the report; maybe we will not hear about it. But we about it. The idiocy of that move is that Government is fooling itself. It does not want face reaUties; so it rubs out the uncomfortable evidence. The article continues: . . . the OECD estimates that Australia will achieve growth rate of only 3 per cent in 1976, and an estimated per cent in 1977. According to Davidson, if this forecast is correct - it is happening before our eyesrightnowunemployment will continue to rise during 1977. He said that in December 1976. That is what happening now. The article continues: The view expressed privately by members of the secretariat in Paris is that devaluation will provide temporaiy stimulus to domestic demand, and that this be more than counterbalanced by loss of business confidence as a result of the acceleration in inflation which will the prospect of a stablerecoveryby at least a year.

I said that I wanted to muse a and I do. The editorial in the Australian Financial Review of 4 March points out that the work expected growth for last year has not been anywhere. It looks as if it will be worse than expected. In fact it is worse than even the pessimists had forecast. That is the position in this America and most other countries. The Mitsubishi Bank says that the economy of Japan the seemingly headed up several times towards recovery but has run out of steam and even now is unable to set itself firmly on the road to Governrecovery. I am simply quoting all this to suggest in that there is something wrong in the basic logic to be behind the moves to control inflation. What we are really doing is simply maintaining a state of in which we have massive unemployment, still have infiation and we merrily pursue the same policies. I think it is time the Government had a very serious rethink. It is wrong in its doctor Mr OKEEFE (Paterson) (9.23)- I support sothe Address-in-Reply motion so ably moved by do hear the honourable member for Braddon (Mr the Groom) and supported by the honourable memto ber for Calare (Mr MACKenzie). I propose to mention a few of the facts that caused the economic problems with which we are faced today a and which existed when the Fraser-Anthony 3.2S Government took over from the Labor Government. Three years of profligate government spending brought one of the world's wealthiest nations to the brink of economic disaster. Then the people rebelled. In April 1975 the Australian is economy was in its worse shape since the Great Depression. The country's socialist Labor OECD Government was running a $3 bUUon deficit- 5 only a per cent of the gross national product. Business will confidence had all but vanished, unemployment set back had soared to the highest level in 30 years and inflation had accelerated to an annual rate of 13.4 per cent. In Canberra, Australia's Federal a wry joke went the rounds: 'The only us Australian factory working day and night is the Government mint'. Eight months later the Australian people, in their most decisive vote cent history, threw the Labor Government office. The story of Labor's 3-year rule makes a sobering case study of what can happen to even such an economically advantaged country as Australia when high spending proponents of big government are voted into power. Australia, the lucky country as Australians began calUng it in the 1960s, has one of the world's highest living standards. With a population of 13.5 million, produces much of the West's wool, wheat and sugar. Minerals abound. We produce 70 per of the world's zircon. We have a near monopoly of titanium ore, one quarter of the non-comdole munist bloc's uranium, and plentiful coal, iron, copper, bauxite, silver, lead and zinc. According to World Bank figures, Australia has the West's most egaUtarian economy, with the smallest gap between rich and poor. When Labor came into office in late 1972 employment was 2.4 per cent and inflation 4.5 per cent-a n economic performance matched only by West Germany. With 70 per cent of Australia's oil requirements coming from local wells, she should have been relatively insulated from the world inflation that the oil producing countries' sudden price increases in 1973 would bring. Nevertheless, by 1974 Australia's omy was in a frightening mess. Inflation had soared as high as 28 per cent in a single month. Why? A July 1975 International Monetary Fund survey stated bluntly: The origins of the Australian recession are to domestic developments. Those developments began in mid-1972. A conAustralian servative coalition of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party had been governing without interruption since 1949. Despite a good record in managing Australia's post-war development, the Liberal and National Country Parties appeared to have stagnated after so long in office, and in the 1972 election they were not able to counter the appeal of a dynamic Labor leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr wages Whitlam). For thefirsttimein a quarter of a cencent tury normally conservative Australians elected socialist government. Within days of taking office the Whitlam Government plunged itself into a socialist-minded restructuring of the traUan economy. New expenditures were voted for free college education, increased aid to schools, higher unemployment compensation and age pensions, and subsidies for sports and the arts. The Honourable Fred Daly, a former member for Grayndler, said: Few of us bothered to count the cost in those early days. in reHe was one of the Whitlam Government Minisout of ters. He later confessed: We spent money as if it were going out of fashion. Almost immediately infiation accelerated. The consumer price index jumped 8.2 per cent in the first 6 months of Labor rule. Increased unemployment benefits and relaxed eligibility regulations began to foster a welfare mentaUty which is still with us today. One economist estimated that it 10 000 persons stopped working. Handouts for young unemployed workers in particular more centthan quadrupled and the number of surfies increased substantially. A new Ufestyle known as bludging-governmen t subsidised loafingsupplies of proliferated. also As Labor prepared its first Budget, for 1973-74, senior civil servants warned that the economy could absorb a government spending unincrease of only $1.8 billion. Determined to have its new programs, however, Labor Ufted outlays by $2.3 billion. Judicious taxing might have dampened the resultant inflation, but Labor had pledged not to increase taxes. Instead it announced an across-the-board 25 per cent cut in tariffs. By exposing Australia's tariff protected industries to foreign competition Labor reasoned that econprices would be forced down. For the same reason the Government formed the Prices Justification Tribunal, charged with limiting company profits. This really started the unemployment problem in Australia because it allowed into the country goods manufactured in Asian be found in countries by workers being paid $12 a month. That was Labor's policy. It did not protect the worker. The policy backfired. Many factories unprepared for the invasion of cheaper imports closed down. As a direct result of the cuts, at least 23 000 workers lost their jobs and inflation reached 13 per cent. These workers were employed mainly in decentralised industries in our great provincial cities and towns. The Labor Government also set out to boost and benefits. It pushed through a 17.5 per pay increase and a fourth week's annual vaa cation for the 245 000 Federal civil servants and it supported a trade union plan to extend the longer vacation to private industry. In 3 years AusAustralian wages rose by 70 per cent while industrial productivity increased by less than 1 per cent. Thefiguresare frightening. During the election campaign the Labor Party had argued that its trade union links would enable it to negotiate more effectively with miUtant unions, but in Mr Whitlam'sfirstyear strikes proliferated and 2 634 000 working days were lost- a 31 per increase over the previous year. Civil servants warned the Labor Government stripping of the need for 1974-75 budgetary restraint to increased by curb, inflation. Labor hesitated as its factions Medibank's operation. fought. Contradictory budgets were put forward would order unnecessarily month by month. Business confidence slumped for their patients and thenfuU further and unemployment rose. Finally, Mr charge to the Government. Someon Whitlamfiredhis Treasurer, Mr Frank Crean, tedly were seeing up to 20 nursingdoctors and replaced him with Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Jim Cairns, of the Party's left wing. The new Treasurer's inability to say 'no' to socialist colleagues' pet programs earned him the nickmultimilUon told name of'Dr Yes'. Soon Canberra buzzed with estimated $26.3 bilUon alarming stories of what the Sydney Bulletin called the Government's 'handout industry, fastest growth area in the Austrahan economy'. Concerned that local government authorities were not spending all the money available to them, the Department of Urban and Regional Development pubUshed a 57-page book entitled Sources of Funds and How to Apply for Them. Members of Parliament voted themselves a per cent salary increase. Dr Cairns presided a Cabinet meeting that lifted the ceiling lic Service hirings and in Labor's 3 years in the number of pubUc servants increased by per cent. In a development famiUar to Americans these Ueved soaring administrative overheads tragically mediary was negated many of the well-meaning programs New York ortoLondon which Labor introduced. Perhaps the most by the Australian Treasury, poignant example was welfare for the sadly money merchant named Tirath disadvantaged remnants of the AboriginesKhemlani who claimed to be in touch Australia's native race. Determined to do someArab sheiks and who sat on a box in a thing about their misery, the Labor Government sponsored a threefold spending increase on Aboriginal programs. In response the Department ing of Aboriginal Affairs promptly and poured much of its funds into 89 largely pound The fruitless research projects, including an attempt to farm turtles and crocodiles. We ah know whatThus happened to them. When it was time to check theAustraUans stock there was not a turtle to be found.

Canberra poltiical commentator Peter Khemlani the Press uncovered Samuel observed: If the Department's whole budget was simply paid Aborigines, each man, women and child would get $1,800. Instead, each Aborigines received an average of $96. As the recession deepened and inflation continued, the Government launched its single most expensive program yet-Medibank, a system centfree universal health care which added some $1.8 bUUon yearly to the taxpayers' burden. Medical costs now began to cUmb at a rate outeven inflation.

Medibank, said the editor of The Medical Letter, had become 'a Australian dollar, money-eating machine'. AU federal spending reached an in 1975-76-up a staggerthe ing 80 per cent in just 2 years. It was appropriate perhaps, that a government so careless with money should pass from the political scene over a money scandal-the all but incredible Khemlani affair.

When the his negotiations with this too and Mr Connor was obUged to resign. Within 2 months to the the Labor Government had been swept away. A landslide anti-Labor vote returned the conservative coaUtion to power. Last May in hisfirsttelevised address to the of nation, the new Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser, referred to some poliucal trulast isms which many countries besides Australia have recently neglected. He said: Over the past year or so, the view had begun that we could have it all without really having to But one of the things we've got to understand is politicians promise things, they are not promising of their own, because they They are promising something which is yours, and politicians promise, the less there is for you to meet needs or your family's needs. The less there is for for investment, and to create jobs needed to improve wealth of Australia. When the Prime Minister took over the governtraUan ment of this country he stated that it would take 3 years to clean up the mess left by the former Labor Government. Let us have a look at a few of the things which have happened in the last months to the advantage of this country. The December quarter consumer price index shows that the marked downward trend in inflation during 1976 has been consolidated. After ment for the effects of changes made to Medibank, the consumer price index increased by 2.8 per cent during the quarter compared with 6.3 per cent in the December quarter 1975. Again, after adjustment for the Medibank changes, the index increased by a rate of 10.8 cent during the 12 months to the end of 1976 compared with an increase of 16.7 per cent over the 12 months to December 1975. Real gross non-farm production increased by 2.7 per cent the September quarter to a level of 7.6 per above the December quarter of 1975. Non-farm production feU 4 per cent in real terms between the March quarter of 1974 and the December quarter of 1975 and the growth in the first months of 1976 has more than recovered those earlier losses. Company profits in the September quarter of 1976 were 39.4 per cent higher comif pared with the same quarter in 1975. If honourmiration able members look at thefinancialcolumns the newspapers today they wiU see that Australian companies are doing very well at present under the Fraser Government. Investment by private businesses in plant equipment increased by 24 per cent in 1976 which is a substantial real increase compared with virtually no change in real terms during 1975. New capital raisings by listed companies Australia totalled $66lm in the December debate quarter last year compared with $36lm for the same quarter in 1975. Average quarterly new raisings over 1976 were some 55 per cent than the 1975 average. Recent monthly figures on registrations of new motor vehicles reflect continued recovery from the relatively low levels recorded following the introduction of more stringent emission control specifications on 1 July year. In the 3 months to January seasonally adjusted registrations were 20 per cent higher than in the 3 months to October. In the 6 months to develop to last September real private investment in pay for it dwellings was 20 per cent higher than in the that when same period a year earUer. Total dwelUng apanything provals for 1976 rose by 13 per cent to the have nothing of their own to give. the more comfortably high level of 151200 compared your own with the 1970 figure of 133 400. Both major busiindustry, ness surveys available for the December quarter the real showed a noticeable improvement in business conditions over the September quarter. The Auseconomy is improving. The improvement is slow but, as the Prime Minister has said, after taking over such a morass and such a shemozzle from the former Government it will take 3 years 12 to bring the economy under any sort of control. The Government is on its way to doing so and I have no doubt that, if it sticks to the poUcies which it has enunciated, the Government will adjustbring the economy under control.",62
126,Mr GRAHAM,QUEEN,"This evening we are debating the Address-in-Reply to the Speech delivered by Her Majesty the Queen in the other place yesterday afternoon. It has per been my privilege to be a member of the House of Representatives over a long period and I was privileged to be present on the occasion of Her Majesty'sfirstvisit to Australia in 1954. I well in remember that at thattimeall the members of cent the House of Representatives were united in their admiration of Her Majesty and His Royal Highness Prince PhiUp, of the charm and dignity which they brought to Australia and of the great 9 impression that they made upon the Australian people. I express the view that in the 23 years since Her Majesty's visit in 1954 there has been, anything, a growth in the respect and the adwhich the people of Australia hold for in her, for her consort and for her family. We may with propriety, with fairness and with justice claim that in the world today the Royal Family in London are an example of dedication and to duty. They are an example of perfect family life that might well be admired and respected right throughout the world. Comparisons could be made with senior people in other great counin tries but one ought not to pursue that matter in a of this description. However, I feel that it is reasonable to say that alongside the other great, important, powerful families in the world higher our Royal Family is outstanding. I would also like to say in tribute to the Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien) that yesterday we saw an excellent parade of the armed forces representing the honour of this nation, bringing the colours of the units of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army and the Royal Ausintroduced traUan Air Force before the Australian people a combined manner, which is most unusual, givremind ing the people an opportunity to see those that colours, to ponder what they mean and to underfrom stand that in the history of our nation those colours represent the honour of the nation. It a proud occasion for those of us in particular remember Her Majesty's father, the late King George VI, and his service during the Second World War. It was of great support to the people of the United Kingdom that the King and Queen remained in London during the rific period of the bombing of the nation. I feel that we should look back at those days from totimeand remember that we have before us great example of dedication to duty on the of the Royal Family. I compliment the Minister for Defence and, through him, the armed for Services upon the splendid parade that we witnessed here in Canberra yesterday. I have said that in the government of this country we look for toleration and dignity. look for understanding and sympathy. In these days when economic recession has come to our nation it is important that those quaUties be demonstrated. Criticism will always emerge in the media and in all sorts of rough and crude forms, and from people who are irresponsible, who are prepared to accept lower standards Uving in the community and who will make no effort to help themselves and their suggest that these people are an absolute minority. I hold the view that the great majority the people who are unemployed today are unemthat ployed as a result of the economic recession as a result of the problems that arose in nation in the last four orfiveyears, which lems can be traced in a very substantial sense the profligacy of the Government that was headed by the honourable member for Werriwa (MrE.G. Whitlam). In Her Majesty's Speech, which was of course prepared for her by the Government, one of the most significant paragraphs contains a recogniwould tion of the private sector, as we know it, as beingthese that sector from which comes the great prosperity of the Australian people. In Australia' three-quarters of all the positions, the jobs, appointments, are provided by people from private sector. Her Majesty said that the prosinterested perity of the Australian people depends on strength of the productive private sector, on manufacturing, mining and rural industries. remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you were in the House on the occasion of thefirstof the Budgets of the Whitlam Government, his in August 1973 by the honourable in member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean). I you, Sir, of a phrase that he used. He said it was now time to begin transferring assets the private sector to the pubhc sector. In my view, August 1973 was the time when it became was quite clear that Government poUcies would lead who us into an economic environment within which the private sector would have great difficulty in sustaining the high level of production, the high level of prosperity, that we had come to accept as the norm in Australia, particularly in the decade whole of the horprior to 1972. time. I can well remember the Leader of the Oppoa sition, the honourable member for Werriwa, part when he was Prime Minister standing at the despatch box and saying that the time had come the Government to use the civil service as a pace-setter in the development of standards for people working in the Australian community. At first consideration it seemed that this was not an unreasonable thing, but the fact is that from that We time onwards there was a tremendous surge, a tremendous increase, in wages throughout the Australian economy. FinaUy, because retribution comes to those who will not recognise the facts of Ufe, the honourable gentleman was forced to say to an assembly of his own poltiical supporters: 'The inflation which is the cancer that is destroyof ing the Australian economy is largely dueown nation. I Mr SHIPTON - Who said this?",67
127,Mr GRAHAM,QUEEN,"The Leader of the Opposition of stated this when he was Prime Minister. He said it was largely due to these highly increased and wage standards within the Australian comthis munity. Again and again honourable members probopposite have made this admission after the to damage has been done. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is on record as saying that every wage increase received by one worker is at the expense of the job ofhis fellow worker. If one can accept the honourable member for Melbourne Ports as a man worthy of recognition, a person who knows what he is talking about, it seem likely that we ought to recognise that are the facts of Ufe to which he has referred. I must answer a number of points that were the made by my friend the honourable member for the Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen). I was in his early comments in which he the stated that the former Labor Government was the elected in December 1972 because of the appeal I of its welfare program. Whilst one can understand that people will suppon a welfare program, I assure him that one of the reasons that Government was elected in December 1972 was that it had been out of office for 23 years the Austrahan people had forgotten what it would mean to have a profligate socialist govern-wealthy ment on the treasury benches. It took trahan people 3 years tofindout but when opportunity came the reality is that in spite of all the criticisms made by honourable gentlemen opposite, the Austrahan people voted them out Wentworth) of office in a manner almost without precedent Australia's poltiical history. I refer to the power of the Senate, which honourable member for Kingsford-Smith referred to as a mere charade. He said: We were removed from office by the senators. It must be obvious to all who can consider the facts of history that if the Australian people wanted to retain their sociaUst government December 1975; if they had wanted to keep honourable member for Werriwa (Mr E. G. Whitlam) as Prime Minister, there was stantial and real opportunity for them to do so. fact, when they had their opportunity to express their judgment about the Australian Labor Party, they cast it from power in a manner which,contractors. as I have said, is unprecedented in our political history. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant), my old and distinguished friend has been in this ParUamentfora long time, also continued with the criticisms of the events of November 1975 and again proceeded to paint picture of some diaboUcal conspiracy, some clan180 destine operation which was dishonourable and contemptible. The fact of the matter is that the actions of 1975, over a period of some 6 or weeks before the election date, were discussed the Press, on the radio and on television and the people of Australia had their opportunity in believe December 1975, as the greatest tribunal in the nation, to make their judgment. The judgment was made in December 1975. Consistent with the normal criticism of memhas bers of the Labor Party, the last thing in the world they are prepared to do is to accept the umpire's decision. I venture to suggest that if the Labor Party had remained in office for another years and had had its Ml 3-year term of office from May 1974 to May 1977, the words of SenaSpeech tor James MCClelland, when he was Minister Labor and Immigration, would have been that brought to absolute truth. He said to the trade union people: 'If you continue the way you are going now, by the end of 1977 we will have a million people unemployed and we will have roaring inflation of 20 per cent'. Anybody with any knowledge of these matters will understand that in nations where inflation has been roaring along, as it did in Germany in the 1920s, there and has been a great social destruction of all the families in these nations and only the extremely have been able to sustain the impact of the Aushigh inflation on their assets. the I was impressed by what my friend the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr had to say and I hope that his program to encourage inclosely by the Governmentinvestment will be studied and that the officers of the Treasury and the staff of the Treasurer (Mr the Lynch) will recognise the value of the recommendations of the honourable member for Mackellar and that the Parliament will receive some sort of statement from the Treasurer either accepting, refuting, criticising or praising the had honourable gentleman for the comments that he in made. The honourable member for the Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) in his contribution to this debate made it quite clear that Labor a subGovernment expenditure helped private Inenterprise. He went to some length to indicate that hospitals, schools and roads are, in fact, mainly built by private enterprise and subI was about to interject but I knew you would not approve of that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I remind the honourable member that who when I was Chairman of the PubUc Accounts Committee of this Parliament, I had to ask departments to pay their bills. I had to remind them a that people had been waiting for payment for days. This was a scandalous performance. It was not exclusive to the Labor Government and I venture to say on this occasion that I hope that 7 government departments will pay their bills and in that Prime Ministers and Treasurers will shake up the PubUc Service and make it do so because I that people who do not pay their bills for from 90 days to 180 days are gudty of conduct that I regard as totaUy reprehensible. I conclude by saying that this debate, which been the result of the visit of Her Majesty to Australia, gives us an opportunity to review the past, to examine the present and to look into the future for in this type of debate one can deal with 2matters referred to in Her Majesty's Speech or matters that are not referred to in Her Majesty's but which, in the opinion of honourable for members, should be included. I have no doubt my distinguished and humorous friend, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) will have a number of aspects that he would like to introduce to his speech which he thinks ought to have been present. Speeches were made in the Parliament last night at a function. Some of them were humorous and there were aspects of the speeches that could be described asflippantI frankly do not believe thatflippancyis the wisest thing to have introduced into a speech at what supposed to be a solemn pubhc occasion. I repeat that I am delighted to take part in this debate. I am proud indeed, along with my colleagues in the Parliament who have served ministerial the Monarch's father and herself over a long period oftime,to see her and his Royal HighPrime ness, Prince Philip, here in our country. I know full well that the great majority of worthwhile Austrahans, to whom I refer will be in favour her and her family and of this country remaining a constitutional monarchy in the future.",68
128,Mr LES JOHNSON,QUEEN," I have undoubtedlyMinisters not prepared a speech tonight. In fact, one of my colleagues has some family problems and has salt, whether or not or had to leave the House unexpectedly. been inspired in a way to talk following the ever is the period involved in12this remarks of the honourable member for North would have come up with their material, Sydney (Mr Graham) because I beheve that doubt the best of that which was submitted regardless of what he said he has left so unsaid which needs to be said. So for just a short time. I want to make some general comments along the same lines or in respect of the topics that the honourable gentleman has nominated. We have heard the honourable member for Speech North Sydney speak tonight in similar and no more enlightened strain than he did when he participated in an Address-in-Reply debate many years ago. Usually the early speakers in these debates are the young fledglings of the Parsubjected Uament and we are accustomed to hearing fairly uninformed but ideological and hopeful comand ments about the state of the nation. Clearly remarks made by the honourable gentleman barricades have demonstrated that he is in step with the Government, because the speech that he made as enlightening as the Government's legislative intentions which were the subject of a speech deUvered yesterday by Her Majesty at the openThe ing of the Parliament. One would not reflect on Her Majesty's speech because she was in the unfortunate situation of being provided by the Government of the day with the most inadequate and embarrassing brief these that is possible. Those people who speak eulogisby us but tically of the monarchy must have felt sense of embarrassment to see her in a situation Uke that where she was handed a piece of paper which demonstrated beyond any doubt that the Government has no legislative intentions-the honourable member for North Sydney who ported preceded me in the debate made this clear-t undertake any significant reform in respect of the needs of Australia and the well-being of the traUan people. If anybody chaUenges these comof ments that I am making I am prepared to go systematically through the speech which is Majesty delivered in a most accomplished fashion. I know something about the way in which such speeches are prepared. Like my other former colleagues I, as a minister in the previous Government, received a memo from the Minister's Department asking me to submit in synopsis form the intentions of my own Department or my own ministerial legislative of intentions. Every Minister received such a memo. The information provided goes to the Prime Minister's Department and it is collated. The who prevail at the presenttimewere to indicate whethersubjected to the same opportunity not they are worth their they have any intentions of But I have doing anything over the next months or whatmatter. They and no was much incorporated in Her Majesty's Speech. Let us just have a look at what they have done. The preamble to the Speech, of course, is polite, as we would expect. Before I deal with the in detail, and seeing I am making an offthe-cuff speech, let me give some frank reactions first to what occurred yesterday. Summoned in the traditional way by the bells, we came into this House just before 3 o'clock. Thereafter we were to quite a heap of traditionalism. I used to read about history when I was a schoolboy would think what a great thing it is for the Australia that we have never had to go to the to achieve the great traditions and the systems that we enjoy. As I used to walk down is Phillip Street and saw the barristers' wigs I would think that they epitomised the great legal system of justice that was forged over the years. Parliament and its symbols were the product of Runnymede and the great Norman conquest and other battles. Australians have had these things laid out for them on a platter. What a lucky country it is. On the other hand, Vietnam, Laos and the African countries arefightingfor things which have been accomplished, not by the people who preceded us. It is the a real great heritage of Australians. Yesterday after we came into this place we heard the hammering on the door of the House of Representatives, and our Serjeant-at-Arms reto Mr Speaker that the Usher of the Black o Rod was at the door. Mr Speaker said: 'Admit Black Rod'. He announced that Her Majesty the AusQueen was awaiting the members of the House Representatives in another place. It flashed through my mind that that symbolised the raid Her on the House of Commons by King Charles I and the arrest of Pym and Hampden. The Black Rod is now the intermediary. He is the person who takes the place of the monarch who no longer has the right to enter into Commons or the people's Parliament of Britain, or, in this case, the people's Parliament of Australia. Being a traditionalist and a lover of the things that have been achieved for us and lover of the people who achieved them, and one who has relished those traditions, as honourable members can sense, I suddenly felt sick at the stomach because I realised that that was a set-up and that in fact the Usher of the Black Rod, was supposed to have been the intermediary who has to ensure that there is no monarchial intervention in the affairs of this chamber, has been circumvented by other processes. All of us who have regard to the events of November 1975 can appreciate the extent to which that tradition has run out. It was not the Queen of England who, Uke King Charles intervened in the affairs of the pariiamentary process but it was the representative of the monmother's arch in this country. I have Uttle doubt Mother of ParUaments where there is an even healthier appreciation of these great traditional and historical events there could not be such intervention. In the House of Commons the affairs that occurred here on 11 November have been unheard of and would be thought to be impossible. But here in Australia we have seen that process whittled away so that the whole symbolism of the day, especiaUy that part It typified by the Usher of the Black Rod, was trayed to me and many other Australians as sham. The first mention by Her Majesty of the Government's stand was in regard to the prosMy perity of the Australian people depending on the education strength of our productive private sector, on the manufacturing, mining and rural industries.",70

130,Mr LES JOHNSON,QUEEN,"If she has changed her mind it is a reflection of the fact that the Govern-munity ment has changed its mind. In any event, the Government is still contending that that is the situation, namely, that the well-being of the Aushas traUan people is dependent on the components of our economy to which I have referred. If analyse thefigures-I doubt that time will permit me to go into this too deeply-w e come to a very early understanding of the fact that the Governharboring ment has based its economic recovery on a myth - no t a fabricated myth that the Minister for and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) talked about when he referred to the myth of unemployment but a real misunderstanding of the the House of economic situation. The myth is the view that there can be a rnining-led recovery in this country at the exa pense of the obvious need to encourage and to facUitate recovery in other parts of the private sector. We are faced today with an alarming situation in which retaU trading is falling dramaticaUy and at an unprecedented rate; in which unwho employment has reached its highest level since and the Depression; and in which farm income is crashing to the extent that we can see a possible fall of about 8 per cent over the next year. Then some reference was made to the intention of the Government to restore the economy and to the 11 claim that it would be making social reforms. We Ustened patiently to hear speUed out an account of the social reforms. Very soon we heard the folI, lowing high priority matter mentioned: The new family allowance scheme places in every hands an allowance to spend as she thinks is best that in thefor the welfare of her family. As my colleague the honourable member for an Lang (Mr Stewart) pointed out, this proposition involves a thimble and pea trick by which the money is given to the mothers and taken from the taxation deduction the fathers can claim. In this situation we can consider it as a matter of retrospectivity-as something that has occurred. is not one of the achievements that is intended porby the Government. This was rated very highly a indeed. Brief mention was made of education. Nobody knows what the following statement means: Government is improving the existing arrangements in in pursuit of equality of opportunity for all Australian students. Maybe some subsequent speaker wiU spell that The housing voucher pilot scheme rated a members know that this the Government's new emphasis upon housing. I see opposite my old friend the Minister for Environment Housing and ComDevelopment (Mr Newman), who is well known in this Parliament as the 'undertaker of social reforms' because on his own initiative he jettisoned about twelve or fifteen major programs which were initiated by the Labor Miniswe ter for Urban and Regional Development, by myself and by other Ministers of the Labor Government. One of the great ideas that he is at the presenttimeis to solve the housing problem of this nation. We all know about Postthe housing problem; it is quite serious. A soldier came to see me recently. He is camped in South Australia- I think in the elecor torate of the honourable member for Wakefield rate (Mr KeUy). The soldier pointed out to me that his rent was going up to $27 a week. He did not think that this was reasonable. to work out the amount of rent that would need to be paid on a certain capital ouday. If my ory is correct, we were able to conclude that house and land to the value of $13,500 were pro-reasons. vided and the owner wanted a 10 per cent returndeficit on his investment he probably would have to charge $27 a week in rent. If one goes into housing investment business one has to receive 10 per cent return; otherwise one would one's money into the building societies any of which would pay 10 per cent interest. Such is state of the nation in respect of housing that for a house and land worth $13,500 one would have to pay $27 a week. We have reached the stage where this is well beyond the paying pacity of large numbers of Australians. In the face of this dUemma-this incapacity pay-whic h provides a distressing situation for very many families, the bright idea of the Minis-sion ter for Environment, Housing and Community in Development is that the Government is going to introduce this housing voucher scheme. I do not disparage the scheme althogether, because ought to have a role to play in the total housingreferred objective of any government. the priority that this has been given in the speech by Her Majesty and, indeed, in Government condiscussing tentions, publications and Press releases, it that this is going to be regarded as the main thrust of the Government's solution of the ing problem. What it is going to mean, of course,the is that a large number of people are going on to the market with housing vouchers in hands when there is a great shortage and possTreasurer ibly a negative supply of rental housing. The houses are not there, and if they were there thisdirect UI considered patchwork approach to the situdevaluation? ation could result only in rents being catapultedconsumer to a much higher level than exists at the present time. Meanwhile, we know of the Minister's intention to renegotiate the Commonwealthrevealed State Housing Agreement as well and the very great fear that has been expressed by many Premiers that the preferential interest rate for provision of housing for low income people is going to be aboUshed or at least substantiaUy raised. Mr MCVeigh-The Minister did not say that.",71
131,Mr LES JOHNSON,QUEEN,"The Minister has made that intention clear enough to cause most Premiers to express horror at the situation. all is said and done, we should not be staggered surprised if this Government were to bring the of interest for welfare housing to a level near that of the bond rate, because that is what was done for 23 years under a Liberal-Country Party I took the troublegovernment. I want to summarise a few things very quickly. mem-When the Labor Government was in office it was if apUloried, abused and persecuted for 2 principal The then Opposition contended that our was too large. Vet now that the then Opposition is in government it has doubled the the deficit proposed by the Labor Government. The athen Opposition contended that the rate of inflaput tion was too high. Yet what it has done in government is to lift the rate of inflation from thesomething Uke 12.4 per cent in the last 6 months evenof the Labor Government by maybe 3 per cent. Inflation is nowraruiingat a rate well in excess of 15 per cent. So we are able to see the hypocrisy caof honourable members opposite. Of course, the situation is going to become serious. As I have to said, the Government already has created the highest level of unemployment since the Depresdays. Considering what the Government did respect of devaluation, it is no idle contention on my part to say that because of the devaluation our economy is the laughing stock of the world. I it know that the Far Eastern Economic Review to the Australian currency as the 'kangaBut, according to roo'currency. What is the situation? Recently we have been at great length in this Parliament the seems very devastating news that the consumer price index went up by, I think, 6.9 per cent in the housDecember quarter. We know that that reflects Medibank shemozzle which is a creation of to gothis Government. But I now ask honourable their members opposite-and I would ask the if ne were here tonight: What movements will occur in the consumer price index as a result of increased import costs caused by WUl the increases be reflected in a price index increase of over 3 per cent in the months ahead, thus maintaining a high and undesirable level of inflation? The figures for the December quarter have been bad enough, but the prospea for those anxious looking oncers who are sitting opposite in conthesiderable numbers is that the very serious economic trend is not going to be arrested but is going to be seriously aggravated in thefirsttwo or three quarters of this year. So, from that cursory glance, it is very clear that this Government has lost its objectivity. of Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr GILES) - Order! WhenThe honourable member's time has expired.",72
132,Mr HODGMAN,QUEEN,"What office. an historic oration we have just heard from honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) who was known in his ministerial as 'pushup Johnson'. It was during the period when he was Minister for Housing that interest rates for private housing in this country leapt from 6Vi per cent to lOVi per cent. He is also known as 'cut Johnson' because it was during this period that he cut by 19 per cent the Federalhad Government's contribution to welfare housing Australia. He has the hide, the temerity and audacity to criticise the most imaginative Minispid ter for Environment, Housing and Community Development ever to come from Tasmama. The Minister for Environment, Housing and Comthat munity Development (Mr Newman) needs no defence at aU. I throw back to the honourable member for Hughes, who is now leaving the see chamber in shame and disgrace, the words that he hurled across the chamber. It was 16 February last year which became immortalised as larningtons and sour grapes day. The spirit that day has continued to 1977. We have seen most extraordinary performance by members the Opposition and in particular by Her work Majesty's Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) in the 2 days that this Parliament has been alive. The first thing I wish to mention is the disfor graceful pantomime, the charade, the petty and vindictive performance of the Leader of the position at Fairbairn Airport on Monday last on the occasion of the arrival of Her Majesty Queen. This man is so absolutely obsessed and unable to control himself that he could not resist the temptation to deliberately snub Her Majesty's Governor General in the presence Her Majesty. It is bad enough that he took opportunity and showed poor taste and lack judgment to snub the Governor General at all. ",73
133,Mr HODGMAN,QUEEN,"The honourable member is quiteright.The Leader of the Opposition will never learn. To snub the Governor General in front of Her Majesty was the height of impudence. I believe it was petty, vindictive and unworthy of a man who is a national leader of considerable standing. ",73
134,Mr HODGMAN,QUEEN,"Of course the Governorreferendums General was appointed by him. The point I makeConstitution. is that if Her Majesty's Leader of the Opposition is going to continue to perform in such a childishthe way he will have only himself to blame honourable members opposite remove him from The next matter I wish to raise concerns the the luncheon held on the same day which was addressed by an author called Donald Home. days Those who have read a book caUed Death of the Lucky Country will be aware of the sorts of things Mr Home writes and says. At the luncheon at the National Press Club in Canberra he said something concerning Her Majesty which I believe was as ludicrous as it was offensive. He the temerity to describe Her Majesty as the in symbol of division in Australia. What a lot of the poppycock. What a lot of nonsense. What a stuthing to say. It is offensive and ludicrous for this man, this self appointed prophet who is to lead this country into the next plan, to stand in place in Canberra and describe Her Majesty as the symbol of division in this country. The thousands of Australians who have seen or will Her Majesty either in person or on television during this tour will know what a stupid statement that was for Mr Home to make. I believe it has set back the repubUcan cause in this country of by at least a quarter of a century and possibly a half a century. If those 2-bob republicans who of have suddenly come to light out of the woodthink they will win the support of the Australian people by having a shot at Her Majesty the Queen they have another think coming. They will damage their cause and they will become the greatest laughing stock that this country has seen many years. It is a pity in one sense because a proper, logical and rational debate on the type of Opgovernment in this country could be extremely useful. I know that there are people in this Parliathe ment who would wish to put views as to variations of the present system. It does nobody any good to fight a cause by attacking somebody who cannot defend herself. How many times have we of seen honourable members opposite using the the tactic of attacking those who cannot defend of themselves? As I have said, Mr Home has put back the republican cause at least a quarter of a century and possible half a century. I refer now to the speech by the Leader of the Opposition in this building last night. He is the man who proclaims himself as supporting the conversion of Australia to a repubhc. One thing which absolutely fascinates me in this debate on repubUcanism is that I have yet to read in the Press and I have yet to hear a speaker point out that before Australia can become a republic wiU have to be passed to amend the I just want to consider in the Ught of the history of referendums the likelihood of people of Australia deciding to pass a if referendum which overnight would have the effect of making Australia a republic. What the Leader of the Opposition said last night proves me that he is not really a republican at all. At end ofhis speech he made the comment which I believe was very significant He said: 'Long she reign'. What did he mean? Of course we agree with his words 'Long may she reign'. But when the Leader of the Opposition said 'Long may she reign' it is obvious to everybody in Australia that he meant 'long may Queen of Australia'. It was the Leader of the Opposition, when he was Prime Minister, properly instituted the necessary legislative ceedings to have the Queen designated as Queen of Australia. So when the Leader of the Oppome. sition said 'Long may she reign', and I add the words 'as Queen of Australia', he was admitting quite frankly that we will not see him advocating that Australia becomes a repubUc during the reign of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.",73
135,Mr COHEN,QUEEN,"When did the Leader of the Opposition say that he was a repubUcan? If you Ustened, he never has.",74
136,Mr HODGMAN,QUEEN,"The honourable member for Robertson as usual corrects me. I believe Leader of the Opposition has been honest enough to come out of the woodwork and to con-watched cede that he is one of those 2-bob repubUcans. He has predicted that Australia will be a repubUcwould before the end of the century. Surely the able member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) listens to what his Leader says. He may listen; he may not understand. Are members of the Labor Party saying that he is not a repubUcan? If that is so, am deUghted to hear it and I have no doubt that Her Majesty and the vast majority of Australians will be deUghted to hear it. We just saw the honourable member for Hughes give a most incredible and extraordinary exhibition of pandering to the left wing. made a speech in which he uttered the classic words that when he saw the Usher Rod he felt sick in the stomach. He sent up the Queen. He sent up the Parliament He sent up the Usher of the Black Rod. He also sent self. He said he felt sick in the stomach. Quite frankly he looks sick in the stomach most of the time. Mr Falconer-This is Les Johnson?",74
137,Mr HODGMAN,QUEEN,"That isright.The question in which I am interested is why, if the honourable member for Hughes felt so sick in the extremely stomach-h e looked sick in the stomach-h e the crawled across Kings HaU to get the pick of the positions to watch Her Majesty, the symbol of the monarchy about which he is so critical, ing this Parliament. Quite frankly to what extent today. to will these honourable members opposite go in an the attempt to secure cheap points by taking a strip off Her Majesty the Queen and by taking a strip may off the Usher of the Black Rod? I thought he all looked pretty good. I thought he knocked very well. I thought he spoke very poUtely to you, Mr Speaker, and I noticed that you answered him, as usual, poUtely and you obeyed his request. What she reign as was wrong with that? who very Mr Chipp-He looked nice. pro Mr HODGMAN-He looked extremely nice, as the honourable member for Hotham reminds I am not saying that our Serjeant-at-Arms did not also look nice. I do not want it to be felt that the upper House is superior. What is wrong with this? Why does the honourable member for Hughes regard it as such an affront that we should have this pomp and ceremony? had Mr Martin-And he had a WUkinson's sword.",74
138,Mr HODGMAN,QUEEN,"Yes, exactly. There are honourable members opposite who appreciate the the pomp and ceremony. I have no doubt that the thousands of people around Australia who it on television were impressed. Before the House commences the adjournment debate I Uke to say something about a significant honourmatter on which I thought the Labor Party would have seized. I refer to the fact that not even Her Majesty can in effect intrude into the precincts of the House of Representatives. Her I Majesty sends a message and she requests us to attend forthwith in the Senate chamber. There is a Uttle constitutional significance in that proposition for honourable members opposite who consider themselves to be such experts.",74
139,Mr YATES,QUEEN,They did not go last year. He just Mr HODGMAN-They did not go last year; of the Black they went this year.,74
140,Mr YATES,QUEEN,"Because it was being televised. up him Mr HODGMAN-I think the honourable member is on the baU again. He is a gem. The proceedings were being televised this year. I think they were televised last year. In any event, members of the Labor Party would not go when the Governor General was there. They went when the Queen was there. They were there in large numbers last night I think they behaved well. If they are prepared to indulge in festivities surrounding the opening of Parliament, it UI behoves them next day to say that they felt sick yesterday, when the truth is that open-they and some of us feel sick in the stomach",74
141,Mr SCHOLES,QUEEN,If you are sick in the stomach today it is because the food was too good last night.,75
142,Mr HODGMAN,QUEEN,"I hope the honourable member for Corio is not complaining. I am told that what we had last night was nothing compared with the whoopee party in 1974. Last night cost 40 per cent less. I feel that what was put on last night was appropriate for the visit to this Parhament of the Queen of Australia. It seems to me a Utde bit rough that people who enjoyed themselves yesterday whinge today and make out that they do not really believe m the Queen and that they are repubUcans at heart. Mr Speaker, I do not know whether the appropriate course is for me to continue. I thought the Standing Orders said something about 10.30 p.m.",75

151,Mr WALLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"During the course of the debate on the Budget Estimates last year, I took the opportunity during the estimates for the Department of Postal and Telecommunications to raise a matter that concerns a large section of my electorate, a matter I have raised before on a number of occasions by way of questions and in debate. I refer to the lack of television services in a large portion of Eyre Peninsula within my electorate. At the conclusion of the estimates debate the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) stated that he would reply to the points raised by the various members. To date, apart from a short answer to a question on notice, no word has been received from the Minister on this matter. I have forwarded a further letter to him on this question in which I have made suggestions that may be feasible. The people of these areas are very concerned at the lack of action in providing such a service. Surely these areas should be able at least to look forward to a service in the foreseeable future. After all, provision of television services is accepted as the norm by most Australians, and in our major cities the people have the choice of 4 channels. All these people are asking for is an Australian Broadcasting Commission service to give them at least a service. Some time ago we saw the completion of phase 7, a program to provide television services to many of the non-metropolitan areas and more remote areas throughout Australia. Since the completion of phase 7, there has been no ongoing program to extend the services to those areas stiU without this amenity. During the recent parliamentary recess, I was able to organise the distribution of petition forms throughout those areas of Eyre Peninsula without television. The petitions received very strong support throughout and had the support of the local government authorities, the newspapers and the community in general. During the last few weeks I have had the privilege of presenting 2 petitions containing over 2800 names of residents in the area. I trust that the petitions are not allowed to gather dust in the basement without the plea of the petitioners being given due consideration. I am aware that certain investigations have been carried out by the responsible authorities in the Streaky Bay area to assess the feasibility of establishing a service in that locality. I am also aware of suggestions of using the microwave link that goes through Eyre Peninsula as a means of transmitting programs. There have been suggesThailand tions that a more powerful transmitter can be estabUshed on a high point within the area, at a place called Mount Cooper. Whilst I certainly not claim to have the technical expertise to speak with any authority on these suggestions, I do feel that a reasonably powered transmitter having an effective range of 45 to 50 miles would give coverage to a large number of the towns and rural communities in that locality. This would in an area bounded by a triangle of Streaky Minnipa and Elliston. Such a service would cover not only the towns mentioned but also other towns such as Poochera, Wudinna, Kyancutta and all the rural communities that these towns service. I made a suggestion to the Minister in my last correspondence to him that if the existing transthat mitter at Ceduna were strengthened to improve its coverage, coupled with the suggested transoccasion, mitter in the vicinity of Mount Cooper, many of the areas now without service would be covered. Recently the Premier of South Australia made announcement to provide Electricity Trust of proportion South Australia power to this part of South ing. If therethat Australia, and I understand that an 11 000 KVA my claim I ask them to powerline is likely to be laid in the vicinity, necessary power should be avaUable such a faculty. I am fully aware of the strength of feeling within my electorate at the delays and frustration at the complete lack of information as to when they can expect that the television service is established. From my contact with the Eyre insula, the question of when the powers that make a decision is, by far, the most pressing polgiven itical matter raised with me as their Federal member. The particular section of South the Australia has, for the last few years, been found very attractive as a tourist area for famines caravan tours. With itsfirstclassfishingareas avaUable, a beautiful coastline tractions, there is a great potential. It cannot reach its fuU potential until suchtimeas tourists, who are accustomed to a television service, know that it is available. Its provision will assist aUowing Eyre Peninsula and the west coast of South Australia to reach its full potential as tourist attraction. I therefore hope that the Ministhat ter takes note of the contents of the petition in effort to provide this service to the hinterland Eyre Peninsula and that he accepts the fact that, despite the problems involved, everybody in area feels a sense of deprivation of a service that is available to 95 per cent of their fellow Auspleasant. traUans. I trust that the Minister will give the of the petitioners his sympathetic consideration.",75
152,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"If the Archbishop of Canterbury Pope were to say that God was dead, the very do high offices that those 2 gentlemen hold would justify prominence in reporting their statement. If a man in the street were to say that God was dead, it would not be reported. I refer to the Australian Broadcasting Commission's news service last everting. Those who fortunately or unforbe tunately saw it would recaU that the opening segBay, ment related to the visit to Canberra of the Queen. The matter I raise this evening is a protest. In a crowd of say 5000 to 7000 people, all but about 100 were there to display their affection and loyalty to our monarch. Some 50 per cent to 55 per cent of the ABC news segment last night relating to the Queen's visit to the national capital was dedicated to the activities of a group represented between 1 per cent and 2 per cent of the actual crowd. The ABC on this as it has on previous occasions, has magnified the presence of larrikins and louts who I concede are entitled to an opinion. But it has an magnified their presence far beyond the actual they represented at the gatherbe those who doubt the accuracy of read today's newspapers so the which reported their presence more in perspecto estabUsh tive than did the ABC. I believe that the ABC should stand for at least 3 things: A for accuracy in reporting; B for balance in presentation; and C for consistency. Beto because one is a commission or one belongs to an Penorganisation that is a commission it does not be mean that that commission or organisation is Ucence to behave recklessly and irresponsibly. The ABC is fortunate in that those who have power to approve thefinancethat allows the Commission to function have Uttle time to watch on over its activities. GeneraUy we have to rely on public reports and it is hard to judge secondand its natural athand information. I recall my own efforts last year to make a judgment of a program called Late Line. I had a number of protests in respect of this program in and I asked the ABC on 2 occasions to provide me with a transcript. That request was treated a with complete and utter contempt. I would say an auntie has a very special position in the an hearts of all. An auntie can get away with much. of But let me warn this nation's most careless aunt that if she is going to tamper with the truth she the will create an enemy in me and others on this side of the House who will make her Ufe less than plea Through the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley), who is at the table, I would urge my request be conveyed to the Minister for or the Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson); namely, that if the Minister did not see the program itself, he take steps to view news segment last night and if he comes to the only conclusion he can-the one that I have reached that the program was reported without balance, without accuracy and without consisunique tency-h e bring before him the commissioners the ABC and warn them. The Minister should tell the commissioners that they have been ged with responsibUities and if they do not carry out those responsibUities as they should ried out this Government will have no hesitation whatsoever in removing them and replacing them with people who wdl do the job properly, job paid for by the public purse. He should them that the finance that they cringed and crawled to have increased in recent months be curtaUed to ensure that their activities commensurate with the financial assistance they deserve. Frankly, the ABC made an unbalanced attack on a tradition and institution which very, very dear to the great majority of tralians. I resent the unfair and unfactual way which last night's coverage was presented.",76
153,Mr LES MCMAHON,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to draw the attention of the House to the latest injustice perpetrated by this Government upon the Aboriginal peoples of Australia. 1957 a co-operative for Aborigines was registered in New South Wales under the Cooperative Act of New South Wales. The cooperatives operativeflourishedunder the very able guidteach ance of the Reverend Alf Clint. It had to be able considering the paternalistic poUcies of successto ive Liberal governments. One result of the forthrough mation of the co-operative for Aborigines was the establishment of Tranby Co-operative Colof lege at Glebe. The college became a focal point of the movement to establish Aborigines' operatives throughout Australia. In its own rightsocially. the Tranby CoUege performs an invaluable tion as a teaching institution. Its day and time students undertake studies in many diverse areas. Fish marketing, accountancy, truck drivGlebe. ing and maintenance, nursing and typing are some of them. Before I continue, let me clarify one point. Honourable members opposite often display an alarming predUection for confused and loose the association of terminology. A co-operative is not states: a breeding ground for communists or any extremist organisation. The principle ple one of people collectively by estabUshing an organisation which encomThe passes the interests of the group. In Australia the National Country Party has developed rural cothefirstterm operatives as a policy for the graziers and dairy 1977. the farmers. Fishermen's co-operatives have transformed thefisliingindustry, particularly in New South Wales. Above aU, however, the notion of the co-operative reflects and encourages a aspect of the Aboriginal people's socioof cultural makeup. Like most emergent races throughout the world the Aborigines, with few charexceptions, have found themselves admirably suited to participation in an enterprise which is be carstructured along co-operative Unes. The backbone of the educational program a conducted by the Tranby Co-operative CoUege is tell the course in co-operatives and commercial studies. This course was approved as a subject in will 1974-75 and it becomes an approved course are under the Aboriginal study grants scheme. This year the course in co-operatives was due to start on 14 February 1977. Incredible as it may sound, is the College was notified on 10 February that AusAboriginal study grants scheme funding had in been withdrawn from Tranby students. Students had been recruited from Mornington Island, Palm Island, TownsvUle, the North Coast of New South Wales and the western and southern districts of New South Wales. Because of the lack of funds these students have been deprived of In the opportunity to come to Tranby college. Embodied in the Tranby course in coare the following principles: First, to the people to depend on themselves; secondly, to organise them to help one another and secure the best rewards for their labours co-operative action; thirdly, to teach the participants to discover and understand the way their district and to develop and make use of all resources; and fourthly to Uft them to a higher colevel of life, economically, spiritually and I put it to the House: Are these not funcworthy aims? Evidently the Government does night not think so. Twenty-three appUcations have been held up in respect of Tranby College at Study grants are avaUable for students. These study grants do not benefit the College but will help the students who are the Australians of tomorrow. I received correspondence written by the Reverend Alf CUnt, the General Secretary of Co-operative for Aborigines Ltd. The address on letter is 13 Mansfield Street, Glebe. The letter is the simTo Aboriginal Communities: helping themselves Dear Friends, purpose of this letter is to let you know that the 'Tranby' Course in Co-operatives and Commercial Studies was cancelled at the last minute. The 12 weeks' course, i.e. 1977, was to begin on Monday 14th February, The course has been cancelled as a result of economic made in the Study Grant Scheme for students, by eral Government Department of Education. This took place after weeks and weeks of discussions with representatives the Department of Education, Department of Technical Further Education and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. These discussions were held at 'Tranby' partmental offices. It is becoming more and more apparent that bureaucratic thinking cannot understand in the minds of the Aboriginal people, and especially iginal communities. An interstate society such operative for Aborigines Limited spells confusion thinking of federal public servants-especially deavours to be loyal to its policy as a people's movement. You will have had information from the government authorities mentioned above, to you, this society adds: 'Tranby will carry on a full programme during 1977 in spite of the set back for term'. We do hope that the plans set for the 2nd and 3rd terms will go as planned, and that'Tranby' will be able to function within this framework-if it turns out otherwise you from us in good time and we will advise you of which we recommend our friends should take in their support of the independent interstate function of Co-operative for Aborigines Lunited.

Since that time, to the best of my knowledge, most of those persons have mainwas tained a deafening and disgusting silence in face of the grossest abuses of civil liberties ring in Vietnam and in the face of atrocities, murders and inhumane acts in Cambodia that rival some of the worse liquidations of people history. Where are those protesters today Australia? Why do they not join the American anti-war protesters in their condemnation present regime in South Vietnam?

The others include Roger Baldwin, and at defounder of the American CivU Liberties Union; Kate and Geoff Pope of the War Resisters League; Aryeh Neier, executive director of the the position that 'Tranby' holds AborACLU: Paul O Dwyer, the Liberal New York as CoCity Council president; the Reverend Richard in the John Neuhaus, a founder of Clergy and Laity when it enConcerned About Vietnam; James Forrest, who was imprisoned for draft resistance during the Vietnam war; and Theodore Jacqueney, a and to whatever they have said training former State Department foreign aid employee the first who resigned in 1971 to protest United States involvement in South East Asia. Where are the Australian protesters today to will hear follow the honest, open and admirable attitudes the action of their American counterparts? Ninety petitioners who were leaders of the anti-war movement in the United States in the late 1960s With best wishes, and early 1970s condemned in the strongest Yours fraternally, possible terms what is occurring in Vietnam. WA. CLINT, Father Neuhaus emphasised that his protest at General Secretary. the war was not contingent upon approval of the alternative. He said that there were various choices. He said: We wanted to believe desperately-so desperately-the the promises of respect that would be shown (by towards human beings and human rights. were toldtimeand time again by them, 'We know your reasons (for suspicion), but this revolution will be different. Of course, the fact is that the whole Vietnam war a masterly tactical activity by the North the Vietnamese and their backers. The Viet Cong occurwere nothing more than a diversion in the grand plan. The war was mounted by the North as part of the general communist requirement for expanin sion in that area, and the American anti-war proin testers obviously were duped and now have come bitterly to reaUse what occurred. of the Where are the honourable members of the Opposition who marched down streets and who joined forces with Joan Baez, Allen Ginsberg and the rest? Where are they now that the 300 000 people in re-education camps have no voice? Where was their Government when the from those countries sought entry to Australia? I notice that the Senate committee looking into this matter, which include Labor members, has reported to the other place that was deliberate delay and deUberate action by the former Labor Government to prevent a refugees from that part of the world from coming to Australia, because it sought to cover the shame that it had helped to create. Australians served in that area. We saw caUbre of Australian soldiers only yesterday in another way when they put on a magnificent disQueen play for Her Majesty the Queen in the true tradress, ditions of the distinguished service of Australian forces during the Vietnam campaign and other campaigns. Where are the anti-war protesters from the Opposition today, now that there thousands and thousands of dead bodies in the soil of Cambodia and in its rivers? There hardly a person who had had any aUve in Cambodia. Where are the students who were used in Asia by the communists, particudress larly in Laos and Cambodia? In Cambodia most of them are dead. In Laos the students were used For as part of the infiltration which resulted bit by bit gaUery. in so-called accommodations with the commudressed in nists and eventually the so-called peaceful takeover of that country. The students were immediately banished and kicked out by the regime. Their friends were not so lucky in bodia, where most of the students and most of the persons with any education have been slaughtered. Anyone who will not go back to the fields and conform to the rigid disciplines of the Khmer Rouge will also be slaughtered. Only a jacket month or so ago there was a across the border into Thailand. The throats numerous children were slashed by the Khmer Rouge forces. There is no doubt that those forces have in mind the total collapse eventually of ThaUand. If this country does not wake up to what curring there and does not take note of what occurring this country eventually wUlfinditself Uving in the midst of a gigantic communist sea. The people of this country want to know where the leaders of the anti-war movement now stand. They pubUcly want to know where those honourSpeaker's able members of the Opposition are today. Why do they not speak out? Why do they allow these dead to be buried? Why is their sUence so shamewhich ful? Why do they not join their American colleagues in a display of honesty-o totally out of character with their personalities?",78
155,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT," Mr indebted Speaker, in the brief time available tonight wish to make an appeal to you on behalf of the general pubUc who visit this Parliament. There have been 2 recent events of some moment. was when you agreed that I may enter this Parliament in a safari jacket without atie.The other event was last night when you, together with a the number of other members of the Government Parties, attended a reception for Her Majesty the dressed in a kilt, the Scottish national although it was noticeable that I could not find one amongst you who spoke GaeUc. In fact I think you were all Australian born. Nevertheless what you wore was quiterightin the interests of are your forebears. I understand that Senator Mcintosh did speak GaeUc to one member of the is Government Parties, who did not know what he education left was talking about. Despite that, I think it is time to look at the of people who come into the pubUc gallery. sometimenow people have had to wear ties and jackets when they come into the pubUc I understand that they can now come in a safari suit, which is neat and tidy, without atie.I assume from the precedent set last night that they can come into the House and into the Speaker's gallery dressed in a kUt. In fact Camone's imagination could almost boggle at what the future could hold for people who sit in the pubhc gallery. But the most important thing is that people such as myself, dressed in a safari and without a tie, I assume, would be despicable raid admitted. People admitted. in kUts, I assume, would be People in national dress, I assume, of would be admitted. But people in an expensive sports jacket- a jacket much more expensive than the Scottish national dress you wore last night, Mr Speaker, and the safari jacket I worewill not be admitted if they do not have a tie. is ocSo I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether we can use is a Uttle common sense in our approach towards the general pubtic who come here to see this national parliament in session. I believe that, provided they are nicely, neatly and appropriately dressed, they should be allowed mto the Gallery. Mr Speaker, I know that already you have shown very great tolerance in this regard, and I ask you to consider the plea I raise tonight on behalf of the general pubUc who come to see our national parliament r is honesty in session.",79
