Mr JOHN THOMSON presented a petition from a number of fishermen, at Port Macquarie, New South Wales, praying that the duty on fishing nets and cork floats may be remitted. Petition receivedMr COON presented a petition from 200 workers engaged in the manufacture of parasols, umbrellas, and sunshades, praying that item 123 of the Tariff be recommitted, and the duty fixed at 35 per cent, ad valorem, instead of 20 per cent. Petition received and read.",14
1,Mr CARR,Unknown,"I present a similar petition from the workers engaged in the manufacture of parasols, umbrellas, and sunshades in Sydney, and desire that it be read.",14
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,It is not usual to read two petitions of a similar character.,14
3,Mr CARR,Unknown,"It is similar to, but I do not think identical with, the petition presented by the honourable member for Batman. Petition received. TARIFF. CONSIDERATION BY SENATE. MI . WILKS - I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether, with a view to facilitate the consideration of the Tariff, the Government are prepared to forward without delay to the Senate the five divisions with which this House has already dealt?",14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As the result of inquiries instituted in consequence of a suggestion made by the deputy leader of the Opposition, I find that the Senate does not desire at the present time of the year to receive the Tariff in sections. NA MEDICINES.",14
5,Mr THOMAS,IMPORTATION OF PATENT,I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether the proposed Bill relating to the importation of patent medicines has yet been drafted ?,14
6,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMPORTATION OF PATENT,It will be laid on the table of the House tomorrow. SMALL-ARMS AND AMMUNITION .FACTORY SITE. - Mr BOWDEN - I wish to ask the Minister of Defence what arrangements have been made with reference to the selection of a site for a small-arms and ammunition factory and whether a decision has lieen arrived at in regard to the site at Lithgow which was offered to the Government ?,14
7,Mr EWING,IMPORTATION OF PATENT,"No decision has yet been arrived at. I presume that. in the course of, perhaps, a few weeks a definite statement in regard to the whole matter will be made. MAIL SERVICE TO EUROPE.",14
8,Colonel FOXTON,IMPORTATION OF PATENT,Is the Prime Minister yet in a position to make any definite statement as to the oversea mail contract? - Mr DEAKIN - So far as the Government are concerned nothing remains to be done; but the tenderers are awaiting a cable from London before taking the final step of signing the contract. FIEL D ARTILLERY RANGES.,14
9,Mr CROUCH,IMPORTATION OF PATENT,"Is the Minister of Defence aware that although new - guns have been provided for the Field Artillery in Victoria it was found impossible on the King's birthday - and. this has been the position for several months-to use them owing to the want of a range long enough to fire over. Has the Department made anv arrangements for the selection of a suitable range on the Nepean Peninsula, ot some more suitable site?.",15
10,Mr EWING,IMPORTATION OF PATENT,"The question is a very important one, and there is some difficulty in dealing with it, since the area required must be large, fairly accessible, and obtainable at a reasonable price. Action is being taken in regard to the acquisition of ranges not only in Victoria but in all the States, and I hope to be able in the near future to give some information to the House in regard to the matter. SEIZURE OF GOODS BY CUSTOMS our DEPARTMENT.",15
11,Mr SALMON,IMPORTATION OF PATENT,Is the Minister of Trade and Customs yet in a position to state whether the somewhat unusualcourse which adopted by his Department of seizing a progress. 'consignment of goods from Japan has resulted in a profit?,15
12,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMPORTATION OF PATENT,"I have not yet obtained the exact figures as to the sale * of the goods in question, but know very handsome profit has been made. I hope to be able to give full particulars press either tomorrow or on Tuesdaynext. ALL-NIGHT SITTINGS. NA MEMBERS.",15
13,Mr MALONEY,ATTENDANCE OF HONORABLE,"In view of the difficulty, of inducing a number of honourable members to attend to their parliamentary duties in connection with all-night sittings, I desire to know whether the Treasurer will see that a record is kept of the names of those who remain in attendance on such occasions ?",15
14,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ATTENDANCE OF HONORABLE,A record of all divisions appears in Hansard as well as in the Votes and Proceedings of the House. .The names of those present at all-night sittings can thus be readily obtained. I do not know what further action could be taken in the direction suggested by the honourable member.,15
15,Mr THOMAS,ATTENDANCE OF HONORABLE,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether, in order to do away with all-night sittings, it is not .possible for iis to meet six days a week? I am not prepared to remain here all night, but I am ready to be in attendance six days a week from io a.m. until 6 p.m. . Mr DEAKIN - Any proposal for the better transaction of the business of the House is worthy of consideration COAL MINERS' STRIKE:",15
16,Mr WATKINS,ATTENDANCE OF HONORABLE,"Has the Prime Minister given any attention to the strike of coal miners in New South Wales, and to the possibility of the dispute extending beyond the limits of that State ?",15
17,Mr DEAKIN,ATTENDANCE OF HONORABLE,"No citizen of the Commonwealth can afford to ignore so serious a situation; but I think that the honourable member will agree that, until events occur that will place the responsibility upon the Commonwealth, the least said regarding it in the meantime the better. . With an earnest desire to assist, by every means in power, the earliest possible equitable settlement of this' unhappy dispute, we think it undesirable to say anything that might possibly, impede the. negotiations, according.to the press are already in TELEGRAPHIC DELAYS.",15
18,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ATTENDANCE OF HONORABLE,"the Postthat a master-General, upon notice-^ 1. Is it a facE that a deputation of country representatives, recently placed before bim complaints of serious delays in the receipt and despatch of telegrams-delay s to the extent of 24 hours being alleged? 2. Has his attention been called to the .Peak Hill Express, New South Wales,"" of the 8tb instant, in which. the following statement appears :- "" We lodged two telegraphic messages at the Peak Hill office on Monday afternoon. Although the local officials waited at the instruments t ill after 11 o'clock that night, they found it impossible to get the messages away, the reason being assigned to the congested state of the telegraph lines, and it was not until the next day that the messages were despatched. On the payment of ' urgent' rates, however, the sender of a message can nearly depend upon getting his telegram ticked to its destination, but why should the public be compelled to pay double charges for ordinary messages? It looks to us as if the present deplorable state of affairs in our telegraph offices is created by a desire on the part of those concerned, to compel the public to pay double rates as often as possible, thus assisting to swell the yearly surplus unjustly wrung from a long-suffering people. The fault does not lie with the country operators, but with the system which has brought the Commonwealth Telegraphic Service into ridicule and contempt."" Also in another paragraph in the same issue, it is stated-"" On Monday afternoon, a telegram was lodged, in Melbourne for despatch to the proprietor of this paper. We received the wire at 7.35 on Tuesday night, after it had been sent in error to Peak Hill , Western Australia, or 26 hours after the message was lodged. On Tuesday, at 11 a.m., we lodged a wire for despatch to Manildra, and at 3 o'clock"" that afternoon we were informed that, althoufh lying at the local office for four hours, the operator could not get it away, owing to the congested state of the line. We agreed to pay double rates, and the wire was sent on its delayed journey. Race telegrams lodged in Sydney for the Express at 3.35 p.m. on Tuesday did not reach us t ill 7.30 p.m. that night. Is it any wonder that the whole countryside is clamouring for reform in our Electric Telegraph Department"" ? 3. What is the cause of these serious telegraphic delays; and what action, if any, has been taken lo remedy these causes of complaint?",15
19,Mr MAUGER,ATTENDANCE OF HONORABLE,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as followsInquiries are being made, and the desired formation will be furnished as early as possible. MILIT IA FORCES: TRAINING.",16
20,Mr SALMON,ATTENDANCE OF HONORABLE,"the Minister of Defence, upon noticeHas he taken into consideration of making arrangements with the Imperial authorities whereby the benefits of military training afforded by such places as Indiamay be open to members of the Militia Forces of the Commonwealth, upon a basis which would provide those who are prepared to give the time with the ordinary pay and allowances?",16
21,Mr EWING,ATTENDANCE OF HONORABLE,"The answer to the honourable member's .question is as followsThe .question of sending a few selected officers of the Citizen Forces abroad for instruction has been considered; and, recognising the value of affording such officers every facility for enlarging the scope of their military knowledge, I propose to recommend provision on next year's Estimates, in order that the system may be initiated. PROHIBITED CORRESPONDENCE, NEW ZEALAND. Mr THOMAS BROWN Postmaster-General, upon notice-With reference to questions relating to prohibitions recently issued by the New Zealand Postal authorities, against the transmission of mail matter to and from certain firms or persons trading in the Commonwealth, is it a fact that certain of these firms or persons were previously prohibited by his Department; and, if so, why were such prohibitions withdrawn 01 allowed to be inoperative?",16
22,Mr MAUGER,ATTENDANCE OF HONORABLE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsYes. The delivery of correspondence to one firm or institute was prohibited in January, 1906; but the prohibition was removed in the following April, on the advice of the Crown Law Officers, upon the principal of the firm or institute ih question giving a written undertaking that he would not again infringe the provisions of the Post and Telegraph Act 1901. . TELEGRAPH CONSTRUCTION: PAYMENT OF CONTRACTORS.",16
23,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ATTENDANCE OF HONORABLE,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Has his attention been directed to the delays in paying telegraph and telephone construction contractors the moneys due to them, it being alleged that such payments are usually from five to seven weeks overdue ? 2. In view of the fact that such contractors are usually men of small means, and have to meet their obligations for material and 'labour as the work proceeds, or as soon thereafter as possible, will he see that greater expedition is instituted in making these payments ? '",16
24,Mr MAUGER,ATTENDANCE OF HONORABLE,"In reply to the honourable member's questions I beg to state in that inquiries are being made, and that the necessary information will be furnished as early as possible. I may add that instructions have been issued to the Deputy Post^ masters-General in the several States that special measures must be taken to prevent the possibility any such delays in future. GALVANIZED-IRON WIRE. Mr MCDOUGALL. asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is it a fact, as alleged in certain quarters, that galvanized-iron wire made in Germany and otherwhere, is imported into Australia, and used by the Department in the telegraph and tele-' phone lines of the Commonwealth? 2. If what is alleged is true, will the Minister take steps to ascertain if galvanized iron wire r can be manufactured in Australia? 3. If it can be so manufactured, in the event of a supply being available, will be undertake to give preference to the Australian article?",16
25,Mr MAUGER,ATTENDANCE OF HONORABLE,"The replies to the honourable member's questions are as followasked the 1. Yes; but material made in a foreign country is purchased only when it is not possible to obtain material manufactured in the Commonwealth or the United Kingdom at a reasonable advance on the price asked for by foreign manufacturers. 2. Every facility has been offered for Australian manufacturers, if any, of galvanized iron wire suitable for the requirements of the Postmaster-General's Department, to tender for supplies required from time to time, but no tender has heen received from any such persons or firms. Special further inquiries will be made in the matter. 3. Yes. Preference is in all cases given to Australian-made as against imported, and ' to. British as against foreign-made, material required for the services of the Postmaster-General's Department. NA ENCOURAGEMENT BILL. SECOND READING,",16
26,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [3-14]--In movingThat this Bill be now read a second time, I may say at once that I do not think it will be necessary for me to deal with all the details of this Bill, since a similar measure has already engaged the aftention of the House on three different occasions, and the debates in respect of it are recorded in Hansard. In 1902, a Bill providing for the payment of a bonus upon the production of iron was introduced by the right honourable member for Adelaide, after the matter had been inquired into by a Royal Commission. As is well known, the measure did. not become law. A majority of honourable members in that Parliament were averse to the granting of bounties.",17
27,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"There are so many honourable members moving about the chamber and holding private conversations, that, it is almost impossible for the Treasurer to proceed. I must ask honourable members to obey the ordinary rules of debate.",17
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"The Bill which was introduced by the right honourable member for Adelaide did not become law, because at that time a majority of honourable members were opposed to the granting of bonuses for the purpose of fostering the iron industry. Upon 22nd March, 1.904, I brought forward another measure having a similar object in view. That did not meet with the favourable reception which I had anticipated, and consequently it was not passed into law. Again, in 1905, a Bill of a similar character wassubmitted, with a like result. I am now proposing the second reading of a measure which, though not identical with its predecessors, contains very similar provisions to those which were embodied in them. I have brought it forward because the Tariff has been so arranged that if it does not receive the approval of honourable members we shall then be in a position to deal with the question of iron and steel in another way. I am very strongly in favour of fostering the iron industry by means of bounties, because I hold that. if a duty' be imposed upon iron-and that is the only alternative presented to us-if will be, to some extent,, a tax upon the raw material used in many of our manufactures. In Division VIA ; of the Tariff, we propose to grant to manufacturers an increased' protection of 2 or 3 per cent, in consequence 1 of the imposition of duties upon pig iron, and a variety of other products to which I shall presently refer.",17
29,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,I cannot allow the Treasurer to refer in detail to matters connected with the work of the Committee of Ways and Means. I must ask him to make only an incidental reference to the Tariff schedule.,17
30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,This Bill is so inextricably interwoven with the Tariff proposals that I hope a little latitude will be extended to me.,17
31,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,They are really allied proposals.,17
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Exactly . I do not wish to infringe the rules of debate, but it would be almost impossible for me to explain the provisions of this Bill without referring to the Tariff proposals of the Government.",17
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"This debate ought to have taken place in Committee. Sir WILLIAM LYNEl- I am endeavouring to meet the wishes of honourable members, and I hope that the honourable member will not endeavour to interpose obstacles.",17
34,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"Of course I am not administering any rule which I myself have laid down. I am merely administering the Standing Orders, which preclude reference being made, in a debate upon one measure, to a debate upon another measure. If the Treasurer intends to refer in detail to the Tariff proposals, I cannot possibly allow him to do that. But I would point out that he will be able to accomplish his' object by emphasizing the advantage of adopting the bounty method of encouraging the iron industry without discussing the exact rates of duty set out in the Tariff schedule.",17
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"You r suggestion, sir, is a practicable one, and I shall gladly adopt it. In order that I mav not wander from the particular points which I desire to emphasize I have had a few lines typed for the purpose of showing effect of this measure upon Divisions VIA and VIB . of the T a r if f Division VIA . is a list of articles which are to remain free t i ll the industry of making in Australia is successfully established. So soon .as this is achieved then the duties set out schedule of Division VIA . are to come into tion. The effect of. Division VIA . coming force will be to place a duty (taking an example) upon 229 (C) bar and angle iron, sheet iron, Jfec, of 12^ per cent. The duty on corrugated galvanized iron under Division VI . is 20 - cent, and 25 per cent. T ill VIA . comes operation sheet iron is free, and, consequently, the maker of galvanized iron has the whole *his duty (20 per cent, and 25 per cent.) by way of protection. The duty on the sheet under VIA . is 12^ per cent., and when that - sion comes into force - the protection now - would be reduced to the extent of the duty on the raw material, and the margin in favour of the manufacturer reduced to that extent.",17
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Assumin g that the Bill becomes law, will the Treasurer still foundation proceed with Divisions VIA . and VIB . of factures the Tariff?",18
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Yes . My typeof written statement proceedsTo counteract this it is intended so soon as Tasmania. VIA . comes into force that VIB . shall follow and increase the import duty on galvanized iron has been put in for about 600 feet. by 5 per cent, (i.e., to 25 per cent, and 30 per - cent.). This 5 per cent, is about equal additional cost to the manufacturer of the on his raw material. If this were not done - effect might be that manufacturers would - entirely in the hands of the maker of the Iron who might not be able to supply, or might - demand too much for the price of his article. If he did so then the manufacturer would - enabled to use imported sheet on which duty has been paid, ancl would be in no position tha-n he was before.",18
38,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,Would not this sheet iron be imported?,18
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"But my object effect. is to stimulate the local production of iron, - so that we shall not require to import a large quantity.",18
40,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,Is the typewritten statement which the Treasurer has read his own production ?,18
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Yes .,18
42,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,Has it been prepared .since half-past 5 o'clock this morning?,18
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Yes . I was - not idle this morning, I can assure the honmitting. orable member, notwithstanding that the House had sat all night. I was desirous placing the position on record way as would admit of no mistake being - made, and consequently I had the stateis ment, which I have read, typewritten. the we adopt Division VIA . of the Tariff we . shall then have to consider Division VIB .",18
44,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,Thos e divithem sions contain a long list of articles.,18
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"But in Division in the VI . there are very few items which will be operaseriously affected. It was at the instance into of members of the Committee of Ways and Means that I promised, within the past ten days, to bring forward this measure before per Division VIA . of the Tariff had been dealt into with, because its provisions may affect some of the duties specified therein. As we have of dealt with this question upon at least three used previous occasions, I do not intend to make divia long speech upon it. As a matter of fact, given I am not quite sure that still another Bill paid relating to it .was not passed by this House and transmitted to the Senate last year, where it was defeated by, I believe, one vote. I regard the iron industry as representing the of the prosperity of the manuof Australia. Not only in one State, but in several, there are abundant deposits of iron ore. I have visited some those places, and, in my opinion, the best ore is to be found at Blythe River, in That ore has been tested thoroughly; and I understand that a drive A to the small shipment was sent to England, not duty to be assayed, but to be dealt with in the the ordinary way; and the result was within be 1. per cent, of the result from ore obtained sheet from the richest mine in the world, in Norway. All this ore at the present time be is lying idle; and the Tariff proposals are, import as the honourable member for Dalley has worse said, double-barrelled. The first barrel is represented by this Bill, and the second barrel is .represented by the duties which we propose if the Bill is not carried into",18
46,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,Blan k cartridge !,18
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"No ; the second barrel will kill, if the first does not ",18
48,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,Who is to be killed ?,18
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,The Opposition.,18
50,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"Oh, , no !",18
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"However , I do not think that I shall have much opposition to the proposal which I am now sub",18
52,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"Would not those inof terested in the industry prefer a duty of in such a 12\ per cent, without a bounty?",18
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Yes"" ; but there the difficulty that if a duty be imposed If ' before it is possible to produce iron in Australia, then the price of the raw material is increased to manufacturers in the meantime. But for this fact, it would be by far the easier method to impose a duty. In every country in the world, where the iron and steel industry has become prominent-suc h as Canada and the United States, and, in earlier days, Great Britain - a bounty has been the first step towards development. I am merely proposing what Has been proposed three times before, namely, a bounty without a duty in the first instance, but with a provision that, when there is sufficient production, not only from one mill, but, perhaps, from a dozen, to prevent any great rise in prices, we may be relieved from the necessity of paying a bounty, and may impose a duty - Mixed Metalware ' That is the whole theory of the proposal now laid before honourable members. should like to' refer to the great imports of not only pig iron and bar iron, but iron manufactures as a whole. This matter has been referred to on previous occasions, and figures relating to the matter may be found recorded in Hansard. The average imports of iron and steel, unmanufactured and manufactured, into Australia represent about £7,000,000 a year. I have here the latest return, which I have pleasure in laying before honourable membersNA Iron and Steel (raw or only partly manufactured) :- Bar, Rod, Angle and Tee 999, 33 - .. 44 , 75 Galvanized, Plate and 245,21 1 . . 1,069,17 4 Sheet .. --- 1 Girders, Beams, &c Hoop Ingots, Blooms, &c. ... 88,083 ... 28,179 Pig 898,297 Plate and Sheet, not 458,197 ...

60,Mr WATSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"The figures represent iron and iron, manufactures.",20
61,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Yes ; and this is the largest importation we have had for sometime, the averagebeing, as I have already said, about £ 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . I give the details in order that the magnitude of this industry may be realized by honourable members. I regret that the iron industry, which has been started in New South Wales, and has been assisted by the Government of that State, does not promise to be successful. cause the best class of iron is not produced there. It has been proved that the iron manufactured in New South Wales is better than English iron, and is as good as Scotch iron. The reason is to be found in the fact that an industry of the character cannot be started without immense capital.",20
62,Mr REID,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,O r a good duty.,20
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"A few years ago Mr Carson, who came here from England with a view of starting the industry, told me that no degree of success could be' looked for unless the capital invested was at least £ 9 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and since then it has been estimated by Mr Jamieson that £1,100,00 0 is necessary.",20
64,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,But those interested in the industry say that if there is a duty they do not want a bounty.,20
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"I know that tralian they prefer a duty; but I have how difficult it is to impose a duty without increasing the price of iron to manufacturers of m'achines, agricultural ments, and so forth.",20
66,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,C o u l d the duty be brought in operation in twelve months' time ? ,20
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"In New South Wales, under the Tariff proposed by Sir ing. George Dibbs, the duty on pig iron was postponed for twelve months with the idea that, in the meantime, the industry would be established. At the end of the months, however, the industry was not established, and the Tariff immediately came into operation, and remained until free-trade was established by the present leader of the Opposition.",20
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,There never was duty on pig iron in New South Wales.,20
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,There was; know what I am talking about.,20
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,And so do I .,20
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"And I have been very cautious in regard to this prospective duty, from the fear that the experience of New South Wales might be repeated.",20
72,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,I suppose the Treasurer has every reason to believe that the people interested in this industry are in earnest ?,20
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,I have no doubt in my mind as to the earnestness of these people. I think that on the last occaThis is not be- sion a number of honourable members were frightened by the rumour that the interest of the syndicate was being sold to London capitalists for a large sum of money.,20
74,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,They were taking too much out of it.,20
75,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,It was thought that they were taking too much for themselves.,20
76,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,That idea influenced a great many votes.,20
77,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"1 think that it did. The reason why men with capital are very chary about investing money in the iron industry here, notwithstanding that we have so much ore available, is that they fear the American Steel Trust, which, with its ramifications, has a capital of £400,000,000.",20
78,Mr REID,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Surely not.,20
79,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,That is so.,20

82,Mr BOWDEN,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Is it not the German and Belgian iron that capitalists are afraid of ?,20
83,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"M e n whom I twelve have urged to embark capital in this industry have told me that they are afraid of the American Steel Trust. We should do all we can to foster this industry in the interest of local manufactures, the increased production of we'alth, and the a defence of Australia, which is, perhaps, the strongest reason of all. When Premier I of New South Wales, at the time of the South African war, I applied for 5,000 or 10,000 rifles; but every arsenal was at the time in full work, and the British Government replied that the rifles could be supplied, and not one was obtained until some time after the war had finished. We should not, in war time, be unable to arm ourselves. We have the raw material for the manufacture of iron, and it will be a serious thing for us in the we cannot make our own arms. The Go-: rernment intend, within a few days, make a proposal for the establishment small-arms factory, and I hope that on we shall be able to make more than small arms. My honourable colleagues and myself wish to have something to f a l on in the event of this Bill meeting same fate as similar Bills.",20

In view of the' probable expansion of the business at various places, I do not think that a bounty is necessary to encourage' it. For the production of pig iron made from Aus""detralian ore, of puddled bar iron made from Australian pig iron, and of steel made from Australian pig iron, I provide for bounties of 12 s. per ton.

124,Mr BOWDEN,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,The manufacturers will not have the benefits of the bounty and the duty at the same time?,23
125,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"No . I may say that part of this Bill was originally drafted by Mr - no w Mr Justice-Isaacs , and that, as it left his hands, it contained a provision somewhat approaching what is now known as the new protection. ' That provision, however, was not in itself complete, as compared with the new protection proposals which we now have under consideration. I , therefore, eliminated it, determining that if the Bill were carried the one general policy of the new protection should apply., to the industries to which it relates as well as to others. I thought it desirable to make* a passing reference to that matter-, in order that honourable members should know what are the intentions of the Government in regard to the wages and conditions of labour of the men engaged in the industry. I consulted the Prime Minister about the matter, and I thought it was better to bring this industry under the general policy of the new protection rather than to insert in the Bill provisions relating specially to it. If we sought in this Bill to deal with the wages of employees and conditions of labour in the industry, we should thus create two different classes of cases to be adjudicated upon. Honourable members wil l recognise that it is far better to make provision in a general Bill for the policy of the new protection to be applied to this and other industries.",23

127,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,No . I feel that there is not the slightest clanger of the posals of the Government in this regard being held to be unconstitutional.,23
128,Mr BATCHELOR,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Will the High Court respect the honourable member's feelings?,23
129,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"I am confident that it will not hold our legislation regard to the new protection stitutional. I have heard some honourable members express a contrary view, but the Prime Minister and a good many other the lawyers have no fear in that regard. I ' think that the spirit, of the Constitution will be observed. Mr W. H. IRVINE - We are justified in assuming our legislation to be right until it is proved to be wrong.",23
130,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Quite so.,23
131,Mr FISHER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,It is singular that as soon as we begin to help the worker the cry is raised that our legislation is unconstitutional.,23
132,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"As soon as our legislation begins to work in that direction we hear the cry that it is unconstitutional.

141,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"North Sydney) [4.15] - The Minister has substituted for the old ad valorem duty a fixed duty, so that guns costing £ 6 0 or £ 8 0 will be liable to the same duty as ""a cheap gun put perhaps to a more useful purpose, such as the destruction of vermin. I think that the Minister ought to - reconsider this item.",24
142,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"I made the alteration in consequence of the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, and should like to hear what the Chairman of the Commission has to say on the subject.",24
143,Mr WH IRVINE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"There should be an ad valorem duty, with a fixed minimum.",24
144,Mr DUGALD,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"THOMSON - We could have a minimumrate fixed. Personally I should prefer ad valorem duties such as the old rates of 10 per cent, and 15 per cent. The proposed change in the rates will not seriously affect the revenue, but it TARIFF. is rather unjust that cheap guns should be called upon to bear as high a duty as are the most expensive varieties.",24
145,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"(Bendigo) [4-17]-The present scheme of duties was first suggested in South Australia by an experienced gunsmith and merchant. His proposal was afterwards supported in Victoria by expert gunsmiths, who gave very satisfactory and clear evidence.",24
146,Mr WATSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"They were importers, and perhaps wished to get dear guns admitted at a low rate.",24
147,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,They were also interested in local manufacture.,24
148,Mr WATSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,There is no local manufacture of guns.,24
149,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Then they were interested in repairs. Further, they wished to import gun stocks for the purpose of (General Tariff), 5s. 6d.; (United putting guns together in the CommonKingdom), 5s. wealth. The old rates of duty were very low. Ten per cent, was imposed upon (General Tariff), 2s. 9d.; (United Kingdom), 2s. 6d. guns, revolvers were dutiable at 15 per cent., and military and match rifles were admitted free. The object of levying these fixed duties is to limit the importation of cheap rubbish-chea p guns, rifles, and revolvers which have been proved by bitter and disastrous experience to be dangerous to life, and not at all calculated to develop good rifle, gun, or revolver practice. Both these witnesses affirmed that the commonest rubbish in the world was imported into the Commonwealth under the operation of the moderate duty of 10 per t is only"" fixed duties which are expressly designed to discourage the use of low class guns, rifles, and revolvers that will exclude this rubbish. A 10 per cent, rate will be absolutely ineffective, and a 20 per cent, duty might not be sufficient to keep out revolvers which are worth only 4s. or 5s. These weapons very frequently find their way into the hands of boys, and their use often results in the loss of life or limb. It is for the Committee to - determine whether it is not sound policy to promote the use of firearms of a superior character by admitting them at a relatively lower rate than is charged upon weapons of a low class and dangerous character.",24
150,Mr WATSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"South Sydney) {4.21]. - The Committee should recollect that at the present time guns are not made in Australia. I i i any case, it seems to me that the duties proposed would be of no value whatever from a protective stand-point.",25
151,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,That is admitted..,25
152,Mr WATSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Therefor e we can regard them merely from the stand-point of revenue. I do not object to the imposition of a duty upon this class ofimports, but I do object to charging the same rate upon a fowling-piece worth £ 6 0 as is levied upon a gun which is worth only £ 5 . I know from experience that one can purchase a gun for £ 5 which is quite as reliable-so far as immunity from bursting is concerned-as is a much more expensive weapon. I admit that there is a cheaper class of gun-principall y of German or Belgian make-whic h is sold in Australia for about 50s. It is not desirable 'to encourage the use of these verycheap weapons. For that reason I am willing to agree to the imposition of a minimum duty; but I think that we ought also to provide that the really expensive weapon which a man imports merely to please his fancy should bear an ad valorem rate in addition to the specific duty",25
153,Mr BATCHELOR,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,What does the honourable member think would be a fair fixed duty?,25
154,Mr WATSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Probably a duty of 5s. or ios. levied upon all guns would still permit of the importation of cheap weapons.,25
155,Mr SAMPSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,It might keep a percentage of them out.,25
156,Mr WATSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"It might. If we are to sanction the imposition of a fixed duty I - think that it ought to be in conjunction with an ad valorem rate, as was the case in connection with the item of cigars under the old Tariff. ' It would be a mistake to. adopt the fixed duty proposed. Sir WILLIAM ' LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [4.25] - This duty was levied upon hobby. the recommendation of the A section of the Tariff Commission, and I do not like to speaking in the general upset their recommendation without good reason. If we can devise a by which we can impose a proportionate barrelled gunwas too much. fixed duty which will give effect to the desire of the honourable member for South Sydney, I shall be prepared to adopt that course. But I do not wish to propose an ad valorem rate in conjunction with a specific duty without first hearing more about the matter.",25
157,Mr HEDGES,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Fremantle) [4.26] - In my opinion it is most unfair that a common gun should be called upon to bear the same duty as is a valuable weapon. It iswell known that one cannot purchase a, first class Purdey gun under about eighty guineas landed here. I do not agree with the honourable member for South Sydney that the use of an expensive gun is prompted by mere fancy. The very best value that can be offered to a man is to be found in a good gun.. Less than three years ago I saw a gun sold for about / [ 6 . It was so badly put together that the shot from the right barrel crossed the shot from the left. That defect is easily accounted for in the manufacture of a gun. Some persons imagine that the barrels of a gun are straight. But, as a matter of fact, in a double-barrelled weapon they are crooked. I suggest that a fixed duty should be imposed upon pea rifles, revolvers, &c. In mv judgment, pea rifles are the most dangerous weapons in use in Australia today. They carry much further than one would think, and almost daily we read of accidents occurring through their use. - Mr JOHNSON - That is only because they are in the hands of inexperienced persons.",25
158,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Flannelett e is much more dangerous.,25
159,Mr HEDGES,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"But one does not shoot with flannelette. I did not refer to flannelette in any way; and if the Minister considers there is anything humorous in my remarks he is at liberty to go outside and think about them. I suggest that on all guns up to, say, the value of £ 3 , a fixed duty shall be imposed, with an ad valorem duty on guns over that value. It is not fair that a farmer or a rabbiter should be asked to pay the same duty on his low-priced gun as is paid by the pigeon shot, who uses high-class fire-arms as a.",25
160,Mr STORRER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Bass) [4.32] - When Tariff disvery cussion, I expressed the opinion that means a duty of IIS . on a cheap doubleThose who live in the back blocks have not many shillings to spare, and they require guns to rid themselves of rabbits and other pests. For such purposes a gun at 27s. 6d. or .30s. is quite sufficient; and my own opinion is that there ought to be a duty of 15 and 10 per cent., which would tax the man who prefers to use a weapon at £ 4 2 . We have heard much about bad guns and accidents which occur; but most accidents arise from the fact that the people who use the weapons do not understand them, or do not exercise sufficient care - I may say that only a few weeks ago I was lent a gun, the cost of which was 27s. 6d., and I shot with it as well as I have ever shot with much more expensive weapons. move That after the figures "" us.,"" paragraph A, the words "" and on and after 15th November, 1907 (General Tariff), ad. val., 15 per cent.,"" be inserted.",25
161,Mr REID,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"East Sydney) [4-35]-have listened with great interest to the debate; and I now understand how it is that I have never been really successful as a shot. The explanation of the honor-, able member for Fremantle shows how it is that I have never been able to hit anything alive. I once shot a bird 100 yards off on the top of a tree, but when it came down it proved to have been dead for years. On another occasion I nearly shot myself, and on a third occasion I nearlyshot my friend. My eye and my aim were right, but I must have had one of those guns to which the honourable member refers; and I am glad to . have the matter cleared up. I think that the proposal of the honourable member for Bass is The simplest way out of the difficulty. As that honourable member, and also the honourable member for South Sydney, said, a matter of 2s. or 3s. cannot make any difference; and we have no object in imposing a duty of us., which would be a heavy impost in the case of a cheap gun. As the honourable member for Bass has said, the people who use these cheap guns are those whom we do not desire to tax to any extent.",26
162,Mr TUDOR,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Yarra) [4.37] - I favour the suggestion for a small fixed duty, and an ad valorem duty similar to that imposed - on bicycles, pianos, and other articles. I hold the further bpinion that there ought to be some establishment where fire-arms can be tested. I have here a price list of imported sporting guns, and in that I. read the following description of a gunHlack steel or imitation Damascus barrels, left choke, top lever, extension rib, single bolt, rebounding locks, case-hardened frame, chequered snap fore end, walnut stock with chequered straight or pistol grip, steel heel plate, £1. These prices are subject to a trade discount of 10 per cent., and of 2 per cent, for prompt cash. I have also here two samples of gun barrels given to me by a gun repairer, who is interested neither as an importer nor as a maker. One sample is a portion of an imitation Damascus barrel, and is painted to look like ordinary steel; and the other sample is a portion of a real Damascus barrel. I repeat that if all the cheap guns could be tested at the Customs House many deaths would be prevented, I and the additional cost would not be by any means serious. The gun repairer to whom I have referred gave evidence before the Tariff Commission,- and he showed that the imitation barrel is practically an iron pipe painted, and must be 1 a source of danger. This is not a fiscal question; and I think it ought to be treated just as we treated the question of the importation of opium, when dealing with the last Tariff, merely regarding it from the point of view of the safety of the public. We ought to impose a duty which will restrict, as far as possible, the importation of dangerous guns. My own opinion is that it would be better to admit the guns absolutely free, and to have them tested, than to impose a duty without requiring any guarantee. There haye been accidents in the case of guns used by rifle clubs;. and we know that the average Australian boy runs great danger when he buys a gun for jQi and goes out for a holiday.",26
163,Mr JOHNSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,There ought to be a certain standard of gun.,26
164,Mr TUDOR,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,That is so; there ought to be an examination to insure that the standard is observed.,26
165,Mr HEDGES,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Fremantle) [4.40] The fact of a barrel being called a "" Damascus "" has very little to do with the matter, because some of the highest class barrels are steel. I have been shooting with steel-barrelled guns for seventeen or eighteen years without any danger to myself ; and that proves that we must not take too much notice of the samples which have been produced. The portion of the barrel submitted by the honourable member for Yarra as Damascus steel of the highest quality shows evidence of being a portion of a gun that has burst, whereas the other barrel, which is supposed to be rubbish, has not burst. Any decent gun, at the back of the breech, is stamped with the mark of a test made in England.",26
166,Mr FOWLER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,But there are many inferior guns which come from Belgium and elsewhere.,27
167,Mr MALONEY,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Gun s of that kind have been introduced into Victoria, and here stamped with the names of English makers.",27
168,Mr HEDGES,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"My experience is that shooters require examination more than do guns. I can assure honourable members that nine-tenths of the men who go out shooting have no idea of what is a proper charge. If I were shooting with a common gun tomorrow, I would not use the same charge that I would in the case of a high-class gun; and there is very little danger in any gun if it be properly used. I should like to see a fixed duty upon pea rifles, revolvers, and similar weapons, with an ad valorem - duty on ordinary guns. I prefer the old duty, but, on consideration, [ shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bass.",27
169,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Trea surer) [4.45] - I think that the rates proposed are rather low. An average value for a gun is £ 3 , on which an ad valorem duty of 10 per cent, would come to only 6s. It is very much by chance that one gets a good gun at a low figure; I know that from experience. Some of the cheap guns are really dangerousI t would be a good thing if , as suggested by the honourable member for Yarra, all guns could be tested; but that is impossible.",27
170,Mr WATSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,The worse guns come from the Continent.,27
171,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,I am not sure that that is so. Some very poor guns come from Great Britain.,27
172,Mr JOHNSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Coul d we not insist that all imported guns be marked in a way which would guarantee their soundness?,27
173,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"I do not think so. While an ad valorem duty of 10 per cent, comes to a great deal on a forty guinea gun, it would amount to nothing at all on a £ 1 gun.",27
174,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Thoroughl y ferred to are pop-guns, not pistols. sound guns can be bought for £ 2 ' each.",27
175,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"It is only, by chance that one gets a good gun at that price. I would prefer the imposition of small fixed rates in addition to the ad valorem rates.",27
176,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Such rates would not keep out cheap guns. Amendment agreed to. Amendments (by Mr STORRER) agreed to.

180,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [4.48] - I think that it would be better to fix the rates at 20 and 15 per cent. ad valorem, or 2s. pd. and 2s. 6d. each, whichever may be the liigher. Some of the weapons in this category are very expensive, and to them the ad valorem rates would apply, while the fixed rates would be.charged on cheap weapons. - Mr BOWDEN (Nepean) [4.50] - I have been informed that under this pro vision the Customs authorities are charging duty on children's toy pistols, used to fire paper caps, as if they were real pistols.

182,Mr BATCHELOR,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Boothby) [4.52] I think that the fixed rates - proposed2s. pd. and 2s. 6d - ar e too high; because it must be remembered that many of the weapons to which they apply are largely used by orehardists to keep down sparrows, starlings, and other similar pests during the fruit season, when a large number, of boys are kept busy shooting..",27

198,Mr FOWLER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"It seems to me that paragraph D as it stands imposes specific duties on the two items. There is a conSTORRER) pro- siderable trade done in Australia in building sporting guns. The industry is a perfectly legitimate one, and is carried on in other parts of the world by men who are gun-buil.ders rather than gun-makers. The barrels are prepared and the stocks are roughed out, and the parts are finished off and put together by the gun-builder. A man who can afford it finds it advantageous to have a gun built to suit his own particular physique, and I do not think that the Committee for the sake of securing an insignificant amount of revenue should do anything to interfere with the industry.",28
199,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,North - If we allow the barrels and actions mentioned in paragraph D to be not subjected to a very low rate of duty,28

Under the old Tariff there were certainly a large number of anomalies in this connection, and I think that the gas companies had good ground for complaining that the electric companies were favoured by reason of a good many of their accessories being admitted free.",30

225,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"I wish to see fair play done as between these competing companies.

I can assure the honourable member for Hindmarsh that we are making lamps in brass, nickel plate, ancl tin.",30

245,Mr REID,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"East Sydney) [5.27] - I think we must all congratulate the Post-. master-General upon having at last offered his aid to the Treasurer in the gigantic task which he has undertaken. I am very much obliged to the Postmaster-General for the statement which he has made. confess that I was not aware that lamps were being made in the Commonwealth, and it is a revelation to me to learn that a duty of 15 per cent, is sufficient to protect an expanding industry. In spite of all the .differences between the alleged starvation wages paid in the Mother Country and the wages paid in Australia, it now appears that a duty of 15 per cent, is sufficient to allow our Australian artisans to create an expansive industry. I have always heard it contended by Ministers that a 15 per cent, duty was a revenue duty.",31
246,Mr MAUGER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Upon some articles it is.,31

We have been told by the Postmaster-General that 15 per cent, is a sufficient protection for this industry.",31
250,Mr MAUGER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,- I did not say I take what I can get.,31
251,Mr REID,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Surely , when the Treasurer is flinging about duties of 40 per cent, and 50 per cent, for the benefit of Ausmake the tralian manufacturers, he ought not to grudge the lamp-makers a fair measure of protection.",31
252,Mr MAUGER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,It is the honourable member who grudges the protection.,31
253,Mr REID,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"On the contrary, I wish the lamp-makers every prosperity, and do not propose to oppose the item. I merely point out that the protectionist wing of the Commission suggested 15 per cent, as sufficient by way of a general duty. That wing of the Commission took an enormous amount of trouble over these items; and I should.like to hear from the Chairman, whether, in his opinion, 15 per cent, is a proper protection.",31
254,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Hear , hear; ft is quite enough.",31
255,Mr REID,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"We now have the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, supported by the Postmaster-General, saying that 15 I per cent, is quite enough.",31
256,Mr WISE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,But is the Chairman of the Tariff Commission prepared to reduce that duty in order to give a preference to Great Britain ?,31
257,Mr REID,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"The question of preference was not considered by the Tariff Commission, and, therefore, British goods were included in the 15 per cent. In view of the statement of the honourable member for Bendigo, I wonder whether the Treasurer noted this particular recommendation of the protectionist wing of the Tariff Commission.",31
258,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Yes ; I saw the recommendation.,31
259,Mr REID,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Do we get many bf these articles from countries other than Great Britain ?,31
260,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Oh , yes.",31
261,Mr REID,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Then we can help the British manufacturer to the extent of 10 per cent.; and that, at any rate, is one recommendation of the proposal. But I am afraid that a duty of 25 per cent, will have a tendency to raise prices beyond the extent warranted by protection; and I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that those who use kerosene lamps are those who have the fewest comforts of life. I should be glad to see this duty made 15 per cent.",31
262,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Bendigo) [5.34] In regard to lamps and lampware, the proso; but tectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended an all-round duty of 15 per cent., thus practically consolidating the old duties of 15 and 20 per cent. This was done on the ground that there were no applications by, or on behalf of, any lamp manufacturer for any increased duty. We therefore decided to adhere to the old duty; and it certainly could not be sugai gested that the lamp industry was a strangled one. I believe that most of the lamps and lampware which come into competition with local manufacturers are from the United Kingdom; and, therefore, this proposed preference of 10 per cent, against the foreigner will not be very operative, though it may be operative some extent. The Tariff Commission no mandate to consider the question of preference, but I do not see that will be done by giving a light preference against the foreigner; and, therefore, I not strenuously oppose the proposal. ' I have no objection to the proposal to elimifor nate arc - lamps and -.incandescent lamps work. from this group. I think., however, that the attention of the Treasurer might be directed to paragraph 10 of the report the protectionist section of the Commission, where the whole subject of the conflicting views and interests of gascompanies and electric light companies, with regard their supplies, is fully taken into consideraexperiment. tion. I submit the recommendation which we made to the attention of the Treasurer tection. and his officers. I admit the problem is a difficult one, and that it requires careful and calm consideration. Paragraph the report is as followsThat electroliers, electric wall brackets, brackets and gasoliers, globe holders and tors, brass pendants and brackets, photometers, incandescent lamps and gas mantles, reflectors, arc lamps and globes, testing instruments and meters, should be classed together, and subject the same rate of duty, whether used in connection with gas or electric light. No very high duties were suggested, cause some of the articles cannot be made here. But I think there ought to be some approximation in the grouping of articles.",31
263,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Especiall y articles used for the same purpose.,32
264,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Quite so. Legiscognate lation ought not to favour one particular group. group of manufacturers at the expense of another group; and if I had the framing of this Tariff, I should consider what would be a fair all-round duty covering these articles. The same duties should be operative for gasoliers, brackets, pendants, and so ""forth, as for incandescent lamps and arc lamps. I do not see why onelighting group should-be free, and the other should be taxed for revenue purposes. Therefore, under item 180 ? I consider that arc lamps and lamps ought to bear duties approximating to those on the other articles I have mentioned. I should like the Treasurer to look this paragraph and consult his officers as to whether there cannot be a new item covering this cognate group of materials. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane)- [5.38] The Treasurer, I understand, moves that arc lamps and incandescent lamps shall be omitted from this item; but I ask him whether lie is quite certain that they canto not be made in Australia. had Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I have no .information on the point, and the inference is any harm that they cannot be made here.",32

268,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,The proprietors say that they could not make arc lamps under 10 of a duty of 50 per cent.,32
269,Colonel FOXTON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,I was not sure that gas the lamps thus referred to by the proprieadaptors of the works were the same lamps that we have now under consideration.,32
270,Mr KNOX,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Kooyong) [5.41] - I point to out to the honourable member for Brisbane that the object of the Treasurer's amendment is not to enable arc lamps and incanbedescent lamps to evade any duty. but merely to transfer these to item 180, the consideration of which will afford the honourable member the opportunity he may desire to propose a higher duty. What the Treasurer desires to do"" is to bring all these articles as far as possible into one",32
271,Colonel FOXTON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,I understood that the idea was to make these articles free.,32
272,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,No ; it is a mere all transposition to another item.,32

274,Mr BOWDEN,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Nepean) [5.47] - As the honourable member ior Bendigo has pointed out, lamps and fittings for gas or electric light should be treated in the same way.",33
275,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"I do not agree with the honourable member. Gas lamps and fittings are made in Australia to an enormous extent, but electric lighting requisites are not.",33
276,Mr BOWDEN,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"B y imposing different duties on gas and electric lamps and fittings we are differentiating in favour of the electric lighting companies acrainst the putgas companies, and I do not think that we should take sides in that way. Therefore, I move That after the words "" 25 per cent.,"" paragraph D, the words "" and on and after 15th November, 1907 (General Tariff), ad val., 5 per cent.,"" be inserted.

277,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [5.50] - I cannot accept the amendment. I am grouping together the items affecting electric lighting requisites, and am making the rates on such requisites as - low as possible, because these things have to be imported. But I should be doing a great injury to the many manufacturers of gas lamps and accessories if I were to reduce these rates. The gas companies are not at a disadvantage, because they can purchase their requisites from Australian manufacturers. "" Mr MCWILLIAMS (Franklin) [5.52]. - Undoubtedly , as the Tariff stands, users of gas are at a disadvantage, because, of course, the gas companies will pass on to their customers any duties that may preiudicially affect them, and in many towns it is impossible to get anything but gas light. The honourable member for Nepean is right in saying that we should not differentiate between electric lighting and gas companies. Neither should we differentiate between the users of gas and electric light j and I urge the Minister to treat them alike. If the Tariff is to last for any time-and we all hope that it willit must be consistent.",33
278,Mr MAUGER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"I have just fitted up my own house with Australian-made gasoliers and lamps, which were cheaper and better than the imported articles.",33

285,Mr FRAZER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"That is so; but in many towns where there is no gas supply electrical plants have been installed, and electrical stoves may be used. That being so, I think that a reduction of the duty originally proposed on such stoves is desirable.",34

"" Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Then the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was under a misapprehension, believing, apparently, that they would come under paragraph A or paragraph B, and be dutiable at 25 per cent, and 15 per cent. We certainly ought not to go beyond those duties, and there should be no distinction between electrical and gas stoves, which are each largely used in order that the heat of wood or coal fires may be avoided. We should endeavour to cheapen these stoves as much as possible, and that being so I am prepared to support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Corangamite.",34
288,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Melbourne Ports) [6.13] - At one time about ten firms were engaged in the gas stove industry in Melbourne, and were doing well. The Metropolitan Gas Company, however, has for some time been supplying mostof the stoves used in the metropolis, and within the last twelve months or two years has imported over 2,000 stoves of a cheap class. The result is that they have practically ruined the gas stove industry in 'Victoria. I have seen stoves imported by them which are inferior to those of local manufacture. That being so, I hope that the Committee will agree to the duty proposed by the Government so that the industry may again be placed in a flourishing condition. We are able to make a first class stove at a reasonable price, but the local production has been run off the market by the importation of cheap stoves.",35
289,Mr FRAZER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Kalgoorlie) [6.15] When I previously addressed the Committee, I was under the impression that if the Treasurer succeeded in eliminating the words ""electrical stoves"" from this item, they woulcl f all automatically either under paragraph A or paragraph B.",35
290,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"No . They will be included in a new paragraph, under which they will be subject to the same rates of duty.",35
291,Mr FRAZER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"When I intimated that X would support the Government proposal, I believed that I was supporting a duty 25 per cent, under the General Tariff, of 15 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. From my own experience, I can say that if there is one necessity to which we might extend special consideramonopolies tion this is it. By doing so we shall give to the housewives of Australia cheaper apthe small ones? pliances 'for cooking purposes, and this will be of great advantage in the hotter portions of the Continent. I i i my opinion, the Government might reasonthey ably consider the propriety of reducing rate of duty proposed upon the manufactured tures of Great Britain by 5 per cent. They would thus be rendering a service to the. - housewives of the Commonwealth, without by way of illustration. prejudicing the position of any worker.",35
292,Mr CARR,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Macquarie) [6.18] - I should like to have an assurance from the Treasurer that electrical appliances and gas stoves will be subjected to the same rate of duty, after the proposed transfer has. been effected.",35
293,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Bendigo) [6.19] - I wish to explain the reasons which prompted the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission in recommending 20 per cent, duties upon these articles. A Melbourne brassworker stated that electric radiators were dutiable at 1 2 per cent, as electrical ap1 pliances, while hot water radiators were dutiable at 20 per cent, as manufactures of metals. In his opinion both articles were used for heating purposes, and should be subject to the same impost. It was upon that ground that we recommended a duty of 20 per cent. There was no suggestion that a 30 per cent, rate should be levied against the foreigner. Mr Danks suggested that a uniform duty should be levied upon this class of manufactures. No preference was recommended, and, therefore, I do not feel justified in voting for the Government proposal.",35
294,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [6.20] - I should like to know whether the honourable member for Bendigo intended to convey that he would support a duty of 20 per cent, under the General Tariff, and of 15 per cent, under the Tariff for Great Britain?",35
295,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"No . I am in favour of a 20 per cent, duty all round.",35

298,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"I would point out to the honourable member that the proposed duty is only 20 per cent, upon the of manufactures of the Mother Country. The and Government will adhere to their proposal.",35
299,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Hindmarsh) [6.21]. - I trust that the Government will stand by their proposal. The gas companies are,35
300,Mr WILSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"The big companies, or",35
301,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"They are all monopolies, and they ought to be sufficiently patriotic to purchase everything that possibly can in Australia. There is the no doubt that gas stoves can be manufaclocally. As a matter of fact, they have been so manufactured. Let me point to the case of the Adelaide Gas Company That company scarcely knows what to do with its income, because it is limited in regard to the payment of its dividends. It oould afford to pay higher prices for gas. stoves than it would generally be called upon to pay.",35
302,Mr ARCHER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,How about the hard-up companies ?,36
303,Mr HUTCHISON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"They are few and far between. Under the operation of the duty proposed even those companies would not be at any disadvantage compared with the wealthy companies, I trust that the Committee will support the Treasurer. Mr HANS IRVINE [6,24] - I think that the Treasurer might agree to accept a. duty of 25 per cent, under the General Tariff, and of 20 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. These rates, I think, would be sufficient for all purposes.",36
304,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [6.25] - I understand that the honourable member for Bendigo is prepared to vote for a duty of 20 per cent, all round.",36
305,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,That is* so.,36
306,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"But , in connection with items of this kind, we have already granted a preference to the goods of the United Kingdom. In this instance we propose to extend them a preference of 10 per cent. If we reduce the rate under the General Tariff to 20 per cent, we shall be denying the Old Country a preference.",36
307,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Bendigo) [6.26] The members of the Tariff Commission were not instructed to frame a Tariff containing provision for the extension of preferential treatment to Great Britain. Consequently, we recommended a Tariff which in our opinion would be an effective one against the world. How can I be expected to vote for an increase in the duty above the standard which was recommended by my colleagues and myself? How can I be expected to vote for an increase of 5 per cent, upon the rate that we recommended, much less an. increase of 10 per cent. ?",36
308,Mr WISE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"If the honourable member takes up that position, he will deny himself the right to vote for a preference at all.",36

311,Unknown,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m. Amendment (by Mr WILSON) proposed - That after the words "" 30 per cent.,"" paragraph c, the words ""and on and after 15th November, 1907 (General Tariff), ad val., 20 per cent."" ; be inserted. Mr JOHNSON .(Lang) [7.45] - I should like to know the reason for the pro(Grampians) posed increase in the duty. As a matter of fact, lamp and gas stoves are manufactured here already in large quantities, and the only 'effect of an increased dutywould be to enable the local manufacturers to increase prices to the consumers. It is absurd to suppose that the manufacturers themselves are going to pay this duty; I do not think that the most rabid and unreasoning protectionist could believe that that is likely to be the result. If the duty be increased, there will be practically a monopoly given to the local trade. And who are the people who principally use these stoves, and who will have to pay the increased prices? They are the housewives of the middle and poorer classes, especially in the country districts, where there is not the advantage of - gas and electric lighting. ' Instead of increasing the burdens of these people, we ought to relieve them, if possible, in the way of reduced prices. It was my original intention to move a reduction of the duties to 12\ ancl 10 per cent.",36
312,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,I had hoped the duty would be increased.,36
313,Mr JOHNSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"I suppose the honourable member is perfectly consistent, as a protectionist, in taking up that attitude. I remind the honourable member, however, that the protection already afforded has been m'ore than ""ample for this flourishing industry.",36
314,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Not now.,36
315,Mr JOHNSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Some of the local stoves have attained a reputation which enables them to withstand any competition.,36
316,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,The local stoves arc better than imported stoves.,36
317,Mr JOHNSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"If that be so, it fortifies my argument in favourof a reduction of the duty. Australian stoves of various makers have attained a reputation that is worthy of all credit; but the fact merely shows that there is no need for any further protection. Under the old Tariff the duty was 1 2 and 15 per cent.; and 1 the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission with every inclination to do so could not see their way clear to recommend a higher duty than 20 per cent., which, in itself, is a substantial increase. Yet in face of this recommendation the Government proposes a further increase of 10 per cent., thus more than doublingthe old duty. I do not think that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission consisted of protectionists any less ardent than protectionists in this chamber; and we must remember that the former had the advantage of being able to sift all the details of the industry with the assistance of sworn testimony. We may depend that they fully informed themselves before making any recommendation; and I think that protectionists might rely on their decision as fair and reasonable.",36
318,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,My knowledge of the loss of trade suffered by local manufacturers is evidence enough for me.,37
319,Mr JOHNSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"That loss of trade must surely be due to defects in management, or the absence of proper appliances. The honourable, member has just said that certain Australian firms produced stoves better than those imported; and, in face of that fact, it is difficult to understand how there can be a greater demand for an inferior article.",37
320,Mr CARR,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,The inferior article is cheaper.,37
321,Mr JOHNSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"The imported article cannot be much cheaper when we consider insurance, freight, and other charges, which constitute a very considerable natural protection. In addition, the local manufacturers have hitherto had the advantage of duties of 12 J and 15 per cent.",37
322,Mr CARR,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Whateve r the advantage, it Crouch, R. A . did not operate.",37
323,Mr JOHNSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"I think the* honor- .Groom, L . E. able member is mistaken. He may be Lyne, right so far as one or two isolated cases are concerned, but, speaking generally, I do not think it can be denied that there is a large and profitable trade done locally. If the industry has already been thoroughly established under the old duty, I do not see what more can be expected under an increased duty, beyond a monopoly which, as invariably happens, must result in obsolete methods, lack of enterprise in the direction of improvement, and failure to keep pace with progress in manufacture in other parts of the world which produce under the stimulus of freer competition.",37
324,Mr CARR,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,It is very hard for small manufacturers to form a monopoly.,37
325,Mr JOHNSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"The honourable mem!x;r may be right, but the bigger ones who form combines can buy them out or crush them. I know there would be no hope of carrying an amendment to reduce the duties to 12^ and 10 per cent., and I do not desire to divide the Committee unnecessarily.

331,Mr MALONEY,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"My information is that NOES. the patent rights have expired, both here and in England. That is evidenced by the fact that prices have gone down.",38
332,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Prices have been going down for years. I understand that the company still holds some patents in Great Britain, though I am not sure about it. The prices charged for mantles here are about Twice as high as those charged in Great Britain. The mantles are not easily imported, because any heavy shock will break them, and large losses are sometimes incurred by breakages in PAIRS. the cases. The local manufacture consists merelv of dipping what is known as the stocking, which is made of textile material, and is imported ready for use, into a solution of mineral earths, also prepared in Great Britain, and imported.. The stocking is impregnated by The mixture and Page, J. allowed to dry, and the fabric having been consumed by the application of a match, what we know as the mantle remains. . Mr Reid - A glorious industry !",38
333,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"The use of mantles undoubtedly reduces the consumption of gas inproportion to the light obtained, and therefore should be made as general as possible by the cheapening of these articles. I know of no reason for increasing the duty. A duty of 15 per cent, added to the cost of importing-and we have to remember that there are many breakages in connection with the shipment of these mantles to Australia-ough t to be ample protection. I do not know that the industry, such as it is, has not been successfully carried on in Australia; and the only competition which it seems to have to meet is that of the English branch of the .Welsbach Company, which also carries on business in Australia. The one object of imposing this duty, it seems to me, is to enable the price to be increased. Consumers will thus be penalized. The fact that this co-called industry is carried on in Sydney does not affect my view of what is the right course to take.

That being so,' we have in this case an opportunity to extend some little consideration to the people without damaging - an industry of any great consequence. The industry will not be injured by the reduction of the duty to 15. per cent., because the protectionist section of the .Commission seemed to think that such a duty would fairly protect it.

384,Mr JOHNSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Lang) [8.54.] - I for think that honourable members who support this duty cannot have read the evidence less given before the Tariff .Commission, or from they would have seen that no manufacturers asked for anything like the promemposed duty. This form of lead is used lead most extensively in building; and the duty less will mean increasing the cost to those be obworking men, amongst others, who desire to get out of the clutches of the landlord by building their own homes. Every endeavour of the kind on the part of the . people ought to be encouraged. Recently [ had occasion to obtain estimates for the building of a house, and was just about to sign a contract, when the architect informed me that the price of lead, amongst other items, had increased in consequence of the Tariff. As a - matter of fact, I found that, under the new conditions, the building would cost me nearly £10 0 more. Eveiy man who has only his daily wage - to depend on tries to acquire a little home of his own; and this Tariff will mean an additional handicap in his struggle to get free. The Treasurer has not shown a single reason why the proposed duty should be imposed. He did tell us that it was recommended by the Tariff Commission; but he omitted to say that the recommendation was only that of the protectionist section. When we look at the evidence on which that recommendation was made, we find that not a single person interested asked for anything like the proposed duty. In the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission we. readA Victorian witness who represented several other manufacturers, suffested that a duty of to per cent, should be placed on imports from the United Kingdom, and a duty of 15 per cent, on imports from other countries (Coop, Q.70711 ; Mcllwraith, Q.70796). An alternative duty was proposed, viz., 25s. per ton on products from the United Kingdom and 30s. per ton against other countries-(Mcllwraith , Q'.70797-98). The New Soutli Wales manufacturers suggested that the duty on British products sliould be is. per cwt., and that on manufactures from other countries is. 6d. per cwt -(Crane, Q.81421). It will be seen that the highest duty asked for was 30s.; and when we return to the report of the free-trade section of the Commission we are toldThe rate of 25s., it was stated, would entirely prevent the introduction of manufactures of lead into Australia. The extra rate suggested over the protection against Great Britain was, one witness admitted, ""merely a sort of ornamental demonstration of the Empire's unanimity."" I should like the Treasurer to show me where there is a scintilla of evidence to justify the duty now proposed.",42
385,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Trea surer) [9.0] - I shall not feel very sore if this duty is reduced. Perhaps it would be well to impose ad valorem rates of 15 or 10 per cent.,43
386,Mr WILSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"An ad valorem rate of 10 per cent, on lead would be equivalent to £ 2 a ton.",43

390,Mr BATCHELOR,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Boothby) [9.3] In my opinion, if we impose a duty the effect will be to induce the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, the largest, and, practically, the only producers of lead in Australia, to take advantage of it by manufacturing their lead into sheet lead and lead piping. If they did so, they would soon get rid of all competitors, because the present manufacturers would have to import their raw material. Therefore, if the Committee wishes to do a good turn to those engaged in the making of sheet lead and. lead piping, it will allow these ma; terials to be admitted .duty free. Mr .CARR (Macquarie) [9.5] - I endorse the view of the honourable member for Boothby. The position of the company to which he has referred is an instance of the manner in which monopolies grow up as the result of exclusive control of natural opportunity, and are not necessarily the creation of either protection or free-trade. It seems to me that the manufacturers of sheet lead and lead piping have a sufficient natural protection in the cost of importation. We need not fear over-importation, because there is not an over-production of lead.",43
391,Mr STORRER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Bass) [9.7]- I hope that the Committee will not be influenced by the suggestion that the wealthy companv to which reference has been made will, if the duty be agreed to, commence to manufacture its lead into sheet lead and lead piping, and destroy the business of those who are now manufacturing these articles. The same argument might have been used when we were discussing the duties on woollen piece, goods. It might then have heen said that their effect would be to induce the Australian woollen mills to commence the business of making up their woollens into clothing, to the detriment Or those now engaged in that business - It must be borne in mind that, although, we have now only one lead mine, others may be discovered in the future.

Seven or eight of the materials or implements used by butter factories have already been taxed, and those interested in viticulture certainly ought not to be subjected to further taxation. .

Then, again, pasteurizers are absolutely essential to the successful making of butter for export, and milk testers must be used to determine the proportion of butter fat in the milk supplied by dairymen to the factories. Since we have recently agreed to a bounty to encourage the production of cotton in Australia, I fail to see why cotton gins should be dutiable. The same remark will apply to fibre scutching machines. Handworked rakes and ploughs combined, hay tedders, horse-rakes, - lucerne bunchers, maize harvesters, and maize binders' open up a delightful vista of farm life. Milking machines are absolutely essential to dairyman. Potato raisers or diggers are made, to some extent, in Australia, a patent having been secured in respect of them. As to sub-surface packers, I would point out that they are essential to the development of the arid districts of Australia, which cannot be properly farmed unless on the American principle of subsurface packing. Senator MCColl, when a member of this House, made a most interesting speech with regard to the use of these implements. They are not made here, and I think that the Minister might well give way in regard to this duty. For the most part, these implements and machines are imported from foreign countries.",44
400,Mr ARCHER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Capricornia) [9.26] The chief reason advanced by the Treasurer for proposing this duty of 10 per cent, was the exceedingly lame one that the Government desired to give a preference to British imports. This, after all, is simply a revenue duty. During the consideration of the Tariff I have supported the Government in regard to all revenue producing duties that were fair in their incidence. In this case, however, the duty will fall solely upon the farming community, and there is no excuse for it. We undoubtedly hope to make the farmer one of the pillars of our national prosperity. We look to him to build up a sturdy yeomanry, which will be the backbone of the country, and this is a tax for which the least possible excuse can be offered. The farmer has a big fight against climatic difficulties, and has to labour under many other disabilities. The preference proposed to be given to Great Britain in this case cannot be of any effect, for the simple reason that most of the machines covered by the item are patented and of foreign manufacture.",45
401,Mr WH IRVINE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,The last things in respect of which we ought to give a preference.,45
402,Mr ARCHER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Quite so. The fact that many of these machines are patented in other countries is in .itself sufficient to demolish the argument of the Minister that the duty will enable us to give a preference of any value to the Old Country, and I hope that the Committee will vigorously oppose the item.",45
403,Mr HUGHES,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"West Sydney) [9.28] There seems to be no justification for the imposition of this duty. Taking the first machine mentioned in the item, cream separators, every one knows that the bulk the of those used throughout Australia are of foreign origin. The same remark applies to a very large proportion of the other implements in the item. This duty can be imposed only as a revenue tax; it must fall upon those who are engaged, in primary industries, and for that reason I shall oppose it. By the time that it reaches the consumer, I dare say that, at the very least, it will.be equal to an impost of 15 per cent., and that in respect of a machine foi which a man has to pay £3°> £ 4 0 , ot £ $ o , is a serious item. The Prime Minister' said the other day that he was prepared to ask Parliament to find £200,000 to encourage immigration. Surely we are not going to ask those already on the land to find the money to bring other people here. The poor man, struggling on the soil to obtain a living, should not be asked to put his hand in his pocket for that purpose. I hope that the Treasurer will consent to the item being made free.",45
404,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"North Sydney) [9.30] - On behalf of the honourable member for Angas, I propose to move That after the word ""combined"" the words "" or separately; also hand-worked cultivators,"" be inserted. I would point out to the Treasurer that, under the old Tariff, handworked cultivators were exempt from duty. Sir ""WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [9.32] - Some honourable members appear to take exception to a portion of this item, and especially to the duty upon cream separators.",45
405,Mr ARCHER,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,We take exception to the whole of it.,45
406,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member cannot have read it. It contains a large number of articles which are being manufactured locally. I will consent to the postponement of the item, and will go through it carefully again, with a view to seeing what articles enumerated - should bear a duty.",45
407,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Will the Treawealth. surer take into consideration the articles which I have mentioned?,46
408,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Yes . The item mitted free. will be dealt with before this division is passed-probabl y next week. I therefore move- . Thut the item be postponed.,46
409,Mr LIDDELL,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Hunter) [9-35J-- ob- 1 ject to this backing and filling on the part of the Treasurer. It is all very well for him to say that he will postpone the consideration of this item, but surely he ought discretion. to have devoted some attention to it before the Tariff schedule was submitted. In judgment, the item ought not to be posthurdle poned, because, in the interim, duty is being collected upon the articles specified. We know that cream . separators are a very important factor in the dairying industry, and it is not right that'the which has been invested in them should tied up in this way. These separators canthat not be made in Australia at the presentmoment.",46
410,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"We could deal with another item to-night if the honourable member would give wav. Mr LIDDELL . ' - If the Treasurer will give me his binding promise that if cream separators be subsequently placed upon the free list, a refund will be made of the duty .paid in the interim, I shall be satisfied. ; Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I ask the honourable member to allow the item to",46
411,Mr LIDDELL,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"When the Treasurer asks me in that way, I must consent. ' Mr Wilks (Dalley) [9-39J- I onty wish that honourable members had been anxious to postpone the consideration duties levied upon food supplies, apparel, and hats, as they. are to defer the consiby-laws, free. deration of this item. What know is whether the proposal of the Treasurer is really a skilful retreat upon his part for the purpose of placing articles upon the free list.",46
412,Mr TILLEY BROWN,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,That is what it,46
413,Mr WILKS,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"If so, I should oppose the motion which he has submitted. I am led to believe that, whilst we can produce the most complicated machinery in Austratools lia, and also the most intricate woollen goods,- we cannot manufacture a potato raiser. By their votes, protectionist bers of this Committee admit that such articles as potato raisers or diggers, potato ' farmer. sorters, root cutters, pulpers, and graters, not to mention sheep-shearing machines, cannot be manufactured in the Common",46
414,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"All those articles, if of British origin, will be ad",46
415,Mr WILKS,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"I am quite aware of that. When the last Tariff was under consider a"" tion, I fought strenuously for free-trade, but, upon the present occasion, T have been given a free hand by my constituents in regard to the fiscal question.",46
416,Mr SAMPSON,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,The honourable member cannot blame others for exercising a similar,46
417,Mr WILKS,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"It is significant that some my honourable members who did not baulk at a of 50 per cent, are greatly concerned about one .of .10 per cent. Only last evening, a. section of this Committee was very grieved over the loss of revenue which had been sustained by reason of the reduction money of various duties. Here is a chance for be them to grieve' again. .Po I understand this proposal means a skilful retreat - on the part of the Treasurer?",46
418,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"No . I should be very much obliged to the honourable member if he would allow the motionto pass, because I have no desire to sit late to-night. If I get this and the free items through, I shall be prepared to adjourn.",46

420,Mr REID,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"East ""Sydney) [9.46] - I should like to invite the attention of honourable members to the duties that are imas posed on agricultural machinery and ap- . of the pliances. Item 167 isMachine Tools, as prescribed by departmental I wish to And item 169 is Tools of Trade, for the use of artisans and mechanics and Tools in general use as prescribed all these by departmental by-laws, free. Under these two items the Treasurer, on the is. day the Tariff was unfolded, made free of duty hundreds of machine tools and tools of trade used in the different protected industries of Australia. Amongst these were the of tinsmiths, vehicle makers, harness makers, nainters, and many others, and they amount to hundreds of tools. Now, memsurely the articles mentioned in the item now before us are the tools of trade of the Why should those engaged in those trades which get a substantial benefit from the high protective duties have their tools placed on the free list, while the farmers of Australia, to whom, in the majority of cases, the Tariff is of absolutely no benefit, are heavily taxed on the tools they use? The principle which gives the city artisan and manufacturer tools of trade free ought to extend to the tools employed in the farming industry. In the case of apparel alone, there are some thirty free lines, and this is art industry which enioys protection to the extent of 45 per cent. Then, again, in the case of the boot and shoe industry, there are about fifty free lines, in spite of the enormous protection which is accorded to that industry. I hope the Committee, in dealing with agricultural implements and machinery, will apply the principle of making tools of trade free, always remembering that the farming community get very little substantial benefit out of the Tariff. Motion agreed to; item postponed. Item 156. Cutlery, of all kinds, n.e.i., including Plated CutleTy; Clippers; Knife Sharpeners;. Manicure Sets; but not cutlery in part or wholly made up of gold or silver, ad val. (General Tariff), 20 per' cent.; (United Kingdom), 15 per cent.  float "" clippers "" are included in this item. These clippers are surely a tool of trade of the barber an'd the horse clipper, and I think that they ought to be placed on the free list.",46
421,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,Surely most of these clippers are made in Australia?  used in the barbers' shops are imported.,47
422,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"If the item is . otherwise acceptable, I have no objection to omitting clippers.  posedThat the word "" clippers "" be left out. ' . Mr LIDDE LL (Hunter) [9.52] - I lowsnotice that manicure sets are included in this item. .",47
423,Mr WH IRVINE,IMPORTS OF IRON AND STEEL AND MANUFACTURES,"Peopl manicure sets can well afford to pay the duty. . Mr LIDDELL - Does the honourable member not know that manicure sets are chiefly used by young women, who engage themselves as manicurists? These sets are practically tools of trade, and we know what a hard struggle many women have to make a living. I think it most reasonable to suggest that these manicure sets should be placed on the free list. Amendment agreed to.  that the Treasurer will take care that in removing clippers from this item we do not place them in some other item where a higher duty may be imposed. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I take it that in deciding to omit clippers from the item our desire is that they shall be free. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 157 (Crucibles), and item 158 (Diving Apparatus), agreed to Item 1.59 (Nails), item 160 (Tanks), item 161 (Weighing Machines), item 162 (Marine ' Engines, Boilers,"". and Machinery, & c ) , item 163 (Steam Road Rollers), item 164 (Engines, including traction and portable, &c), postponed. Progress reported. NA QUALIFICATIONS BILL. Bill received from the Senate, and, 011 motion by Mr GROOM, read a first time. EXCISEPROCEDURE BILL. SECOND READING.",47
424,Mr GROOM,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [9.58] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This measure has been introduced as the President of the Arbitration Court had doubts as to his powers under the Excise Tariff Act 1906. Honourable members know that under that Act Excise duties are imposed on certain agricultural implements manufactured in Australia, but that there is exemption from duty on the part of those who obtain a declaration from the President of the Court of Arbitration to the effect that the goods have been manufactured under certain conditions. The section of the Act is as folProvided that this Act shall not apply to goods manufactured by any person in any part of the Commonwealth under conditions as to the ree who use muneration of labour, which(a) are declared by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament to be fair and reasonable; or (*) are in accordance with an industrial award under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904; o r (c) are in accordance with the terms of an industrial agreement filed under the Commonwealth Conciliation and A r bitration Act 1904; or (d) are, on an application made for the purpose to the President of the Commonwealth Courtof Conciliation and Arbitration, declared to be fair and reasonable by him or by a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State or any person or persons who compose a State Industrial Authority to whom he may refer the matter. The Bill deals wholly with matters of procedure, and does not interfere in the least with the fundamental principles of the Act of 1906. When Mr Justice Higgins came to adjudicate under the principal Act, he pointed out that it was doubtful whether he possessed the powers of a Judge sitting as President of the Arbitration Court, and the Bill has been introduced to declare, exactly what his powers shall be in regard to matters of procedure and evidence.",47
425,Mr WH IRVINE,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"Does the measure deal only with matters of evidence ? Mx. GROOM - Onl y with matters of procedure and evidence. At the present time His Honor is. sitting and adjudicating in accordance with the principles of the Excise Tariff Act of 1-906. When Mr. Justice O'Connor came to administer the Act,. he found it necessary to lay down a certain practice and procedure, which was printed and circulated, and has been f o l lowed by the Court in dealing with the different matters which have come before it . But a question has arisen as to the power of thePresident to .call in assessors to assist him, and to issue subpoenas requiring persons to give evidence. Mr - W. H. IRVINE - On initiative ?",48
426,Mr GROOM,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,Yes .,48
427,Mr REID,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,Thes e things might have been thought of when the original Act was being drafted.,48
428,Mr GROOM,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"It was ' thought then that the President would be able to exercise t.he powers of the President of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration: but as a doubt has arisen it is desirable to settle it by clearly defining his powers. The Bill adopts almost in their entirety the principles regarding procedure and evidence of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It declares that the Presidentin the hearing and determination of 'any application . . . . shall act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities or legal forms. He is left free to inform his mind from the best sources available to him, without being bound by the technical rules of evian dence. He may, at any stage of an applihis [""5] cation, appoint two assessors to advise him, one of whom is to be nominated by the applicant and the other nominated in the interest of the employees; and, in default of nomination by cither party, he may.appoint an assessor or assessors without nomination.",48
429,Mr WATSON,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"The Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides that either party may insist on the appointment of assessors. MT. GROOM - There we provide for litigation between two parties, but in this instance the Fresident is simply asked to declare whether certain conditions are fair and reasonable. It may be desirable, even if employees do not appear, for him to appoint some one to represent their interests, or to afford him assistance in dealing with their case, and he is, therefore, empowered to appoint an assessor or assessors at any time, even at the last moment, to assist him in framing his award. Clause 5 provides that, except by the consent of all parties, and by leave of the President, no partu shall be represented by counsel or solicitor.",48
430,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,Will agents be excluded ? .,48
431,Mr GROOM,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"It is necessary to allow parties to be represented by some one. If there were 1.50 employees concerned in an application, they could not all be expected to appear in person, and very often employers will hnd it convenient to be represented by their managers or other agents. his own Mr MCWILLIAMS - Then wall solicitors who have been struck off the roll be able to appear as agents? - Mr GROOM - The President has control of his own Court. The intention of the clause is to reduce the cost of . l it i gation. '",48
432,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,Is that a;i admission against the legal profession ?,48
433,Mr GROOM,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"No . In many ..Wages' Boards .proceedings it has been found desirable to obtain the assistance of members of the legal profession, and in many other instances the attempt to do without them has. increased expenditure. Mr W, H . IRVINE - It is likely to do so in this instance.",48
434,Mr GROOM,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"Perhaps so. The matter is left to the parties themselves, who will have to bear the. expense. The' provision was inserted . by the - Senate. Power is given to the President to issue order to any person to take evidence on behalf. That provision is made with a view to securing elasticity of administration, because it may be desirable to take evidence at some place remote from where - the Court"" is sitting. Seeing that these inquiries may often be confidential, no person taking evidence will be allowed to disclose, except to the President, such evidence relating to any trade secret, or to the profits or financial position of any witness or party. The President can prohibit the publication of evidence if he thinks fit.",48
435,Mr LIDDELL,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,Sta r chamber procedure !,49
436,Mr GROOM,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"Xo t at all. In many of these inquiries confidential information which the President is entitled to have will be put before him; but it may not be in the public interest that it should be published. What we aim at is the obtaining of fair and righteous decisions. The powers of the President will be the same as those of the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. He may refer technical matters, or matters of account, to experts, whose reports he can accept as evidence, and he will have power to summon witnesses, to take evidence on oath, and generally to give such directions as he may. deem fit or necessary. Clause 8 is a copy ot a similar provision in the Comrnonwea.lth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and deals with contempt, while clause 9 provides for the same penalties' for contempt by witnesses as are .provided for in that Act. Any one who disobeys a summons to appear, or refuses to be sworn as a witness, or to answer any question which he is required by the President to answer, or to produce any books or documents which he is so required to produce, will be liable to a penalty; but' no person is to be compelled to give evidence, except to the President, or'to the person ordered by him to take evidence on his behalf, relating to any trade secret, or to the profits or financial position of any witness or party.' - Such evidence is not to be. disclosed or published without the consent of the person entitled to the trade secret or non-disclosure. Section 10 provides ' for the protection of witnesses, making it an offence to use, cause, inflict, or procure under violence, punishment, damage, loss, or disadvantage to any one for having appeared as a witness. No employer may dismiss an employee because he has appeared' as a witness, and. no empl'ov-6 shall' cease to work in the service of an employer because of evidence given by him; In clause 13 penalties are provided for the. intimidation of witnesses, and under clause 15, where an application is referred by the President to a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State, or to a State industrial authority, the Judge or authority' shall have all the powers and privileges vested, in or imposed on the President. Clause 16 empowers the Presir dent to make regulations prescribing practice and procedure on applications; but these are to be subject to the approval of the Governor General. The Bill deals wholly with procedure, the principles followed being those of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The President is given just, the amount of power necessary to enable him to make the proper investigations required by the Excise Tariff Act. It has been found necessary in the administration of that Act to confer these powers on the Court. Debate fori motion by Mr W. H . IRVINE) adjourned. House adjourned at 10.15 P- * m",49
