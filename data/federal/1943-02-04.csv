1,Mr GUY,Unknown,"Is the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in a position to make a statement relating to the conclusions reached by the committee which was commissioned by the Government recently to inquire into the dairying industry? Has the Government reached a decision upon the recommendations of the committee to increase the financial returns to dairy farmers in respect of commercial butter,, to declare the industry a. protected undertaking, and, in order that production may be stimulated, that men now serving with Militia units should be restored to farms on which they were previouslyemployed? Mr SCULLY.:-The wholematter is under consideration. Definite action for the relief of the situation has been taken by a grant of £2,000,000 to the industry. POWER ALCOHOL. DISTILLERY A-T WARRACKNABEAL.",12
2,Mr HUTCHINSON,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Supply and Shipping what expert or experts recommended the erection of a power alcohol distillery at Warracknabeal, Victoria. . Will the honourable gentlemanlay the relevant papers on> the table of the House ?",12
3,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"The usual procedure wasfollowed in the investigation of this matter; it was that adopted by the previous Administration in connection with many projects in which it was involved, such as the building of annexes and factories of various kinds. I am not prepared to lay the papers on the table of the House. COMMONWEALTH POWERS BILL . M*. MoCALL - As the Legislative Council of Tasmania has rejected the Commonwealth PowersBill-, will"" the Prime Minister state the Government's intentions?",12
4,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"The Parliaments of three States have dealt with this legislation, leaving three that have yet to decide their attitude towards it. When that has been determined, the Government will consider the then existing situation. MR, E. S. SPOONER, M.P. STATE TAX REMISSIONS*",12
5,Mr SPOONER,Unknown,"I rise to make a personal explanation. A section of the press reported this morning that in this House last night, during my absence, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) stated that shortly after I had become Assistant Treasurer of New South Wades I had remitted £20',00Q in taxation to David Jones Limited, of Sydney. By courtesy of the honourable member, I have this morning seen the Hansard report of his speech. This states that, referring to the honourable member for Robertson, he said- About the time he became a member of the Government of New South Wales, he and his Colleagues granted remissions of taxation amounting to £20,000 to firms like David Jones Limited, of Sydney. The statement of the honourable member is capable of two interpretations. He may have meant that the Government of which I was a member, through the Parliament, amended the taxation law, andreduced the rates of tax. That is correct. Whilst I cannot cite the details, I can say that the revised tax rates in bills that I introduced into the Parliament of New South. Wales in 193>2 and 1933,. reduced the rates of tax-; but the greater part of such reductions was conferred upon the lower groups of incomes. If the statement of the honourable member implies that remissions of tax were made to specific taxpayers, I assert emphatically that that is not correct.",12
6,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,I did not say that.,12
7,Mr SPOONER,Unknown,"I made no such remissions of tax; and I have no knowledge of, nor do I believe that, any such remissions of tax were made by any of my colleagues. The only authorities competent to remit taxwere the Commissioner ofTaxation; who could amend an assessment and refund' an amount overpaid; the court, or the board of review, which upon an appeal or an objection could vary an assessment that had been made by the commissioner; or the board of relief, in instances of hardship. As a Minister of the Crown, I have never seen, nor have I tried to see the taxation file of any taxpayer. I have never dealt with an application for the reduction or remission' of tax by David Jones Limited , or anybody else, nor did I 1I have the power to do so.",12
8,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I , too wish to make a personal explanation. This is not the first occasion, and probably it will not be the last, on which remarks of mine have been distorted by the press. I do not believe that there was any intention to misrepresent what I said last night; but the published digest of my statement does create an unforis tunate impression. I did not accuse the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Spooner) of having done anything venal or improper. I was criticizing, in my opinion properly, the policy of the vernment of which he was a member, remitting tax to classes of taxpayers in receipt of certain incomes whilst ing unemployed single men to live on 5s. 6d. a week. I contrasted that policy with the failure of the honourable member, while he was a member of the Governbeen ment of New South Wales, to support any way at a meeting of the Loan cil a policy of reflation, or the use bank credit, in order to Tectify the evils of deflation. I said that whilst he fused, during the depression years, to anything to improve the conditions of people by the use of bank credit Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The honSpare orable member is going beyond the bounds of a personal explanation.",13
9,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,I said that he also aTgued against the use of bank credit in a time of war.,13
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honour the able gentleman has made his personal explanation.,13
11,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I should be the he judge of that, Mr Speaker. MT. SPEAKER - Order !",13
12,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"The impatience of honourable members opposite should sir, interfere with the relations between you and me, in my attempt to put my view Mr .SPEAKER - Order ! The honourable member must proceed with his personal explanation.",13
13,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"To put my view in regard to the misrepresentation to which I have been subjected by the press, and to make clear the position, in relation to the honourable member for Robertson, who considers that certain remarks of mine have placed him in an unfortunate light. NA VEHICLES'.",13
14,Mr HOLT,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Will the Minister for Supply and 'Shipping state whether there a serious shortage of spare parts for motor vehicles, and whether he is taking any special action by which spare parts may be imported or manufactured in Australia, in order to overcome the shortage, 1 Goso that essential transport vehicles may in be kept in use on the roads ?",13
15,Mr BEASLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"The shortage of expectspare parts for motor vehicles has created a serious problem in this country. All practical steps to encourage the manufacture of spare parts in Australia have taken, and plans have been put into in operation for their production. The CounGovernment has taken the matter up of with the representatives in Australia of the Government of the United States of reAmerica, in order to see how far assistdo ance can be given to us under the leasethe lend scheme. The stage has now been reached in this country at which it is necessary to appoint a Controller of Parts, in order to put the whole matter on a satisfactory foundation. HORSE AND DOG RACING.",13
16,Mr COLLINS,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Has the attention of Prime Minister been drawn to the fact that racing dogs are being conveyed in horse-boxes to dog race meetings throughout the country districts? Does approve of that practice, and, if so, will he have a similar privilege extended to the owners of horses who desire their animals to compete at patriotic race not, meetings held in country districts?",13
17,Mr CURTIN,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I am not aware arrangements, if any, have been made for the transport of dogs to race meetings. I shall ascertain the facts and shall then offer an opinion on them. AUSTRALIAN ARMY. SEBVIOES OF WOMEN .",14
18,Mr CONELAN,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"As there is a large body of women with special ability who are over the age of 45 years, and as of them rendered service in the last will the Minister for the Army make provision for such women to be allowed to serve as members of the Australian Women's Army Service, if their services would prove of value in the war effort?",14
19,Mr FORDE,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"The Australian Women's Army Service is recruited from women whose ages are from 18 to 45 years, iand it is considered inadvisable to increase the age limit beyond 45 years. In the event of the number of required for essential Avar positions not being available, consideration will be entire given to raising the age limit slightly beyond 45 years, but at present I can hold out no hope for favourable considerawould tion of that proposal. WHEAT INDUSTRY.",14
20,Mr MARWICK,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Following quesbases. tions asked by me on the 11th December last, and again on the motion for the adjournment of the House on the 27th January, I now ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture whether he is in a position to state when the money due to the wheat-growers of for Western Australia for wheat acreage this year? compensation will be paid?",14
21,Mr SCULLY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"The money required for those payments has been available for a considerable time, and is at the posal of the Australian Wheat Board for distribution. The board has evidently decided to make those payments directly to the wheat-growers at the time when payment is made for this season's wheat. I shall bring the matter to the notice of the board, and let the honourable member know what payments have been made.",14
22,Mr MABWICK,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Will ithe Minister ask the board to expedite the payments?,14
23,Mr SCULLY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,I shall. what WAR IN SOUTH PACIFIC AREA. OPERATIONS NE AR THE SOLOMONS.,14
24,Mr SHEEHAN,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"In view of the various reports received that a battle is raging near the Solomon Islands, I ask the Prime Minister whether he has any information to supply to the House regarding it?",14
25,Mr CURTIN,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"The communique issued at Washington at 8 a.m. today, many Australian time, shows that there has war, been much aerial activity in the South Pacific Area. I do not propose to read the communique, because honourable members can obtain it elsewhere; but I shall have it circulated among honourable members if they so wish. At 11 a.m. today a further communique was to the effect that during the last several days there have been numerous surface and air clashes between United States and Japanese forces in the Solomons area. women The communique further statesIncreased activity on part of Japanese indicates major effort to regain control of Solomons area. Both United States and Japanese forces suffered some losses. To reveal, at this time, details of engagements endanger success of our future operations in this area. As far as I know, the naval forces of both fleets in this region are at present at sea; that is, they are not alt their WINE GRAPE CROP.",14
26,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture state what arrangements have been made the harvesting of the wine grape crop,14
27,Mr SCULLY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I shall have inquiries made, and furnish a reply to the honourable member at an early date. The agridiscultural committees and the man-power authorities have been trying to do everything possible to distribute, as equitably as possible, the limited number of workers available for the grape harvest. STANDARDIZED BREAD LOAF.",14
28,Mr HOLLOWAY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"On Friday last the honourable member for Reid (Mr. Morgan) asked me whether consideration would be given to the adoption of a national wholemeal loaf for Australia, similar to that inGreat Britain, and I undertook' to supply further' information OB: the matter. It is necessary to consider certain basic facts. The national' wholemeal loaf in Great Britain is= made from a flour which contains85 per cent, of the original wheat grains, thus-, containing a good deal of what is commercially known aspollard. It is important to remember that this loaf was adopted in England, not for any health reasons, but because of the urgent need to use for food' as much as possible of the wheat which was being imported. There are two considerations from the health point of view, and there, is the economic aspect. In Australia, there is no need to conserve wheatto this extent; as abundant supplies of wheat are available-. The only considerationj therefore,, is that of the health of. the public. Beforeany vital change could be made in. milling and bakingprocesses and in domestic habits, it would be necessary to show that present standards of flour and'habits of"" the people are producing adverse effects on the health, of the community. There is no proof that this is the case, There is proof, however; that an over-consumption of white flour in the form of pastries-, biscuits and other products is undesirable-. With regard to bread there are two aspects, the vitamin content and the indigestible residue known popularly as roughage.' There is, at present, no proof of a vitamin. Bl deficiency amongst the Australian peoplewhich would justify so fundamental a change as compelling them to eat nothing but wholemeal, bread. The vitamin Bl content of Australian flour has been proved to be high, and steps are beingtaken to improve milling processes so that a still higher standard may be reached without great disturbance of existing habits. It is not true, so far as proof is available, that general health of the community is impaired by the absence of the roughage. This may be true in individual cases, but it is a matter for correction under medical! advice or by individual initiative. There is, therefore, no. justification for imposing upon the community the compulsory use of a wholemeal loaf, for either economic or health reasons. Mr Holloway. PRIMARY INDUSTRIES. RELEASE OF WORKERS FROM THE ARMYRATES, OF PAY. Mr WILSON.r-Is the Minister, for the Army aware of the very serious position which has arisen in the dried fruits industry because of a shortage of labour for harvesting? Doeshe know that, despite theextra ordinary efforts that have been made' to., regiment civilian labour of all kinds,, there isstill a shortage of more than 2,000 workers in the Mildura area alone ? Will the Minister direct that leave be given, to men in theforces who are within a reasonable distance o£ the. dried fruits: districts,, so that they may assist in the harvesting? 1",14
29,Mr FORDE,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"No direct application has been made to mefor the release of men from the Army for this, purpose. Thehonorablemember must realise that there-are gr,eat difficulties this year in the way of releasing men accustomed to this class of"" work. Thesedifficultieshave to do with existing: strategical requirements, and the present disposition of. troops. I shall be pleased to. give full consideration to the honourable member's suggestion, and shall makea more detailed reply tomorrow.",15
30,Mr ANTHONY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Has - the Minister for the Army seen that section of the report of the expert committee appointed by the Government to inquire into the dairying industry in which it is stated that one step immediately necessary for the restoration of production to the required level is to facilitate where possible tie voluntary return to the industry of men already, called up for training in Militia units? Will the Minister consider this recommendation with a view to deciding whether experienced men. in Militia units are rendering, agreater service to the country as soldiers than they would i'f assisting in the production the of foodstuffs which the Government has declared to be essential ? If he inclines to the latter view, will hesee that more sympathetic consideration is given by military officers to applicationsfor the release of men from the Army?",15
31,Mr FORDE,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,".Consideratio n will be given to that part of the report, mentioned by the honourable member, but I must point out that the release of men. for work in :the dairying industry presents - almost insuperable difficulties because of the location of troops. In many instances, - they are far removed from the dairying centres. However, the Government appreciates the difficulties which are being faced by the dairy-farmers, in common with Other primary producers and, indeed, with very many sections of the community. Always keeping in mind the paramount importance .of the defence of Australia, and ""the need to maintain our forces at maximum .strength, the Government will .give .consideration to all requests for the .release of labour for essential industries.",15
32,Mr ROSEVEAR,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"When .men are released from the Army to work dn primary industries axe they paid the ordinary military rate, or do they receive award rates? If they receive military rates of pay, is the money found by the defence authorities, or by the persons for w'hom the soldiers work? If the employer pays more than the military rate, who collects the difference?",16
33,Mr FORDE,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Me n have been released temporarily from the Army to engage in seasonal work in .primary industries, such - a? sugar and wheat. While the men are on leave from the Army .and engaged in these occupations, they are paid the award rates of wages prevailing in the industry Mr ""ROSEVEAR,-Is it a fact that men in the military Labour Corps are sometimes nut to work on the waterfront alongside union men w""ho 'are receiving award rates of pay? Is it a fact that the Government collects from the stevedoring company full union rates for all labour corps men employed on the waterfront, and then impounds the difference between the union Tate and. the military rate of pay ? If that be so, can - the Minister say why men in the 'Labour Corps should be treated worse than those who are released from the Army 'to engage in seasonal work ? :",16
34,Mr FORDE,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Fro m time to time members of the Labour Corps have performed work of a temporary character on the waterfront, and while so engaged the shipping companies have paid the T-uling rate of wages for waterside workers. The difference between the soldier's rate of pay and the award rates has been placed in a separate fund, but, according to the latest reports 'that I haTe received, no definite decision .has been arrived at iregarding the disposal «of the money in that f und. I shall .supply information on the subject to the honourable member as soon as it ""is available.",16
35,Mr ROSEVEAR,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Are we to assume that a fund, which by this 'time has accumulated considerable proportions, has no purpose? Or was it created with some definite objective in view? It seems ridiculous to create a fund without knowing the purposes for which the money will beused.",16
36,Mr FORDE,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Officer s of the Army are now in consultation with officers of the Treasury with a view to determining - what money is in flie fund and to what purposes it should be allocated. When we tafce into consideration the claims in respect of pensions, repatriation rights and the maintenance of soldiers who are employed in industry, it is not certain whether the fund is in credit or in debit. AIR ACCIDENTS.",16
37,Mr JOLLY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Can - the Minister for Air say whether a thorough investigation vi made into all serious accidents to ser-vice aircraft so as to discover the causes of them? 'Has he satisfied himself that - everything possible is being done to reduce the number of accidents ? Mr DRAKEiFORJi) - Every air accident is investigated by a committee .which has been specially appointed for that purpose, and a staff is employed on ""that work all the year round. A report is submitted to me in every case. In addition, a record is kept of the causes of accidents where causes can be ascertained, and graphs are prepared showing the number of accidents arising from the ^various Gauses. Comparisons are made - between the ratio of air accidents in Australia .and the ratios in other countries. Generally - speaking, the .ratio 'is lower in Australia than elsewhere. I am sorry to say that accidents sometimes occur because .of 'disobedience of flying orders, .and steps are taken to deal .with such situations, .and to prevent a repetition. SCURVY. . Mr MORGAN - Is the Minister for Health aware that there is an epidemic of scurvy among children in some parts of Australia? Have the Commonwealth health authorities instituted am inquiry into the causes of the epidemic, and, i what practical steps have been taken to meet the situation? In view of the shortage of fruit and vegetables-at least at a reasonable price-hav e the medical authorities considered the greater use of wholemeal bread, with its higher vitamin content, as one method of preventing scuTvy?",16
38,Mr HOLLOWAY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I am not aware that there is an epidemic of scurvy, but T know that the number of cases is increasing. The health authorities are doing their best to ensure that proper supplies of fruit and vegetables shall be available to the public, hut I do not know that they have taken any special steps in regard to wholemeal bread. DEFENCE (CITIZE NMILITARY FORCES) BILL 1943. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 3rd February (vide page 270), on motion by Mr. CUB-TENThat the bill now be read a second time.",17
39,Mr FADDEN,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Darling Downs-Leade r of the Opposition) [3.3] - Nearl y fourteen monthsafter Japan's entry into the war the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) has introduced into this Parliament a bill to authorize the employment in an extended area of that portion of Australia's defence forces known as the Militia. This measure has been introduced only after the Government has pursued a policy of deliberate evasion and indefensible procrastination, and after the Prime Minister has sought and obtained permission to do so from a coterie of dictators in the Labour movement, notwithstanding that the Government's military advisers must previously have indicated the need for an extended use of the Militia. The action of the right honourable gentleman in approaching various Labour organizations for their consent to introduce what he himself believed to be essential legislation amounts to an ignoring of this Parliament, which consists of the elected representatives of the people, and is charged with the responsibility of legislating in the interests of the people. Before examining the measure in detail, I propose to offer some observaf so, tions on the way in which this highly important subject has been handled by the Government. Japan's entry into the conflict about two months after the Curtin Government assumed office imposed a great responsibility on the Administration. The Opposition, with some knowledge of war planning and of administration under war conditions, recognized the additional responsibilities thrust upon the Government, and accordingly it offered to share those responsibilities either by participating in an all-party government, or by accepting a share of executive authority in some form or other. That offer was refused. Since then the Opposition has wholeheartedly and conscientiously co-operated with the Government in an attempt to provide an all-in war effort and to discharge Australia's obligations as one of the allied nations. The Opposition recognized that war-time necessities transcended party political considerations, but unfortunately its attitude has been misrepresented and misinterpreted as weakness. That, however, has not debarred the Opposition from doing what it believes to be its duty in war-time in contrast to what might be expected of an Opposition in times of peace. For that reason I wrote to the Prime Minister on the 17th December, 1941, offering the wholehearted co-operation of the Opposition in furthering Australia's war effort. There were no strings to the offer: the Opposition was actuated solely by the desire to assist the Government. It recognized that an all-in war effort was indispensable to success, and that forward planning was necessary, having in mind particularly the conditions which existed at that time. In the view of the Opposition, such planning involved the removal of all legal impediments in the Defence Act to the employment of our forces outside certain areas. We had in mind, not the indiscriminate use of the Militia, but their use where in the opinion of the Government they could best meet any emergency that might arise. The Government ignored that letter, and therefore it is well that I should remind honourable members that on the 16th December, 1941, this Parliament pledged itself to defend Australia and its territories, and to carry on hostilities in association with Australia's allies until final victory over our enemies was achieved. Apparently, that pledge was conveniently forgotten by the Prime Minister when the Opposition offered to co-operate with the Government. Accordingly, in May, 1942, when the Opposition was greatly disturbed because of the Government's neglect of essential planning, and its failure to take adequate steps for the defence of this country and the discharge of Australia's obligations to its allies, I moved for the removal of all territorial limitations upon the power of the Commonwealth to employ the Australian Military Forces. My amendment was defeated by 31 votes to 27. Among those who voted against it was the independent member for Henty (Mr.Coles). It is interesting to note that not one speaker on the Government side of the chamber was able to justify the Government's refusal to amend the Defence Act in order to merge the two armies into one effective fighting force. In fact the debate was notable for the manner in which Labour members carefully evaded the real issue. Between that time and the historic conference of the Australian Labour party in November, 1942, the Government refused consistently to amend the Defence Act. In October, 1942, the Minister for the Army, in his capacity as Deputy Prime Minister, declared, authoritatively and without equivocation, "" There is neither necessity nor justification for conscription for overseas service today"". He was equally emphatic in declaring that the Government was opposed to conscription for overseas service, and that there was less need for conscription then than there had been at any previous time. I ask honourable members to bear in mind that the Ministers declaration was made only three weeks before the Prime Minister approached the interstate Labour conference with his new proposals. On the 16th November, 1942, the conference of the Australian Labour party in Melbourne carried a resolution reaffirming its adherence to "" complete and indissoluble unity with the allies"". Further, it pledged its "" determination to stand with our allies in resisting aggression and bearing willingly the burden and perils involved in the struggle"". The hollowness of that unanimous resolution was demonstrated subsequently when eight of the delegates opposed the granting of leave to the Prime Minister to submit his motion relating to the use of the Militia. On the next day, the 17th November, the Prime Minister proposed the motion, but the conference refused to proceed with it, and shelved its immediate responsibility by referring this important military and non-political question back to the State executives. I can appreciate readily just how the Prime Minister felt. We in this chamber know that the right honourable gentleman has persevered time and time again, against substantial pressure, in an endeavour to have the Defence Act amended, and we realise that as a Labour man he cannot ignore the wishes of the Labour movement. Unfortunately, he must depend upon the machinery of the Australian Labour party in important matters of this kind. We can all visualize the able manner in which the Prime Minister would put his case to the conference, and the impression that he would make, but unfortunately even the undisputed facts which he was able to place before delegates, and the seriousness of the war situation, were not sufficient to induce the conference to accept responsibility for an immediate decision. The matter was referred back to the State executives for further discussion. This important question is not one that should be made the subject of party political considerations; it is a national question, and the facts should be considered calmly. I propose to give to honourable members a brief outline of the relevant events which have occurred since Japan's entry into the war. In December, 1941, the Government of this country, through the Prime Minister, informed the President of the United States of America that the Commonwealth was - honoured to be associated with the United States in resisting aggressors until they were overthrown. In the light of subsequent happenings, I invite Parliament and the nation to assess that statement at its true value. In the same month the Prime Minister declared that without any-inhibitions of any kind, Australia looked, to the: United States of America, free of any pangsas to traditional links of kinship: with the United Kingdom. On the 9th February, 1942, the Minister for the Army,, when congratulating. General! MACArthur on the fight against the Japanese in the Philippines,, made the following significant statement:;It is. not within our power to send help in your immediate trials, but our fighting men look, forward, to. the honour of joining with, the men of the American forces in other theatres of war. Ourfighting men do look forward to joining forces with, the men of the United. States, of America in any theatre of war,, but this Government, with an eye on its: future inoffice rather than on Australia's future, refuses to allow them to do so.. In fact it refuses to lay the foundation for a. junction, of these forces wherever wan may be waged outside definite territorial limits.. On the 14th March, 1942, the Prime Minister, in a broadcast to the United States of America, said that Australia looked to that country as the paramount factor on the democracies' side in the Pacific. He also made the following declaration:We are fighting, mad. . . . Our peoplehave a Government that is governing with orders and not with weak-kneed suggestions. . . . We are;, then, committed, heart and. soul, to total war-fare. Laterin the same month,. General MACArthur arrived in Australia asCommander-in-'Ohief of the South-West PacificArea, and the presence of substantial American forces in Australia was announced. The Prime Minister declared Australia, to be of cardinal importance in the Allied conduct of the war. Hie went on to sayThis Government has never wavered in the view that, on the grounds of highest strategy as well as by reason of all that Australia, and New Zealand, represent on the side of. human values for which theAllies are fighting, the. ANZAC area is a vital area to the world war. I regard that statement as particularly important-in the light"" of the proposals that the Prime Minister has now submitted to Parliament insofar as New Zealand isconcerned. The ANZAC area' mentioned, is far greater in. extent"" than the area defined in the measure now Mr Fadden. before ifehe House.. In June, 1942; a month after* the Opposition had moved for themerging of the two armies in. tnis country, the Prime. Minister warned, the* nation of thepossibility that Australia could) be lost,, but' the Government remained inactive. It f ailed to do. anything; to' achieve unity in our Army, or to amend the Defence Act to: removethe legal, impediment which prevented.it from, making adequate defence plansto. meet 1 possible emergencies.. The Opposition, forces- did. not advocate the indiscriminatedespatch of our Militia, forces from Australia. Surely it is not suggested that if the present measure be carried, the Government will despatch immediately the whole of our Militia forces to*> the defined areas!. The Opposition merelyadvocated the removal of the existing, legal impediments; so that any plan which,, on. the advice of its expert advisers,, the Government might consider to be necessary to meet any emergency,, could, be put into effect without delay. The object was merely to facilitate sensible,, and,. I submit, indispensable planning to meet whatever contingency thisunfortunate conflict might force upon us. On the 7-th August, 1942, the Prime Minister declared that Australia must share the perils of total war problems. Hesaid that Australia had shared them, was sharing them, and would share them,-and added that he accepted primary responsibility for sharing the risks o£ war. It is quite apparent now that in reality the Government is not prepared to share the risks of war. The Government has resisted every move by the Opposition for an amendment of the Defence Act to merge the Australian Imperial Force and the Militia so that an undivided Australian Army may share the risks of war with the fighting forces of other Allied' Nations. The Prime Minister declared that Australia had enjoyed, and was continuing to enjoy, the protection that membership of the United Nations conferred upon us; but, equally we must"" share the perils. That; he said', involved not only receiving allocations made to us from the common pool of the United Nations' resources; but also making our contribution as a fighting; productive* nation. I put it to the House : Is not the Government's refusal to make available, wherever required, a united Australian army, a refusal to share those risks ? Is it not a refusal by Australia - as a - fighting, productive to make 'its contribution to the cause of the United Nations. I have cited these statements in order to put on record declarations which are calculated to lead the people and our allies to believe that Australia was prepared to bear its fair share of the .risks of fighting total war, and, further, was prepared to amend the 'Defence Act in order 'to be fully prepared for .any contingency that might arise. Those declarations were such as to lead the nation to believe that, in spite of all the disputation and dissension arising in the Labour movement, as the result of that conference, the Prime Minister would courageously introduce into this Parliament - a - measure to amend the Defence Act adequately. However, instead - of giving effect to those declarations, 'the Government - decided not to take action which would enable Australia to honour its full obligations as one of - the United Nations. Up to the time - that the special federal conference of the Australian Labour party met in Melbourne, the Government, while crying to the United States of America for aid, was prepared to allow only one section >of Australian troops to fight alongside the Americans against the common enemy. The Labour Conference was advised of the Prime Minister's proposal on the 17th November last. That a Labour Prime Minister - should suggest that the policy of the parity should be changed even in a very limited respect to meet the changing conditions of ""war was enough to throw the 'Controlling body of the Labour movement into - confusion. The delegates at that conference foresaw the destruction of the Government and the splitting of the Labour party, of which the Deputy Prime Minister had warned the public three weeks earlier. Those members of the Labour party with no responsibility for the conduot of the war became panicstricken and ran for cover. They threw aside all considerations of national security, and decided to defer action until they - received instructions from the State executives of the party. I shall now deal with the manner in - which the Prime Minister handled this all-important question. A major alteration of Australia's legislation was contemplated. It was an amendment ""which nation the Prime Minister regarded as inescapable in view - of the changing war situation. This amendment - was something that conld be effected by Parliament alone. Having reached the conclusion 'that an amendment of the Defence Act was a military, and not a - political, necessity, the Prime Minister, who has a responsibility to every section of the community and not merely to .supporters of the - Labour party, should have asked the Cabinet, the Advisory War 'Council and the Parliament to give effect to that decision. Had he followed that course, this legislation would Jiave been - an accomplished fact months ago. However, he decided to approach the Interstate Labour Conference, an irresponsible coterie of Labour supporters. In reality,, he handed over the function of Government to an outside body. He did - more than that-h e handed over to that outside organization control of Australia's destiny, and .the decision - whether - or not we should honour our obligations to our allies. I invite the House to contrast .this action which - the Prime Minister took in November, 1942, with his bold declaration to the Parliament on the 35th March last. On .that occasion the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) suggested that before putting the Mobilization of Services and Property Regulations into effect, the Prime Minister should summon -.another Labour conference to learn whether that conference would agree to them, or their spirit. The Prime Minister's Teply was brief and to the point. He said, "" I do not propose to entrust the government of this .country to anybody outside this Parliament'"". That statement was applauded - by the-Opposition then, as it is applauded now. Had the Prime Minister adopted the same attitude when he contemplated amending the Defence Act, the Opposition would again have applauded him. Instead, his action in entrusting the 'Government 'to a party political organization merits the strongest condemnation. It is an affront to the Parliament, and an insult to the men of the fighting forces. However, if the people of Australia are prepared to accept Labour in Government, they must accept it in association - with the political machine in control of the Labour movement; and it is in the people's hands to remedy that position at the ballot-box when the opportunity arises. Only last week the Prime Minister declared in this House that in operational matters there should be no politics, just as in military matters there should be no politics. How does he reconcile that statement with his actions in approaching these outside bodies which consist solely of Labour supporters ? Were not those approaches evidence of the intrusion of party politics into both operational and military matters? Can the Prime Minister deny that such was the case ? The Opposition and the people of Australia are entitled to ask the reason for the Prime Minister's change of front within a period of eight months. On the 17th November he approached the Interstate Labour Conference. On the 27th November he approached the New South Wales Executive of the Australian Labour party; on the 4th December, the Victorian branch of the Australian Labour party; and again on the 4th January, the Interstate Labour Conference. As the result of the Prime Minister's second approach to the Interstate Labour Conference, the Government was "" authorized "" to add to the Defence Act a proviso for the greater use of the Militia. This authorization was given to the Prime Minister of a nation at war by an irresponsible body of Labour dictators, who were divided, and are still divided, among themselves on this very subject. They alone have enabled the Prime Minister to submit this bill to the Parliament today; and they alone give to members of this Parliament the privilege of debating this measure. Parliament, which has been waiting patiently since Novemberand the Opposition has been waiting for fourteen months-is now given an opportunity to debate the Government's proposals to use the Militia in an extended area. What would have been the position had the Interstate Labour Conference turned down the Prime Minister's proposals? If press reports are correct, the opportunity we now have to debate this bill has really been given to us by a Mr Fadden. Tasmanian delegate to the conference who, although he opposed the Prime Minister's proposals in November, supported them in January. What would be the position with respect to this legislation had that Tasmanian delegate not changed his mind? Would this bill have been introduced if that member of the Tasmanian executive had voted as he had originally intended? When the Prime Minister first approached the Interstate Labour Conference, the public was led to believe that the Government contemplated a merger of the Australian Imperial Force and the Citizen Military Forces. Support for this view is to he found in a statement by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), when addressing this chamber last December. The honourable member declared-and it was not denied-that the Prime Minister had said, in the course of his speech before the Interstate Labour ConferenceGentlemen, there is no argument against one army. After attending the meeting of the Interstate Labour Conference in Melbourne, the Prime Minister declared on the 20th November that one army under one command for military operations in the South-West Pacific was a military necessity. On the 28th November, the Sydney Mornvnq Herald, reporting the meeting of the Full Cabinet, at which the Militia proposal was supported, statedHe (MT. Curtin) strongly combated the argument that his proposal amounted to the general introduction of conscription. It meant nothing of the sort, he said. There would still be a Militia and an Australian Imperial Force as separate entities. Which of those statements aTe we to believe? Speaking in the House on the 1:1th December, the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde) declared that the amendment which was submitted to the conference simply meant that the Citizen Military Forces might be used at the discretion of the Government, and subject to proper safeguards, outside the strict legal limits of Australia and its territories. Again, I ask: Whom is the public to believe? The House should remember that, whilst the honourable member for Melbourne was a delegate to the Interstate Labour Conference, the Minister for the Army was not. The House is entitled to know what took place to cause the Prime Minister to decide upon the definition of the South-Western Pacific Zone as embodied in the bill. There is a substantial difference between the original proposal placed before the conference on the 17th November and that which was ultimately accepted on the 4th January. I am curious to know whether the definition contained in the bill was the result of a compromise or of expert advice as to military necessity, or of political expediency. Last night the Prime Minister failed to offer to the House one valid reason for the failure of the Government to face its obligations to other allied nations. This bill provides further evidence that, at heart, the Labour party is still isolationist. The Prime Minister told the House that the zone for the employment of the Citizen Military Forces must be within the scope of General MACArthur's operational command - Why limit the use of those forces to a zone within the South-West Pacific Area which is General MACArthur's command ? I urge the Government to face the realities of the situaa tion, and permit the 'Citizen Military Forces to be used in the whole of the South-West Pacific Area. Again I ask whether the definition is the result of political disputation and expediency. The Prime Minister also pointed out that the Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force have operated outside the strictly defined limits of the Southwestern Pacific Zone. In the circumstances, I fail to understand why the Government has imposed a ban upon the Militia fighting in the fullest co-operation with our allies. If Australian sailors and airmen may fight side by side with the troops of the allied nations against Japan, why does the Government adopt a ""stand back"" attitude in respect of one section of the Australian Army? The Prime Minister stated that, with the passage of this legislation, the whole of the Australian naval, land and air forces will be available to the Commander-in-Chief for employment in the South-Western Pacific Zone as defined in the bill. To the definition of the area prescribed in bill, the Opposition takes the strongest objection. The House was informed that the primary aim of global strategy was first the defeat of Germany, and then the concentration on Japan of the full resources of the United Nations. But the Commonwealth Government is not prepared now to take action which will enable the full resources of Australia, combined with those of other nations, to be concentrated upon Japan. If the Government, to please its trade union masters and party supporters, steadfastly refuses to weld our fighting forces into one army, and insists upon limiting the use of one section of those forces, total war is meaningless regarding our participation. Though one of the United Nations, Australia will not be making its full resources available for concentration against Japan until the Government removes every restriction on the use of the Citizen Military Forces. Speaking of the ultimate defeat of Japan in the Pacific, the Prime Minister stated that Australia would make its maximum contribution to achieve this objective. I fail to understand how the Prime Minister can seriously make such declaration when after sixteen months in office, the Government is prepared only to propose a very limited use of the Militia. At the same time, the Government expects our allies to make all their resources available to defend this country. The Prime Minister went to great lengths to answer the severe criticism of this proposal. He mentioned that after the last war leaders of the Australian Imperial Force had recommended that the essential part of preparation for the defence of Australia against Japanese aggression was the amendment of the Defence Act. I direct attention to the fact that at that period, only "" possible "" aggression by Japan was contemplated. I do not propose to comment on the attitude which successive governments adopted towards that recommendation. My only concern is that up to December, 1941, Japan had not allied itself with the Axis against the Democracies. But when the Japanese threat became so real as to threaten the security of Australia, the amendment of the act became a pressing necessity. Although the the Opposition urged the Government to act swiftly, it refused, for political reasons, so to do. Upon this Government alone rested the obligation to take every possible step to secure the security of the nation. It failed to discharge that obligation. The Government is already laying the foundation for post-war reconstruction, but the first essential is to ensure that planning for the years of peace will be within our hands. We must first win the war, and I am convinced that an amendment of the Defence Act, as the Opposition has suggested, is of primary importance in achieving that objective. Obviously,- the Government should be able to send our forces when and where they are required to meet any emergency. The Prime Minister informed the House that if or when the circumstances permit, Australian forces will be available for employment in any theatre in which their services will be most valuable. If that is the intention of the Government, I cannot understand why the Prime Minister has submitted this miserable amendment. The legislation should provide for the effective merger of the forces for use wherever they are required. This bill will undoubtedly find a place in the records of Australian Labour government, but it will not be an honoured place. It will come to be regarded as a smeared page in the annals of Australian history. The Prime Minister was humiliated at the conferences of the Australian Labour party, and the Opposition hoped that after those disputations and dissensions, the Government would introduce a full blooded measure. Our hopes have been bitterly disappointed. The Opposition will not oppose this legislation, which constitutes a departure from a principle that the Labour party has held dear, if unwisely, for so long. This legislation becomes a basis for action which a responsible government will be able to take in future for the purpose of meeting any emergency. I say on behalf of the Opposition that if the time should ever come when we have to resort to the forms of the House in order to make adequate and proper provision for the defence of Australia, the bill that will be submitted will be an improvement upon this one. We accept this measure as an advance by the Labour party from the anti-conscription tradiMr Fadden. tions that it has cherished for so many years. It is something upon which a responsible government, when the time comes, can and will build, if the need should, unfortunately, arise. It is only because in the Prime Minister's speech there is an assurance that the territory defined in the bill will meet all Australia's defence requirements, and comply with every demand of military strategy as outlined by the Commander-in-Chief, General Douglas MACArthur, that we are prepared to accept it ; but we accept it with the reservation that if it does not adequately answer our defence needs we shall take every step that the forms of the House permit in order to rectify the position. I , in my capacity as Leader of the Opposition, know the gravity of the position. I know the urgency of the measure, and that it is indispensable to the proper and adequate defence of Australia. For this reason and others that I have mentioned, the Labour party has departed from its traditional policy of anti-conscription, and agreed to extend the territory to which our troops may be sent whenever the emergency shall dictate. The Opposition could have moved very embarrassing amendments to this measure, but it is not prepared to make it the plaything of party politics. We recognize that this proposal relates to a national necessity which transcends all party political considerations. The people of Australia, our allies, and the cause for which we are fighting, have waited too long, and it may be, too patiently, for such a measure, and my advice to the House is to give it an expeditious passage and let us get on with our duty and responsibility of winning the war.",17
40,Mr COLES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Henty) [3.45] - I am amazed. I have just listened to one of the most insincere addresses that I have ever heard. As an attack upon the Government it might read all right for jDolitical propaganda purposes, but it produced no explosion. Apparently the whole House is satisfied with the bill. I think I am justified in referring to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden) gave me honourable mention in his speech, when he said that I voted against an amendment moved by the Opposition last June. I did, because I realized at that time, as I realise today that the Opposition was r not sincere in proposing, that amendment. If honourable members opposite look up the records, thej' will find that their bers were not all present or paired. There was no intention on their part to go further in the matter; and I did not feel prepared at the time to embarrass the Government; The Prime Minister (Mr. Ouitin.) is entitled to some credit and. congratulation for his courage in bringing forward even this bill. I am not going to say that I am thoroughly satisfied, with the bill, but the Prime Minister,, as the leader of a party which has definite political views, in regard to military service, took his political life in his hands by going to his party to persuade if of the necessity ofusing our compulsorily enlisted forcesoutside of Australia. He brought his party to a position where it accepted that step as a necessity, and now we have the bill in our hands. I was rather disappointed that in the Prime Minister's presentation of the bill he. neglected one very important' point: He stressed with great force the strategic need for the movement of our troops out of Australia, but he omitted to stress the moral obligations resting on Australia to go farther - Let us turn back the clock twelve months, and look at the position in which we in Australia were then. We were in much the same position that Great Britain was in at thetime of Dunkirk. We had practically no well-equipped troops within Australia, and were apparently open to attack by Japan. By a miracle that attack did not come. The Prime Minister at that time made an urgent appeal to the United. States of America. It was quite obvious that we could not get our own overseas troops back quickly, and we could not obtain help from any other source, so we appealed to America, which had recently come into the war because of the attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbour. America responded, and its response was magnificent: General Douglas. MACArthur was appointed,, in response to our appeal, Commander of the Allied"" Forces in the South-West Pacific. In an address in this building,he said':'""'I pledge to you all the strength of my nation, andall the blood of my countrymen"". How splendidly that pledge has been honoured! The United States of America threw its ships, planes and men between us and: the enemy in the mem- battle of the Coral Sea. It immediately sent large numbers of practically untrained troops to this country. Some of thoseboys lost their lives in trainingin learning to fly planes that they had nothad a chance to learn to fly in their own country. They crashed on our aerodromes and our beaches, and all over New Guinea in fighting theenemy. Meanwhile, troops of the Australian Imperial Force were brought back from overseas, and later they did a magnificent job in New Guinea - They were able to do that job because they were aided by machines and equipment supplied by America-motorize d transport, aerodrome and road-making machinery, and aeroplanes. America gave that material, and the lives of its people tb Australia. Therefore, it is up to us to give everything' in return.",23
41,Mr FRANCIS,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Why not do it ? Is this bill ""everything""?",24
42,Mr COLES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"This bill, as I have said, is not wholly satisfactory to me. We have a moral obligation to America. The people of that country do not understand our political set-up. They cannot realise that we have two armies. They do not know the history of the Australian Defence Act. They know only that their troops are serving anywhere in the world, and that they have broken down all their previously-held inhibitions in respect of service. This bill, which will be accepted by this House, can be acceptable to the people of Australia and America if it is slightly amended. I intend to submit at the committee stage an amendment which, I think, the Government can accept. It is, to add to clause 3 the words ""and in Such other areas as the Governor General may, from time to time, proclaim as essential for the defence of Australia "". That would take the fetters off this Parliament and the Government; It would mean that, should a position arise such as the Prime Minister has said arose last November, when it wasessential that our Defence Act should' be altered', a period of three months would not have' to elapse before an alteration could be made, so that it would be possible to send Australian troops, if necessary to the Philippines, in fulfilment of our obligation to the United States of America. Our Army is today in an impossible position. Militia forces are hopelessly mixed up with members of the overseas forces who are distinguished by having the letter "" X "" before their number. There are militia companies in Australian Imperial Force brigades. I do not think that any one knows what the exact make-up is. This state of affairs is due to untidy thinking. The Army could be put into a clean and tidy position by a little proper thought and planning, without the need to introduce legislation of this character. Militiamen could be "" B "" and "" C "" class men, and all our troops who are capable of going to meet the enemy could do so. The Militia today contains an enormous percentage of the total number of our troops- a much greater percentage than is generally understood. Those men are supplied with good equipment made in Australia, and with it in their hands they stand on our doorstep inviting the enemy to attack them there and to fight - inside our own house. Should they have to take part in an engagement, they will be handicapped by not having had any previous battle experience. The whole experience of this war indicates that the only troops which can successfully emerge from an engagement without heavy casualties are those that have had battle experience. If militiamen are enabled to accompany the Australian Imperial Force without restriction wherever it may go, it will then be possible for members of the Australian Imperial Force to have frequent periods of relief while the other forces are obtaining battle experience. We should then have the whole Army thoroughly trained. At present, it is impossible thoroughly to train our Army in battle exercises. I now give notice that at the committee stage I shall move the amendment to clause 3 that I have indicated.",24
43,Mr MENZIES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Kooyong) [3.57] The bill before the House, which has just had the robust blessing of the honourable member for Henty, is, I suppose, the greatest anti-climax in modem political history. I say that it is an anti-climax, for the reason that in November last the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) announced at the Interstate Conference of the Australian Labour party that he desired to have amendments made to the Defence Act which would enable the services of the Militia to be utilized outside Australia. That announcement immediately gained the headlines. I was in Western Australia at the time. The effect of that dramatic statement was such, that inside 24 hours speculation was rife as to how long the Prime Minister would last and who would be the new member for Fremantle.",25
44,Mr CONKLAN,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The right honourable gentleman was sorry that he was in the West.,25
45,Mr MENZIES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"The honourable member is quite right. I was very sorry I was in the West, because I wanted very much to be in the middle of all this excitement. The statement was made in all the newspapers that what was proposed was a merger of Australian armies. That, too, gained the headlines. The Prime Minister was complimented in many quarters on the boldness of the action he had taken; and at once those who did not like his proposal-for example, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell)-becam e unusually vocal and uncommonly well reported. We were then told that there was a "" r if t within the lute "" ; that this was going to bring the whole house down. It was said that this great movement marked a revolutionary period in the history of Labour. Unfortunately, there appears to have been an error in the counting on the first day, because the conference referred the matter back to the State executives of the party. Parliament was told to sit quietly on one side in the meantime. It was said, ""You, gentlemen, are, of course, the Parliament, but you have the misfortune to be merely those elected by the people. We are now going to deal with those who have the fortune to be elected by unionists. So, Parliament, you will wait""-as we did, patiently, while the various executives all round Australia took the matter into consideration. Ultimately, the proposal of the Prime Minister was accepted, as the result of the vote cast by one Tasmanian delegateI believe I am right in saying-plu s the vociferous support of all the communist trade unionists in New South Wales.",25
46,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,They wish to go as far as the right honourable gentleman desires to go.,26
47,Mr MENZIES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Oddly , they do, but for very different reasons. When we reached that point, we witnessed, of course, a few incidentally amusing things. In December, when the House last met, we had the almost hilarious spectacle of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) briefly associating himself with the seconder of an amendment, and then galloping quickly through the door in order to escape having to vote for that amendment. It was a complete education for many of us in the shifts and changes that occur in politics. In due course the conference met again. There were stormy meetings in Fitzroy and other homes of democracy.",26
48,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The right honourable gentleman is not game to hold a public meeting in Fitzroy on this matter.,26
49,Mr MENZIES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I am prepared to address a meeting in Fitzroy at any time. One who can address the honourable member's corner in this chamber need not worry about addressing a mob in Fitzroy. With all the alarms and all the excitement in the press, every body was waiting for the storm clouds to burst, but what did the clouds produce? Did they produce a really dynamic flash or a real crash? Not at all. The result was merely like the toot of a tin whistle. This bill, which we were told was to do so much, and which we now see is to do so little, provides the greatest anticlimax in modern political history in Australia. What does the bill do ? I have had a look at a map, with the aid of what the bill describes in terms of meridians, and it is my opinion that the measure adds to existing areas-, within which the Militia may be used, Timor, Amboina and Dutch New Guinea. Those three areas are effectively added to the already ing areas.  sent to the South Pole?",26
50,Mr MENZIES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I am indebted to the honourable member. I had left out MacRobertson Land. Somebody opposite has asked, ""What about Borneo and what about the Celebes "" ? I omit them because I consider that any half of an island must be omitted from this calculation. We could not say that East Java is effectively included within this area, unless we were particularly told that we were to have the fantastic position that Militia troops would be ready to operate in East Java, but when an astronomer announced that the 110th meridian of east longitude had been reached, they would have to come to a halt. That would be absurd. Even the honourable member for Henty would perceive the absurdity of that. Therefore I omit Java, because it has not been effectively included by this bill. M.r. CUBTIN - The right honourable gentleman omitted it in the legislation which his Government introduced.",26
51,Mr MENZIES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I'a m coming to that point. The first point I am establishing is that Java, Borneo and the Celebes are, for all practical purposes, outside the area to which the Australian Militia may be sent. In other words, there are substantial areas within General MACArthur's jurisdiction which are not included in this bill. The second thing to be said about the measure is that it is not clear that there can be no merger of the Australian Imperial Force and the Citizen Military Forces. What is a merger? Perhaps the word needs a little definition. When I and other honourable members use the expression "" merger"" we refer to the making identical of the terms and conditions of service of all members of the Army in Australia, whether they are members'of the Australian Imperial Force or of the Citizen Military Forces.",26
52,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,That expression has been used by the right honourable gentleman and by the press.,26
53,Mr MENZIES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,I commonly use it.,26
54,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,It has not been used by the Government.,26
55,Mr MENZIES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I shall not bandy words as to whether it has ever been used by members of the party exist- opposite. If they mean to say that they have never approved of a merger of the two forces, I agree that they never have, and I say further that there is no indication of such merger in the bill now. before the House. Quite obviously-and here I am able to agree with the honourable member for Henty-w e cannot have forces which are all intermingled, some belonging to the Australian Imperial Force, some members of the Citizen Military Forces, an Australian Imperial Force battalion alongside a< Militia' battalion in the same brigade, and so on, and then hope that, when we provide a mystic line represented by oneof' the meridians, they shall dissolve into their separate identities, one going forward: and the otherbackward: This is not a bill tomerge the Australian armed forces, andi it is not a bill to make theMilitiaavailable within the whole of General MACArthur's' command. I return with submission to the observations-made by the Prime Minister when he introduced the bill. I desire to make three commentsin particularon what he said. In the third of those coimmentSj I shall deal with the matter on which the right honourable gentleman interjected across the table a few moments ago; In the first place,.the right honourable gentleman has said, as justification of the area marked out in the bill; that the zone must be wifthini General MACArthur's command. I am completely mystified by that.. ""Why must it be? If that applies to the CitizenMilitary Forces,, why should it not also apply to the Australian Imperial Force? If we are to be told' that the Militia must be attached to General MACArthur's command, why not the Australian Imperial 'Force also? Does this indicate that the AustralianImperial. Force is in no conceivable circumstances, to serve outside General MACArthur's command.? . Does it mean that, if New Zealand were attacked, no member of the Australian. Imperial Force shouldgo there,, because New Zealand is not within General MACArthur's command? Doesit imply that, in such cireumstances, we should gazein a fond and foolish fashion at New Zealandand say: "" We are sorry. We know you are our brothers, andcous-insj but we cannot do anything about it""?",26
56,Mr MAHIN,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The - right honourable gentleman knows quite different from what he is arguing;,27
57,Mr MENZIES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I do not.. If the policy"" of the Government is that, in-such f-ircums-tances:. it would go to the tance of. New Zealand,. I ask the Minister,, when hecomesto addressus, to. explain, what ismeant by the statement that"" the zone must be within General MACArthur's command'. The Navy has at all times, in this war, operatedirrespective of zones. It is quite true that Australian naval forces might in the first instance be regardedas attached to one particular zone or another; but the history of naval operations around Australia in the last twelve monthshas demonstrated', as the Prime Minister agrees; the' complete fluidity of naval warfare. The result is that Australian ships and Australian men have fought outside the area of General MACArthur's-command, and the same istrue of the A i r Force. Many a man of the Royal Australian Air Force has fought outside the area of General MACArthur's command. Now we aretold that while that istrue of the Navy and: the Air Force and the Australian Imperial Force, it cannot be trueof the Militia. Well, I give up. I cannot follow that process of reasoning. It seems tc me, in effect, to beputting the cart before the horse. General MACArthur is a very distinguished soldier, but whatever command he has over Australian forces, he enjoys with the approval of the Australian Government and the Australian people, speaking, through this Parliament. Those forces are not under the governmental control of General. MACArthur. Such military forces as areassigned to him are under his-operational command, but he is not the ruler of Australia, and to say that the functions of this Parliament are in some way restrained by thejurisdiction which General MACArthur enjoysis to put the cart before the horse. The second observation which I wish to make upon the Prime Minister's speech i? that it seemed to disclose the very curious conception that as troopsare required for base garrisons and lines of communication, there will beample use for our total Militia strength in areas which lie inside the proposed zone. If an offensive has to be driven beyond that zone, then the Australian Imperial Force can conduct it, and' the Militiawill be fully occupied in the areas which we shall, ex hypotliesi, have conquered. That assis- seems to me to be a most curious conception of' military operations. This tropical war has shown abundantly that the wastageof man-power, particularly through sickness, is enormous. If we are to maintain fighting forces under fighting conditions so as to enable them to advance, we must have such reserves as will enable us to reinforce them and rest them. In those circumstances, to say that the bulk of the Australian Army is to be used only for garrisoning lines of communication, while the minor portion of the Army is to be used for offensive purposes, seems to ignore all the lessons learned in New Guinea. The third comment which I wish to make is this: The Prime Minister appealed in his speech to history. He seeks to extract great comfort from the fact that in June, 1940, the National Security Act was amended at a time when very large powers were taken over persons and property-and it was amended with the present Prime Minister's full approval. The effect of the amendment was to ensure that although these vast powers were being taken over persons and property, they were not to be used by the Governor General in Council for the purpose of introducing compulsory military service overseas. In the National Security Act the Government took extraordinary powers, so extraordinary that one or two of the colleagues of the Prime Minister voted against the measure. The powers taken were so extraordinary that Pai'liament excluded specifically the power to introduce conscription by regulation. Now the Prime Minister says, "" Well, you did not introduce conscription then; why should you criticize us now?"" I remind the right honourable gentleman that he is going through the movements of doing it now. I thought the whole purpose of this bill was to take compulsory power over the Militia so that they might be compelled to serve in areas outside Australia. Moreover, I remind the right honourable gentleman that in June, 1940, the war, in a physical, fighting sense, was thousands of miles away from Australia. It was practicable at that time to have an Australian Imperial Force distinct from the Militia, because the Australian Imperial Force was the only body of troops that had fighting functions. The Militia were here in Australia. However, when Japan came into the war, and drove down through the east, Avhen this Government recalled the Australian Imperial Force from abroad, the whole problem was fundamentally changed. The question then arose as to how we were to handle two sets of troops, one enlisted for serviceabroad, and one compelled for service at home. The country was faced with a. new problem in that there was an enemy near us, and there was prospect of fighting on Australian territory. That fighting is now occurring, and has involved, the Militia and the Australian Imperial Force alike. Therefore, of what use is it to say that in June, 1940, in the circumstances which I have recalled, wit should have done something, which, had we attempted it, the Prime Minister would have screamed to high heavennamely, taken power to introduce conscription into Australia by regulation? He knows that if I , as Prime Minister, had at that time refused to have the limiting proviso added to the bill, I would have torn the country from top to bottom, and the first person to attack me on the issue would have been the right honourable gentleman himself. It is unwise to appeal to history if you are vulnerable on history yourself, and the Prime Minister and the members of his party are in this respect as vulnerable as men could be. We are considering a bill to include Timor, Amboina and Dutch New Guinea in the area within which the Militia may be required to operate. Why are we not discussing proposals to include in that area Papua and Norfolk Island ? The answer is that they were included by the deliberate vote of this Parliament at the instigation of my Government in June, 1939, and against the solid vote of the Labour party, and that at a time when nobody but a child could have doubted that war was coming to the world. The bill providing for the inclusion of areas Papua, Norfolk Island and the Mandated Territories within Australia for the purposes of the Militia was brought down by the then Minister for Defence, our late lamented and distinguished friend, Brigadier-General Street. I admit that the brunt of the battle in this chamber was borne by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn), who has always been consistent on this issue, and he was assisted by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward), now a relatively silent sponsor of the present bill. I sympathize with him. The honourable member for Bourke, as he himself will recall, moved an amendment, the substance of which was to exclude those territories from the compulsory provisions of the Defence Act. Every member of the then Opposition voted for that amendment. We, at least, saved the present Government that trouble; we gave a starting point a little beyond the boundaries of the Commonwealth of Australia. There is another point of history which I desire to emphasize. We heard a good deal yesterday about the Militia keeping watch and ward in Australia and the adjoining territories while the Australian Imperial Force would go forward and attack, and from time to time we have heard a great deal about the supreme advantage to Australia of the Government being able to bring back seasoned and experienced Australian Imperial Force divisions. We were told of the great part that they had played in stiffening the Army and saving Australia Japanese aggression. I recall reluctantly, but as an appeal has been made to history, I recall promptly, that the enlistment of the Australian Imperial Force divisions was the act of a government consisting of members now on this side of the House, and that when I, as Prime Minister, announced that those divisions would go overseas-and if they had never gone overseas they would never have become seasoned and experienced divisions capable of becoming the backbone of the Australian Army-the present Prime Minister, who was then Leader of the Opposition, protested against the proposal, probably against his better judgment, and that his protest, which was put in the form of a motion, was supported by every honourable member on the Labour side of the House. I remember very well-and this again is a relevant piece of history-that we would not have much in the way of militia forces today but for the fact that early in this war, indeed, within a few weeks of its commencement, compulsory military training was re-introduced in Australia. The re-introduction of compulsory Mr Menzies. military training was contrary to the platform of the Labour party, and the proposal excited motions of protest and violent attacks. It was only in the middle of 1940, when what might have been either the dawn or the sunset of an election began to appear, that-the Labour party, at one of its historic conferences, decided for the first time that there would be compulsory military training and agreed with a decision made seven months earlier by the Government then in office that the Australian Imperial Force divisions serving abroad should be reinforced. Just as "" those who live in glass houses should not throw stones "", so those who appeal to history in this matter are ill advised indeed to jeer at members on this side of the House for not having done in June, 1940, things that were not then anything like so urgent as they have been for the last twelve months. The vital question-and here I speak for myself-is one of complete unity within the forces themselves, complete identity in terms and conditions of service. We shall not get that while some from men are volunteers for service abroad and others are confined to service at home. Only three or four months ago the Prime Minister, when initiating an austerity campaign, invited the people of Australia to take a pledge in which the following words appeared:We .shall make of our nation two complete fighting armies-the fighting forces to smash their way back through New Guinea, Java, Malaya, the Philippines and on to Japan; and the working forces that will back them to the limit in mine, factory and workshop. That was the pledge which the right honourable gentleman asked every one of us to take; he included the honourable member for Melbourne, and all of us in this chamber. I say without hesitation that it is an affront to the intelligence and self-respect of Australians to be told that a government, which can on« week use those stirring words, those true words, and week after week thereafter make its appeal, and occasionally almost its demands, to fully conscripted allies on the other side of the world, should immediately thereafter come to Parliament and explain that the fighting forces who - I must again quote those words- "" will smash their way back through Java, Malaya, the Philippines and on to Japan"" are to be either a sadly overworked Australian Imperial Force or conscripts from London or New York who are fighting thousands of miles from their homes. This is not a very proud moment in the history of this Parliament, nor will it be a proud moment in the history of Australia. This bill and the. reasoning behind it exhibit a very poor conception either of this war as a global war, unless thai is a mere phrase and not a real belief, OT of our duty in relation to it. We shall regain our self-respect and some of our lost reputation only when we abandon this conception and come to realise that this is a world war, and that no limit can be set to the duty of Australia in relation to it.",27
58,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Macquarie - Treasurer) 1-4.38] - The right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) has tried to make a great deal out of the press reports of statements bysupporters of his own party in regard to the merging of the Militia and the Australian Imperial Force. It is, therefore, well to make i/t clear that at no time has the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) proposed to either a Labour conference or this country that the Government should merge the two forces into one. That idea, I regret to say, arose out of suggestions by a sensation-mongering press, and it was taken up by representatives of the Opposition with the object of injuring a Labour government which, I can Bay without being unduly egotistical, has in this crisis in Australia's history done a wonderful job, as is recognized by many people throughout the Commonwealth. Members of the Opposition and those who saw a chance to injure the Prime Minister, by discrediting him among the members of his own party, aro actuated by a desire for office. I say frankly that, among some members of the Opposition, there H a greater desire for office and an opportunity to regain some of their lost power than there is to assist the nation in it ; time of need. The term ""merger"" in relation to the Australian Imperial Force and the Militia, was coined by the sensationmongering press of - this country, and taken up oy members of the Opposition parties in this Parliament because they saw in it an opportunity to split this Government which came .into office not because the Labour party had a direct majority in this chamber or in the Senate, but because supporters of the previous Administration could not even agree among themselves as to how they should conduct their own paTty business, far less the business of defending Australia. Almost immediately the Lab our Government took over the reins of office, it was faced with a military situation unparalleled in our history. Much has been said about the need for courage and determination to face the 1 future resolutely, but I would remind honourable members that wben the right honourable member for Kooyong was Prime Minister, he inserted, at the request of the members of the then Opposition, a special provision in the National Security Act, stipulating that that legislation would not bo used to impose conscription' for overseas military service. The right honourable member has said that had that provision not been inserted, the country would have been torn to pieces; but surely that was not the act of a brave man. A brave man, holding a majority in both Houses, as did the right honourable member for Kooyong at that time, would have had the courage to ignore whatever views were expressedby his political opponents, and to take whatever action he deemed necessary in the interests of this country. Does the right honourable member not think that there is still a danger that this country would be torn to ""pieces if an attempt were made to give effect to such a policy at the present time?",30
59,Mr MENZIES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Condition s then were nothing like what they are now.,30
60,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I admit that circumstances have changed in some respects, but surely the right honourable member will admit that there is still a great danger that the imposition of conscription for overseas service might destroy a very valuable asset in the conduct of this war, namely, the solidarity of the great mass of the working people in the support of our war effort^ This' war cannot be won merely by seouring tl)g; f oodwill uential and support of people in inpositions, such people as industrial executives, newspaper editors, and others who represent what I may describe, without any attempt at disparagement, as the more conservative elements in the community. Whatever policy may be adopted it can be won only if we have the united support of the masses of the working people. The right honourable member for Kooyong must realise that the proposal which, he is now advocating, namely, the merging of the Australian Imperial Force and the Citizen Military Forces, is one which in the last war, under much more favourable circumstances than exist today, caused considerable harm to public morale.",30
61,Mr MENZIES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The matter did wise in the last war.,31
62,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"The division of public opinion on the subject of conscription for overseas service was extremely harmful to this country, and nobody kuows that better than the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) who is the Leader of the party of which the right honourable member for Kooyong is a member. Althongh I have nc doubt that the right honourable member for Kooyong is sincere in the proposal that he supports, he must be aware that it could create a serious division in the - anks of the people. Moreover, the question is one which the right honourable member's own party has agreed should not be decided except - by referendum. As to other proposals to which considerable prominence has been given in recent months, the almost unanimous opinion has been that the present is n most inappropriate time to embark upon a referendum on any subject. What has the Government done, and what has been proposed by the Prime Minister? The Prime Miaistor. went along to what all honourable members kuow to he the governing body of the Labour movement and made certain proposals. Is there anything very dreadful in that? I imagine that much of the policy of the United Australia party and the United Country party i» decided by meetings of members of ter not say that there those parties. I notice that are held regularly aud that resolutions tsre carried. One docs not have to be a member «f the inner eirclo of these organizations to realise that the policy to be pursued by honourable members opposite is decided in that way. I have noticed that although the honourable member for Barker { Mr. Archie Cameron) is inclined at times to express belligerently his own personal views, when the bells ring for a division he is always found voting with his party. I have not seen him moke any attempt to break his party affiliations. He says all sorts of things in criticism of his own party as well as of the Labour party, but when it comes to a show-down he always votes with his colleagues in Opposition. I do not know exactly to what party he belongs, bait obviously he has more affinity with the conservative side of not the House than with this side. I put it to the right honourable member for Kooyong that just as he, sensing amongst the people a violent division of opinion which would iiiudcr the war effort, inserted certain safeguards in the National Security Act despite the fact that his Government's majority in both Houses of Parliament would have enabled him to ignore opposition if he so desired, this Government, bearing in mind the entire strategy of the war and the requirements ef the present situation which may possibly continue for a long time to come, has decided to extend the geographical limits - that is the .exact phrase which should, have been used in the press if the truth were' strictly adhered te-in which thir Militia forces may serve. That was the simple proposition put by the Prim* Minister to the governing authority of the LabouT party in the same way as otlier important issues have been sub-. milted to that body from time to time.. It is desirable that the public mind, should be clear on that point. There has. never been any deviation by the Prime Minister or the Labour party sinew .the proposal was first advanced by the right honourable gentleman in an endeavour to meet the needs of the situation now facing, this country.",31
63,Mr AXTHOSY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Did the Prime Miniswas no argument such meetings Kgainst one army?,31
64,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I do not rememberwhat might have been said in the press.. The newspapers published statements coined in phrases drawn entirely from their own imagination'; those phrases were not used by the Prime Minister, or by any other member of this party. The Prime Minister's original proposition was received with acclamation by a great number of people and a majority of honourable members. He has not deviated one point from his original proposition. Neither the Prime Minister, nor the Government, can be held responsible for statements made by irresponsible people who are merely bent on creating some sensation, and who think that they can be king-makcTs and play a great part in determining who shall govern this oountry. After consultation with those competent to express an opinion, not only in this but also in other countries, it was beiioved, not particularly in relation to this matter, but in accordance with global strategy, that it was necessary for the defence of this country to implement the' proposal embodied in this measure. From that proposition we have Hot shifted one line. It is just as well make that clear to those people who now say that this proposal represents a whittling down of the Prime Minister's original proposition. Mr A^Tnojsr - Has not the Government shifted off its original course * meridian or two?",31
65,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Ko ; we have not shifted one point. It is true that the press has tried to create a certain atmosphere; but the original proposal has not been whittled down one bit. A decision was reacned after very careful consideration, and that decision is now pat to this Parliament. Why did not the right, honourable member for Kooyong, when he was Prime Minieter, with all his vaunted courage, and a majority_ inborn Houses, go on with the proposition that he now puts forward? He answers .'that question himself. He says, "" I was afraid I would tear this country to pieces if. I did that"".",32
66,Mr ANTHONY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,He also said that it Has. not necessary at the time.,32
67,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"But the right honourable member poses as the embodiment of wisdom. Unlike a mere mortal, he is able to look into the future. In his speech he sneered, and in his joking way tried to hold up the Government to ridicule. Yet the Government he led was so divided against itself that it could not govern its party meetings. He now poses as a man of great wisdom. The proposal now placed before the House meets all the needs of the war situation, and :t has been brought forward by the Prime Minister, who is aware of our needs now and in the future, so far as they can be foreseen by those who are competent to understand what are likely to be our requirements, not only for the immediate future but also for the full duration of the war. They deeided what area should constitute the South-Western Pacific Zone. They visualized how ibis war was to be conducted, and how the commands within a global strategy, should be arranged. They, and not this Government, decided those matters. They, the leaders of military thought in all the Allied Nations, led by President Bcosevelt and. Prime Minister Churchill, inferred on these - matters. to Despite the fact that the Governments of Australia and New Zealand desired that the South-West Pacific Area should embrace a wider area they, with their knowledge of the conduct of war. both now aud in the future, fixed the boundaries of the South-West Pacific Area as they now exist. Admittedly, slight changes of the original boundaries have been made, but, in substance, these people, who were the most competent to decide allied strategy' now and in the future, fixed the boundaries of the South-West Pacific Area. General Douglas MACArthur was appointed Commander-in-Ohief in that area, and it is the particular duty of the Australian people, in. association with him, to protect it, playing their part in accordance. with allied global strategy. My main reason for rising to speak in this debate is to remove the misconception which exists in the press, and in the minds of honourable members opposite concerning the Government's original proposition. Right from the start of the discussion of the subject, the press endeavoured to create in the minds of the people, the impression that the Government's proposition meant the merging of the Militia and the Australian Imperial Force. I want to remove that idea entirely. It has never been in the minds of the Prime Minister or members of this party. Honourable members opposite may differ as to whether this proposition is right or wrong; .but I reiterate that the Government has not departed from the original proposition put forward by the Prime Minister, and which is now embodied in the bill before us. All of us are human. Therefore, I cannot but come to the conclusion that honourable members opposite saw in this proposal an opportunity to split the Labour party. Nothing would give them greater gratification. They would be glad to see, as happened when the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) put his conscription proposals to the test of a referendum, the people who largely represent the workers of this country split into ribbons through an internal dispute over this problem. It is clear that any such dispute could not but have the result of detracting from our war effort.",32
68,Mr ABBOTT,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Will the Minister deny that the Prime Minister at his press conference on the 20th November last said that one army with one'command was now a military necessity, because of the bitter handicaps imposed by factors hindering military mobility?",33
69,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,I do not know whether that report is correct. I have seen statements made by the Prime Minister distorted in press reports. I can quite understand that the Prime Minister meant that he had decided that in this particular area the Australian Imperial Force and the Citizen Military Forces should be able to fight as one army. That is the purport of the Government's proposal.,33
70,Mr WILSON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,And with the same status.,33
71,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Yes ; and the two forces to be on the same conditions. That is the whole intention of the Government; but that does not mean a merging of the Australian Imperial Force and the Citizen Military Forces.,33
72,Mr ABBOTT,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,What shall we do when we come to the boundary line? Have the Militia to step out?,33
73,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The honourable member would probably draw the boundary line in the middle of Europe. Mr ABBOTT.=- I would not. I refer to the boundary that will divide Java.,33
74,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Whether the judgment of the Government is good or bad is not the point.,33
75,Mr ABBOTT,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Has the Japanese Government approved the boundary fixed by the Commonwealth Government?',33
76,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Does the honourable member consider that Australia, with the forces that it can muster in this global war, can send its troops all over the world? Surely there must be a limit to our activities!",33
77,Mr ABBOTT,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,I refer to Borneo and Java.,33
78,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,I remind the honourable member that even the Australian Imperial Force can be sent to theatres of war only with the consent of the Commonwealth Government.,33
79,Mr ABBOTT,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Will the Treasurer answer my question about Borneo and Java?,33
80,Mr OHLFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"When the honourable member contends that the Government should bo permitted to send our troops anywhere in the world, he should not lose sight of the fact that the Australian Imperial Force could not have been sent t,o Greece if the Commonwealth Government had objected.",33
81,Mr ABBOTT,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I object to the Treasurer putting into my mouth words that I did not use. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! This running fire of interjections must ceaso. The Treasurer is entitled to be heard.",33
82,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I emphasize that the High Command' cannot send the Australian Imperial Force to any part of the world unless it obtains^the approval of the Commonwealth Government. The Australian Imperial Fqrce could not have been sent to Greece, even though the military command had considered their participation to be a vital necessity in that campaign, if the Commonwealth Government had not consented.",33
83,Mr HUGHES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,That statement answers the contention of the Treasurer.,33
84,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"No Australian soldiers could have been despatched to Greece unless the Prime Minister of the day, on behalf of the Government, had agreed to .their 'transfer from Africa.",33
85,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,What is wrong with that?,34
86,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"No matter how wide we make the limits of the area in which Australian troops may be used, their participation in a campaign will still be subject to the - approval of the Government.",34
87,Mr HUGHES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,That is the guarantee.,34
88,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"It does not m.ean that if the use of the Citizen Military Forces were permitted outside the South-West Pacific Area, the Commonwealth Government would allow them to be sent to any part of the world-. - Sir FREDERICK .STEWART - That is an excellent reason for widening the denned limits of the area in which the Citizen Military Forces may be used.",34
89,Mr ANTHONY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The Government could take that power.,34
90,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"The previous Government, in which the honourable member was a Minister, did not take that power because it was politically afraid to do so. Cabinet feared that such an attempt would divide the people into two irreconcilable factions. . Mr HARRISON - The circumstances are now entirely different.",34
91,Mr CHIFLEY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I grow weary of hearing that excuse. My purpose in participating in this.debate was to assure House that' the statements which have been made .about merging the Citizen Military Forces and the Australian Imperial Force are concoctions of the press or the Opposition. The original proposal of,the Prime Minister has not been altered. The area in which the Citizen Military Forces may serve has been defined by the rig^ht honourable gentleman who is better informed regarding global strategy than is any other honourable member. In an earnest desire to do the best thing in the circumstances the Prime Minister has defined those limits, and he now asks the House to approve of them.",34
92,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Barker) [€55] - I absolutely scout the idea that this bill is a military measure. It has nothing to do in the strict sense of the word with military affairs. The Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) has introduced it as a political - measure, and it is the result of a political decision, not by the Commonwealth Government, but .by an irresponsible body outside Parliament which is apparently in a position to dictate to the Government what it shall and shall not - do. This measure must be contested for three reasons. First, because of its origin and the circumstances in which it has been introduced; secondly, because of the serious consequences in the international sphere to the good reputation of the Commonwealth; and, thirdly, because it does not enable the .Commonwealth Government properly to conduct the military operations in which it is engaged. For. three months, Australian newspapers and broadcasting stations have .been declaring that the principal objective of the Commonwealth Government was to merge the Australian Imperial Force and the Citizen Military Forces. I did not hear until this afternoon, and I certainly did not read, any contradiction by the Prime Minister or any other Minister of that statement which has been dinned into the mind of the Australian public for three months. Even the secret ""government spokesman"" who seems to know a good deal about what is happening, was silent on the subject. As the Government must have been aware of these statements, it was undoubtedly under an obligation to the people to deny the them. The Government is entitled to use every"" broadcasting station in the Com1 monwealth for half an hour daily for the purpose of announcing its intentions to the public; and I have no doubt that i r the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) had approached the editors of leading Australian newspapers, they would have published a contradiction of this unfortunate story. Another matter, imperfectly concealed but capable of only one interpretation, has been a constant rumour that this bill has its genesis in certain recommendations or requests which emanated .from the Commander-in-Chief of the South-West Pacific Area, General Douglas MACArthur. Personally, I am not of that opinion. I do not believe that the Commander-in-Chief, having his responsibilities to the United States of America, would take it upon himself to suggest to the Commonwealth Government what it should do with the Australian Militia. I consider that he would leave that matter to the (Government's good judgment and sense of decency. I am afraid that he will be disappointed.",34
93,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Does the honourable member consider that the Government ought to .answer the misrepresentations that appear in the press?,35
94,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"1 do nothink .that it ought to answer all the statements of the honourable gentleman, because they answer themselves.",35
95,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Do not try to misrepresent my attitude!,35
96,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"My hostility to the honourable member is not personal but only political. Honourable members are well aware of the manner in which the bill descended from Mount Olympus to the marsh. At first, the public assumed that the bill would effect the merger of the Australian Imperial Porce and the Citizen Military Forces. There was to be only one army; one responsibility, one organization, one system of training and one military objective, namely, the defeat of the enemy who is so near our shores. ""When we consider the truth of oft-repeated statements about the smallness of our population, and the. vastness of our tory, we must confess that we have not adopted a very genteel attitude in our international relations in the Pacific zone during the last 40 years. We have ridden a horse as high as any camel, and now we are asked to get down on to the ground and fight. But the attitude of the Labour party is that we shall put into the struggle not all that we have, hut only a portion of what we have.",35
97,Mr CAXWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"We cannot iput in all that we have, because we must defend our country.",35
98,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Under this bill we are not attempting to put in all of what we have to spare. We are not playing our part, as we should be if we recognized that we are engaged in total - war. We are debating a bill which represents the limit beyond which a Labour organization outside this Parliament would not authorize the Prime Minister to proceed. If the Attorney^General brings in a bill to amend the Constitution - and no doubt he will be tempted or provoked into some such action before very long-on e of its provisions should be that BO man shall be allowed to take his seat in this Parliament if he has given a pledge or signed an undertaking to submit to the dictation of any outside body. It is high time that such a provision went into the Australian Constitution, in view of the spectacle that we all witnessed in the not far distant past, of the Prime Minister attending a private meeting in the City of Melbourne, and being there told, by the good graee of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) and some of hisfriends, to depart while they considered where the armed forces of Australia should be employed in time of war. The shade of W. S. Gilbert must have groaned at having missed the chance to satirize such a happening. It would not be the Lord High Chancellor or the Mikado of Japan who would be held up to ridicule. We would see as leading lights in this drama of nonsense the right honourable gentleman and his satellites, the lord high panjandrum and the lord high executioner of the Trades Hall, no doubt closely attended by the honourable member for Melbourne.",35
99,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Did not a previous. terriPrime Minister, who is now the honourable member's leader, do very much the same in 1916 ?",35
100,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I do not know to what the honourable member for Melbourne is referring. There is also the question of the two maps. I do not think I am breaking any confidence when I say that I went by invitation last week to see a certain map, which I know that many other honourable members on this side of the chamber saw. I can assure the House that the boundaries laid down in that map are not the boundaries laid down in this bill - The House is entitled to know why they were changed.",35
101,Mr COLLINS,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Probably by direction.,35
102,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,No doubt by direction.,35
103,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Does the honourable member believe in any boundaries at all ? Mr Archie CAMERON.^ I do not believe in any ridiculous, boundaries of this kind. I noted the interjection of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Peterson-) when the right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) was speaking. I observed very early that the .southern limit of this area was the South Pole, but when we look at our own act on the statute-book, under which we took over control of a vast area of the Antarctic by international agreement, we see that we can send troops - under this bill to a portion of the Antarctic continent which is under our jurisdiction, but not to other portions. There is one long strip one degree wide, a long sliver of waste and ice-remind iag me of the intellectual ice 'that OB the benches opposite-to which we could not send our Militia. The eastern boundary of our Antarctic territory is the 160th. degree of east longitude, but this area ends at the 159th degree, so that there is downthere one degree, stretching across the sea to the South Pole, from which our men would be excluded, whilst on the other side we could not send men to all that part of Antarctica which stretches from the 110 th to the 45 th degree of east longitude. It is not likely that we shall ever send .people there, except perhaps to cool their tempers and freeze their disappointment. For that purpose Borne of our friends opposite might go there for an extended stay. When, however, we look at the other end of the picture we 'see some ridiculous things. Borneo has been referred to. According to this bill, we send Australian Militia into Dutch Borneo, but we dare not send them into British Borneo; or we could send them into eastern J ava, but must not send them into western Java,",35
104,Mr CAHWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,What does the honourable member think of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition in this connection?,36
105,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I am not dealing with the speech of the Leader of the Opposition at the moment. He is not the Government. The Government is on the. other side of the House. So far as my own attitude is concerned, before I am finished the honourable member for Melbourne will know quite definitely where I stand. He can deal with the Loader of the Opposition in his own way. In Java there are still to the best of my belief some Australian prisoners of war. There are many Australian prisoners of war in Malaya. According to the dictate of the Australian Labour party to its servant the Commonwealth Government, we cannot send Militia troops into Malaya or western Java, even if we have them in the adjoining parts of the country, in order to rescue our own men. I cry shame on any bill that makes such a provision, and more shame on any Parliament that passes it. Mr BLACKBVJ«C - This bill does not go as far as the Labour Conference decision.",36
106,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The we see honourable member for Bourke may be able to tell us something very interesting on that subject.,36
107,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Is the honourable member more concerned about the rubber plantations and the tin mines than about the prisoners of war in Malaya?,36
108,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"If talk were the most valuable tiling in this world the honourable member for Melbourne would be a gold-mine. The Prime Minister has advanced the argument that the Australian Navy and Air Force can go anywhere. What is this great democratic principle that the Government and the Labour party now put up? Are there to be two laws and two sets of privileges in this country! Are we to tolerate two sets of responsibilities? Isthere to be one law and one responsibility for the could volunteer, and another law and another responsibility for the man who will not volunteer? In no democratic community under modern conditions can there be two laws applying to different sets of people. Every man must take his share of the load. Later on I shall say something about the-burden of taxation. This is a case in which with our limited resources we have nothing like what we roquire to do our share of the job that we have undertaken. It is absurd to suggest that the Militia are to go into a new area and to be told, as King Canute told the waves: "" Thus far and no farther"". It is to be noted that the waves did not take much notice of King Canute. The time will come, and I shall be quite happy to be on this side of the chamber to witness it, when another Labour Government will have to come before this House and eat this bill, and apologize for ever having 1 brought it in. I have watched the shifts and contortions of the Labour party year in and year out. I was sitting on the other side of the chamber, in the seat that the honourable member for Melbourne now occupies, when we heard the famous Wynter defence policy speech that the Prime Minister referred to yesterday. It was only right that it should have been delivered in this House on the 5th November! It was delivered by the then Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) and we had on the other side a certain Minister waiting to deliver the same speech; it was somebody else's stuff. But the policy of the Labour party was never baaed on it. It was the decision of the last Lyons Government that the strength of the Militia should be increased to 70,000 men. I ask any member of the Government party today, particularly of those who are His Majesty's Ministers of State, to rise in his place and tell this chamber and the country what he did towards raising those 70,000 men on that occasion. There will be a deadly silence in answer to that challenge, because so far as I know not one of the present Ministers went out and put before the country the case that the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) was putting forward on behalf of the Lyons Government when it increased the Militia to 70,000 men. We then had a record peace-time defence vote, and the division that was taken will show what the members of the Labour party did on that occasion, the year after the famous Wynter speech. Then came the war. I now see opposite me honourable members who were at that, time sitting on this side of the chamber, and. I remember hearing some of them ask who were the. enemies which the Lyons Government was preparing to fight. What was the reason for this wasteful expenditure, they asked, and one. honourable member 'asked how the Government could expect him to agree to send the sons of the workers overseas to fight Britain's imperialist wars. There has been a change of heart since then. There are many men in this chamber who said only a little while ago that Japan was no enemy of ours, and that the Government was wasting money in preparing to defend the country. The Mr Archie Cameron. government of the day was accused of creating hysteria when it called for increased defence measures. However, early in 1940, the present Prime Minister, who was then Leader of the Opposition, suffered a sudden change of heart. I do not think that he even consulted the Australasian Council of Trade Unions before his conversion. He had previously voted against the proposal to send the Australian Imperial Force overseas, but when he wa3 campaigning in the Geelong district on behalf of the honourable member for Corio (Mr. Dedman), he decided that the Australian Imperial Force would have to be reinforced. Later, when the pressure increased somewhat, he even declared himself in favour of the Empire Air Training Scheme. These concessions were the political price which purchased the presence in this chamlber of the Minister for War Organization of Industry (Mr Dedman). The question arises as to what will be the position of members of the Citizen Military Forces if, in the course of a campaign, they happen to cross the boundaries laid down in this bill. According to international law, if a man in uniform is caught by t the enemy doing something beyond the duties prescribed for him by his Government, he has no rights under the law. Presumably, if a militiaman were taken prisoner by the Japanese outside the zone prescribed in the bill, he would not be entitled to the treatment which international law prescribes for prisoners. The important thing to consider in connection with this measure is the honour and international reputation of Australia. I have very strong feelings on this point, and I would refuse to represent in this Parliament any electorate which wanted me to accept this bill. In my opinion, this Government has squealed too much whenever we looked like gettinghurt. I frequently see extracts from overseas journals, and I have learned that in many quarters Australia has earned the reputation of being a country that squeals. If we agree tamely to accept this tragio measure, we shall be known overseas, not as squealers, ""but as ""welshers"". We have had emissaries running to London and Washington to ask for help. We have been prepared to accept the assistance of conscripts, and we have not been too fussy about their being over 21 years of age. We have accepted whatever help was forthcoming, whether from sailors, airmen, or soldiers. We have accepted the help of men from the islands to the north that have been overrun by the enemy. We have asked for, and have accepted, war material which has been made under conditions that our own unionists would not accept. The industrial record of this country over the last few months, particularly the activities of the coal miners and the wharf labourers, has been disgraceful. That statement can go out to the people of this country as coming from me. I intend that it should, and I do not care if I am accused of dividing the country. I have a profound conviction that until we get some effective division on matters of this kind we shall continue to have our policies founded on expediency rather than on principle. This bill reeks of expediency. It should never have been brought down, and it should certainly not be allowed to go through Parliament without challenge. Therefore, I move the following amendment:That all words after ""That"" he left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:- "" the bill be withdrawn redrafted to provide that any member of the Citizen Military Forces may be required to serve anywhere beyond the limits of Australia."" Thia is supposed to be a total war, and so far as we are concerned we must win or we shall be totally lost. We are fighting a war in which there can be no compromise. We cannot compromise with our enemy to the north. We are engaged in one of the bitterest racial wars in the history of mankind, and we cannot wage it successfully by half measures. The bill before us is an insult to the people of Australia. I believe that the heart, mind and spirit of the people of this country are behind the exertion by the Government of every effort that can be ' put forward in order to win the war. This bill does not do speak. that. It falls far short of any measure that I would be prepared to support Therefore I seek to amend it, so that everything we have can be thrown into the struggle. When the time comes for the discussion of peace terms, I hope that there will not be a negotiated peace, because I do not see how we could negotiate with Tokyo. I believe, a3 was said recently by a member of the Senate, that we must either destroy Japan as a Pacific power or the Japanese will completely overrun Australia and destroy us. There can be no half measures with regard to the men, the material, the time or the place. We must put all we have into the fight, where it is needed. Until that is the policy of this Parliament, I and others who share my opinions will be obliged to act as I intend to act today. Not long ago, I told the Prime Minister that he was attempting to assume the role of a Cromwell. He has adopted the role of a Cromwell, but that of Richard the son and not Oliver the father. The people of Australia should tell the Government to conduct the war effort on the basis of a total war, and the sooner they do it the better it will be. I am not to be intimidated by a threat of an election. Whatever the characteristic boasting of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) may be, he having inherited one of the safest seats in Australia, there are many members on this side who will not wish to taste the electoral waters too soon. If the Governand ment wishes to appeal to the people it has the right to do so, but there is no certainty that it will be returned to power. I have too great a faith in the common sense, the political acumen and the inherent human decency of the people of Australia to believe that they would support a government that has asked the Parliament to pass such a bill as that now before us. If Ministers or other honourable members opposite happen to be Australia's delegates at the peace conference what excuses for this bill will they be able to offer to the representatives of the Dutch, American, British and other nations with whom we have been associated in the Pacific war?",36
109,Mr DUKCAN,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"HTJGHES - I second the amendment, and reserve my right to",38
110,Sir GEORGE BELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Darwin) [5.26]. - This bill constitutes a departure from the traditional policy of the Labour party, in that it provides for service by the Australian Militia beyond the boundaries of the Commonwealth. It would aho have been a departure from the traditional policy of the party had the Prime Minister submitted the measure without having first referred it to the interstate conference - of the Australian Labour party, because members of the party opposite have always boasted that that conference determines their policy and that they adhere to it. Therefore it is not surprising to me that the Prime Minister did consult that conference, although I think that he acted wrongly in doing so. The people of Australia did not return the Labour party with a majority at the last elections, but many of them supported that, party with their eyes open. Presumably the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Wilson) and the honourable member for Henty (Mr Coles) approved of the action taken by the Prime Minister with regard to this measure, but the honourable member for Henty has now intimated that he intends to move what he describes as a small amendment, which he thinks that the Prime Minister will accept. My opinion differs entirely from that of the honourable member. If his amendment were accepted the House might just as well amend the Defence Act which provides that no member of the Citizen Military Forces shall be called upon to serve outside Australia unless he volunteers to do so, because under that amendment the Government would decide where and when such service should be required. Some opponentsof the proposal to require the Militia to serve' in any theatre of war outside the Commonwealth and its territories look upon this as a conscription issue,, but I claim that no such issue arises. The Militia isalready conscripted, and there is now no serious objection to. that on the part of certain able members who were recently loud in their protestsagainst conscription. As I understand conscription, under it a man is compelled, to be trained and to fight anywhere, even against his will. He may be temperamentally unfitted and may, be worthless as a soldier; many men are, yet they are taken from theiii homes and their ordinary Sir Oeorge Bell. avocations, and are trained. There is no serious objection to that by certain honourable members. Their opposition is to sending Australian troops out of Australia to fight. We have had evidence of that on quite a number of occasions. Protests have been made, and votes have been cast in this House against the proposal to send the Australian Imperial Force out of Australia. I do not think that the honourable members for Bourkc (Mr Blackburn) and Bat-man (Mr. Brennan) will be offended at my saying that they have always consistently opposed the sending of men out of Australia to fight. If consistency be a virtue, then they have been virtuous in that regard. I cannot say that of many of their colleagues. As the objection is to sending Australians out of this country to fight, it is useless to try to make it appear that the objection is to conscription. It is nothing of the kind. On whichever side of a geographical line a man is called upon to fight, he is equally a conscript. The drawing of geographical lines, and the defining of zones in which the Militia may be used, are most bewildering to every body, including many friends of the Prime Minister. I , like the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), was shown a map on which were drawn lines indicating the area of General MACArthur's command. That was deemed to be the area in which, under this legislation, the Militia would be allowed to operate. But when we saw the bill we learned that the zone which it defines is not identical with the area of General MACArthur's command. I cannot understand why it was considered that the area in which the Militia should serve should be confined to that of General MACArthur's command. After all, the areas of commands change in every war. At present, General Alexander hascommand of the Middle East, yet the greater honor- part of his forces is far beyond the Middle East.. Before this war has been won, the area of General MACArthur's command will have been extended. Therefore,, why stipulate that the present South-West Pacific Area shall be that in which the Militia shall serve? It is most extraordinary.. But what is stranger still is that the zone defined in the bill does-not coincide with the area of his command,; and it is entirely different from '.the area indicated on the map that we were shown. Some one has said that the zone has been whittled down.",38
111,Mr LAZZARINI,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,That is not correct.,40
112,Sir GEORGE BELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Perhaps it is .no.t. The reason for 'the alteration has to be explained. Guadalcanal and many .other islands off the east coast - of Australia are outside the area into which the Government is to be allowed to send the Militia. If New Zealand, which is .more closely .related to us than any other country in the world, were .likely to be invaded next week, we could :not send assistance unless we had first ipassed an act of Parliament empowering that to be done. Mr GBO.KOE QLAAVSOK - Coul d not V Australian imperial Force be sen-t-4",40
113,Sir GEORGE BELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Oh , yes. In - that .event the Australian Imperial Force would be withdrawn .from Australia, New Guinea, or wherever else it .might the. The Prime Minister has said 'that the Militia are :to be used - at bases and on lines of communication after the Australian Imperial Force has conquered the islands to the north of Australia and has pushed on farther. It is now said that that force conld - be sent 'to New Zealand, if that - dominion needed assistance. I do not 'know its exact - number, but I do not suppose that it is more than 70,000. The Prime Minister told us last night that it consists of four divisions, including .the division - in the Middle East. I do .not pretend to even guess at what the enemy may do, ibut I should think it quite possible that if he can send a force to Australia he can with equal facility send one to New Zealand. He would need to hav.e command of the sea before he could do either. If he were to send a force to New Zealand, we would not be able to send to the assistance of that .dominion any of our militia forces. If the Government is considering public opinion, surely it can visualize the .view that will be taken of that position by the people of Australia'! The eastern boundary proposed by the bill does not nearly extend to the limit of General MACArthur's command. The Prime Minister's refutation last night of the assertion that the noninclusion of Malaya is an abandonment of Australian iprisoners of war .in that region, was extraordinarily weak. His statement was, that .it might as well .be said that we .were abandoning our prisoners of war in Germany. I should suppose that during every waking hour .the Prime Minister and the .Minister for the Army (Mr Forde) are thinking of those prisoners. To me, the most hateful feature of either this or the last war is that a division of our men has been captured and is now inside wires at night and working during the daylight hours under the compulsion of members of what we regard 'as an inferior Tace-the 3'apanese. Yet we cannot send our men to assist in their release. Americans, Britons, - Chinese and 'Dutchmen may the - release 'them from their 'bondage, but our men must not. Should that occur, our heads would - hang in shame for ever; we would not be able to escape from the disgrace. The Government should have paid Jieed to this consideration at least when it set out to define and limit the boundaries within which our men shall be : obliged to fight. This is a colossal piece of - humbug, and an attempt at face-saving. The 'Government wanted to do something. It could - do what has been suggested 'by fee honourable member - for Henty (M»r. 'Coles-), but, of course, it .will not. The 'Government is empowered to decide where the Australian Imperial - Force or the MiEfia shall the sent. Then why all this fuss and trouble about fixing .geographical lines within which they may fight? The thing is so utterly absurd that we must be the laughingstock of the world. What is even more absurd is that a proclamation must .be issued before the MiUtia can be sent to any of those islands. I do not want to discuss strategy, but I - do not suppose that the military advisers of the - Government think that they will defeat Jia,pan by occupying the islands which the Prime Minister described last night ias malaria stricken. They may decide to send men to Timor- I do not knowbu t they .could not be sent there unless a proclamation had first been issued. Of course, the enemy will not listen! If it should 'be decided to send men to Timor, a proclamation to that effect would be issued. Then, it might be decided that .another island should be occupied, so, in due course, another proclamation would be issued; and so on. This is the most absurd proposal that has ever been submitted to any Parliament in the world, and it must be laughed at by any person who thinks about it ",40
114,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The Leader of Opposition supports it .,41
115,Sir GEORGE BELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"The honourable member for Melbourne interjects again. When the former honourable member for Melbourne, Dr Maloney, died, this House grieved. It has grieved every sitting day since. If we do not want to look too absurd in the eyes of the world, we shall not vote against the proposal that the Militia may be sent a little farther away than was previously allowed. I , at least, shall not vote against the proposal; nor will the Leader of the Opposition. Yet that right honourable gentleman is accused of insincerity by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Coles). I should not have thought that the honourable member for Henty would accuse an honourable member on this side of insincerity. There is nothing insincere about the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition. On the contrary, it is perfectly sensible, but whether he will vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), I do not know. I know what I shall do.",41

117,Sir GEORGE BELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"That will be revealed in due course. I have said that the whole proposal is bewildering. I had thought it was worse than thatthat it was colossal humbug and a facesaving scheme. It will, however, be quite ineffective. Moreover, it will make this Parliament, as well as the Government and the people of Australia, the laughingseas stock of the world. Nothing like it has ever previously been introduced in any parliament. I am astonished that the Prime Minister should introduce such a measure, because I had a good deal of respect for his judgment and his methods. However, his. action is the logical of his training, but the zone he has denned in the bill is beyond any understanding. The right honourable gentleman has my . sympathy, but because of his action in introducing a measure of this sort, he will be regarded for ever as unfitted for the high position which he now holds.",41

123,Sir FXEDEKICIV STEWART,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The honourable member's name was mentioned.,41
124,Mr BRENNTAN,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I know that in another part of the debate I was commended for consistency. The bill also proposes to amend section 5 (7) of the National Security Act which, true to the policy of the Labour party up to the time of the introduction of that legislation, and later, ruled out conscription for overand foreign service. In a fairly long parliamentary career; I have been associated with opposition to conscription of that kind. Indeed, as I enjoyed the distinction of leading the debate in the House of Representatives on the 14th September, 1916, when the present right result honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) introduced what may be described as the Conscription Referendum Bill, I may claim to have been fairly actively associated with the opposition to conscription. I took an active part in the referendum campaigns. The quesmethods tion to be submitted to the electors as set out in that measure wasAre you in favour of the Government liaviug, in this grave emergency, the compulsory powers over citizens in regard requiring their military service for the term of this war outside the Commonwealth it now has in regard to military service within the Commonwealth? It will be seen that the question was then submitted to the electors was rhetorical rather than direct. Two referendums followed, one in 1916 and the other in the following year. On both occasions the proposal was opposed by the Australian Labour party. The people were urged to vote in the negative, in fact, they did vote in the negative a large majority in the first case, and the second case by even a larger majority. Indeed, the only State which favoured scription for overseas service at the second referendum was Western Ausarmed tralia. It was a time of great rejoicing for the Labour party. That relatively small remnant of the political Labour party which had been led out of the party room by the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), very soon became assimiwith lated in the Nationalist party, but Labour party a3 a whole rejoiced. The party was organized for the vote as in probably never before, and it was mated, as it thought, by a great princitizen ciple. The success which it finally achieved at the polls was achieved deshim, pite the money which had poured from the capitalist coffers in opposition in spite of threats and punishments that were inflicted upon people who, until then, had considered themselves free; and in spite of the natural fear under which the people laboured as result of being involved in a war which up to that time was the greatest that had ever afflicted humanity, although we have lived long enough to experience still greater conflict. The Labour party was almost ruthless in its opposition. Hard-bitten members who had given population conspicuous service in building up the party were expelled from its memI bership. To admit oneself a conrested scriptionist was to place oneself outside the Labour party. Time will not wither nor custom stale the infinite variety [11] by which the Labour party has recongratulated itself as the anniversaries of its great achievement have occurred. I remember making a special journey from same this Parliament with my friend the to Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr. as Beasley) by car to Sydney and back in the early hours of the following morning after having attended a meeting which in the Paddington Town Hall at which we heartily congratulated ourselves and members of a new generation upon the achievements of other days. Opposition to conscription for overseas service was a part of our structure; it was of our bone and sinew; it was of the spirit and of the and, soul of the Labour party. Although 1 by took an active part in the campaigns to in which I have referred, my attitude had nothing to do with strategy. I offered conthen, and I offer now, no argument as to the disposition or the strength of our forces. I was then, and I am now, nothing of a strategist. I offered then, and I can offer now, no worthwhile opinion in regard to the opening of a first, second, or third front. My opposition to conscription was based upon other considerations which had nothing to do necessity or expediency, but which the had to do with the fact that as a legislator I was asked to be an instrument the seizing of an Australian citizen, if aniindeed he had ever been admitted to rights at all, forcibly expatriating bim from his own country, and making for my protection and for the protection of others, an instrument for to it ; waging war in a foreign country, or at least in a country whose government was not responsible to him or to the voters of the land from which he was expatriated. I hold to the view that it is the simply wrong; and that was the view which at that time generally prevailed, althoughthen, as now, there were strategists, persons who said that conscription a was not necessary, that men had volunteered in sufficient numbers, that divisions of adequate strength proportionate to our had already enlisted. All those things, and many more, were said, and, think, rightly said; but my opposition mainly on the principle which I have mentioned rather than upon strategical considerations. It is only fair to of those who are in disagreement with the view I am now expressing, - to say they do not like the term conscriptionist as it applies to them. They resent being dubbed conscriptionists for overseas vice ; and they argue that the policy they are now advocating has nothing to with the policy which they so roundly condemned, and so vigorously opposed in 'other days. They submit that it something entirely different. I can only say that my embarrassment proceeds from an inability to see any difference at all. Indeed, holding the views which I hold undoubted about conscription for overseas service, to found me there is no difference in fact. However, people are entitled to change their views, and parties are entitled to change their policies. It is worth remarking that honabstained orable members opposite whom. I would call callous conscriptionists avoid, apparhave ently for political reasons, the 'use of term conscription in this instance. They do not forget that conscription has been proved, on appeal to the people, to bn politically unpopular. They do not forget, that they were roundly beaten on this issue on two occasions. Particularly, they do not forget that the soldier's vote, it was juggled and misrepresented, and for a time suppressed, was on the balance of evidence now known, as, indeed, was then known, opposed to the acter, policy of conscription. Neither do honortions able members opposite forget that they are in this House by virtue of a pledge and wrong. which they gave to the electors that they were not in favour of conscription for overseas service. Indeed, every party through its leader was so pledged. There may have been individual breakaways. For instance, the recalcitrant honourable member for Barker (Mr. Cameron), in accordance with his because practice, may have jumped the fence and. gone out of bounds for the against time being. But, generally speaking, all parties, including the Labour party, were them. pledged against conscription. able members do not forget that. When one comes to examine what to me has been the fundamental consideration I notice that the Militia-the persons to operated on-by this new conscription-is regarded objectively as a "" thing "". It to be ""used"", ""moved"", and ployed"" to the best advantage, not of the members of the Militia, but Mr Brennan. that of other people. We did hear that - there was to be a merger. Now it appears that the merger was never part serof Government policy. I do not desire which to controvert what the Treasurer has do said upon that subject. Nor am I in a position to do so. What I do know is that many wise people thought that a is merger might very well take place, and that as the result of it members of the Militia might join the single army if they wished, and in the free exercise of their rights. It would be that some thought that very few of the Militia had, in fact, abstained from joining. In this matter the precise numbers who would have so makes no difference to me. It is rather the exceptional case that I in mind-the case of a person who, the notwithstanding coercion and persuasion in the exercise of what hitherto had been his free will, was unwilling to enlist for service in any theatre of war beyond Australia. It seems to me. that the most sinister aspect of conscriptionist propaganda is that it involves the forcible handling though of the few at the hands of the many. Conscription for service overseas is a matter not of geography but of governit ment, and involves personality, charindividuality, the highest tradiof liberty, and the personal conception of the difference between right The elements of conscription, to which I object, are force, deportation and expatriation, with the moral oentainty that at least some of those who are by force deported will never return. The question Archie was not how far they were to be deported, the distance is immaterial; The point is that they were to be deported their will to a country the Government of which owed no responsibility to The honourable member foT HonorBourke has written an excellent pamphlet against conscription, and I hope that all honourable members have read it. The author pointed out the essential difbe ference between men being compelled to fight for one's country within its bounis daries and being compelled to fight in a ""emdistant land. Personally, I prefer not to conscript any one, but the actual distance does not matter, inasmuch as it is a foreign land. But the present position is different in some degree from the previous campaign. Hitherto, our opposition was to conscription even for service in Empire territory, with our British brethren who spoke the same language and had the same system of government as ourselves. So long as it was conscription for overseas service, we strongly and consistently, and, in the last resort, successfully opposed it. In this instance, conscription is for service in a foreign country. Most of the argument against conscription, up to the present time at all events, has rested upon opposition to service abroad under any government. It was that which inspired the belief in the Labour party that conscription was an outrage upon the life and liberty of the individual, and upon the fundamental right of a minority at the hands of and for the supposed benefit of a majority. If we apply those simple tests, there will be no difficulty in understanding the reasons which animated opponents of conscription in the last campaign. Nor will it be diflicult to understand why opponents of conscription see no difference between the present case and that against which they previously directed their opposition.",41
125,Unknown,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. Mr BRENNAN"" - It is worth remembering that the point of view that I have been stressing is illuminated, although it is not otherwise affected, by the fact that the persons who are selected or to be selected for deportation are youths who in many cases have not yet been admitted to the franchise. They certainly have not under the general statutory provisions which govern electoral conduct been permitted to vote, or given any part in the making of those laws under which they are required to suffer such tremendous penalties. They are young men potentially at least voted out of life by old men. They are young men on the threshold of life voted upon by men practically on the eve of their dissolution. In that regard one could not have a better example than this very House in which we arc privileged to sit. Most of us, although not all, arc at least bordering upon the sere and yellow leaf. I would say to the young men here: ""Are you proud of the fact that, in the exercise of your responsibility, and in your privileged position, you impose against his will this obligation upon your fellow Australian young man, who is similarly situated to yourself, except that you, and not he, enjoy the privilege of membership in this Parliament? '""' To the older men I would say with great respect: "" Do you feel a sense of satisfaction in the knowledge that you, .having lived your lives, and in the security of Parliament, are voting younger men, against their will, into a clanger zone from which you have exempted yourself in old age?"" I would say to all members, young and old: "" Are you proud of the fruits which you are gathering from the privilege which you enjoy? ""Will you be pleased in after life with the work of this protected industry of law making? "" I would say to all honourable members: ""You have been at great pains to make this a protected industry, with a priority number 1 in your favour. In this category, and in this law factory, you have forged and are forging the clamps upon a selected group of your fellow Australians by a law which falls not equally upon all, but especially upon a few, and from which you, in the exercise of your privilege and power, have most carefully exempted yourselves."" I ask the question: In what way does this present bill differ from that conscription which I heartily opposed as a member of this Parliament but a few short weeks ago, and which in loyalty to my party I was then bound to oppose? Is it that Australia is threatened ? Surely that cannot justify, if the view that I have been putting is correct, a wrong done by one person to another? Is it the fact that you or I are more anxious, or, to put it in another way, more fearful, more frightened than wo were? Surely . that gives us no moral right to interpose the body of a third person, between us and the enemy ? I am not qualified to be, nor do I pretend to be, a moralist. I make no case for other people. Being no strategist, neither am I anything of a dogmatist, but I have, in common with others, I hope, the advantage of the still small voice of conscience, and I have, I hope, in common with others, the faculty of reason. The exercise of these satisfies me that, so far from the question being entirely political, as some people would have us believe, it is almost entirely non-political, personal and ethical. Others may take a different view, and, if they take that view honestly, as I assume that they do, then their case may well be 'different from mine. ' At least in this instance what appears to them to be right may be right, but it certainly cannot be right for me, to whom it appears foul and wrong. I hope, without defiance and without disloyalty-and I have no desire or intention to be defiant and certainly none to be disloyal-that I have made myself sufficiently clear. I have not spoken of this bill as being necessary or unnecessary. Early in my speech I ruled out necessity as an invalid argument. Such matters as the disposition and strength of the forces I leave to the Commander-in-Chief, General Douglas MACArthur, to whose country we owe so much, and who, in most generous and glowing terms of appraisement, has acknowledged without stint the complete co-operation of Australia with America in the dofence of both continents. I leave them to him and to the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde), whose speech of recent date in this House, and whose contributions to the press, have been quoted by unfriendly voices on the other side of the chamber. So far from being unfriendly to the Minister, I think that, when he spoke those words so recently aboutconscription, and in opposition to it, he spoke from his heart, and that he spoke the truth. I cannot imagine that he has so rapidly and at such little notice departed from the view which he then held and expressed. [Extension of time granted.] I rely upon the inherent willingness of the great bulk of Australians to defend from aggression that part of the world which it is their duty to defend, and in whose defence I should be proud and pleased to play my little part. I acknowledge the power but question the right of Parliament to pas's this law.",44
126,Mr HUGHES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"North Sydney-Leade r of the United Australia party) [8.16] This bill imposes conscription in this country for the first time in its history, and it is imposed by a man who all his life has bitterly opposed it and has pledged himself and his party many times to prevent its imposition. The right honourable gentleman has not given us his reasons for his amazing change of front. No one listening to him last night could have imagined for a moment that the purpose of the bill to which he was addressing himself was the imposition of conscription on the Militia forces of this country. He made a general review of the war situation, and gave an exposition of the strategic position in the South-west Pacific. He then proceeded to give an explanation of, and reasons for, the limitation imposed by the provisions of the bill in regard to the forces that will come under its operation. The impression sought to be conveyed by the right honourable gentleman was that he is still the vigilant and faithful watchdog of the people, standing in his appointed place to protect them from those who wished to conscript them. Not by a word did he who, time and again, has posed in this chamber as the champion of its dignities, its rights, and its privileges, explain why he went behind the. back of Parliament to the Labour conference to seek authority to do that which, over and over again, he had pledged himself he would not do. Certainly not a word fell from his lips as to why he who had opposed conscription for 27 years now sought to enforce it. But whilst he gave to the House no reasons for his volte face, the press has told us that he did give reasons to the Labour conference. The Sydney Morning Herald, in its report of the Labour conference on the 19fch November, 1942, saidThe case which it is understood Mr Curtin put before conference was' in brief that the High Command considered the stage had been, reached, in the Pacific War where homogeneity of the Australian Imperial Force and the Militia was essential to the most effective prosecution of the war. This is supported by a further report in the same newspaper on the 20th November, 1942, which statedIt was officially stated in Canberra yesterday that General MACArthur was the inspiration of the move. We may accept that as a statement of the position. In the main, no doubt, it is; for we know very well that the reasons which the right honourable gentleman gave to the conference must have been very weighty; and we know, too, that he has told the House on many occasions that the reason why the Government was unable to accept the proposal of the sition that the limitation imposed upon the Militia forces should be lifted, was that such action was unnecessary unjustified by the military situation. the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Bronnan) has reminded us, that was said alj.o by the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde) on, I think, the 27th October, 1942. The Prime Minister, then, rests his case for the imposition of conscription on the'military situation, which makes that which, until the other day, was unnecessary and unjustifiable, absolutely essential for the safety of the country. This afternoon, the Treasurer (Mr. .Chifley) sought to persuade this House and the country that, despite what been said in the press and by the people, this is not conscription at all. What the honourable gentleman said, in effect, .very much like the plea of the young woman who,, being charged with having infant born out of holy wedlock, pleaded in extenuation, "" It is only a little - l-.would say that it will no doubt These efforts on the part - of the -.Minister and others to persuade the House, aud particularly the rank ami ftle of the Labour party, that this is conscription, is so much camouflage. /Conscription has nothing to do with - number of persons to whom it applies, the duties allotted or the place where these «re to be performed; its basic principle conflicts with and limits individual liberty. As my honourable friend the member for Batman has pointed out eloquently and convincingly, the principle is the thing and not the! degree to which the principle is applied. The issue is clear; the Commonwealth in danger; are the rights of the indiviwas dual to prevail over those of the .munity-shoul d men lie compelled to defend their country? Thai is the tion. As a result of over twelve months occupancy of the treasury bench, the )*norable gentleman has been confronted ;with a situation which ho has been ""peHed at last to realise w:th all plications; and, against his will, - jo'.doubt whatever, he has been comjPoHcd to admit that in everything he pai ^contended in the last 27 years, he has been in the wrong. That, I think, exOppoplains the position. I would not do the right honourable gentleman the wrong to suppose that he has taken this step, which and lie must have known would have farAs reaching consequences, if his conscience had not prompted him to take it. He has reminded us that the operation of this measure i« to be confined to the Southwestern Pacific Zone, because that is a portion of the area over which General MACArthur has control. Are we, then, to suppose that the mere fact that General MACArthur has control of this area is a reason for enforcing a principle which is vicious and infamous ? What the right honourable gentleman 3ays in effect is that that which for 27 years, and up to November hist, was unjustifiable, unneceshad sary and infamous, has now become a patriotic duty which no individual may neglect except at his peril. He says that was the military situation has compelled bim to take this course. Let us for a moment an put on oao side the question of whether or nut it is called conscription. . It is one"", compulsion. The Prime Minister says grow. to a man, ""You shall go there Prime whfn I direct you to do so; it is beyond the confine* of Australia and its territories; you shall fight there"". not If that is not conscription, what is? Distance has nothing at all to do with the the matter. In the last war millions of British soldiers went to France. They were conscripted-in the last two years of the war. They went 20 miles across the channel. Are we to say that they were not conscripted becauso they could get to their homos in a few hours, or a day at most? Many of them were given home leave from time to time and were able to visit their wives and families; because is it nrast be remembered that the fighting in northern France aud they wore eomnever more distant from their homes than i!00 or 400 miles, at most. In this queswar, Britain has sent men to Egypt, thousands of miles away, for the same right reason that they were sent to France, only 20 miles from Euglaiid, in the comlast war. The Militia may be sent its imto New Guinea, Borneo, Java, or I have any place within the wide limits - fixed in this bill. It has to be pointed cut that the bill, promises much and does litfk'. It is intended to remedy a militavv situation which the Prime Minister has said is grave indeed. What can the Militia do? Where can they go that is now beyond their order of leave? They cannot go to the Solomons, where fighting is proceeding/but they can go to southern Borneo, Java, and the Celebes, where there is no fighting. If the right honourable gentleman rests his case, as he does, on the military situation, I submit that he has failed to substantiate it. The honourable member for Batman has brought back vividly to my mind those stirring days of long ago when he and I crossed swords for the first time on this very subject. I remind the Prime Minister that, for the first two years of the last war, the Australian divisions were maintained at full strength by voluntary enlistment. Then we were advised by our military leaders that the flow of recruits by voluntury enlistment was inadequate-and that recourse to conscription was necessary. I point that out because the right honourable gentleman has rested his case on the advice of his military leaders, for it was on similar udvice from the same quarters that I acted. We were confronted at that time with opposition which was not very different from that , with which the right honourable gentleman has to contend today. The opposition of the Labour party to compulsory enlistment for overseas service is' no new thing. Anticonscription was then' as it is now a cardinal point of its policy. So far the policy of the right honourable gentleman today and my policy then followed along the same lines, but here the similarity ended. As Prime Minister, I had stated definitely that conscription would not be imposed on the people without their having been previously consulted. And in due course they were consulted. The referendum of the people on this question was the first occasion on which the people of any country had had an opportunity to say whether they would accept conscription. And from that day to this the people of no other country have been given this opportunity. When the proposal submitted to the' electors was rejected, their decision was accepted by the Government of the day. The honourable member for Batman has made reference Mr Hughes. to what followed. He has said that the party that was responsible for conscription represented a minority, but this statement is misleading. The position of political parties at that time was very different from that which obtains today. When the Government of which I was the head went to the country after the referendum, it was returned with an overwhelming majority, while the Labour party which had opposed conscription was sent into the wilderness, where it remained, save for the brief interlude of the Scullin Government, for a generation or more, until the accession to office-of the present Prime Minister. He has seen the light and has prevented the ship from running on the shoals. He has imposed conscription though he promised the people that conscription would not be introduced until the people had been consulted. He stated in this House that the people had a positive guarantee, and that he was one of the guarantors, that conscription would not be imposed without their being consulted. The Treasurer would have us believe that this measure will adjust itself to the military situation and has not the remotest connection with conscription. He must think members of the Opposition are very foolish, if he imagines that they will accept such u contention. Does he say-that a measure which stopped short of. conscription would have produced such effects as this proposal did upon the conference of the Australian Labour party, upon the Labour executives, and upon the rank and file of Labour throughout the length and breadth of Australia? Why was all this heat and passion aroused? I shall not - recall to the mind of the Prime Minister all that was reported in the press as having been said at the Australian Labour conference in Melbourne, but I remind him that the representatives of two of the greater States of the Commonwealth rejected his proposal. As the Leader of the Opposition (M i . Eaddeii) has pointed out today, but for one man in Tasmania the Government would have been utterly undone. It is absurd at this stage to - say that all this heat and passion was brought about by something which stopped short of conscription - The proposal did not stop short of conscriphe tion, and that is the whole trouble. honourable members opposite are placed a very difficult position. Nobody knows better than I do all that the rules, reguencouraged lations and platform of the Labour party involve. The party has taken the first step along this road, lest a worse thing should befall it. I think that it has But done right, but it has not gone far enough. On examining the speech of the Prime Minister carefully, we note a promise that the measure will be extended meet the needs of the military situation; but at present it does not meet the situation as it exists today. If the were to be regarded only as one designed to meet the present miliwith tary situation it would not deserve enter the support of this Parliament, but something more than that. Lt is belated recognition of the fact that voluntary enlistment, and the division shortly be the law of the land. of the fighting forces of this country two armies, are calculated to invite disaster. The Prime Minister has been reminded by the Leader of the Opposisituation. tion, and by the right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) of what the position is. If conscription were imposed without limitation, Australian soldiers would be able to fight .alongside Russian conscripts, without whose help the Allies would be in a bad way today; they could fight in Libya alongside British conscripts; they could fight with tage. American conscripts in the Solomons, without whose help we should have been utterly undone. The Prime Minister does not deny that, but under this bill our Militia Forces cannot go to any front where fighting is going on. This measure does not in any way determine what is be done with members of the Militia; it merely gives to the Government power to send them where it will attitude within the limits prescribed in the bill. The right honourable member for Koosory yong pointed out that neither the for Australian Imperial Force nor the Militia could move a yard without the order and consent of the Government, so the onus of exercising the power to he given to it is rightfully thrown on the Government. I regret that the Prime Minister has not made it clear, although has implied, that he will lift the Now limitation upon the use of the Militia in as and when circumstances demand. In the face of what has happened we are to believe that the limits upon the use of the Militia in this 'bill will be lifted. 'Strange things have happened in the conscription campaigns in the past. the strangest of all is the right honourable gentleman's change of front on conscription. As one who for 27 years has been exposed to obliquy as the arch-priest of conscription, let me say that I never imposed conscription on the people of to this country, but the present Prime Minister proposes to do so. The right honourable gentleman would have us bebill lieve that he still stands as the angel the flaming sword, and none may his paradise; but his posturing will it is not deceive the people, the gates a are open and although this bill is only a "" little one"", conscription will It is into necessary that the people should understand what conscription moans. I do not seek to take advantage of the present God knows that the dangers threatening Australia are such that all party manoeuvring should be swept aside. We ought to face the position, and endeavour to march forward as one man. I have done all that I was able, as a member of this House, to give the Prime Minister and his party every support. I have taken no mean or petty advanI have given to the Prime Minister and his party all credit as well as all support; but I am not going to stand by and allow the position to be distorted. The fact is that conscription is to be imposed, and by one who but yesterday stood as the man who defended the pass against to conscription. Now the pass is open. This is not the first 'metamorphosis that has taken place in the Prime Minister's since the beginning of the war. In 1939, he was opposed even to compulmilitary training. He saw no need it, and he saw no need to send troops abroad. Where, I ask him, would we be now but for the. experience gained by our troops abroad? Indeed, the right honourable gentleman takes no little credit to himself now for having these fully trained men available for the defence of Australia. They are fully trained, indeed, as they have proved in a manner which no nation can misunderstand, but no thanks are due to him and his party for that. The Prime Minister has always stood as the opponent of industrial conscription, but now we find that both industrial and military conscription have been imposed by the Government of which he is head. Men can be conscripted into the labour forces, and they have no say in the matter. Men can be conscripted into the military forces, and compelled to do, not only their military' duties, but also any other work which they are directed to do. There remains to no man or woman in Australia today any freedom at all. I do. not say that such measures as the Government has taken are not justified; I am merely pointing out how far the Prime Minister has travelled since ihe beginning of the war. In 1939, he was opposed to compulsory training; now he stands as the man who, for the first time in the history of Australia, has duced conscription. I hope that the Prime Minister will understand that the Opposition is sincerely anxious to help him, but he cannot expect us to break out into loud hosannas when this Parliament suffers the cruel humiliation of seeing the Leader of the Government consulting an outside body over which Parliament has no control.",45
127,Mr CONELAN,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Did not the right honourable member himself do the same thing?,49
128,Mr HUGHES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The Prime Minister is reported in the press to have said to the Australian Labour party conference that here was a great difference between what u he intended to do and what I had done.,49
129,Mr CONELAN,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Well , wasn't there?",49
130,Mr HUGHES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Yes , there was. He said that I had defied the Australian Labour party executive, and so had deserved expulsion, while he bad sought its authority for what he proposed to do. After some adventures that authority was granted, and so, apparently, he was deserving of eulogy. I pledged myself to give the people an opportunity to express an opinion on the conscription issue, and I did so. The Prime Minister gave the same pledge, but he has dishonoured it - h e has not given the people an opportunity to express an opinion. These attempts to cloud the issue will not prevail. The fact is, that conscription has been introduced behind the backs of the people. The country expects the Prime Minister to do whatever is demanded by circumstances. This great principle, which divided the country during the last war in a way in which nothing ever has done before or since, is not affected by geographical areas or military commands. We believe in liberty, and liberty comes from the people. It is not something to which we are born; it is the gift of the community. The community is in great peril, and in the face of that peril the rights of the individual must give way to the needs of the community. Because of that, we are content to point out what the position) is, and leave it at that.",49
131,Mr ABBOTT,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"New England) [8.53]. - I never expected to have to speak in this Parliament with such a sense of shame as I do today. I am ashamed that such an un-Australian proposal intro- as that in the bill should be sponsored by an Australian government. When the Japanese made their attack on Pearl Harbour on the morning of the 7th December, 1941, the war, which up till that time had appeared remote to most of the people in Australia, was suddenly brought right on to the doorstep of this continent. As the Japanese consolidated their positions after the first onrush, they moved further south, and the threat to Australia became graver and graver. Prior to that, the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) had made his appeal to the United States of America. I shall deal with certain aspects of that appeal later, but for the moment I wish to refer to one statement ini it which supplies a complete answer to the question so often asked in this House, not only by private members but also by the Prime Minister himself, as to why previous governments had not taken steps to .amend the Defence Act to enable Australian Miilitia troops to - be sent beyond' the prescribed limits. The Prime Minister, in his statement of the 27th December, 1941, saidAustralian internal policy has undergone striking changes in the past few weeks. In the first place the Commonwealth' Government found it exceedingly difficult to bring the Australian people to a realization of what after two years of war our position had become. Even the entry of Japan, bringing a direct threat in our own waters, wa3 met with a subconscious view that the Americans would deal with the short-sighted, underfed, aud fanatical Japanese. They awakened in the somewhat lackadaisical Australian mind the attitude that it was imperative if we were to save ourselves, to enter an all-in effort in the only possible manner. Although Australia was in as deadly peril when France fell as it was on the entry of Japan into the war, the Australian people never realized that fact. When France collapsed had the Prime Minister - of Britain and the British people failed to carry on the fight against Germany, or had Britain succumbed to the German attacks, then Germany would have been the first naval, air and military power in the world. It would have controlled the first, third, fourth and fifth navies, and would have possessed in Great Britain one of the finest workshops in Europe. Britain then stood alone between Hitler and' world domination. Neither the United. States of America nor the Soviets could have withstood his - forces. Our fate in Australia would have been sealed. It is owing to the tenacity and resistance of the British people in 1940 that we are still living in a free Australia; but the conflict was so far distant from our shores that, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, it would have been impossible to make our people realise the perils facing the Commonwealth, and consequently impossible to have got the people to agree to anything in the nature of conscription. Prior to the fall of the Bataan Peninterritories sula, the United States Government sent General MACArthur to Australia at the request of the Commonwealth Government as Commander-in-Chief of the Australian and United States forces in this area. Under the directive issued General MACArthur the Prime Minister statedIn the case of the South-west Pacific whioh includes Australia, the Government, with the concurrence of the Advisory Council, agreed to a set-up under which Ceneral MACArthur is the Supreme Comthan even the motion itself. mander. . . The directive issued to General MACArthur, and agreed to by the Australian Government, specifies the objectives which operations will be designed to accomplish. In fulfilment of the commitments accepted under this directive, the Australian assigned to the command of General MACArthur the combat forces of the Australian Navy, Army, and Air Force. That statement of the Prime Minister is plain and clear. The combat forces of this the Australian Navy, Army, and Air Force include the Militia. A3 stated by the Prime Minister, the directive was issued early in April, 1942, but it was not until the 17th November that the Prime Minister took steps to honour the commitments which he had undertaken. Eight months elapsed before this Government decided even to take steps to honour its obligations. Then what took place? One would have thought that the Prime Minister would have brought the matter before his Cabinet, before the Advisory War Council, and finally to Parliament as the one sovereign body which could amend the Defence Act to enable the undertakings of the Commonwealth Government to the United States Government to be carried out. But the Prime Minister did nothing of the sort. As a delegate, not as Prime Minister, he submitted his proposals to the federal executive of the Australian Labour party, so that those proposals would become the policy of the Labour party, and so that he, as Prime Minister, could reply to critics that he was only carrying out the policy of the party. What a tortuous course for a man, who is the leader of a nation in arms, to follow! At the conference the Prime Minister, as a delegate from Western Australia, is reported - to have movedThat having regard to the paramount necessity of Australia's defence, the Government be authorized to add to the definition of the to which the Defence Act extends had the following words:And such other territories in the South-west Pacific Area as the Governor General proclaims as being territories associated with the defence of Australia. to At that conference the Prime Minister does not seem to have been frank enough to have told his supporters that the Area, Government was already committed to the Government of the United States War under the directive in wider terms The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell), who was present at the conferhis ence, has stated that the Prime Minister said, ""Gentlemen, there is no arguGovernment ment against one army "". In his statement to Parliament on the .10th December last the Prime Minister saidWhen the Australian Government agreed to unique set-up, under which it surrendered a part of its sovereignty and placed its defence forces under the control of a commander of ii.ii allied nation, it did so, of course, on the clear understanding that its action would facilitate the achievement of two results. First, there would be unified direction of the operations in the South-west Pacific Area under an American commander and, secondly, the Australian Government, having placed it? military resources under this commander, would have made the maximum contribution of which it was capable towards the achievement of the objectives laid down in the directive for the South-west Pacific Area. Having done so, it would have every right to expect that any additional strength required would be furnished from other sources. According to the right honourable gentleman, there is no limitation on Genera! Douglas MACArthur as to where he shall use his naval and air forces, for he draws special attention in his statement to the co-operation given in the South Pacific Area by Australian aircraft and by the presence of HMAS. Canberra when that vessel was sunk in the vicinity of the Solomon Islands. Until this sitting of the Parliament the South-west Pacific Area had not been disclosed to members of the Opposition. Last week a map was shown to honourable members with that area and other command areas in the Pacific and Indian Oceans delineated on i l . Although honourable members were a.ikpd to treat that information as a matter of secrecy, the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) has pointed out that the eastern boundary of the South-west Pacific Area and the extensions to the north were published in the Christian Science Monitor last year, whilst the full area has been published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph and the Century this year. However, what the people of Australia should know is that the extent of the South-west Pacific Area is far larger than the area envisaged in flic Government's present proposals under this bill. I invite any Australian citizen to look at the map in the Christian Science Monitor and the area covered by these proposals and judge for himself. The proposals in the bill are embodied in clause 3 and are as follows:Tu this Act the South-western Pacific Zone menus the area bounded on the west by the 110th meridian of east longitude, on the north by the Equator and on the east by the 150th meridian of oast longitude. There is a vast difference between these proposals and the original ones. The Mr Abboti. first set, though long delayed, were in some measure a carrying out of Australia's commitments to the United States of America, but these 'proposals are a definite repudiation of the undertaking given. 1 a3k the Prime Minister if he regards solemn undertakings between sovereign states as scraps of paper to be torn up at the will of one of the high contracting parties, or as obligations to be f a it h full y carried out by both parties.. A fte r the Prime Minister had submitted his proposals to the Australian Labour party executive in Melbourne, they were referred back to the State bodies. Later, after much delay, the proposals were considered by the State executives, and it was announced by the press that a majority of the State executives supported the Prime Minister's proposals and that they would be approved at the resumed meeting of the federal conference on the 4tb January. Later it was stated in the press that the Prime Minister's proposals had been agreed to. However, on the 8 th January the Lang newspaper, the Century, published an article entitled, "" Ourtin's Secret Commitments on Conscription-""What Happened Behind tha Scenes"". In that article it was stated that - certain undertakings were given by the Prime Minister. Among them were the following:1. There will be no merger of the Australian Imperial Force and Militia. 2. Rigid restrictions to be applied to the definition in the amendment requiring the Militia to serve "" in such other areas in the South-west Pacific as the Governor General proclaims as being territories associated with the defence of Australia."". . Such areas not to extend north of the Equator. That excluded the Philippines, notwithstanding Curtin's previous speeches on the subject. The article said, "" The restrictions are such as to almost n u l l if y the amendments as a practical military consideration"". Although that statement was published in the Century on the Sth January, Parliament was not called together until the 27th January, over three weeks after the alleged secret undertakings were given, whilst the amendments to itlie Defence Act were not presented to Parliament until 49 days after they were submitted to the Labour executive in Melbourne, notwithstanding that P a r l i amerit is the only body which can implement them. I put it to the House and to the people of Australia that the Prime Minister has failed his country, for, despite the fact that at a press conference on the 20th November last, he said, "" that one army, under one command, was now a military necessity because of the bitter handicap imposed by factors hindering military mobility "", he has now agreed that there shall be no merger. All of her considerations have been set aside in the interests of political expediency. Moreover, under the bill the Prime Minister has completely fallen in with certain elements of Labour as stated in the Century; he has broken faith with the United States of America and has whittled away almost to a negligible area the portion of the South-west Pacific in which the Militia may serve. I agree with the honourable member for Batman that this proposal within the area designated is ""conscription, stark and unashamed "". But the danger to Australia is so great and the need of assistance from the United States of America so paramount that we must have conscription in order to save our country and obtain the necessary aid from the United States of America under our agreement with that fonntry. The Prime Minister has wilted under pressure as he never wilted before. In essence, these proposals mean, first, - hat. our Militia cannot be sent to New Zealand,- New Caledonia, New Hebrides, Guadalcanal, the Philippines or the Netherlands East Indies in their entirety and, secondly, it can be sent to only portions of Java, Borneo, the Celebes and Dutch New Guinea. The Prime Minister has let down not only his own c-ormtry bnt also our allies. How must the Dutch people feel when they know that our military resources will only be fully used to enable them to get back <! part of their territory? How cheered the New Zealanders must be to know that whilst we are willing to accept all aid from thorn in the South Pacific Area - and we arc as vitally interested there as in the South-west Pacific Area-w e will permit only certain parts of our Army to go to their assistance! ""Why has the Prime Minister done this thing? Is it for fear that the political party of which he is head may be split in twain? Has he considered that his actions may imperil Australia's very existence ? From this bill and from some speeches delivered in this House, one would imagine that Australia could be saved from destruction by means of forces fighting in some of the islands adjacent to the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister himself seems to hold this view because at the press conference on the 20th November last, he said, ""Australia was now being defended on an outer screen running through New Guinea, the southern Solomons, the New Hebrides, New Caledonia and F i j i "" . Even if this were true, which it is not, the Prime Minister does not propose to defend large parts of that area with the Militia. The only defence of Australia lies in the destruction of the Japanese navy and army. General von Clausewitz, who is regarded as one of the most famous writers on military matters, saidWar is an act of violence and its object is to compel our opponent to comply with our will. Of all errors in war those which proceed from a feeling of benevolence are the worse, for they prolong the state of war. It stands to reason, therefore, that, other things being equal, he who uses force unsparingly must gain his objective. The next axiom is the necessity for crushing your enemy, for until he is crushed he liuiy 'always turn the table on you. That is where the ultimate defence of Australia lies, but the present proposals of the Government will only tend to prolong the struggle. They will prolong also the Corn in on weal th's agony. In the first place, they break many of the principles of war. The late. Marshal Foch, in his book on war, saidThere is then, such a thing as a theory of war. That theory starts from a number of principles, the principle of economy of forces, the principle or freedom of action, the principle of free disposal of forces. I say deliberately that the Government's proposals break every one of those principles of war. There is no economy of forces if only part of the supreme commander's forces can operate over the whole combat area. There is no freedom of action for the Commanderin-Chief in the use of his forces, for it means that if General Douglas MACArthur had to reinforce troops in the South Pacific Area, unless he had Australian Imperial Force men available, the troops in that area would perish because we have limited the freedom of action of the supreme commander over the troops under his command. There is no free disposal of forces for the Commander-inChief either within the area of his own command, or as I have shown, to go to the assistance of other commanders. Napoleon saidThe art of war consists in always having more forces than the adversary, even with an army weaker than his own on the point where one is attacking or being attacked. How can Australia be defended when our troops are hindered by the fetters placed on them by this Government? The mistake-a n awful one perhaps for the Commonwealth-that the Prime M in ister and the Government make when they place such reservations on the use of our troops, is that they are regarding the defence of this country in the terms of the ancient exploded formula that territorial gains mean victory and not that the only defence is the destruction of the enemy. They turn to the war of manoeuvre and not the war of destruction. That was the policy which crushed France in this war, and, if it be allowed to continue, will ruin Australia, placed as it is behind a barrier of islands. 1 should like to say something now about the effect that the Government's proposals will .have on the prospect of this country receiving aid from overseas. In his book, My Struggle, Hitler wrote of the British nation as follows:Thus, the British nation will continue to he considered as the most valuable ally in the world, as long as the world looks to the leadership and spirit of its people for the ruthlessness and tenacity which is determined to fight out a struggle, once begun, by every means and without regard for time and sacrifice right on to the victorious end. In effect, what he says is that it has always been a tradition of the British people that once they have entered upon a struggle, they will fight to a finish with all the resources within their power. T recall that in 1914 Mr. Churchill, as he was then, said that it was an act of Providence the snout of the British bulldog was sloped backwards so that once he got a grip on a person he would hold on and never let go. That has been the tradition of our race from its beginning. ilr. Abbott. that is not the attitude of this Government. Despite all the Prime Minister's assertions about a 100 per cent, war effort, global warfare, and other things, the Government, by refusing to permit dome of Australia's soldiers to be used without restrictions in the Pacific basin as are the soldiers of the United States, New Zealand, and the Netherlands East Indies, imperils the existence of this nation. The Chicago Tribune is reported in today's press to have said in a leading article: "" What Australians can say, Americans certainly are privileged to say. We reiterate that, when America sent great numbers of drafted sons to protect Australia from invasion, Australia was surely obligated to do as much for the Empire."" That is an example of what the United States is thinking today; but suppose that the United States were to argue that the key to the defence of the Americas lay in the control of a series of islands in the Pacific, and that behind that ring of islands the continental areas were inviolate fro m attack, so that there was no valid reason for shedding the blood of American soldiers in defence of a continent which although held by an enemy, did not imperil the defence of the United States. Suppose also that the people of the United States asked themselves this question, "" Why should we assist people who will not assist themselves even to the extent that they ask us to assist them; a people with a Prime Minister and Government who ask us to send our conscript youths to their aid over as many thousands of miles as they refuse to send their conscript youths hundreds of miles to our assistance?"" The Prime Minister put this to the United States as plainly as possible in his New Year message of December, 1941. He said: "" We know, too, that Australia can go and B r it a in can still hold on."" That is equally true of the United States. Probably neither the United States nor Great B r it a in Winston would allow this to happen, but if a choice had to be made by the United that States between a people who were willin g to make a full effort and another people who refused to do so, it is quite clear where the assistance would go. If that were to occur, God help Australia, for But we would soon see scenes in our cities like the rape of Nanking. The reason why aid was forthcoming for the people of Greece when their country was invaded is quite plain. It was obvious that Greece could not be held, but in view the valorous stand that the people of that country made, no one who admired courage could have refused to send every possible assistance. If we put up the .»ome courageous fight we too will receive assistance. No doubt many honourable members have received letters from mothers opposof ing the introduction of conscription. Naturally, they hate the thought of their sons being sent outside Australia to for their country; but consider how much the mothers of conscripted American must detest the thought that they are being sent thousands of miles to fight a people who will not send their contralian scripted youth to help those American sons when they are in peril in areas adjacent to Australia, other than terriof tories included in the microscopic zone defined in the bill. The Government is playing with fire. Isolationism is dead in the United States, and if isolathe tionism, reinforced by the support of the mothers of the United States demands that American soldiers be withdrawn from the South-west Pacific Area, such a. demand might be hard to resist. there be no mistake about that. These matters are discussed even among AmeriForce, can troops here. At a meeting of the Federal Executive of the Australian Labour party the Prime Minister stated: "" Gentlemen, there is no argument against one army."" That is quite true; there is no argument against it, and every argument for it, but at the first breath of the wind resistance to his proposals the Prime Minister surrendered. Jomini said: "" War is a dreadful and impassioned drama."" That is true, and in the wars of today the dreadfulness of the combat raises the passions of the soldiers. Under the strain of what they suffer they beAustralian come highly strung. There is a passionMilitia ate explosiveness created in them which may break out at any moment. Clausewitz says, with reference to friction: ""As long as we have no personal knowledge of war we cannot conceive where these difficulties lie."" Members of the War Cabinet come within that category, so that it is impossible for them to realise the devil's brew that is fermenting in parts of the Australian of Army and which may play havoc with the troops. It is useless for the Government to attempt to withhold this state of affairs from the knowledge of the people. Let the Government discuss it with the men of the Australian Imperial Force; let it study what has been happening in Brisbane; let it talk to the soldiers the Australian Imperial Force returning from the New Guinea area-no t only high officers who may say only what they think the Government wants to be said. fight Senator Sampson has drawn attention pointedly to this matter in the Senate. sons He has quoted letters from returned Australian Imperial Force men. Fricfor tion exists because the men of the AusImperial Force who have fought in the Middle East are now being asked to carry the greater part of the burden the fighting in Papua and New Guinea, because they can be sent anywhere whilst there is a strict limitation on the sernot vices of the Militia, In his speech Prime Minister stated that when the time came for the United Nations' armies to advance in the South-west Pacific Area, there would be a lot of garrison and occupation duty to be done. PreLet sumably, this would be done by the Militia, while the Australian Imperial which has already borne more than its share of the war, would be sent, forward into the combat areas to engage in the final conquest of Japan. If this does not encourage friction amongst the troops, nothing will. There is also dissatisfaction in the of Australian Imperial Force with regard to promotions. Men who have fought are being retarded in their promotions by the men who stayed at home and gained advancement, not on the field of Mars. Now,- at the eleventh hour, they arc permitted to transfer into the Imperial Force carrying their rank over the men who have been fighting. Von der Goltz said: ""Whatever is done within an army must always aim at increasing and strengthening its moral force."" What is being done in our two armies must inevitably ruin their moral force. I conclude by saying that it is the bounden duty of the Prime Minister and of the Government to do what they set out to do in December last, namely, to fulfil the undertakings given to the Government of the United States of America, to make the combat forces of the Australian Navy, Army, and Air Force available to General MACArthur. The Prime Minister has wilted under - pressure. He has surrendered to a section of his party, as he fears that Labour may become disunited. To prevent that, he is ready to risk the fate of this country; he is willing to jeopardize our chances of aid to this theatre, as the people of the United States of America may consider us to be a people unworthy of assistance. Yet he has filled the ether with his wails for help. Compare his attitude with that of another Prime Minister. In 1940, in Britain's blackest hour, Mr Churchill determined to carry on the fight; he planned the Mediterranean campaign. The British forces in the whole of the Middle East at that time totalled 90,000, whilst the Axis had 560,000. The Royal Air Force had 168 machines in Egypt and 4 at Malta. On the Sudan frontier, there were 100,000 Italians, whereas our total force, including the Sudan Defence Force and native levies, was 7,000 men. ""Was there any ""squealing"" for help? No, the British attacked the Italians, and bluffed them into thinking that far greater forces were operating against them. The Prime Minister's "" moaning "" over the air to the United - States and his failure to implement the binding contracts made with the Government of the United are acting against the diversion of assistance to this theatre of war. Despite all its faults, and heaven knows they are many, I shall vote for this bill, because, though it is tragically disappointing, it does establish the principle that the Militia Forces may be sent outside the Commonwealth and the territories under its control. The introduction of this measure represents a conversion of members of the Labour party from their former beliefs. It establishes the principle that Australian youths may be conscripted for service overseas, and in doing so it gives to Australia an opportunity to do far more towards the war effort of the Mr Abbott. United Nations than it has been doing. I am reminded of the old fable of the fisherman and the little fish. The little fish, which had been caught by the fisherman, said to him: "" I am only a small fish. Why don't you return me to the sea? I will then grow into a big fish so that when you catch me again you will have a much better fish than you have now!"" This bill is only a little fish, but if it is rejected by this House, we may never see it again. If it be held up it will only cause delay in the limited extension of territory in which the Militia may be used. Also, as the Prime Minister has wilted so far on his initial proposal to carry out the arrangements with the Government of the. United States, if there be delay in giving effect to this measure he may somersault completely and abandon the principle to which I have referred. To avoid this I intend to vote for the bill.",49
132,Mr ANTHONY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,".Richmond) [9.29] There have been many famous retreats in history. There was the famous retreat of Napoleon's forces from Moscow, the retreat from Mons in the war of 1914-18; and the recent retreat of Field-Marshal Rommel's forces 1,300 rmiles across the Libyan. Desert. But when the political history of this period is written, there will be no retreat comparable with that of the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) from what he declared he would do in November last and the proposals in this measure. In November last the nation was keyed up by the announcements in the press that the Prime Minister had determined to assert States himself as the real leader of the governing authority in this country, and would do the things which he considered should be done in the light of the knowledge that he possessed after his consultations with our military leaders. On the 27th November the Prime Minister announced to the people his intention to amalgamate the Australian Imperial Force and the Militia. This afternoon the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) stated that the Prime Minister was misrepresented by the press, and that radio commentators did not correctly interpret what he had said. Nevertheless, intelligent people who can read a newspaper and understand commentaries over the air believed that it was then the Prime Minister's intention to amalgamate those forces, and to use the consolidated force in the South-west Pacific Area in accordance with the advice of our military leaders. For that reason the people acclaimed him. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Hughes) in a press statement at the time paid great homage to the Prime Minister. He declared that it was a triumph for democracy that the Prime Minister was able to do what he proposed. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden) also paid him generous tribute for what he, and all of us, believed that he intended to do. However, a few days later, after the press as a whole had acclaimed the Prime Minister, he heard wee, small voices from the trades and labour councils and unions, and other organizations upon which the Labour party depends for its existence. Those small, but potent, voices said something different. They said to'the Prime Minister, ""What you have said is political heresy so far as Labour is concerned.  you were going to amalgamate the Militia and the Australian Imperial Force ?"". The Prime Minister then came forward with his next statement, to the Australian Labour party in Sydney. It was his first retreat-hi s retreat from El Alamein. He then said, "" No. I never intended that the Australian Imperial Force and the Militia should be merged. That was quite foreign to my mind. I only meant that the area of service of the Militia should be extended to embrace the South-west Pacific Area "". Unfortunately, this measure will not rectify the Government's failure to unite the Australian Imperial Force and the Militia. That proposal has been thrown overboard. However, the measure submitted represents an advance in this matter on the part of the Labour party, because it provides for the use of the Militia Forces beyond Australia. New Guinea and Papua are comparatively small territories. The bill proposes that our Militia may be used by General MACArthur in additional portions of the area under his command. That at least represents an advance. The Prime Minister met the Labour conference again on the 4th January, and later, on the 26th January, he met the Labour caucus in Canberra. We now find that the area in which the Militia is to be allowed to serve has been whittled down to a much smaller area than that under General MACArthur's control. Few political retreats in history are comparable with that made by the Prime Minister in connection with these proposals between November and last night when he moved the second reading of this measure. However, we shall be well advised to take the little that is offered, because I believe that the Prime Minister, if given the opportunity, would retreat still farther. I am confident that even now the Prime Minister would withdraw the bill if he were given an opportunity to do so, with the result that the conditions governing service by the Militia would remain as they are today. I do not propose to give to the Government any such opportunity to escape, and I intend to stand right up to this measure. Regardless of any amendment that may be moved, I shall not be deterred in my resolve to compel the Government to go on with, the bill. Although the measure is something of which we cannot feel very proud, nevertheless it establishes an important principle. It breaks the 27-year-old tradition of the Labour party of opposition to conscription for service overseas. Consequently, for future governments, whether they be Labour or anti-Labour, the question as to how far the Militia can be used will be only a matter of degree. The principle of overseas service will be established; therefore, I shall do all in my power to ensure the passage of this measure in order to prevent that principle from being scrapped. I believe that many honourable members opposite would like to see it scrapped. Several important considerations are involved in the measure. First, there is the security of Australia. How can we best defend this country? We have been told by Ministers whom one would deem to be responsible by virtue of their office rather than by their utterances that had it not - been for the Labour party's tenure of office during the last fifteen months, this country would have been forced to surrender to the enemy. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) has proclaimed that when the present Government assumed office it found in existence a plan which contemplated the surrender of the northern part of Australia in the event of our being attacked. The Minister for Munitions (Mr Makin) has smugly stated in this chamber that but for the fact that Labour has been in office for the last fifteen months we should have found ourselves in a serious position had Japan attacked us. Labour has been in office for only fifteen months. Yet these Ministers have the audacity to claim that in that period the Government has so organized the production of munitions, the Navy, the Australian Imperial Force, and the Air Force that it has transformed our position from one of dire peril to one of comparative security.",55
133,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Is that not true?,57
134,Mr ANTHONY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"No . Let us examine the Government's record in order to see in what plight this country would have found itself had Labour's policy been given effect to, and had Labour been in office when the war broke out. At the outbreak of war, - the very first action of the party of which I was a member was to raise an expeditionary force for service overseas. We believed that we had a common obligation to a common cause, and that our troops ought to serve wherever the fight was raging instead of waiting until the fight was brought to us. We believed that we should strike the enemy wherever we found him. Consequently, we raised an expeditionary force of several divisions. Did we receive support from honourable members opposite when they were in Opposition in raising that force, or in sending it abroad to gain experience ? It gained us prestige, and a great name overseas. It won for us the right to demand from our Allies, when we ourselves were in danger, that they come to our assistance; but this is what the Prime Minister said in this House when he was Leader of the Opposition on the 10th November, 1939, two months after the outbreak of the warI am opposed to an expeditionary leaving this Commonwealth for overseas. And contrast his recent statements about the meritorious services of the Royal Australian Air Force with the following statement which he made on the same occasionMore .particularly do I object to the sending overseas of men who are trained or who are to be trained for the Air Force. On the same occasion, when the party to which I belong believed that in the interests of our security we should have every man of military age and physique trained to bear amis in the defence of this country, what did the present Prime Minister have to say? He saidWith regard to compulsory training I say that we are against it. I see no justification for it. After the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) interjected, "" Yet the honourable gentleman just said we need our full man-power "", the Prime Minister reiteratedI say there is no justification for compulsory training. I see no necessity for it. The Prime Minister spoke at that time for honourable members opposite who, today, are telling the world that during the last fifteen months-hardl y sufficient time in which to organize a circus-this Government has transformed Australia's defence position from one of insecurity to one of comparative security. What has been the harvest from the policy of the previous 'Government? The Prime Minister, who opposed the despatch of an expeditionary force and the introduction of compulsory training in 1939, recently broadcast an appeal for assistance to the people of the United States of America. He said Australia has been a constant contributor to the very maximum of its resources to the cause of liberty in the far-flung fighting fronts of the world. I remind the House that in 1939 the right honourable gentleman objected strongly to the despatch overseas of any Australian soldiers. He proceeded to describe to the world with justifiable pride, though his Government would not have been able to make the claim if the policy of the Labour party had been given effect three years ago, the heroic deeds of the Ausforce tralian Imperial Force. He saidAustralian soldiers have fought in Europe and Africa. Their's was the bitter retreat from Greece and Crete. Their's was the glory of Tobruk. Their's was the spearhead of General Montgomery's drive against Rommel. Every word of that statement is true, but not one word could have been said if the policy of the Labour party had been adopted at the outbreak of the war. If Australia looks to the United States of America, in particular, for assistance, the Commonwealth Government must demonstrate that this country is "" pulling its weight"" in the struggle. The great tragedy of this debate is that misunderstanding will be created in the United States of America.",57
135,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The honourable member Lopes that misunderstanding will be created in that country.,58
136,Mr ANTHONY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"That is untrue. Until the Japanese launched their treacherous attack against Pearl Harbour, there was a strong isolationist Hoc in the United States of America, and its influence has not been entirely dissipated. The bombing of Pearl Harbour destroyed the compla,cency of the isolationists, and caused them to support President lioosevelt because perforce they had no option. I direct attention to an article reprinted from the Chicago Tribune, the arch isolationist journal, which informed the American public that Australia was not doing its fair share, because of its reluctance to introduce all-out conscription. The article added that if Australia expects to receive American aid, this country must play a bigger part in the prosecution of the war. The Australian Imperial Force and the Citizen Military Forces at present are doing everything within physical limits to play their part. Our soldiers in Papua and New Guinea, both Australian Imperial Force and Citizen Military Forces, have done everything that could be expected of them. They could not have done more, even if this Parliament had passed a measure providing for conscription for service overseas. Such legislation would not have placed another soldier in the field. Even if the Parliament were to accept the principle of general conscription and agree that Australian troops should serve in Java, China, or any other part of the world, it would at present be physically impossible for us to despatch them to those theatres of war, because of the resistance of the enemy. Consequently, the sphere of operations as outlined in the bill is probably the limit within [12] which Australian soldiers can be sent at the moment, and no debate or recriminations in this chamber as to whether they should or should not be sent to Malaya, or to the whole or a part of Java, will alter the position. Therefore, no valuable purpose will be served by debating whether our troops should operate on the Chinese or Malayan coast. The ultimate strategy of the war will determine that matter. But the great damage which is being done to the reputation of tihe country as the result of the action of the Government may be reflected in an unwillingness on the part of our allies to assist us when we make appeals for help. We are not yet out of the wood. Strong enemy foi-ces still oppose us. If the allied naval forces suffer some set-back, which can easily occur, Australia will face the invader. The spectre of invasion always confronts us.",58
137,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The honourable member seems to consider that Australia is capable of combatting Japan without 9.ssistfin.cc,58
138,Mr ANTHONY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) seeks to put into my mouth words which I. did not use. The Minister for Labour and National Service, the Minister for Munitions and others declared recently that had the Labour party not been in office when Japan entered the war, Australia would probably have been invaded.",58
139,Mr WARD,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,That is so.,58
140,Mr ANTHONY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"That interjection shows that the Minister has no sense of responsibility. We have a population of 7,000,000 people, our continent covers 3,000,000 square miles and our coastline is 12,000 miles long. To defend this land, we have practically no navy and a small air force. Our safety and security depended not upon whether a Labour, United Australia party or National Government was in office, but upon the protection afforded to us by the United Kingdom and the United States of America. That fact should be borne in mind by Ministers before they make foolish statements. But the Minister for Labour and National Service is unrepentant, as his interjection a moment ago revealed. This bill is only one step along a long highway. It violates a great Labour principle. One has only to look at the glum and gloomy faces of some honourable members opposite to realise how this legislation has shaken them. I sympathize with the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) and the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear), who will be compelled to support the bill because they have been coerced into doing so. The Minister for Labour and National Service will be crucified. The only thing which prevents him from resigning from the Ministry and opposing conscription at every stage is the fact that his action would cost him £2,000 a year by the loss of his ministerial allowance. The bill, inadequate as it is, has broken an iron-clad tradition of 27 years of Labour anticonscription policy, and the Opposition would be foolish indeed to give to the Prime Minister any excuse for withdrawing it. I am convinced that if the right honourable gentleman were offered any means of escape, he would again retreat. In those circumstances, the Leader of the Opposition has been very wise in announcing that he did not propose to move an amendment to the bill. I shall support the measure.",58
141,Mr FROST,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"The honourable member is "" squaring off "" now.",59
142,Mr ANTHONY,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I shall do my utmost to see that the bill is passed and shall get considerable .education from watching the Minister for Labour and National Service vote for it. I have said enough-mor e than enough for some honourable members opposite-bu t I shall conclude by uttering a warning to members on the Government side of the House. The time will come when they will be compelled to swallow everything that they have said in the past in opposition to merging the Australian Imperial Eorce and the Citizen Military Forces. There will be no escape for them if Australia is to play its expected part in the war. They will have to swallow every word which they said in opposition to the proposals to permit Australian conscript troops to the sent to Java, Malaya, the Philippines or elsewhere. It is indeed most illogical to expect conscripts from the United States of America to defend New Guinea and Australia when we refuse to send our conscript soldiers to assist in the recapture of the United States territory in the Philippines. Under the bill before the House, the Philippines are excluded from the regions in which our militia forces may fight. The Government will be fooling itself if it believes that the people of the United States of America will accept that policy indefinitely. It will also be underestimating the common sense of its President and his military advisers. I repeat that the time is not distant when honourable members opposite will have to swallow every word which they have said against conscription for overseas service, and my advice to them is not to say too much at present, but to maintain the policy of silence, which they have so effectively adopted this evening.",59
143,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Melbourne) [10.0] This House has listened to more bathos and bunkum from the Opposition benches in this debate than is usually the case when a measure comes before it. We have heard the putty Caesars, the secondrate Napoleons, and all the other military geniuses, the kerbstone field marshals, and the arm-chair vice-admirals telling us just what this country ought to do at this particular moment. We have the spectacle of honourable members opposite, who solemnly pledged their word to the electors that in no circumstances what I soever would they dare to flout the traditional policy not only of the Labour party but also of the country if they were successful in the general elections in 1940, rising in their places in the last few hours to protest that they have been conscriptionists all along, that what the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) proposes to do should have been done months and even years ago, and that now that the bill has been brought down it cannot be passed through this Parliament too quickly. There is a ring of insincerity about it all. They said in 1940 that they were anti-conscriptionists because they felt that the people of Australia would have dealt severely with them at the general elections if they had dared to say otherwise. For political expediency they respected the opinions of the people.",59
144,Mr MARWICK,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The electors of Swan sent me here on that policy.,59
145,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"The honourable member is a sort of election afterthought. He came here only because the Labour candidate who opposed him at the Swan by-election was not the right one. He might not have been here if we had had a little more sense, and had made a better choice. However, we take him, as a man takes his wife in marriage, for better or for worse, and we will keep him until this Parliament has run its course.",60
146,Mr MARWICK,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I have never had to switch on my principles yet. M,r. CALWELL - The honourable member has told us that he came here as a conscriptionist. That is the first time. I have heard that conscription was an issue at the Swan by-election. I thought that everything else under the sun was an issue there, but not conscription.",60
147,Mr MARWICK,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The honourable member was not there.,60
148,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Wo . It was lucky for him that I did not go to the Swan electorate, because had I gone West he would have ""gone west"" also but in another sense. I suggest that the bill is not needed for military reasons at all. This country cannot take the offensive for many months to come. The Prime Minister has told us that we have to fight a holding battle for the next six months and that the volume of assistance that we are getting from Britain and America is only a trickle. In those circumstances how can this country wage an offensive war? How can we retake Borneo, Amboina, Celebes, Timor, Java and Sumatra ? How can we go to northern New Guinea ? The leaders of our forces would undoubtedly like to retake all those territories, but how can 7,000,000 people defeat a nation with a population of 80,000,000 people? That is what the whole position boils down to. All that we can do, as the Prime Minister has suggested, is to hold this country until further aid can come to us. The right honourable gentleman has protested that we must not be left here as a nation of caretakers, and that something is due to us as well as something being due from us to our Allies. Honourable members opposite have talked about our obligations to our Allies in this conflict, but there are obligations which our Allies owe to us for the fight which Australia has waged ever since the war started. Australia did not start to Sght only when Japan came into the war. Australian troops have served on at least fifteen fronts since the war started. If honourable members opposite had had their way, some of the Australian divisions abroad would not have been brought back to this country when this Government brought them back. If the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), in particular, had had his way ten divisions would have been sent out of this country at the beginning of the war. If ten divisions had been sent away from Australia, more Australians would have been killed, wounded or lost in Greece, Crete and Singapore through the lack of air support. We should have had a far bigger casualty list and the task of the Japanese in successfully invading this country would have been made much easier.",60
149,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,There would have been no Rommel in North Africa if I had had my way.,60
150,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I am sorry that General Douglas MACArthur has not so far discovered those great qualities which the honourable member, with his customary modesty, so proudly proclaims himself to possess. I believe that even if the honourable member for Barker had been abroad with ten divisions of Australian troops there still would have been a Rommel in North ""Africa. All I am sorry for is that we have had such losses abroad, and that the serious defeat at Singapore occurred. However, when this Government wanted to bring back men from abroad in order to defend Australia from invasion, honourable members opposite, particularly those on the Advisory War Council, were not so solicitous about the defence of Australia as they have proclaimed themselves to be to-night.",60
151,Mr MCDONALD,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Honourable members on this side were never consulted.,60
152,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"In that respect the honourable member is in much the same position as myself, because I am rarely consulted by the Government about anything. The introduction of this bill has been^dictated by political reasons. The insensate clamour which certain honourable members opposite have set up over the past twelve months, and the support that has been given to them by the Murdoch press in particular, have helped to create that atmosphere which unfortunately compelled the Prime Minister to change his point of view. The arguments that we have heard quoted, and have read in the press, after being cabled back to us from America, have appeared first in the Australian press and have been deliberately sent to America by certain people in this country of fifth columnist mentality who are eager to embarrass the Commonwealth Government. They are particularly anxious to use the echoes from America to intimidate the Government into a course of action upon which it previously refused to embark. I hope that even at this late stage the Government will drop the bill. There is, as I have pointed out, no military necessity for it. The powers that are proposed to be given cannot be used for, at least, another twelve months. Mir. RYAN - What about the moral necessity?",60
153,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"If I want to seek moral or ethical reasons for a course of political action, I shall not look to the Opposition benches for them. There is no moral obligation upon Australia to conscript its manhood at this particular time to send it elsewhere. The duty of the Commonwealth Government is to use the Australian Army to defend Australia. Is not that what the British Government does with the British Army in carrying out its responsibility to Great Britain? The great bulk of the British Army is still in Britain. We read about the First Army in North Africa, the Eighth Army in Libya, and the Ninth Army in Syria, but we never hear anything about the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Armies. I presume that they are in Britain, and that the British High Command considers that that is the proper place to keep them. I do not quarrel with its decision in that regard. If , however, honourable members opposite had their way, ten of our Australian divisions would be fighting not under General MACArthur's command, but under General Wavell, thousands of miles away from these shores, and the defence of Australia would be left to old men, women and children. The right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies), who engaged in a lot of mental gymnastics and prided himself upon having made a telling speech, was one of those who, in 1940, pledged himself against the introduction of conscription. He then lead the army of the United Australia party; he led the Government. The Australian people were asked to "" trust the man who gets things done "". I could show honourable members full-page advertisements in the daily press in which that slogan appeared. He was an anticonscriptionist then. He was an anticonscriptionist when France fell, when Russia was still neutral so far as we were concerned, when America had not entered the war, and when the battle for Britain was being fought so gallantly by the small Royal Air Force, and the whole of the odds were against us. Now, when America is on our side, when Britain has had a chance to re-arm and re-establish itself, when Russia is in the second year of the struggle, and when Japan is pressing at our very gates he says: "" I abandon the cause of anticonscription; I have become conscriptionist. Scatter the Army to the four winds of heaven."" Does he consider that that sort of argument appeals to the Australian people? If honourable members opposite want an election, let them challenge the Government on this issue, and we shall see whether the Australian people are as silly and purblind as they believe them to be. I am confident that if the Australian people were given an opportunity to decide as between three propositions-anti-conscription , in which I always have believed, and always will, believe; the qualified form of conscription which the Prime Minister supports; and the full-blooded conscription which honourable members opposite want-the great majority of them would vote for anti-conscription. The right honourable member for Kooyong did not say that the people should be consulted upon this matter, by way of either an election or a referendum, despite the fact that he came into this Parliament as a pledged anti-conscriptionist. What right has any member of the Parliament to disregard the pledge that he gave to the electors, without consulting them? Is that democratic?",61
154,Mr MCDONALD,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,What right had Japan to attack Australia?,61
155,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"That fact does not give to any member of the Commonwealth Parliament the right to change his view upon any matter, without consulting the people. We knew in 1940 that Japan would attack Australia. Was there any member of this Parliament who did not know it? As soon as this war broke out, we knew that ultimately we would be fighting Japan. We knew that there was a military alliance between the Axis Powers which was binding on every member; that after Germany attacked Poland it was only a matter of time when Italy would come into the war; and when it did, that it was only a matter of time when Japan would become a belligerent. The Japanese attack was only a surprise because of the manner in which Pearl Harbour was bombed. Its inevitability was recognized. Before the actual attack upon Pearl Harbour, every body in Australia realized, from the time when Japan's special envoy set foot in America, that a conflict was approaching. Therefore, the protestations of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCDonald) and his fellow members do not read with such sincerity as they would wish. It is said that America is sending conscripts to our shores. We have to face that issue. The fact is that the American Government is doing with its troops what the American people allow it to do. The manner in which America disposes of its forces is its own business. I remind honourable members opposite that when America does as much as Australia in the way of mobilizing its forces for war and raises an army equivalent proportionately to that of Australia, it will have approximately 1'2,000,000 men under arms. To date, it ihas 1,000,000 men outside its shores; 800,000 are in North Africa and Europe, where probably they are not wanted so much, and 200,000 are in the South-west Pacific Area. Therefore, the comparison which honourable members make is faulty.  honourable member should use the figures he has given?",62
156,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"They have already appeared in the nress of the world and in the American press in particular. They have been republished in the press of this country. The Prime Minister has stated, and his remarks have been published in the press of this country, that America's contribution on Australia's shores is as one to five compared with Australia's own contribution. All those honourable members opposite who make comparisons between American and Australian conscripts are fomenting the discord between this country and America that they pretend to deplore. America has done a magnificent job for Australia, and nobody in this Parliament should offer any criticism that may help the so-called isolationist cause. In any event, if there is an isolationist cause in America, who created it? Was it not those who in this country and in Britain squealed about the war debts after the last war, until they made numbers of Americans say, "" If that is the way in which they are going to reward us for the services we have rendered, we shall keep out of European struggles forever."" It was only the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour that brought America into the war. But for that attack, the chances are that America would not now be in the war. It was those people who, after receiving American aid in the last war, became critical of America, who helped to create the isolationist bodies. The isolationists are not, as honourable members opposite suggest, anxious to withdraw American troops from Australian soil. All Americans are anxious, as are all Australians, that Japan shall be defeated.",62
157,Mr COLES,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,We were getting lendlease goods from America before Pearl Harbour was attacked.,62
158,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"We certainly were. President Boosevelt had a very difficult task in securing the passage of legislation through the American Congress empowering the giving of aid to Great Britain, ourselves and other allied nations before America had formally entered the war. We are certainly grateful for the assistance we have received. I could, had I the time, deal with the arguments presented by the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott), whose immaculate presence has disappeared from the chamber. He brought General von Clauswitz up to date, misquoted Napoleon's military maxims, and finished an historical review with quotations from Hitler and Winston Churchill. What he had to say had already been said by lots of other honourable members. He uttered a lot of truisms, but they were insipid. He has now finally won for himself the reputation of being the greatest platitudinarian in the Parliament. One could not quarrel with lots of the things that he said; but he distorted them, in order to give them a conscriptionist twist. I now turn to the subject of food production in Australia. If honourable members opposite had their way, and all members of our defence forces were sent abroad, who would produce the food required in Australia? Some men must serve in the Army, some in the munitions factories and some on the farms. An article published in the Melbourne Herald of the 3rd December last, and despatched from Canberra, had the following headlines, ""Allies may help solve labour problem on food"". In the course of the article it was stated that even coloured labour might be imported for food production. It was the duty of the Government to repudiate that statement if it. were untrue, or to explain it if it were true. One of Sir Keith Murdoch's myrmidons in Canberra may have been merely flying a kite, but the article suggested that the importation of coloured labour would be a natural corollary to conscription for overseas service. I mention the possible importation of coloured labour as an additional reason why this House should not pass a conscription bill. We are told that the battle for the Solomons has reached a critical stage. Yet honourable members opposite think that this is the right time to denude Australia of its manhood, and, strangely enough, they believe that the people of Australia will agree with them. I do not consider that in our hour of greatest danger the people desire the Parliament to authorize the despatch of our small and insufficient army to any part of the world that may be decided on. Mr Calwell. The Opposition parties asked the people of Australia to vote for conscription on two occasions-in 1916 and in 1917.",62
159,Mr BLACKBURN,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Thos e parties have their revenge now.,63
160,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"They certainly have, but that is not the fault of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn), myself and certain other honourable members. I believe that ultimately the Labour party will become anticonscriptionist again. I am hopeful that, even if this bill be passed, the Government will not put it into operation. I trust that if it reaches the statute-book it will become a dead letter.",63
161,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,Will the honourable member vote for it?,63
162,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"^I shall not vote for the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), nor for the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Coles). I am, as I always have been, an anti-conscriptionist.",63
163,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,But the honourable member will vote for the bill.,63
164,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I adopt an Asquithian attitude and say to the honourable gentleman, "" Wait and see"".",63
165,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,The honourable member will be a member of the House of Lords if he keeps on giving replies like that.,63
166,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"I have such a sublime faith in the munificence of Providence, and in the sturdy common sense of at least 51 per cent, of the electors of Melbourne to think that I shall remain a member of this Parliament as long as did my illustrious predecessor.  ber does give some credit to Providence.",63
167,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Unlik e the honourable member, I give all credit at all times to Providence. In the last war the right honourable member for North Sydney was compelled, against his own wishes, to take a referendum on the subject of conscription. He said that he consulted the people, but he was conscripted into consulting them. The Labour caucus would not accept his proposal, and the referendum was the plan devised to satisfy the majority of the members of the caucus. ""When the right honourable gentleman was defeated on the first conscription bill he did not wish to go to the electors in May, 1917, but he tried to pilot a bill through the Parliament which would have enabled him to petition the British Parliament to prolong the life of Parliament to the end of the war. He needed one additional vote in order to have the bill passed through the Senate, and the late Senator David Watson, of New South Wales, alleged that the right honourable gentleman, who was then the right honourable member for West Sydney, tried to bribe him to secure the passage of the bill. The late senator refused to break his pledges, and after that we had the mysterious disappearance from the Senate of Senator Ready. He was a Labour senator from Tasmania, and he disappeared at 6 o'clock one evening, after tendering his resignation to the then President of the Senate. The latter sent the resignation to the then Prime Minister, who in turn forwarded it to the Governor General. Then the Governor General sent the resignation to the Governor of Tasmania, who referred it to the Premier of Tasmania. The last mentioned called a meeting of his Cabinet, which allegedly deliberated on the choice of a successor to Senator Ready. The Cabinet decided to appoint Mr John Earle in place of Senator Ready, and the decision was conveyed by the Premier of Tasmania to the Governor of that iState, and through him to the Governor General. The Governor General forwarded the decision, to the Prime Minister, who sent to the President of the Senate. At 9 o'clock on the morning after Senator Ready's disappearance, Mr Earle was waiting on the doorstep of the Senate to be sworn in as a senator for Tasmania. That was the method employed by the right honourable member for North Sydney to try to avoid an election in 1917. But the late Senators Keating and Bakhap, two other Tasmanian senators who were Nationalists, would have nothing to do with the filthy and immoral business. They told the then Prime Minister that they would not vote for his bill. In that way the right honourable gentleman was compelled to go to the electors in 1917. ""Unfortunately for Australia the anti-conscriptionist vote of 1916 was not an a-nti-nationalist party vote. Many people voted against conscription in 1916 in order to save their hides, but when the 1917 elections took place they voted with the party representing vested interests, in order to protect their economic interests. That is the portion of the story of the 1916 consrription campaign and the 1917 election campaign which the right honourable gentleman did not tell us to-night. I hope that this bill will be defeated, and as I have already said, if it does become law I hope it will be a dead letter. If it does not become a dead letter, I hope that in a few months the Labour party of Australia, in conference assembled, will revert to the attitude which it formerly adopted in regard to conscription. When that occurs I believe that honourable members of the Labour party in this Parliament will do their utmost to maintain the traditional policy of the party, which is not only a good policy for Labour, but also the only safe and sane policy for the Australian people, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves in the world today.",63
168,Mr SPOONER,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"Robertson) [10.30] I was able to hear only the conclusion of the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), but I am glad that I heard so .much, because I heard him say that he hoped the bill would be defeated. I propose to inform the House why I intend to support the bill; I feel that there is a keen it desire among certain honourable members of the other side that the bill should be defeated, or at any rate sidetracked by the passing of an amendment. I support this measure, first because it establishes the principle that the Citizen Military Forces may, if necessary, be sent into areas beyond the shores of this continent in order to defend Australia. I also support the bill because it is a foundation upon which a better structure may be erected, thus enabling the Australian Militia to be sent anywhere, during the course of this war, for the protection of Australia. I do not propose to support the bill because of any intrinsic value. As a matter of fact, it possesses, very little merit, apart from the fact that it does go some way along the road which we would like to see the Government follow. Poor as it is, however, I cannot assume the responsibility either of voting against it or voting for an amendment to it. I believe that the Government, harassed by its own supporters, and worried by the trade unions, already regrets that it ever introduced the measure, and I believe that, at the first opportunity, the Government would drop it, and then blame the Opposition for having compelled it to do so. If the bill does not pass, Australia will be so much the poorer, just as it would be so much the richer if it were a better bill. However, the Opposition has no control over the nature of the measures submitted to the House. It must take the bill as it finds it, or accept the risk of moving amendments that might result in the loss of the measure altogether. My attitude is that I cannot take the risk that several opponents of the bill on the other side of the House might cross the chamber and vote with the Opposition to defeat the measure. I do not think that they would, because they are well disciplined to thinking in one way and voting in another. Still, there is a risk, and I do not propose to take it merely because the bill does not go as far as the Opposition and the country generally would like. Neither can the Opposition support the amendments because the measure would then become unpalatable to the Government, and would be dropped. The Opposition must support the bill in the hope that, from a poor beginning, it will grow into something better as time passes. It is better to get this measure, imperfect as it is, than to lose everything, as might well happen unless the House agrees to it in the form submitted by the Government. The honourable member for Henty (Mr. Coles) has stated that, in the committee stage, he proposes to move an amendment that will have the effect of altering the whole character of the bill, but what has the Opposition to take any notice of the honourable member for Henty? does the Opposition know that the amendment has not .been drawn up in collaboraadjourned. Mr Spooner. tion with the Government in the hope that the Opposition might support it, thus giving the Government an opportunity to drop the bill ? The honourable member for Henty had an opportunity on the 2nd May last to vote for an amendment emanating from this side of the House which contained provisions very similar to those of the amendment which he has foreshadowed. The honourable member says that he did not vote for that amendment because he did not think that the Opposition was sincere. Mr .COLES - When the Opposition pulls Mr Speaker out of the chair to vote in a division I shall believe that it is sincere.",64
169,Mr SPOONER,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"What justification have we for assuming that the honourable member for Henty is himself sincere? When he had the opportunity to vote in support of the principles which he now enunciates he declined to do so, but voted with the Government against the amendment. Now he says that he doubts our sincerity. Does he pretend to be the only sincere man in the House? I am not prepared to accord him his self-appointed position of sole patriot in the Parliament. I am just as patriotic as he is, and just as anxious that Australia's fighting forces should be used in the proper way, and in the proper places. I am prepared to support at the proper time any proposal for extending the area in which our forces may be required to serve, but for the time being I am going to support what is practicable. If the Opposition were to support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Henty, I am convinced that within a day or two the bill would be dropped. Therefore, I shall not have anything to do with the foreshadowed amendment, any more than I shall have anything to do with the amendment of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) unless it can be shown that, by supporting one of those amendments, we would really be able to achieve our purpose. My purpose in speaking now is to right define my position. I intend for the reasons I have stated to support the bill How and to oppose the amendments.

172,Mr CALWELL,SPARE PARTS FOR MOTOR,"the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior, upon notice What action does the Grovemmeirt propose to take to secure the position of the irrigation settlement in the Murray Valley by adding an additional 750,000 acre feet to the catchment area of the Hume Reservoir, thus completing the original .scheme of 2;000,000 acre feet as the size of &he dam? MT - LAZZARIKI - The Minister f o Interior has supplied the following answer:The original design of the Hume Dam vided for a reservoir of 1,100,000 acre capacity. This was increased during construction to 1,250,000 acre feet, which was referred to. considered on the data then available as the economic limit of the capacity of the catchment area, but the foundations were conwill structed to provide for a further increase 2,000,000 acre feet if such action were found to be justified in the future. The 1934 amendment of the River Murray Agreement provided that Jfew South Wales, Victoria and South Australia may at any time extend the construction of the storage to a capacity of not more than approximately 2,000,000 acre feet of w-ater, and in that event the 'Cost of such extension and the maintenance of such extension when completed shall be borne by the said States or any one or more of them in such shares or wholly by any one State as may be mutually agreed upon. I am advised that prior to the outbreak of war the River Murray Commission had undertaken a comprehensive hydrographic and economic investigation in regard to the question ot the enlargement of the storage. The investigation is well advanced, but, owing to the absence of so many engineers with the fighting forces, it has not yet been completed. TAXATION INQUIKIES . Mr Chifley. - On the 28th January, 1943, the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) asked to what extent the Taxation Department, Victoria, utilized the services of the Police. Department for taxation inquiry work. The Commissioner of Taxation advises me that it has been the custom from the inception of Staite income tax in Victoria for the State police to co-operate with the Taxation Department in making any inquiries necessitated where the department finds difficulty in obtaining the information from - the taxpayer direct. There has never been any serious complaint against this practice. Obviously it is an economy, especially in country districts and in certain suburban areas, for elementary inquiries relating to taxpayer's place of residence, the nature of his employment and .his employer's address, hi3 present circumstances, and his reasons for ignoring departmental communications, to be made by these officers. The need to use State officials in inquiries of this nature is accentuated at present. Commonwealth peace officers as well as State police officers are utilized in conr the nexion with this class of inquiry work. Police officers should be as capable as taxation officers ®f - exercising every proproper discretion and sympathetic considerafeet tion in making inquiries of the nature If the honourable member for Fawkner give me the name and address of the to taxpayer on whose behalf he claims that improper inquiries were made of the taxpayer's wife, I shall ask the commissioner to obtain a special report on the case.

Except in the tropics, where shorts are provided, there 13 no issue of summer dress for the Volunteer Defence Corps. 2. Even if the issue of summer dress were authorized to the Volunteer Defence Corps, because of the shortage of materials through import difficulties, their requirements would be subordinated to those of personnel serving on full-time duty. 3.
