"" Mr CROUCH - The following paragraph appeared in last Friday's Melbourne HeraldLast summer the sites for the new searchlight stations at Queenscliff and Point Nepean were decided upon, and the exact positions were surveyed and pegged out. It was anticipated at the time that the work of constructing the engine rooms and emplacements would be pro* ceeded with almost immediately. It now transpires, however, that through some extraordinary oversight the ordering of the machinery was entirely overlooked, each of the officers concerned being apparently under the impression that this formality had already been complied with. It is now anticipated that it wili be full y two years before the work is completed and the new searchlights are in action. Can the Minister of Defence inform the House who is responsible for this alleged extraordinary blunder, or will he take steps to see that some one is made responsible for it?",11

2,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister if the Government concurs in this doctrine, laid down in the Admiralty despatchof the 10th February, transmitted by Lord Elgin on the 14th February lastI n time of war . as under internationallaw there is only one executive authority in the British Empire capable of being recognised by foreign States, Colonial ships of war cannot operate independently, of the Koyal Navy except to the limited extent referred to above. The Executive power of the Crown, as the central authority of the British Empire, must be applied as regards foreigners in the same manner and under the same conditions wherever a military or naval force is in existence, and the same responsibility for any action taken by Colonial or Home ships of war will rest upon this central authority. It is essential, - therefore, that officers commissioned by His Majesty should have full power and responsibility in accordance with their rank, wherever they may happen to be serving. Accordingly, it follows that not only must the local force when associated with the Royal Navy recognise orders given by the Admiralty or Naval Commander in Chief, but also that their officers must submit to the command of any senior naval officer during the time they are in company with him.",11
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is a statement of the general Admiralty doctrine made at the date named, which, in its application to the future Australian flotilla, must be supplemented by the further statements on the same points set out in the last despatch received this month.",12
4,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Seeing .that the Prime Minister invited the Admiralty to send' a pricis of the despatch from which the honourable member for Coolgardie has quoted, so that its contents might be made known to the House, which was to meet in March, why did he suppress that despatch when at the beginning of March it arrived in extenso, instead of letting Parliament know its contents ?",12
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Such , a question ought not to be asked without notice, but, speaking from memory, I can say at once that the honourable member's suggestion is incorrect. I informed the House that I had received the despatch, but that it was not sufficiently complete to enable us to deal with our proposals, and tjherefore would be kept back until complete.",12

Has he any fresh information which he can. give to the House as to the reasons why Western, Australia is not worthy of as much consideration at the present time, on account of her remoteness and isolation from the rest of the Commonwealth, as was willingly conceded to her last year by the insertion of the clauses now deleted from the present Bill? 4Will he again give {he matter consideration with a view of reinstating the clauses referred to?",12

DEFENCE BILL. Bill presented by Mr EWING and a first time.",14
21,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Richmond) [3-15]-move by leaveThat this Bill be now read a second time. .Honourable members, if they will allow their minds to revert to a period a few short years ago, will remember that, when the question of Federation was before the people of the Australian Colonies, there was never a doubt as to where the responsibility for the defence of Australia should rest-that it could not remain with the States, but must be intrusted to the Federal Parliament. Since that time there have been many discussions with regard to the sovereign rights of the States, and the joint and several responsibilities of the States and the Commonwealth; but no individual, and no State, has at any time hazarded the opinion that the protection of any part of Australia was a State right. Defence is the responsibility of the Parliament of Australia, and the Government today asks Parliament to deal with it in a reasonable and proper manner. This responsibility is not a small one for any Parliament to undertake. It is not a simple 33 2 11 1 month. matter to protect any country; ancl the protection of any vast, half-developed JJ territory, sparsely populated and enorin proportion to the now population is indeed dimcult. It is more to a difficult here, beset as the Commonwealth is with greater dangers and difficulties in by temregard to the future life and preservaalready tion of white occupation, than exist the British Domimen nions. But Parliament has accepted the by responsibilitv, and we have to face the proThe Government do not undertake this work in any lighthearted way. It would be very much easier for any Ministry not to raise these problems, nor to ask Parliaperment to debate these questions, but to proceed comfortably, telling the country that everything is right and satisfactory. Would I were able to tell honourable memthat today; but we feel there is a responsibility cast on any Government or man the in office not toehold office for the sake of all power and place, but to do what they think and is right: and therefore we accept the great years responsibility of dealing with this question. In moving the second reading of this Bill, it is not necessary to go categorically through all the! clauses which are placed definitely therein, read and I do not propose to enumerate them. There is one salient point-on e important SECOND READING. question - to be decided, and that is the responsibility of every growt ing youth in Australia to prepare for the proper defence of his country. Those who believe that that is not necessary-thos e who contend that the prebent system is satisfactory-will against the second reading; .hose who believe that the present system is not satisfactory, and that it is part of the responsibility of every growing youth to undertake this duty of defence, will vote for the motion. Although the various clauses are plainly stated, I shall, in the course of the remarks I propose to make, deal with what might be called the minor principles which are the justification for those clauses. The Government have thought out the matter so seriously, that there is very little justification for suggesting even minor alterations in the scheme outlined in the able and eloquent speech of the Prime Minister at the close of last year. The main principle remains the same, and almost every detail remains the same. Any difference the Government may have made is so small as to be hardly worth consideration. and there is practically no difference between the proposals then and now. That should make it clear to the House how completely the Government had considered the question before moving in the matter; and that it is only a sense of duty and responsibility that impels Ministers to proceed. I shall, first of all, endeavour to make clear to the House that the present system is unsatisfactory, and to then show that the proposals offered by the Government are the only alternative. In order to shorten my remarks as much as possible, I shall hand to Hansard any returns, statements, estimates of cost, or matters that can properly be tabulated, and not ask honourable members to weary themselves in following details which they will apprehend more readily and understand more thoroughly when they have them before them in print. The main principle underlying the Government proposals is to be found in the question: Is it the duty of every growing youth in Australia to prepare for the defence of the country ? Before dealing with that question, however, I wish to turn aside for a moment or two to clear the ground by referring to one or two special considerations, and thus practically dismiss them. We have heard already that this is a Conscription Bill. I take it for granted that in dealing with an improtant measure of this kind every honourable member will forget that he has any responsibility of party ; that we shall all endeavour to rid ourselves of any personal antagonism or party responsibility, and approach the question from a Mr Ewing. vote national stand-point, with the determination while to arrive jointly at the best possible conclusions. This is a matter not only for the Government, but for the whole House.",15
22,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,And for the most fearless criticism.,16
23,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Unquestionably ; we do not object to criticism. Criticism is valuable as long as it is honest. But let us take the position in regard to conscription. No man who fairly approaches the consideration of this Bill will say that it provides for conscription in the European sense of the word. The Government proposal is that for a few weeks in each year every growing lad shall, under camp conditions, engage in open-air work that should be pleasant to himself, as it will be satisfactory to the country. How is it possible for any man desirous of approaching the Bill fairly to confound that proposal with the European idea of conscription, which takes a man for a considerable period away from his social responsibilities, and his vocation, and, placing him under military discipline drills him into what might be called a fighting machine?",16
24,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It is only a matter of degree.,16
25,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Everythin g is a matter of degree or of comparison. I shall not devote to this aspect of the case the time that might pardonably be allotted to it, since this is the first occasion that is has been presented in an English-speaking community, but will allow the question of conscription to be dealt with by others, knowing that there are many prepared and ready to deal with it if it should arise. The next point to 'be considered before we approach the main principle of the Bill itself is that in any civilized country the Government accept certain responsibilities with regard to the people. When any procedure becomes a national duty, it must be legislated upon, and we have to ask ourselves in this connection whether the defence of the country is a national duty. Speaking the other night, the Prime Minister-and I have seen it elsewhere referred to-pointe d to one salient case, namely, education. The State says that no man can fittingly discharge his duty as a citizen without being educated, and it therefore insists that every man shall be educated. It says further that since every man by reason of his manhood is entitled to voteand participates to that extent in the government of the country-it is necessary that he shall be in a position to cast his vote intelligently, and that he cannot do so less he be educated. We ask still further that every man shall obey the laws of his counbut try ; but no uneducated man can have that appreciation of law and responsibility enables him to know what his duties On that ground, again, the Government insists that every man shall be educated. am giving only the most obvious examplesmarw might be quoted-of Government interference, in a civilized country, with those who wait. the lives of the people and the obligatruisms tions that are laid upon the people,. where a national responsibility is involved. House. Therefore, to reiterate the point, if defence of a country is a national responmade, sibility, it is the duty of every man cept his portion of that responsibility, .it is the duty of the Government to insist that he shall do so.",16
26,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable member has merely to show the necessity for proposal. ',17
27,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I shall later on. dismiss the question of conscription with the remark that if honourable members choose so to describe it, we already have principle in existence in Australia. I to be found in the present Defence which was introduced by the right honourable member for Swan. The right honourable member very properly, and with the f u approval of Parliament, provided in that brains and training. Act for conscription.

Thus it will be seen that the system of conscription is already in existence. If the Government in time of emergency, that every man sha;ll aid in the defence of his country, follows as a corollary that the Governguns; ment shall see that every manis fitted discharge that duty.

One of the greatest mistakes and made frequently by enthusiastb actic and patriotic people, is that war can and be successfully carried on by a man with a musket.

I can understand what a difficult problem honourable memunder bers who oppose this Bill are faced with. - It is incumbent upon those who value the British Navy because of the training and competence of the men who compose it to show that an army fit to do its work can possibly be obtained in Australia without preliminary training. Those honourable members sav first that no training is required, and then assert that more is requisite. We can take it either way.",17
32,Mr RETD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Does any man seriously say that our Military Forces should have no training? Is it not very unfair to make such a. statement?,18

SPEAKER - I think honourable members will recognise that the Minister of Defence is performing an important task in moving the second reading of this Bil l and that he should be perfectly free to make his speech in his own way. I hope the}' will remember that the proper time to answer any statements which the Minister may make is when he has. sat down, and not in such a way as to interrupt his speech. I ask honourable members in pursuance of that spirit of fair play which always actuates them, to refrain from'inter- jecting to such an extent as to interfere with the Minister's speech.",18
36,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I shall endeavour as far as T can to avoid making any statement that would Bring anything approaching acrimony into this debate.,18
37,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Then be fair.,18
38,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I shall endeavour to be fair, but of course no one in politics is ever regarded by opponents as fair. There is always a party bias in existence. The essence-the salient point-of the argument is this- "" Has the voluntary system succeeded, or can it succeed, in Australia"" ? The difference between the Government view in making defence a national responsibility, and the view of those who say that such a step is not necessary, simply resolves itself into the question-""Will the voluntary system succeed?"" I presume that every honourable member will grant that that is a fair statement of the case.",18
39,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,That is 'a perfectly-' fair way of putting it.,18
40,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I accept with gratitude the remark of the leader of the Opposition. There are two ways of testing that question-firs t by numbers, and secondly by results. Our whole system in Australia today may be regarded as practically a voluntary system. There are in the Commonwealth at a conservative' estimate 8co,ooo men capable of bearing arms. The whole of our effective forces undergoing training at present in preparation for the defence of the country amount in numbers to much under 20,000. If , then, there are in Australia 800,000 men capable of bearing arms and liable in the last country, is it a successful system which, leaves one man in every forty to do the work ?",18
41,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"What are the ages of interject- those 800,000 men ?",18
42,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am taking those of the fighting ages. If the honourable member desires a verification of the estimate, the population of Switzerland is about 3,500,000, ,and it is estimated that of those there are 800,000 men capable of bearing arms. Consequently, as the populations of the two countries approximate, I thought, after reviewing the Statist's figures, and when searching for a justification for the statement, that that analogy would be satisfactory to honourable members. If there are 800,000 men upon whom rests the defence of Australia, , and at a liberal estimate only 20.000 men are being drilled and trained, it will readily be granted that that is not a fair condition of things. That, therefore, disposes of the question of numbers, with, however, this proviso",18
43,Mr HUGHES,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"And how have those 20,000 been doing the work? Only a percentage of them have been doing it properly.",18
44,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I will deal later on with' the question of results. The test of numbers is being taken first. I wish t j be perfectly fair, and therefore point out that it is true that the numbers might be increased in some branches of the forces under the present militia system. There have been several requests to increase the number of the light horse. But a light horseman costs about £ 1 7 a year, without making any estimate for administrative work and so on in connection with him. That branch is consequently one of the most expensive of the forces, and to increase it to any great extent would mean a considerable financial problem. Even if the Government accepted all the men offering at present the comparison between the 20,000 and the 800,000 would not be materially altered. I should like honourable members to listen attentively while I deal with the - question of results. It is no pleasure to me to say a number of the things that it is my duty to tell the representatives of the people today as to the results of the present system.",18
45,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Do not make it worse than it is.,19
46,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It is absolutely necessary to know the truth. It is no part my or the Government's business to say that everything is satisfactory until the last dreadful day comes,19
47,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The member need not exaggerate on the other side.,19
48,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,There will be no exaggeration. I shall give figures for every statement that I make.,19
49,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It should have been done years ago.,19
50,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Probably it should, but, if it had been, the honourable member would not have had the honour of helping us. We have in Australia 5,000 volunteers. The idea of an ordinary citizen who do;s not possess special knowledge of the subject is that our volunteers are a band of men who are gradually trained year after year until they approach in efficiency a regular force.",19
51,Colonel FOXTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Is the Minister speaking only of volunteers, or does he include the militia?",19
52,Mr EWTNG,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I am speaking of the volunteers. I shall also deal with the militia specially. If we possessed a force of 5,000 men, who were being drilled year after year, and who were gradually approaching perfection from the stand-point of a knowledge of warfare, they would form a very important and valuable body of troops. But of these 5,000 volunteers 2,500 are virtually recruits-me n with less than one year's service. Let me deal with another aspect of the case. Whatever may be urged against our annual encampments, it must be admitted that they are the only places where our Defence Forces receive any training in keeping with the duties which they would be called upon to discharge in time of war - an",19
53,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Hal f of our volunteers do not attend the encampments.,19
54,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Notwithstanding all the defects that attach to these camps, I repeat that they are the only places where a practical training in the evolutions of war can be imparted. The number of days set apart for that training varies in the different States. In New South Wales, the term prescribed is eight days, whilst in Victoria it is limited to four days. It will be conceded that four days a. year is an altogether inadequate period to set apart for the military training of our troops. At the last Victorian encampment an effort was made to extend that period, but failed. I desire honourable of members to test the value of our Volunteer Forces from the stand-point of the service which they render at our annual encampments. Of the volunteers in Australia honourable only one out of every two or three enter these camps at all.",19
55,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,They do not receive - very much encouragement to do so.,19
56,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I will deal later on with that aspect of the question. Under these circumstances; do honourable members wonder that every Commandant in the different States has reported that the volunteer movement is absolutely hopeless, and that there are in the Defence Department statements from volunteer officers to the effect that the system .has collapsed ancl cannot continue? Yet, despite these facts, we are continually being told that the volunteer system of defence is adequate to all our requirements. Every Commandant, I repeat, has reported that that system is a failure, and the volunteer officers themselves declare that it cannot continue. One of every two, or., in some cases, one out of three volunteers in our Defence Forces enters the annual camps. It is true that amongst our volunteers there are a large number of indefatigable, earnest, and able officers, ancl good men, but the fact remains that the position is utterly hopeless. These officers, when they reproach the small number of men under their command for shortcomings, know that the balance of our male adult population is doing absolutely nothing to equip itself in the matter of defending our shores. How is it possible to secure discipline in a force when only one out of every two or three of its members take the trouble to attend camp at all? When officers feel called upon to chide them for their failings, when they desire to be serious, .and definite, and harsh d harshness is sometimes requiredhow can they possibly take up the attitude that they ought? Similarly must not the Minister recognise that these men are a? least endeavouring to do something for the defence of the country, whereas the vast majority of our people are doing nothing beyond idly looking on ? Let me put a concrete case. Let us imagine the case of an officer who is dejected by reason of the small attendance. How can he effectively urge his men to attend more regularly when those men know perfectly well that only a week or two ago more of their fellow citizens assembled in Sydney to witness a prize fight-for which privilege they paid prices ranging from £ 5 to ios. each - tha n are comprised in the whole of the efficients in the Forces of the Commonwealth ? Let me put another example. Whilst an officer is endeavouring to induce his men to "" brighten up "" and prepare themselves for the serious work that may eventually f all to them, his voice is perhaps drowned by a roar from 50,000 throats consequent upon the Pet of St. Kilda or the Pride of Footscray winning a "" g o a l . "" Only on Saturday last 50,000 men, or more than three times as many "" effectives"" as there are undergoing training in the Defence Force of Australia, assembled to witness a football match. The Government's view is that sport, in its place, is a good thing, and that no nation which cannot play some sport well can do anything else well. An individual who has not been prominent in some form of athletics in his boyhood rarely grows up to do anything worthy of note. In any nation sport should be taken up with avidity. But any honourable member who thinks that a football match should attract three or four times as many adult males as are comprised in rhe whole of the efficients in the Defence Force of this island continent, must have lost his sense of proportion.",19
57,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Does the Minister include the-members of rifle clubs in comparison ?,20
58,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No . I am dealing only other capital - the ranks again with the training of our militia and up. volunteers. The members of the latter force each cost the State £ 7 per that annum for their maintenance exclusive of administrative expenses, &c. One of the reasons emphasized to me why the volunteer system does not succeed is that the militia men are paid, whereas our volunteers are not.",20
59,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The two forces cannot work together satisfactorily. MT . EWING - A defence system under which some men are paid whilst others are not must certainly create dissatisfaction. The maintenance of each member of themilitia amounts to between £ 1 3 or £ 1 4 a. year, not including administrative and other costs, the difference between, their cost and that of volunteer unitsbeing made up' by 16 days' ""pay at 8s. per day, or £ 6 8s. a year.. Honourable members doubtless imagine that the militia are a band of men who are continually perfecting themselves in a knowledge of warfare, one year's training being;, added to another until they eventually beDefence come an effective force. I wish that such were the case. But nearly 5,000 of our militia, or about one-third, are virtuallv recruits. It would be more pleasing: to me if I could tell the House that the position from a defence stand-point wnssatisfactory - But I conceive it to be my duty to put the facts of the case before honourable members. Included inour militia force are many splendid men. The service which a large number of officersand men have rendered to the Commonwealth is worthy of the thanks of everybody who believes in the progress of the country. We owe them much. But it is necessary to explain to honourable membersexactly how the militia system works. We have about, it is said, 15,000 men included in that force. So we have upon paper. Let us assume that 8o r 90, or even 100 per cent, of that force attended the annual encampment. We should tliink that result was a: splendid one. It looks so upon paper. But, as a matter of fact, after the encampment is over, the number of those enlisted gradually diminishes. In August of last year they had decreased . to such an extent that the militia force was short by 260 officers and 2,000 men. As we approach Christmas and the camp again draws near-the camp, of course, meanshis certain payment to the men and a freetrip to Sydney or Melbourne, or some fill Perhaps more effort to secure the enlistment of men is made at period. Last year 2,600 new recruits went into camp. Thus we have the spectacle of a paper force of presumably, efficient men- a number which in part is made up of"" thousands of recruits. It is not the cohesive fighting force that we desire. I repeat that it is beyond our power to adequately thank officers and men for the work which they have done. But we have not enough of them. We have men who year after year work under very trying and difficult circumstances, but I regret to say that one-third of those enrolled are continuously drifting in and out of the ranks.",20
60,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Will the whether he includes members of rifle clubs amongst volunteers?,21
61,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No . The members of .rifle clubs do not undergo any training. I am dealing with those who undergo training. The members of rifle clubs .and the cadets are not 'military forces undergoing training in the military sense. The rifle clubs have practice in shooting, but my remarks are confined to those who undergo some militarv training.",21
62,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Might whether we have not as many men undergoing training as we provide for on the Estimates?,21
63,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Yes .,21
64,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If we have not money to pay for more, how can we expect to have more?",21
65,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If the right honourable member, will refer to the portion of mv speech when numbers were under consideration, he will find that point has been - dealt with. I propose now to test the present system from another stand-point-the stand-point of efficiency. I need not read to honourable members a statement of what is required .to enable a member of the militia to become ""efficient,"" but will place it upon the table of the House. It is - as followsAn equivalent of twelve days made up as tinder :(a) Continuous training and exercise for not less than four or more than eight days in camp or bivouac, at such time and place as may be ordered. (i) Whole-day, half-day, and night parades, as ordered, to make up twelve days, but not more than sixteen night parades to be allowed to count. District Commandants will determine the allotment of parades under this subsection. (c) Prescribed Course of Gunnery or Musketry. (d) Annual Inspection by Commandant, or his representative, which will be carried out at any parades mentioned in (a) or (*). ' \d) Eight out of twelve or more half-day parades ordered for . training, exercise and instruction, at such times and places in any part of the district to which the corps or regiment belongs. (6) Ten out of sixteen or more night parades ordered as in (a). [c) Prescribed annual course of Musketry. (d) Attendances up to and not exceeding six at musketry may be counted as half-. day parades.. Minister say It will be seen that to become "" efficient "" in the case of the militia does not involve any very heavy task, while to become "" e f f i c i e n t "" in the volunteer force - is easier still. One would imagine that the task might be very easily performed, but the last record I have shows that we have in the force 3,424 "" non-efficients."" I have spoken so fax in order to make it clear to honourable members that the present system is not succeeding. If the statements I have placed I ask before the House are accurate, and I vouch for every statement. I have made, any honourable member who believes that satisfactory work is being done to prepare for the defence of this continent must be very the easily pleased.",21

67,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is always the member of Parliament who is to blame. I shall refer to that kind of statement a little later on. I must say, however, that the position of affairs at the present time is very much better than it was when the forces were under State control.

69,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Wit h regard to the attendance at camp, as Mr Haldane pointed out in the House of Commons, the matter trenches w r y closely on the great question of the relations between employer and employee, and between labour and capital. What he partly meant by that was, that not only must the man be willing to go to camp, but his employer must be prepared to permit him to go. It is not merely a question of the man who is employed desiring to be trained for the defence of the country, it is also a question of whether his employer Volunteers. will be sufficiently patriotic to allow him to go into training. I do not wish to disclose names in referring to this matter, on one occasion when a particular man was specially required to be in camp, letter was written to his employer asking that they have. him to allow the man to go.",21

I think I am not disclosing any confidence when I say that that is view the Prime Minister took of the matter. While it is necessary to bring this matter under the attention of the House, let me say that I know that there to an old-age pension. is a large number of employers who are just as patriotic as any one else. Since the Government policy was decided upon, I have discussed this question with employers of labour, and with the manI agers of large institutions such as banks, and, in a majority of cases, they in expressed their willingness to do was required. They said: "" Let the vernment be considerate, and we shall them in every way we can."" In fairness, I am informing honourable members of the other side of the question. The view these men took was that it is very much better that they should suffer a little inconvenifor but ence, and exercise, perhaps, a little selfabnegation than that they should lose their a money, their business, and everything That is the view which practical men would take of the the matter. Still, the fact remains that what we have to consider is not' only the volition of the individual, but also the volition of the man who employs the individual.

There will be no trouble at all with our lads, and especially when it is known that every one will be called upon to perform the same duty. At present Jones says, "" Why should I go, when Brown does not go "" ? and so far as the employer is concerned, it must be admitted that the writer of the letter which I have quoted is so far justified that he may well ask why he should let his men go to camp when Smith down the street does not allow his to go. But when it is the law of the country, and the Government administer that law reasonably, we shall find that there will be no need for anything approaching compulsion. It will become in Australia a disgrace to a man that he should not have fulfilled his period of training, just as in Switzerland a man is ashamed to say that he has not done his military service.

The problem resolves itself into that concrete form eventually.",23

88,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If honourable members will look at the Estimates for past j'ears, they will find, eliminating from them the cost of rifle clubs, cadets, fixed defences, &c., and dividing the residue by the number of effectives, that the cost is between £ 2 5 and ^ 3 0 per head per annum.",23
89,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The money is largely spent in contingencies.,23
90,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I do not say how it is spent, but there is the result of the present system. Does any honourable member think that that is satisfactory?

96,Mr GLYNN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,We ought to be patriotic enough to find the necessary money.,23
97,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have pointed out the results from what is called the voluntary system. A man comes when he likes, goes away when he likes, and practically does what he likes under such a system.' The Inspector-General for New Zealand, in his last report, points out that only 25 per cent, were present at camp under the voluntary system in that Dominion. I make no comment upon the affairs of another Dominion, but simply state the fact. I turn to the state of things in Great Britain. The present Minister for War, Mr Haldane, is an able, astute man. His proposals up to a certain point were, perhaps, the best that were ever made-certainly , they were the best ever laid before the Imperial Parliament. But there was one defect in them, which at once became apparent. That defect was that the Imperial Government had not faced the question of making preparation for war a national duty. I haveshown our own condition under the voluntary system, and desire to show how an effort in Great Britain under the voluntarv system has succeeded. Honourable members may, suggest that preparation for wac is most effectively made when people are in a state of excitement. But it is too late then. Every one is willing to fight when his country is in danger, but those who are untrained do not know how. That Great Britain is in a state of serious apprehension, that she is very much alert, is evident from the fact that ^60,000,000 per annum is paid by the British taxpayer for defence purposes. The nation that pays so large a sum of money must be somewhat apprehensive. dane brought forward his scheme he was warned by a large number of men that his scheme would fail , as any scheme must fai l when work under, it is every one's business and no one's business. It was, however, launched with all the prestige of a new scheme, and with all the enthusiasm pertaining to a Government with a huge majority behind it. But what has happened with Mr Haldane's territorial army? In Great Britain, taking the same proportion of able-bodied men as I have taken in Australia and in Switzerland, there should be .8,000,000 capable of bearing arms. honourable members consider that that figure is too large,-they can have it for the purpose of argument, and take the number at 4,000,000.",23

104,Mr GLYNN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I do not think that that is the opinion entertained in England.,24
105,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,If the honourable member will read the English newspapers he will find that that is the view that they express.,24
106,Mr GLYNN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have read them, and they do not say that the scheme has failed.",24
107,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In the case of one brigade, which should have had a strength of 3,840 men they enrolled 1,287. Only 1,043 attended camp, and in the second If week of the camp there were only 707 men undergoing training.",24
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,How long were they in camp?,24
109,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,When they got to the eighth day the numbers were reduced to 707.,24
110,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The men had to get back to work. there are in Mr EWING - Some of the men said that they could not remain away longer; that their employers would 'not let them stay; but I have already referred to this matter. Therefore we arrive at this position - that the efforts in Great Britain to obtain a voluntary system have not been satisfactory. They have, on the contrary, been profoundly disappointing. Colonel Gadke, But then, when the German military expert, says that there is no doubt that the territorial army will be, apart fro m its numerical weakness, of small military value. Perhaps some honourable members will not be inclined to attach much weight to the opinion of a Gerdisappointing. man expert.",24
111,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,But he is a very high class authority.,24
112,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"He is, indeed. Le Tewfis, the great French newspaper, said that the territorial army was worthless as a fighting force. There is the result of the voluntary system under an able Minister in a strong Government. It has been Mr Haldane stated that this was the last opportunity that Great Britain would have of trying the voluntary system; that if this attempt failed the country would have to face the only alternative. I come now to what some experts have said in regard to the matter. When aMinister quotes to Parliament what his experts say we are usually told that experts sometimes say the right and sometimes the wrong thing; but I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without saying a word as to experts, because we shall have the opinions of experts more or less obscure quoted in opposition to the scheme of the Government. I ask honourable members to bear with me for a few moments to hear what the ablest experts in Great Britain have had to say in regard to the matter. It is not necessary to quote extensively from Lord Roberts, because every one knows what his views are. Everywhere, by means of pen or voice, he has insisted upon the necessity for what is sometimes called the compulsory system, or what we call the system of universal training. Standing next to him is Sir Evelyn Wood, Field Marshal, who says The time has come for instituting throughout the Empire a military system of universal service for Home (National) defence, and the Mother Country should set the example. I desire to know what names my honorTurning able friends on the other side will quote against Lord Roberts and Sir. Evelyn",24
113,Dr LIDDELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Will not the honourable member let us know the views of Lord system, Roberts ?",25
114,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member enough, can consult his book in the Library wishes. If any member of the Opposition expresses a desire, I shall get him a of it. I did not quote Lord Roberts, beappreciations, lieving that even the members of the position knew his views on the subject. Field-Marshal Viscount Wolseley saysFrom the national point of view, I should like to see every man in England undergo a course of military training, even if I thought that no invasion of England was possible.",25
115,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,How long is statement was made-thirt y years ago?,25
116,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No ; I have not gone Bill. back more than a few years, and can produce all these opinions. If honourable members knew the mass of congratulatory material from the press, and from literary and military men all over the Englishcopy speaking world, which has come to partment, and also to the Prime Minister, they would be astounded.",25
117,Dr LIDDELL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Will the Minister lish it for our benefit?,25
118,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"As much as is good for my honourable friends. Let me now give the views of some men who have recently been engaged in active operations. Lt General Kelly-Kenny saysI should put them all in one. army-militia , volunteers, and yeomanry, ancl have obligatory service for the whole, making it one homogeneous army. I should like to see every single man in the country go through a good militarytraining. Sir John French-and honourable members are aware of the position which he holdsat the present time-says I am greatly in favour of compulsory service in England-universa l service. I do not think that the requirements of a possible military situation can be satisfied short of general) service, i.e., the liability of every one for service. I will hear with interest the names my honourable friends will place against thenames I have quoted. Turning to the Navy, Admiral Sir E. Fremantle saysI am impressed with the necessity for universal military training and service, in timeof war. Admiral Sir N . Bowden Smith supportsLord Roberts' proposal for national training, and states that thirty Admirals aremembers of the National Service League. to laymen, there is a laymanwhose views will be held in respect, and' Wood ? that is Lord Milner, who saysWhat is causing the failure of the present and will always cause failure, is theerror of supposing that the volunteer principle can ever provide a basis, broad and strong to sustain the immense superstructurei f he of a really effective modern army. I turn next to the press. We have received"" copy hundreds of press acknowledgments and' but I shall simply quote theOpeminent military correspondent of The Times. Writing of the scheme, he says"" The plan is broad and comprehensive.""",25
119,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Did he receive a copy of compelled to the Bill before we did?,25
120,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No ; he received a copy of the scheme afterwards, but he underit since that stood it when he got it.",25
121,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,We have only just seen the,25
122,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"After the Prime Minister made his speech in December last, the scheme was circulated all over the world. To Lord Roberts and various authorities a was sent. It was a reasonable thingthe Deto do. Each of them could have got a copy otherwise, but it was a courteousthing to send a copy to eminent authoripubties. No material alteration has been* made since December.",25
123,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,There is a large alteration.,26
124,Mr EWING,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Bill is based upon the .Prime Minister's speech. The military correspondent of The Times says The plan is broad and comprehensive,, ciently modern to meet the principal requirequestion ments of scientific organization in the day. He goes on to say that he is convinced that the Prime Minister's solution is right one. From those classes, I turn to literature, and take the view of the Hon. John Fortescue, an able writer, and author of the History of the British He saysIt has never been denied that it is the of every able-bodied citizen to defend try when it is in danger; and if it be his duty to defend it, it is his duty to learn how to fend it If there be one lesson to be gleaned from British military history, it is the hopeless and irremediable inefficiency of voluntary system. I have cited these names-whic h could be extended almost indefinitely-to honourable members, in order to discover what names they will place against them, not that, as a rule, a critic is much more capable of expressing an opinion on what is trained good for the country, and what the. recruits, people ought to do for its defence, than are honourable members. I leave aspect of the case, having pointed out own sybtem, and its obvious and manifest failure, notwithstanding the many excellent men identified with it. I have shown that in England a similar system has been grievthe ously disappointing, and that in New Zealand one man in fourattended camp.

136,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"It is not estimated that we now have more than 15,000 efficients. One of the objections raised to our proposal is that Ave contemplate the creation of an army of boys. The age at which a boy can enter the territorial army under Mr. Haldane's scheme is seventeen years, but the age at which a boy can enter the National Guard of Australia is eighteen-and it must be remembered. that the Australian boy ismore matured at seventeen than is the English boy at that age. There seems to be an impression that the British army is like Xenophon's famous 10,000, that it is composed of seasoned veterans. According to the most recent figures I can obtain, 753 out of every 1,000 in the British regular army are of, or under, twenty-five years of age, and since the short service has been in vogue, the average age is less than it was. Mr Haldane proposed,a total forty-five days' training for his territorial army in the first three years; we propose forty-eight days in the total for these years for the National Guard. If it be jected thai our proposal is inadequate, what year's training is completed. is to be said of that of Mr Haldane?",27
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ITEMS COMMON TO,The Minister making a comparison with the scheme which he said was a failure.,28
138,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I limited my remarks to numbers. It must be remembered, too, that in Australia, after a few years, boys will come into camp who have had previous training, are ciplined, and know how to use their rifles. The period of training for the the Territorial Army is to be fifty-seven days; we propose eighty-four days for the National Guard.",28
139,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,In three years?,28
140,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Yes . I give the comnumber parison, to show that the Government have not made their proposals without considerabe a number of privates-perhaps tion, though T grant that the periods lowed are all too short for thorough trainwill ing. Coming to the question of payment, our view is that the defence of the country is not to be paid for as ordinary commer-' cial services. There are those who say that we should pay others to defend us, who think that there should be a large standing army; we propose that our people shall defend themselves; we do not contemunpaid plate paying wages in the ordinary sense of the term for military service. There must be exceptions where special duties are required, or special individual responsibilitention ties are in existence; but, generally speakthe ing, service in defence of the country will not be looked upon as something to be paid for in the ordinary way.",28
141,Mr FISHER,ITEMS COMMON TO,There should be equality of sacrifice.,28
142,Mr SAMPSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,-Is the employ^ to bear the whole brunt of the sacrifice?,28
143,Mr DEAKIN,ITEMS COMMON TO,Employer s as well as ployes must serve.,28
144,Mr SAMPSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,Employe s are in the majority.,28
145,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"As to the action to be taken with regard to the existing forces, the Prime Minister has promised that no one now serving shall suffer any disability reason of the change. There will be - dismissals. All will be treated fairly, rights and privileges will not be interfered with. In the first place, it would unreasonable to do away with the present force until we have another to put in place, and the task which confronts us so great that it will probably be or three years before the enlistment and obpreparation of regulations and the first No change whatever will be made until a stateis ment of the Government's intentions has been placed before Parliament. Nothing will be done hurriedly. The Government feel under a great obligation to the present forces. It is almost certain that the militia regiments will be called upon for more strenuous and definite work than partly disI have already outlined.",28
146,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,Are paid and unpaid men artillery of to serve together?,28
147,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I am speaking of the transition stage. We cannot do away with the existing force until we have another with which to replace it . No doubt a of the junior officers will offer their Services to the new regiments, and there may not S6 algreat a number as some would think-wh o qualify by examination as officers, and their services will be accepted. This wil l necessitate alterations which must be met. I cannot say definitely what form they will take, or the number involved, because or to do so would require the g if t of prophetic vision. It must be understood, however, that there cannot be a paid and an force, with two kinds of training, two sorts of administration, and two systems of camping. Such an arrangement would be like a harlequin's coat, whereas the inis to fuse the various branches of military service into one. It has been suggested that a militia regiment of 513 might be divided into three bodies, each containing 171 men, to be used as the leading companies of other regiments; but it has been asked by the militia men, "" Why cannot you keep us together? Why break us up unnecessarily?"" Having emlooked into the matter, I am able to say that I think that that can be done in nearly every case. The militia men are sane and patriotic enough to comply with the right thing when it is proposed, and I should like to place this aspect of the case before them. Everything must be looked at from by the war stand-point. Preparations which no do not bring jibout effectiveness for war and are so much circus display. If , ten years hence, a war broke out apd we had only be 15,000 or 20,000 men to put in the field, the militia officers would regret that the its Government had not taken action to inis crease the forces; whereas if we could two send out 200,000 men, they would be the thankful that Parliament had been sufficiently far-seeing to prepare. The Governto ment are taking power to make cadet service compulsory, though, while the cadets increase at the rate of about 10,000 year, it is not likely to be exercised.  between the time when they leave school and their attainment of the age of eighteen ?",28
148,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"During that period they will belong to the senior cadets. We take power to drill every child between the ages of twelve and eighteen, but under present conditions it probably will be unpoint! necessary to exercise it.",29
149,Mr HUTCHISON,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Is it intended untrained those who do not voluntarily join the cadets, and to train only those who do?",29
150,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"We have 40,000 cadets now, and the year after next we hope to have 60,000. There are 270,000 boys of cadet age in Australia, and while they tinue to join the cadets in such numnation bers, we feel that the work is going on fairlv well. Then we have to consider the financial aspect of the question. Each junior cadet costs jQi ios. in the Bill? per year, and each senior about J £ I 16s., while the rifles cost about £ 2 . The latter is a high figure; but we have hopes of ducing that expense presently. members will see that with 270,000 boys in training, there is involved a very large not nearly enough. financial question; and the Government will not proceed more rapidly than our financial position justifies. Therefore, the Go the vernment propose to be content with an annual increase of 10,000; and,- although power is taken to exercise arbitrary action, I do not anticipate such action will be necessary.",29
151,Mr SAMPSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,Is it proposed to reorganize the whole system of training cadets ?,29
152,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,There will be much resuggesting organization.,29

155,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,I do not desire to go inextent to details now; but the present proposal allow no boy to enter the cadets unless - he is reasonably fit to do the work.,29
156,Mr HUTCHISON,ITEMS COMMON TO,Who is to be the each judge of reasonable fitness?,29
157,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,The boys are presumed to boys to be fit when passed.,29
158,Mr HUTCHISON,ITEMS COMMON TO,The officers cannot make the inspection.,29
159,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"If honourable members desire that there should be absolute medical inspection, I will make no objection. ",29
160,Mr DEAKIN,ITEMS COMMON TO,There should be medical to leave inspection in all schools.,29
161,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Before leaving this branch of the subject, I desire honourable members not to be carried away with the idea that cadets are an army. That is one of the most popular and misleading views to take of national safety or defence. conAny competent critic will tell us that a which substitutes cadets for trained men, is going hopelessly astray.",29
162,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,Does the Minister say that men can be trained in the time proposer!,29
163,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"At any rate, the time reproposed in the Bill is much preferable to Honourable no training at all.",29
164,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,The training proposed is,29
165,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I know that the men, at end of the period, will not be so highly trained as, for instance, were the Federal' and Confederate troops at the end. of the American Civil War; but they will have been got pretty well into order, and will form the basis of a readily prepared force.",29
166,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,"In Switzerland, a man gets more training in a year than is proposed under the Bill in four years.",29
167,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,That is no reason for that there should be no training at all.,29
168,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,I do not know that I made such a suggestion.,29
169,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I have heard it frequently said, "" Let us stick to the cadets.""",29
170,Mr HUGHES,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Is any provision made for compulsory training of cadets, to the of providing any penalty or punishis ment for failing to attend ?",29
171,Mr DEAKIN,ITEMS COMMON TO,Powe r is taken to make the whole system compulsory.,30
172,Mr HUCI,ITEMS COMMON TO,IES - But what is proposed in this connection under the Bill ?,30
173,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"No doubt, with regard to many matters, difficulties will have to be overcome; and we shall take power, under regulation, to meet many contingencies we are not able to foresee today. If the Government come to ithe conclusion that it is essential to exercise compulsion, presume that Parliament will readily find a way to extend the power. I have frequently heard the opinion expressed that we ought ito keep to the cadets, who, no doubt, receive a very fine training, and are an important itemin our defence scheme. When the child is young the brain is receptive, and the training the cadet receives makes him a better citizen and a man. But we cannot defend the country with cadets.",30
174,Mr JOHNSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,No one has said that we can.,30
175,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I have heard it said, over and over again, "" Stick to the cadets! """,30
176,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,It is absolutely incorrect.,30
177,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I shall find examples for the honourable member. It is one of the most dangerous fallacies we have to combat that a nation is doing all that is necessary when it trains cadets. An army must be a living, moving machine, and officers cannot be trained by dealing with children, nor by merely consulting books. Where are we to obtain officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers to do the work of training and ing? If all the manhood of the countrycould shoot, and all had a knowledge of drill, they would be useless without officers to lead them. In war, no one would know what to do, or how to do it ; and any one who suggests that we should be content with cadets had better abandon any idea of a defence system.",30
178,Mr JOHNSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,No one has suggested that we should be content with cadets.,30
179,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I am glad that the honourable member agrees with me. But I can show him statements in leading newspapers, and refer him to the utterances of a large number of men who have expressed the opinion I have indicated. I now wish to refer to the question of the clothing of the forces, and to make it clear why this is most important. In the middle of last century, there was, in India, as honourable members will remember, with Lawrence and others whom I need not mention, a very able body of men which did great work in holding up the prestige of the Empire under circumstances that were well nigh appalling. In Younghusband's book, The Story of the Guides, he points out one of the great troubles which the British forces had to combat thereAt a time when soldiers fought and marched, I and lived in tight scarlet tunics, high stocks, trousers tightly strapped over Wellington boots,, and shakos, which would now be looked on as certain death, Sir Henry evolved the startling heresy' that to get the best work out of troops, and to enable them to undertake great exertions, it was necessary that the soldier should be loosely, comfortably, and suitably clad, that something more substantial than a pill box with a pocket handkerchief wrapped round it was required as a protection from a tropical sun, and that footgear must be made for marching, and not for parading round a band stand. Representations in regard - to the clothing were made on behalf of the men; and immediately the experts and a large number of people in Great Britain declared ""that, if a feather or a stripe were removed, the Army would be ruined-that ft was disloyal to propose such a thing. These experts and people asked how discipline could be preserved if those trappings were done away with, and declared that it would be a treacherous act to interfere with the then conditions. But those in favour of the reform persevered; and the result is that today khaki is the fighting costume for armies all over the world. It is obvious that the clothing of our forces lead- must be of the simplest and cheapest character; and I desire now to refer more particularly to the question of officers' uniforms.",30
180,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,Is it proposed to make a change? Every change means expense.,30
181,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I do not wish to say anything disagreeable; but honourable members who had an opportunity of seeing the gorgeous spectacles on the occasion of the visit of the American Fleet, must have been struck by the view of decent, respectable, inoffensive gentlemen, appearing arrayed like escapees from the Mahdi's harem. It is astounding to me that men should desire to get into such uniforms. I can understand men in China, in times gone by, assuming great masks in order to frighten the enemy, or gorgeous costumes being resorted to by savages, or the rain-makers of Africa; but I cannot conceive that any respectable, middle-aged man, who has ""lost his waist, can desire any such costume. I am quite sure these men do not desire to wear such uniforms, but only do so because it is customary-the y are just as sensible as any of us, ancl would not appear in costumes of the kind if it could be avoided.",30
182,Mr JOHNSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,To which uniform is the Minister referring?,31
183,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"We saw gorgeous uniforms everywhere; if they were not on the top of the binnacle they were on the top of the funnel; if they were not there they were on the main track-it was appalling. It is accepted as a fundamental principle by every one, whatever be his position-whethe r he has money or not-that a country, to do good defence work, must have it done by men, irrespective of class-that wherever brains may be found they should be utilized. All the brains are not in Footscray, any more than they are all in Toorak, but are diffused throughout the community; and wherever ability is found it should be used in the defence of the country. But it is of no use calling upon men of intelligence and industry, whatever their position, to act as officers, if we permit a procedure which practically excludes the poorer portion of the community. That is why I was somewhat harsh when speaking on the question of clothing, because I regard this as representing one of the greatest dangers in connection with our forces. If we inform men of limited means that, providing they have ability, they mav become officers, and then inform them that they will have to spend .£40 or ^50 on uniform, we might as well extend no invitation to them.",31
184,Mr HUTCHISON,ITEMS COMMON TO,That is what poorer men are told now.,31
185,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I am now laying before honourable members the proposals of the Goveniment. I have here, a statement made by the Inspector-General, who shows that, not in the case of a general in the Coldstream Guards, but in that of a lieutenant of infantry in our forces, who, I believe, is not a very high magnate, the approximate cost of the uniform is ,.£44 8s. 6d.",31
186,Mr MATHEWS,ITEMS COMMON TO,More than that.,31

188,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,Why permit expensive uniforms now ?,31
189,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The honourable member knows that only a conjurer can make a mango tree grow ""while you w a it ""; and I am no conjurer. I can do only one thing at a time.",31
190,Mr HUTCHISON,ITEMS COMMON TO,But the honourable member could abolish the system if he chose to do so.,31
191,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"When it was determined that the ordinary working uniform of the Australian forces should consist of khaki, permission was given to a large number of officers to continue to wear these uniforms, and they were entitled, having purchased them, to wear them out. But, as a matter of fact, they never wore out, or, if they did, they were replaced by new ones.",31
192,Mr MATHEWS,ITEMS COMMON TO,Scarle t tunics have been reintroduced during the honourable member's term of office.,31
193,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"That is a mistake. The intention of the Government is that not only shall the wearing of these expensive uniforms not be permissive, but that it shall be made clear by the regulations that they shall not be worn, and that such uniforms as there are shall be worn only at ceremonials and special functions.",31
194,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,Is the use of khaki going to be provided for in the Act itself?,32
195,Mr DEAKIN,ITEMS COMMON TO,No ; it will be dealt with in the regulations.,32
196,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Regulation s are continually being made, and I would rather see the Government left as free as possible in regard to such matters. Too comprehensive a measure is often almost as useless as no measure at all.",32
197,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,Then what about the mango-tree argument? The honourable member says that one needs to be a conjurer to amend the regulations. Does he. intend to become a conjurer after this Bill is passed?,32
198,Mr DEAKIN,ITEMS COMMON TO,We shall then have a new system.,32
199,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,But the Minister has three years within which to make this change.,32
200,Mr DEAKIN,ITEMS COMMON TO,Unde r the old system.,32
201,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Unde r the old system officers are allowed to use these uniforms. I have explained to the House the general principles underlying the Bill itself, and have referred specially to the question of clothing, because it appeared to me to cut right across the question of the employment of ability."" I now leave that phase of the subject to the consideration of honourable members. Air. KELLY - The Minister promised to let us know what kind of invading force the new system was intended - to repel.",32
202,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I am neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet. impossible for any one to foretell Australia's future danger. I have read a statement by competent men there would never be a warship south of the line, and yet within the last few weeks we have seen sixteen of them in our hairbors. The Imperial Defence Committee postulated a force of some thousand men with a few unarmoured cruisers.",32
203,Mr DEAKIN,ITEMS COMMON TO,For how long does that prophecy hold good?,32
204,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I was about to put that question to the House. If that were all we hacl to fear we might almost hope to cope with it by means of the police; but the Imperial Defence Committee has pointed out also there is such a thing as national existence, and I believe that, in the future, national existence in Australia, and the lives of our children, will be seriously imperilled. The great work for us to do is to preserve Australia as a white man's country for our children and their descendants. If honourable members read Professor Pearson's great work, which has been referred to by recent critics as being more in the nature of a prophecy than an alarmist statement, they will see that he points out that Europe and America will certainly remaan white, and that Asia and Africa will remain black, but that there are very serious doubts with regard.to Australia. If honourable members take into consideration our environment, they will recognise that civilization in Australia stands in more danger of absolute destruction than it does in any other part of the British Empire. And yet I am asked what we intend to provide against. The Government proposal is to make had the position of Australia such that no country will thoughtlessly interfere with her. If we wish to have immunity from pin pricks or actual war, we must show ourselves able to fight. The country that would laugh at our present force of 15,000 men, would not dare to laugh if Australia were properly prepared. This is a preparation which means peace, not war; it is a. preparation designed to keep Australia in tact and white. We shall meet with opposition ; I have scented it ; like the scent of the rose it still hangs round our opponents, this evening. We shall have opposition from men who cannot undergo the begetting of an idea; we shall have opposition from people who find it impossible to believe that any system save that to which they have been accustomed could be It is right. We shall have, also, to contend! with political bias. Political bias, entertained unknowingly, will cause some that doubtless to be critics; let us hope that they will be fair. .One of the most reputable members of the Opposition is the honourable member for North Sydney, yet, in speaking the other day, he asked, ""Why don't we do as the British Navy has done?Conscription has never been necessary in connection with the British Navy. Such legislation has never been necessary in Great Britain. Why don't we follow the example of the British A d m i r a l t y ?"" The honourable member forgot that when, in the years to which he referred, there was any. shortage in connection with the manning of the British Navy, men were hocussed in drinking shops or overpowered in the streets, and sold at the ship's side by the - carcass. I. am not aware whether honourable members believe that that is a right position to take up ; but our contention is - that to take Parliament into our confidence, and to legislate in regard to these matters, is far more in keeping with the spirit of the times. I mention this as an illustration of the effect of political bias, and when we find so reasonable a man as the honourable member for North Sydney usually is, - taking the tail-board off his intelligence and pouring that sort of stuff over an un-suspecting and unsophisticated people, what can we expect from - I leave to some - one else the task of filling the blank?",32
205,Sir JOHN QUICK,ITEMS COMMON TO,Can the - member tell us what is proposed with reference to Naval Defence?,33
206,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"It has always appeared to me to be unwise to deal with the two different forces in the one Bill , and this measure deals primarily with the land forces. At all periods in the history of the world - w e read of them in Holy Writ-ther e - have been men who were thankful that they were not as other people. The feeling is reciprocal. When we first made this proposal, the charge against us was that it was disloyal; that it was tantamount - to finding fault with the British Navy, and the Government have had to meet such questions as, "" You have the British Navy, ' why do you not sit down and do nothing?"" I have as strong a belief in the British Navy, and in Empire responsibility, as has any honourable member, and have shown it whenever called upon to do so; but, as we all know, man's members either become atrophied or expand, and intellect has not become atrophied, I am forced to look at - they are. I have already said that the British-Navy is the greatest fighting force in the world, and I want now to present in the briefest manner possible a summary of its history. middle of the last century the position of the British Navy was such that if the whole of the fighting forces afloat of other nations had gathered in the English Channel in opposition to it, it could have blown them out of the water. A few decades passed, and we had British statesmen saying, not that it could beat the whole world, but that it could Hold its own against any possible combination. A little later onancl we can trace these changes through history-it was said, "" The British Navy is able to meet the navies of any two Powers.""",33
207,Mr DEAKIN,ITEMS COMMON TO,That it was up to the two-Power standard.,33
208,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,Quite so. Now we find some of the ablest statesmen in Great Britain declaring that in 1913 the British Navy will be put tb the pin of her collar to hold her own against one.,33
209,Mr MATHEWS,ITEMS COMMON TO,It is not disloyalty to make that statement.,33
210,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"We have to face the facts as they present themselves to us, and it is idle to orate about Britain being mistress of the sea and to indulge in mere talk. Facts control the situation, and when we find that within fifty years the honourable British Navy has passed from ithe stage of absolute, control of the oceans of the world to one which impels some British statesmen to declare that it is doubtful whether it will be able in a lifttle time hence to hold its own successfully",33
211,Mr JOHNSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,All the more reason why we should be loyal.,33
212,Mr EWING,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Exactly . And how does a man display true loyalty ? By using his intelligence for the good of his country and seeing, as time goes on, what is the most practical step to take for its well-being. There is no disloyalty in a mere statement of facts. We must remember that the British Navy has something more to do than to look after our shipping and our foreshores. The British Navy-and I say this is' an Australian - has as its main responsibility the protection of the heart of the Empire. If the heart goes, everything goes. We might be scorched and hurt a little; still the Empire would since my recover and the white man win. But destroy the heart of the Empire, and the things as whole is destroyed. The main work of the British Navy is to protect the heart of the Empire-the "" powerhouse of the line""-to hold it intact against invasion and to so arrange that the In the food supplies of Great Britain shall continue without stint. If for a few weeks her food supplies were delayed or obstructed Britain would be placed in a serious position. Remembering that the British Navy has enormous responsibilities, cannot honourable members recognise that we are not disloyal to Britain by trying to prepare to help her in time of trouble, so that when she is engaged in a leviathan struggle, fighting for her l if e and for the existence of the Empire, we shall not have to throw ourselves upon her shoulders, saying, ""Come and help us."" ? Take the two positions. In the one case some say, "" We will do nothing, we will blither about the flag until we sicken every one who hears us. We will talk about loyalty, but we will do nothing, and when we' are in trouble Ave will cry to England, ' We are powerless, Ave are helpless, come and help us.' "" Britain ought at such a time to be left free to clo her greatest work wherever it may be. The attitude of the Government, and of a vast majority of the members of this House, is rather to say to her in her time of crisis, "" We have used our time by preparing for the evil days to come. We have 200,000 men of the National Guard partly trained, and with, at least, a knowledge of the rudiments of their work. We are prepared to maintain inviolate our island continent, while you clo your greater Avork. Come as soon as you can. We may be sorely pressed, but, in the meantime, go on Will your work, for you may depend that, hav-. ing prepared, Ave Avill do our duty."" Is there any man in this House, any Britisher, so obtuse as not to see the difference between the palsied oratory, the Avretched lip-loyalty,. of one attitude, and the manly 'reasonableness of the other? Australians should be prepared, if for no other reason than that it is their duty to the Empire. One position degrades a community into the position of servile sycophants-lazy , thoughtless, inconsiderate. The other elevates a nation to a position of manhood. Having done their duty, having prepared themseh'es, they are able to stand upright, as sons in their father's house.",33

I therefore move That the debate be now adjouined. Motion agreed to. Motion (by Mr EAVING) proposed - That the resumption of the debate be an Order of the Day for this dav week.

Debate resumed from 25 th September (vide page 432), on motion by Mr. GROOMThat this Bill be now read a second time.",34
217,Mr STORRER,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Bass) [5.10] - A considerable amount of heat has been shown by some honourable members over the question of the Capital site, and the delay in settling it. Personally, I cannot imagine why - honourable members should get so heated in discussing any question, especially one of such great importance as this, or make so many accusations against one another, as has happened in this case. The Capital site question Avas decided some years ago by the last Parliament, and the delay has been caused through the opposition, not of the people of NeAv South Wales, but of the Government of that State. Yet members of the Opposition in this Chamber are chiding the GoA'ernment for the delay, stating that they have been four years in office a.nd have done nothing. The leader of the Opposition was himself in power for some months after that Act was passed, yet, with all the knoAv ledge which he and his Minister of Home Affairs brought to bear on the question, they could not make any advance OAving to the opposition of the NeAv South Wales GoA'ernment. I do not blame the Reid Government, the Watson GoA'ernment, or the Deakin Government in any Avay for the delay that has taken place. I put the whole of the blame on the Government of NeAv South Wales, and not upon the people of that State, Will whom I haA'e no fault to find. We on this side haA'e been accused of not alloAving the representatiA'es of New South Wales to speak Avithout saying something derogatory about them. Personally, I do not blame any honourable member for speaking for his State, but I do not like unfair charges to be made against any Minister or member of this House. I sent some of the speeches made from the other side, in which the Government been accused of doing nothing for the four years. An arrangement was entered into, as the result of a conference between representatives of this Government Government of New South Wales, under which the present Bill has been brought forward. The Government have brought it into give effect to that arrangement, yet they are chided for delay extending over many years. I hope that, ing with this important matter, we shall get away from all .this party feeling, not accuse any party of unfairness. supported Dalgety on a previous occasion, and as a majority of the Parliament dorsed that view, it is only right that every honourable member should now be loyal to that decision. We have at present a tem by which we vote money for certain works, and any that is not spent at the of the financial year lapses, and has to re-voted. We are told that under the sent system each Parliament can decide upon any position for a site for the Federequired ral Capital, but what would be thought this Parliament voted a sum of money a large building, such as the Melbourne General Post Office, and if then a new Parliament refused to vote money to comfor plete the work? The responsibility upon one Parliament to carry out the cisions of a previous Parliament, especiwool ally on an important issue of this kind. We acted wisely in fixing the site at Dalgety. After considering the whole of the reports, I found that Dalgety was the only site that had what 1 considered a good water supply. One honourable member reof cently made the peculiar statement that supply of water was only a minor matter; but water is the main requirement for man and beast, and is certainly, essential for city of any size. An amendment has been circulated by the honourable member for Parkes, the effect of which will be to pone the settlement of the matter for number of years, and allow Parliament meet at Sydney in the meantime. idea, was endorsed by the honourable member for Batman. But where would we meet Sydney if it were decided that we should go there in one or two years' time? There is no building suitable for us there. Where necessary undertakings for a city. should we find accommodation for our offihope, cers? Ten vears, although a long time [,9] the life of an individual, is but a small respace in the history of a nation. Who would prepare offices and move whole deha.ve partments from here to Sydney for last only ten years ? No individual likes a temporary habitation of that description, and there are much greater objecand the tions fo it in the case of large departments like ours, which must necessarily be permanently located somewhereThe sooner that is done the better. When 1 and voted for Dalgety I hoped that we should go there immediately, or, at any rate, in dealas quickly as possible, so that we might settle down - We have been acand cused by some honourable members on I the other side of not being in earnest in the matter. I am very much in earnest in inbelieving that we should be in our own Capital as soon as possible, and so carry out the will of the people, as expressed b\ systhem when they voted for the Constitution. We require in the Federal Capital end a good supply of water for the people, be and also a good force of water for electric prelight and power purposes. It was argued the other day that watei power would be only for trams and lighting puri f poses, and that the Capital would never for become a manufacturing centre. But in a district like Dalgety, hundreds of miles from any large city, there is a fine opening a woollen industry, for example, which rests would have the advantage of cheaper decarriage than is the case now, when the has to be sent long distances.",34
218,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Does the honourable member think that the presence of a Parliament would start a commercial centre? ' Mr STORRER - No , but the presence power will help to establish factories. the In Launceston we have over 2,000 horsepower coming through the tunnel continually, and it costs us nothing, except, a of course, the interest on the money spent on the works. Yet one honourable membei stated in the House recently that coal was postcheaper than water as a source of power, a and quoted an engineer in support of the to assertion. The experience of Launceston That is a proof to the contrary. At Dalgety we could get water power in the same way, in and that could be used for woollen or other mills, as well as in the work of stone crushing for road-making, and other I therefore, that this Parliament will in not go back on the vote of the last Parliament, but will adhere to Dalgety, and that then we shall have no further delay in taking up our position there. that another amendment has been foreshadowed, to the effect that the Government should bring up a report every year, showing how the work is progressing, if Dalgety should be adopted as the site. But, as every honourable member knows, we can get a reporb from the Government whenever we wish, by asking a Minister for it, and so I see no necessity for that amendment. I hope to see the day when we shall assemble at Dalgety. Whether I am there or not, I hope that it will become a strong and flourishing city. I repeat that one of the main sources of the success of any city will always be found in an abundant water supply. Mr TILLE Y BROWN (Indi) [5.20] I do not intend to occupy the time of the House at any length. The selection of the permanent Seat of Government is, however, a matter of considerable importance fo the people of this country, and from the information in my possession I do not think that either Canberra or Dalgety should be chosen. I sympathize deeply with the representatives of New South Wales and with the people of that State in their desire to have this question definitely determined. Certainly we ought to be in a better position to decide it now than we were eight years ago. We are all aware that at the Premiers' Conference, which took place in 3899, certain proposals regarding the permanent Seat of Government were put forward. To-day, it is urged that those proposals should be binding upon us, and should commit us to something which, in the light of experience, we know would be to the detriment of Australia, I listened with great interest the remarks of the honourable member for Nepean, the honourable member for Coolgardie, the leader of the Opposition, and the Minister of Trade and Customs. When this measure was before Parliament last session, I took the precaution of consulting Mr Speaker in regard to an amendment which I desired to move, and I was therefore surprised when I heard the leader of the Opposition say that no amendment to the Bill could be submitted. Surely common sense indicates that any honourable member is entitled to submit an amendment ?",35
219,Mr REID,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I said that no amendment could be moved which would have the effect of nullifying the object of the Bill. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - I know ex[ see actly where I stand, and it is my intention to submit an amendment. But I first propose to deal with the position as it presents itself today. When we were discussing the question of Federation in 1899, infinitely more important questions were raised than the mere settlement of the site of the Federal Capital. Upon page 219 of the report of the proceedings of the Premiers' Conference in 1899, is to be found the followingIt is considered that the fixing of the site of the Capital is a question which might well be left to the Parliament to decide, but in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South Wales, the Premiers have modified the clause so that while the Capital cannot be fixed at Sydney or in its neighbourhood, provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales, at a reasonable distance from that city. I do not think that there is any reasonable man in this Chamber who desires for a moment to interfere with the absolute right of New South Wales under the Constitution to the possession of the Federal Capital. The report continuesAccordingly, the request of New Soutli Wales that the Capital should be in that Colony was granted, but with two conditions which Victoria insisted on. Victoria surrendered whatever right she may possibly have had in connection with this matter to the sister and parent colony.  Mr TILLE Y BROWN - I have not said that they did not.  is '""' quacking "" about Victoria.",36
220,Mr TILLEY BROWN,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I have heard the honourable member refer to what he believes is going to be the greatest State into the Commonwealth, namely, Queensland, without interruption from any honourable member. The document proceeds1. That it should not be within 100 miles of Sydney. > 2. That the Parliament should sit at Melbourne until it met at the"" Seat of Government. That is the constitutional compact, and no honourable member desires to break it. But the provision that the Seat of Government should not be within 100 miles of Sydney does not necessarily imply that it should not be distant 200 miles or 300 miles from that, city.",36
221,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ITEMS COMMON TO,"O r 500 miles. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - O r 500 miles, if that were possible. I have not been able to visit either Canberra or Dalgety, but I have used the intelligence with which Providence has endowed me to investigate the relative merits of these two sites, and I am satisfied that neither of them fulfils the requisite conditions for a Federal Capital. I understand that Dalgety is the one great tourist resort of New South Wales.",36
222,Mr REID,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Dalget y ? Nobody ever goes there. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - That is another matter. I thank the leader of the Opposition for his interjection. If nobody visits Dalgety for the purpose of viewing its beauties, I do not think that this Parliament will be so foolish as to go there. The country surrounding the Canberra site is, I am informed, second-class "" squatting "" .country. I do not think that either the Canberra or'Dalgety site is an eligible one. I recognise that both have been put forward because it is desired to conform as closely as possible to the constitutional provision relating to the 100-miles limit. But I venture to think that the people of New South Wales are sufficiently broad-minded to recognise that our desire is to establish the permanent Seat of Government in a place where advantages will accrue to"" the people of New South Wales, and, if possible, to the people of Victoria. It has been my privilege to inform myself of the merits of a third site, and, while I feel that it is a little too near Victoria, I cannot fail to recognise that its selection would confer immense advantages upon New South Wales, and also upon this State.",37
223,Mr SAMPSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Is there good land there ? Mr TILLE Y BROWN - I have personally visited this site. I have also been - to Sydney, and I must say that when I have looked out upon its magnificent harbour, I have been led to wonder how some New South Wales representatives could ever leave it. The scenic effects of Sydney Harbor are reproduced with striking fidelity at Tooma. I have no doubt that if the Sydney people themselves could be transported to that site they would not insist upon the observance of the provision relating to the 100-miles limit. I do not know whether the representatives of the other States recognise how earnestly and determinedly the Victorian Parliament has from time to time endeavoured to formulate some system by which natural disabilities might be overcome. I have no desire to enter into an academic discussion upon principles which are not cognate to this question. But it must be patent' [19]- 2 to every one who is interested in. production, that we are not getting the best possible results from our climate and our lands in that connection. A magnificent fall of rain today may be succeeded tomorrow by one of those blizzards which I am told are common at Dalgety, the effect of which is to dissipate all the good Lhat the rain has done. The Victorian Parliament has evidenced a determination to counteract the injury worked by these natural forces. What better work could this Parliament perform than that of establishing the permanent 'Seat of Government upon one of the upper reaches of the River Murray? What would such action mean? It would mean that hundreds of billions of cubic feet of water which today run idly to the sea, would be distributed through Riverina and Victoria for irrigation purposes. It would thus confer incalculable benefit upon both New South Wales and this State, and assist to create wealth with which to pay the taxes that must inevitably be levied by the States and Commonwealth Governments. The character of the climate must also be considered. Only the other night the Treasurer interjected that if Dalgety were chosen he would resign his seat.",37
224,Sir PHILIP FYSH,ITEMS COMMON TO,No ; he said he would not go there.,37
225,Mr TILLEY BROWN,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The honourable member said he would retire from Parliament, and great as the loss no doubt would be, I think there are some thousands of people who would be prepared to congratulate themselves upon it.",37
226,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"They would not be patriots. ' Mr TILLE Y BROWN - We must consider the advantages and disadvantages of any site proposed for the Federal Capital, and the consensus of opinion appears to me to suggest that Dalgety would not be a wise choice. There are people who say that if we persist in choosing Dalgety from time to time, we shall never have a Federal Capital established. That would not distress me very much. I am, of course, friendly with the members of the Government, though 1 do not defend their policy, and am utterly opposed to them on many points. They included in the Governor General's speech measures which involve the expenditure of millions of money. If the honourable member for Brisbane is to be believed, and I think he is, the acquisition of the Northern Territory will involve an expenditure little short of ,£15,000,000. If the Government are in earnest about the establishment of the Federal Capital, I should like, in view of the approach, of the year 1910, to ask where the money is to come from with which to build it. I interjected the other night that the establishment of the Federal Capital would involve the expenditure of millions of money, and I was told that it would not. I am reminded of a proposal which, I think, was an improper one, to acquire a site for Commonwealth offices in London, in the Strand. In connection with that proposal, we were invited, at very short notice, to consider the possibility of expending a sum of £500,000 upon the construction of offices, with an additional annual expenditure. If it would require the expenditure of ,£500,000 to build offices in the Strand, it is of no use to tell me that it will not involve the expenditure of millions to build a Federal Capital'. I think it would be far better to accept the suggestion that, as the Seat of Government has been in Melbourne for ten years, we should now let Sydney have it for ten years. I am aware that under the Constitution, the Seat of Government is to remain in Melbourne until the Federal Capital is established; but if , in the light of experience, it is deemed unwise for some time to spend money upon its establishment, we have common sense enough to say that, as we have had the Seat of Government for ten years in Victoria, it should now be transferred to New South Wales for another ten years. I should be willing tc assist a movement in that direction ; but I am not prepared to agree to expenditure in the establishment of a Federal Capital at the present time, without fuller investigation of the whole subject"". No matter where the Capital is located, railway construction will be necessary. In all the circumstances, I ask whether it would not be better to make a selection which would create another province for both Victoria and New Sputh Wales. That might be done by the selection of the Tooma site. It has great natural advantages. I have referred to the advantages which its selection would confer as an inducement to the conservation of the waters of the Murray. The district surrounding it is comprised of exceedingly good land. The necessities of Victoria, as well as of New South Wales in times of drought, are met by the fat cattle brought from that country. Only the other day, when our people were calling out for meat, some Mr Tilley Brown. 1,400 head came from the Tooma district, and they had to travel 60 or 70 miles by road. In the olden days, it used to be said that the settlement of Gippsland would add another province to Victoria, and surely there is sufficient intelligence in this national Parliament to select a Capital site which will add a new province to both Victoria and New South Wales. The site selected must possess a good supply of water. What do we find in this respect at Tooma? No less than 900,000 cubic feet of water pass in front of the site reported upon at Tooma every minute. If the site must possess beauty spots, and must be capable of agricultural and pastoral development, these features are possessed by the Tooma district, whilst from all the evidence 1I have seen it is impossible to grow even a potato within five and twenty miles of Dalgety. If Canberra is second-class squatting country, as we have been told, the same statement would apply to it. Surely there can be no intention on the part of a great Parliament such as this in the selection of a Capital site to do an injustice, not only to ourselves, but to the teeming millions of Australians yet unborn. We are selecting a Capital site for a Commonwealth which we expect to grow into a nation. I have no doubt that it will become a nation, though perhaps not in my time. I intend to make my voice heard not only here, but elsewhere if necessary.",37
227,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ITEMS COMMON TO,"In the honourable member's electorate. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - Not only in my own electorate. I have told some of the honourable members who sit in the corner opposite that I shall take good care to keep them employed in their electorates when the next elections come on. . If they do not know the first principle of etiquette in parliamentary life I am old enough to teach them. But that is "" parenthesis business,"" as Sir Thomas Bent would-say if he were here. I have here a full report upon the Tooma site, but I shall not quote from it, because honourable members as well as myself can read it. But I urge its claims to consideration as superior to Dalgety and Canberra, because of the impetus which the selection of Tooma would give to settlement and to water conservation. I do not know whether honourable members who live in cities quite appreciate the disabilities of the man on the land. He gets up at 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning, works on till dark, and goes to bed because he is tired, having none of the opportunities of enjoyment which are open to persons - residing in centres of population. I hold 'that everything that is possible should be done to improve the condition of the people on the land. Let me say that in the establishment of the Federal Capital we must consider first the necessity of a pure and wholesome supply of water, and that cannot be provided at Canberra or Dalgety.",38
228,Mr JOHNSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Ye s it can. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - So far as I understand the matter, at those places it would be necessary to establish a pumping plant to provide the people with a water supply.",39
229,Mr JOHNSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The engineers who report on the matter do not say so. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - At any rate, I believe that selfish interests dominate those who recommend Dalgety and Canberra. I may be charged witli having some consideration for my own electorate in suggesting the selection of Tooma. If so, [ cannot help it. Tooma is not in my electorate, but in the electorate of the Treasurer, ancl I have not had even a consultation with that honourable gentleman on this question. So that I cannot be charged with being in collusion with him. I commend the reports upon the Tooma site to the consideration of honourable I claim that the selection of that site would give another province to Victoria and New South Wales.",39
230,Mr JOHNSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Not to New South Wales, only to Victoria. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - To New South Wales also. I am sorry that the honourable member does not see the matter as I do, but no doubt he will when it - comes to a vote.",39
231,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The honourable member is aiware that the Tooma site was before the House on another occasion? Mr TILLE Y BROWN - I am aware that the Treasurer took a number of people in motor cars to see it, and that some them did not see it. I have intimated I would close by moving an amendment. The motion before the Chamber isThat this Bill be now read a second time. I intend to move as an amendment that all the words after the word "" That"" be left out with a view to inserting in lieu 'thereof the words ' ' this' Bill be withdrawn and another introduced forthwith providing for a Capital site at Tooma."" I am aware that as expenditure is involved a message is necessary, but I believe that the amendment I suggest will be considered in order.",39
232,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"No message is required. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - I hope, Mr. Speaker, that you will hold that my amendment is in order; and I am quite certain that if the House takes the claims of Tooma into consideration, and is-as I am sure it is-honestl y determined to do its best in fixing the Capital site, the position which I advocate will be recognised as furnishing advantages even greater than those v/hich I have mentioned.",39
233,Mr SPEAKER,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The honourable member for Indi has rightly said that the motion before the House-is-""That this Bill be now read a second time."" The honourable member will see that his amendment if carried would mean negativing the motion. The amendment directs that the Bill shall be' withdrawn. As the result desired by the honourable member can be achieved simply by negativing the motion, I cannot accept his amendment, because the first result of it would be fo resolve that the Bill shall not now be read a second time.",39
234,Mr TILLEY BROWN,ITEMS COMMON TO,"But , Mr Speaker, we cannot get a straight vote, otherwise members. than by this process.",39
235,Mr SPEAKER,ITEMS COMMON TO,"If the honourable to .member wishes to know how he can get a straight vote, as he terms it, I may inform him that he can, in Committee, propose to omit Dalgety.",39
236,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Parkes) [5.51]. - I have not, so far, taken any part in the debate upon this much-vexed question; and my reason for hesitating to do so is simply that I regard any attempt to change the votes of the members of this House upon it, either collectively or individually, as absolutely futile. Although I have no intention of touching the issue that has been dealt with by honourable members during the last two of or three days, I am going to prothat pose, in effect, that the further discussion of the matter be postponed. I propose to move an amendment, the effect of which would be to secure a postponement of the choice of the Capital site at the present time. I have on previous occasions commented, as forcibly as I could, upon the great inconvenience, not only to honourable members, but to the legislation of the country, of having the Parliament situated at one of its great centres; and I have pointed out more than once that other States have suffered considerably by reason of the great advantage which has been afforded to the State of Victoria, and would be afforded to any other State in which the Parliament is situated, because of the facility with which it could be reached by its representatives in Parlia-' ment, and by which they could be afforded facilities for voting upon different questions as compared with the difficulties which the representatives of the more distant States experience. But notwithstanding that consideration, I propose, for even stronger reasons, to submit an amendment which will have the effect of postponing the choice of the Federal Capital for some years to come.",39
237,Mr FRAZER,ITEMS COMMON TO,Does not the honourable member think that by moving such an amendment he is denying to New South - Wales her rights under the Constitution?,40
238,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"No ; I may be postponing the securing of those rights, but I do not think that I am denying them. The choice of the Capital site is unmistakably one of the most important steps that can be taken, or has ever been suggested, in Federal history. To fix a site for the Parliament of Australia, for all time, is really to take a step of the most far-reaching cliaracter; and although the Constitution provides for the choice of the Capital in the State which.I represent, I think that I am taking a sufficiently unbiased view of the matter in desiring to postpone the choice in view of the vote which I think this House is inclined to give. At the present time the choice of a Capital site will be too much influenced by local feeling. I am sure that no man in this House who is aware of the different stages tlirough which this question has passed since 1901 can doubt that a great many of the votes that would be given if the choice were made at the termination of this debate would scarcely be given if the Capital were intended to be built and occupied at once; because I believe that votes are intended to be recorded in the approaching division which are not being given upon the principle of choosing the best site for the whole Commonwealth. I am satisfied that many votes are about to be given for Dalgety in the hope that the selection of that site will mean the permanent postponement of the final choice of the Capital site. We cannot speculate upon a possibility of that kind without referring to the eifect of press criticism on this particular question. I am not going, to do this in order to stir up any ill-feeling with regard to any particular State, but merely to illustrate the fact, which is. thoroughly impressed upon my own mind, that the press in the different States, and' especially in the State in which we are now situated, has done more to stir up Inter-State ill-feeling than has been done by this Parliament at this time. I refer first to the Age newspaper.",40
239,Mr COON,ITEMS COMMON TO,The best newspaper in j\.UStl*tlllfl,40
240,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"That may be; and I am trying to show what it has done in the exercise of its alleged supreme qualities. Four years or more ago, when this question was prominently before the public, that newspaper deliberately and clearly enunciated a principle which I had no hesitation at the time in characterizing as an immoral one. It put forward this argument in one of its leading articles : That it was true that the Constitution did provide that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales, but, inasmuch as the Constitution did not say when the site should be chosen, Victoria, which had been done out of its right to have a vote upon the question of locating the Capital in this State, was justified-and I am now using the Age's words - in applying the principle of the Merchant of Venice to the compact, and giving New South Wales her absolute right, but at some indefinite future time. The Argus selected four candidates for the Senate at the last election. Those four candidates made it a plank in their platform that they would advocate and approve of the indefinite postponement of the selection of the Capital site; and the Argus newspaper, in its leading article, not only advocated the election of those four men, but made it a point in its advocacy of their cause that they were in favour of postponing the choice of a Capital for an unlimited period",40
241,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I think the honourable member is making a mistake. There were only three vacancies for the Senate at the last election. ' Mr Bruce SMITH - Then the leading article to which I refer must have beenwritten on the occasion of the previous election, as it related to the choice of four candidates. The Age. only within the last week or two, again advocated the indefinite ^postponement of the question. I am not now complaining of this. I think that we have become reconciled in this country to some - extraordinary local and parochial attitudes on the part of the press for its own purposes-whethe r for 'the sake of circulation or with a view to procuring advertisements, or for its own commercial ends in other - directions. We have become inured to this kind of thing, and we as politicians have, I think, almost ceased to feel surprise at such practices on the part of the press. ' I give these instances to show that at the present time this question is - not being looked at in a calm, quiet, unimpassioned way; that the question as to what site within New South Wales is most in the interests of the Commonwealth is - not at the present time being considered in .a calm, impartial manner, apart from local - considerations. It may be that many honourable members are actuated by the fact that the change will involve their travelling from week to week, as I and others have 'had to do for the past seven years, over :great distances. But that is a reason that - should hot affect the mind of any honourable member in effecting a choice of thils kind. I have come to the conclusion, therefore-fro m a conviction that at the present time public opinion is not ripe, is not cool, is not impartial, for the purposes of a choice - that the whole question of a selection should be postponed. And, inasmuch as the State of Victoria has had the benefit-and it has been a very great benefit in the discussing of and voting upon the Tariff-of having the Seat of Government within its 'borders, I suggest that it is a fair and reasonable thing that, in the event of any postponement that is made with a view of a cooler choice in the future, that advantage should be shared by the senior State with Victoria.",40
242,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The honourable member - does not suggest that Our legislation has been for the benefit of Melbourne, or of Victoria ?",41
243,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I say this without any hesitation, and I have submitted a - statement to the House more than once to prove it, that although New South Wales is entitled to a seventh more representation than Victoria by reason of the fact that her population is so much larger, yet, as a matter of fact, Victoria has enjoyed more voting power.than New South Wales. Honourable members will see for themselves that the mere fact of legislation being enacted' in the city of a State from which the representatives come has enabled that State to be more frequently and more conveniently represented.",41
244,Mr JOHNSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,We saw that in connection with the Tariff.,41
245,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"We saw, in connection with the Tariff, that while the representatives of the other States were necessarily following their own occupations, it was impossible for them to attend with the same regularity and with the same convenience to themselves as was the case with the representatives of the State in which the Seat of Government was situated.",41
246,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,Is not that a very good reason for having the Capital established?,41
247,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"A very good reason. I have contended before that it is a great disadvantage to have the Seat of Government fixed in any one city which is the capital of a particular State; and I admit that whatever has been done in Victoria in relation to the press there is a liability of the same thing occurring in any other State. If this disadvantage is to be continued, however, it is not an unfair thing to propose that the most populous city in Australia, the capital of the State which is entitled under the Constitution to provide the territory for the Capital city for the Commonwealth, should have an equal share of the advantage which Victoria has hitherto enjoyed.",41
248,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,The honourable member appeals to the Constitution in one breath and wants to alter it in another.,41
249,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I do not desire to alter the Constitution in any particular direction without giving other honourable members the opportunity, if they like, to seek to alter it in another. It is not for me to claim that the Constitution should be altered in one direction, and to deny to other honourable members the opportunity of proposing its alteration in another. But I must add that I am convinced that this House would never countenance an alteration of the Constitution which had the effect of shifting the Capital from the State in which it is placed under the Constitution. """,41
250,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"If the honourable member tries for Svdnev, I shall trv for Melbourne.",41
251,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The honourable member is at liberty to try for Melbourne, and his threat will not interfere with my moving my amendment. Unquestionably, this country and this House are not in a thoroughly unbiased and impartial condition to make a choice of the Federal Capital - a choice which will have such far-reaching effects upon Australia; and therefore I have conceived the idea - which I believe the Minister of Trade and Customs thought of years ago, although many of us might not have seen an opportunity to put it into practice then-of postponing the choice for a number of years, until Parliament and the people generally are better qualified to determine where the political needs of Australia require the Capital City to be placed. No harm can be done by taking the course that I recommend. But if we make a mistake today in the choice of a Capital, it will be irreparable; because I regard it as inevitable that if Dalgety is chosen-and I believe that it will be chosen, apart from my amendment-it will become for all time the Capital of Australia. No'honourable member can look at the map of Australia, and' see the position of Dalgety, situated away down in the south-east corner of the con* tinent, without feeling that, as time goes on, it must be a very undesirable site from an Australian point of view.",41
252,Mr STORRER,ITEMS COMMON TO,Not from the Tasmanian point of view.,42
253,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Fro m the Victorian or the Tasmanian, or the South Australian, or even the Western Australian point of view, it is equally undesirable. I am ready to confess that ifthere were a railway from Melbourne to Sydney, via the Snowy River and the Snowy Mountains, it might prove to be a very ,desirable alternative route between those two great cities. But all engineering experience and advice go to show that not only would it take years to construct, but that it would involve the expenditure of an immense sum, which I am quite certain the State is not prepared to spend. There has been no attempt on the part of the Premier of Victoria, or of its Ministers, to come forward and say : '' You are now discussing the advisability of choosing this Captial site. We are prepared to construct a railway if you do so."" Twenty years ago I , as Minister of Public Works for New South Wales, in opening the railway to Cooma, made the offer, that if the Government of Victoria would undertake to submit to Parliament a Bill for the construction of a railway from Melbourne to the border in that neighbourhood, I "" would undertake to submit to New South Wales Parliament a Bill to continue the railway from Cooma to the border in order to meet that line. I recognised then, and I recognise now, that some day it may become an alternative route between the two cities which will involve no greater distance, but will pass through some very beautiful country, and no doubt will be a. commercial improvement. But at present there is no indication that that is going to be done. It may be that twelve years hence the prospects of such a consummation may appear nearer than they do at the present time. But if that is the case, and if Victoria chooses to construct her railway, it may be that even in the event of the selection of the site being postponed as I have suggested, the House would come back to that conclusion, and so, after all, in view of the construction of that railway and the facilities for reaching it, we might still choose Dalgety as the best site. I think that Victorian members know that at the present time, and for years to come, in order to reach Dalgety, they would have to travel as far as Goulburn and then go south-east for eight hours from that city, which would be equivalent to travelling from Melbourne to Newcastle'.",42
254,Mr TILLEY BROWN,ITEMS COMMON TO,And to Canberra ?,42
255,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"That .would involve many hours' less travelling, as the honourable member knows.",42
256,Mr TILLEY BROWN,ITEMS COMMON TO,Not manv.,42
257,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"It is an eleven hours', or at the very most twelve hours"" journey, from Melbourne. To reach Dalgety at the present time it would require twenty hours' travelling. It would require two or three hours more than the journey to Sydney. I am speaking not about imaginary things, but about the railway system of New South Wales. It means that every Victorian, every South Austra^lian, and every Tasmanian, would have to travel a distance which is equivalent to travelling from Melbourne to Newcastle in New South Wales. Therefore my proposal only involves this-that if the railway system of Victoria is going to be continued through Gippsland to a point at which it could be reached by the New South Wales railway system, then the twelve years during which I propose to postpone the settlement of this question would give Victorians an opportunity of demonstrating, the feasibility of this choice and the practicability of reaching Dalgety in a very short number of hours.",42
258,Mr COON,ITEMS COMMON TO,Does the honourable member think that Dalgety is not a suitable place?,43
259,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,I think that it is unsuitable at the present time because of the want ot that railway.,43
260,Mr COON,ITEMS COMMON TO,That is why the honourable member is proposing his amendment?,43
261,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"No . I do not think that the members of this House are, at the present time, in a sufficiently unbiased and impartial frame of mind to choose a Capital site irrespective of local influences. I think that the selection should be delayed; for at the present time there is a very strong ' feeling of local jealousy between Victoria and New South Wales. I am not saying justly or unjustly, but, at the present time there is in the senior State of Australia a feeling that Victoria has enjoyed an undue number of advantages over New South Wales, quite apart from the presence of the Parliament. One might almost say that the bearings of the Commonwealth are "" heated,"" and 1 think it is our duty to take a step, which will have the effect of allowing things to cool down and so of giving us a proper perspective with regard to this question. I think that the postponement of a selection for some years to come will secure that. It may be that at the end of twelve years we shall remain of the same opinion, especially if , as has been suggested, Victoria is ready to construct this railway to the border. I confess that in many respects Dalgety has many advantages ; and if the Parliament, as I apprehended at the beginning of Federation, were going to sit for about three months in the summer, I should say that it is a climate which would be most enviable for the purpose. But we have drifted into sessions of six, seven, and sometimes eight - months; and while the two Tariffs were under consideration we sat for ten or eleven months in the year. whole outlook is altered in . that respect, and there is no indication, as I anticipate there may be at some time or - other, that the Victorian Government will make a railway to the border from Melbourne, so as to make the site accessible. Without, therefore, giving up my right to - even vote for Dalgety at some future time, in the light of the developments of our railway system, I hold that at the present time we are not in a calm and impartial frame of mind to make a choice. That is my reason for moving this amendment. Victorian politicians would not suffer in any way by the postponement, because the journey to Sydney would, as I have shown, take three hours less than the journey to Dalgety. That argument also applies to Tasmania and South Australia. It would give New South Wales members for ten years the advantage of not having to travel, which the Victorian representatives have already enjoyed. It would give to Queenslanders the advantage of not having to travel so far. But it would be less disadvantageous to every State in Australia to put the Capital in Sydney for that limited time. I move That all the words after the word "" That "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :- "" in view of the wide difference of opinion in regard to the most suitable site for an Australian Federal Capital, the final choice be. postponed until the year 1921, and that the Government shall forthwith prepare and introduce into Parliament a Bill providing f b r an alteration of the Constitution by which the city of Melbourne shall remain as the Seat of Government until the end of the year 1910, and that from the beginning of 1911 until the end of 1920 the Seat of Government shall be fixed in the city of Sydney, pending the final and permanent selection of a site for the Commonwealth Capital and Seat of Government, in accordance with the terms of the Constitution."" I want to assure the House that I am moving this amendment with the utmost impartiality. It is not done with the desire to benefit Sydney or New South Wales; because, just as I have stood nearly eight years of travelling between Sydney and Melbourne, without any serious inconvenience to myself mentally or bodily, I am prepared to go on. I want honourable members to believe that T am not asking the representatives of either State to embark on any increased inconvenience in taking this course. As I have pointed out, the Victorian members would save time as compared with travelling to Dalgety. Instead The of going to a place which, apart from the public buildings in which we shall do our work, would be by no means comfortable or interesting, they could go to one of the largest cities in the Commonwealth, and have an opportunity of learning, not only by experience, but in many other ways, the inconveniences which representatives from the other States have had to undergo in travelling to the Seat of Government. So far, the Victorians have not had the experience, because, as honourable members know, a Victorian can follow his avocation, whether it be commerce or a profession, until 4 o'clock, when he can walk up to the House and take part in the business of Parliament.",43
262,Mr STORRER,ITEMS COMMON TO,Onl y those residing in Melbourne.,44
263,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I admit that some representatives of Victoria are as much inconvenienced as even those who come from the nearer States. But it has been a very great advantage, and the honourable member knows that representatives of Melbourne proper form a very substantial portion of the representatives of Victoria. I am, as I have said, submitting this amendment without any desire to give an advantage to either Sydney or New South Wales. I am acting in the interests of the Commonwealth; because I believe that Parliament is about to make a mistake, in the light of present knowledge with regard to the advantages of Dalgetv.",44
264,Mr JH CATTS,ITEMS COMMON TO,Does the honourable member think that a majority of the people of the other States would vote for such an alteration of the Constitution ?,44
265,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Of course, one can never tell what the people will do, but I should be very hopeful that they would, especially after having had the advantage of hearing the eloquence of those members of the House who had voted for the amendment. I do not want to dwell upon the matter, because there are advantages to all the States-the advantage of less travelling and the advantage of postponing a decision on the most far-reaching and most important question which has ever been submitted to this Parliament- a decision that we could not alter afterwards. I do not want in anv way to speak in a depreciatory sense of Dalgety, because I know that it has manv natural advantages, and I believe that bvand-by, if a railway to the border were con- way. structed by Victoria, and a connection with the coast made, it might become one of the most interesting and suitable places in the Commonwealth. But at the present time we have no indication or suggestion from the powers that be that they are prepared to do what I invited them to do twenty.. vears ago; we are no nearer. It is general information that the cost of such a railwav would be from ,£1,500,000 to ,£2,000,000.",44
266,Mr KNOX,ITEMS COMMON TO,Where from ?,44
267,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Fro m Bairnsdale to the border. I am sneaking of the estimates which were made when Mr. Oliver entered upon his examination of the scheme, and I believe that estimates obtained since go to show that the line would? cost at least £1,500,000.",44
268,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,The Victorian RailwaysCommittee has had referred to it a proposal to carry the line a good distance further.,44
269,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The honourable member knows that the consideration of such proposals may mean nothing. If the people or the Government of Victoria had agreed that it would be an advantage to that State that the Capital site should beat Dalgety, it would be the easiest thing i h the world to intimate that if that sitewere chosen they were leady to submit a proposal to .Parliament for the construction, of the line referred to. Such an announcement would tend-and I have no doubt that"" the honourable member for Gippsland .isaware of this-to make the site popular.",44
270,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The line has been submitted to Parliament, and the proposal to carry the line 200 miles further thanBairnsdale. bas been referred to the Railways Committee.",44
271,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,That would not take the line to the border.,44
272,Mr GROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,It would take it so muchnearer to the border.,44
273,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,I recognise that a line cannot be carried 200 miles further than Bairnsdale without carrying it so muchnearer to the border; but the question iswhether there is any real intention to con- struct such a railway. The postponement of the question for ten years would not prevent the choice of Dalgety as a site.,44
274,Mr STORRER,ITEMS COMMON TO,We understand that theNew South Wales people desire the question to be settled.',44
275,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"But not in that Would the honourable member for Bass, if he were a resident of New South Wales, consider Dalgety a fair choice?",44
276,Mr STORRER,ITEMS COMMON TO,Yes .,44
277,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Does the honourable member say that in face of the arrangement entered into by the Premiers, representing the people?' The honourable member must not adopt the idea that anagreement, signed by the Premiers, was merely binding on the Premiers; they werethe representatives of the different States.",44
278,Mr HUTCHISON,ITEMS COMMON TO,For the time being.,44
279,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"If the honourable member entered into a contract, as therepresentative of other people, would he beat liberty a week thence to say that he their representative only for the time being ?",44
280,Mr HUTCHISON,ITEMS COMMON TO,The people were not told anything about the arrangement.,45
281,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"That may But I would point out that the Premiers <lealt witli much more important matters, they having authority to agree on proposed .alterations of the Constitution.",45
282,Mr HUTCHISON,ITEMS COMMON TO,"But the people were - to vote on the Constitution afterwards, - though not 'on this agreement.",45
283,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Of course, the agreement was not put into the Constitube tion j but the honourable member will not Sdeny that there was a moral undertaking the part of the people through their reprechoosing sentatives.",45
284,Mr HUTCHISON,ITEMS COMMON TO,I do not see that.,45
285,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I do not hold the honourable member to the agreement, only point out that we have been asked to pay regard to much less binding agreethat ments. Over and over again, we have heard it urged on behalf of Western Australia that the people of the eastern States - are bound by an "" understanding "" entered into in regard to the transcontinental way.",45
286,Mr HUTCHISON,ITEMS COMMON TO,I should not recognise that understanding.,45
287,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,Then I can - only say that my standard of political ment. morality and that of the honourable member do not agree. Mr HUTCHISO'N - There is no morality in question.,45
288,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I do not desire to say anything unpleasant; but the right - honourable member for Swan has said, over and over again, that, when the Constitution was proposed, there was an. understanding that the eastern States should, as soon possible, connect the west with the east, in order to completely realise the Federal idea; and that has been cited as a reason .why the people of the east should bind themselves to the construction of a line. If I were satisfied that there was such clear understanding in the minds of people of Western Australia, it would an argument, though I do not say a binding or conclusive argument with me, with reus gard to the construction of a railway; if that be so. a fortiori, the agreement 'black and white entered into by the was Premiers as .the representatives of the people, as to the Federal Capital, is an argument.",45
289,Mr HUTCHISON,ITEMS COMMON TO,"That agreement was never seen by the people. be. Mr Bruce SMITH - I admit that. I do not say that the agreement is conclusive; but it is a potent factor. In any case, I point out that the postponement of the question does not mean the abandonment or even jeopardize the chance of Dalgety. If that site comes into greater prominence by reason of the possibility or practicability of the construction of a railway through Gippsland, thai its choice will all the more easy in the future. If we find by-and-by that the sessions become on shorter, that will be another reason for Dalgety, on the ground that we shall be there only during the summer, and assured of a cool climate.",45
290,Mr STORRER,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Then , the honourable member will ignore the decision of Parbut liament four years ago?",45
291,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I do not regard as a final decision. I have no desire to raise any very recondite constitutional points with the honourable member; but he may remember that, as far back as 1902, I railtook exception to the Seat of Government Bill then before us, on the ground that this Parliament is incompetent to make a choice until the territory has first either been acquired by the Federal Government, or ceded by the New South Wales Govern",45
292,Mr ROBERTS,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Is that the honourable member's definite position on the subject ? ' Mr Bruce SMITH - I contend that until the Commonwealth has either acquired the land or the land has been ceded to us by New Soutli Wales, the High Court will hold that we are incompetent to actually select a site. Of course, the Commonwealth is quite competent to acquire land for the purpose, because it is not necessary, under as the Constitution, that New South Wales shall consent to any particular site. If the Federal Parliament chooses to pass an Act, and resume any particular land, it is quite at liberty to do so-it is quite as much at liberty tofixthe site on acquired territory a as on territory placed at its disposal, by the New South Wales. But neither step has be been taken; and I desire honourable members to notice that the Bill before us takes no further than the previous . Bill ; it and, merely seeks to make the choice ""more in certain."" We cannot make an Act ""more certain "" by merely passing a second Act of the same effect; and, in. any case, the land must be acquired ox granted before effect is given to the Bill.",45
293,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,Why have the people changed their minds in regard to the ioo miles radius from Sydney?,46
294,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I do not know; but Parliament does change its mind, and very frequently repeals laws which it has previously passed. As many as 600 Acts of Parliament in the reign of Queen Victoria were repealed before she had been twenty-five years on the Throne.",46
295,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,The Federal Convention rejected the idea that the site should be near Sydney.,46
296,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,Parliament constantly contradicting itself by repealing Acts passed in previous sessions. Why is this Bill submitted? Is it not in order to induce the House to say again what it said some years ago? Why is it considered necessary to ask honourable members whether they still hold the same opinion?,46
297,Unknown,ITEMS COMMON TO,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m.,46
298,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"When the House adjourned for dinner, I had practically completed my speech, with the exception of one or two observations in the nature of a summary. The personnel of the House changes from time to time, and one is sometimes involved in repetitions in which, with a continuous audience, one would not indulge. In the course of my speech, some observations were made in the character of an inquiry as to what would be done by the people of Sydney to accommodate this Parliament, in the event of the Seat of Government being removed for a period to that city. I can only say, in answer, that the House might very well depend upon the people of Sydney to do justice to the occasion and the requirements. I am sure that in' the event of the Seat of Government being removed to Sydney, the people of New South Wales would feel sufficiently honoured to make a great effort to equal, if not to surpass, the very great liberality which has characterized the Parliament of Victoria in accommodating the Federal Legislature here. I wish to assure the House, in conclusion-and I hope my past in this Parliament will entitle me to do so-that in taking this step, whicE is a diversion from 'the subject of debate that has occupied the House for some days, my object is not in any wav to frustrate the choice by the Federal Parliament of a Capital site which is not favourable to New South Wales. I think, as I have said, that the time is not ripe for the taking of so far-reaching a step. I have no feeling against Dalgety. I consider that under altered conditions, it would be in many respects an admirable site. But those conditions have not arisen. They may arise within the next ten or twelve years, and my desire is not tp advocate any other site as preferable to it, but merely in the first place to lead to the postponement of a final Ghoice under present conditions, and, in some way, to remove from the minds of the New South Wales people the idea that the represenis tatives of Victoria have endeavoured to dominate the Commonwealth power. 5* wish further to give an opportunity in the future, under altered conditions, for a riper decision. I have pointed out, and point out again, that if Dalgety continues to enjoy the advantages that it is supposed to enjoy today, or if - it increases them, there will still be an opportunity to .select it for the purpose for which many honourable members desire to choose it now. I trust that the House will accept this assurance from me, and believe that my only desire is to induce the Parliament to hesitate to take a step which, to my mind, is premature, and may be taken possibly with greater justice and effect some twelve years hence. . I therefore beg to move the amendment of which I have given noticeThat all the words after the word ""That"" - be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words : - "" In view of the wide difference of opinion in regard to the most suitable site for an Australian Federal Capital, the final choice be postponed until the year 1921, and that the Government shall forthwith prepare and introduce into Parliament a Bill providing for an alteration of the Constitution by which the city of Melbourne shall remain as the Seat of Government until the end of the year 1910, and that from the beginning of i g n until the end of IQ20 the Seat of Government shall be fixed in the city of Svdney, pending the final and permanent selection of a site foT the Commonwealth Capital and Seat of Government, in accordance with the terms of the Constitution.""",46
299,Mr SPEAKER,ITEMS COMMON TO,"At first sight it would seem that the objection which I took just now to the amendment indicated by the honourable member for Indi might be taken to this. It appears to me, however, that whereas the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Indi dealt simply with an alternative site, and did not go to the root of the purpose of the Bill, the amendment now proposed by the honourable member fox Parkes deals not with rival sites, but with a rival scheme for the whole settlement of the question.",46
300,Mr TILLEY BROWN,ITEMS COMMON TO,"So did mine, sir.",47
301,Mr SPEAKER,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The honourable member's proposal dealt with a purely alternative site. In the case of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parkes, however, there is no question of alternative sites. What is proposed is a radical change of the whole method of dealing with the Seat of Government, and I therefore feel bound to accept the amendment, provided that it be seconded.  amendment.",47
302,Mr WISE,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Gippsland) [7.50] - It appears to me that much of the discussion to which we have listened has beep quite beside the question. This is a Bill, not to select a site, but to more definitely define the site already selected by this House. This question was discussed, in the first place, in 1902, when the House of Representatives selected Tumut, and another place, Bombala. It was again discussed in 1904, when both Houses agreed to the selection of Dalgety, and the Bill passed. We are now asked merely to more definitely define that site. When the selection was made there was a fair fight to a finish, and the right honourable member for East Sydney then said I accept that decision as not brought about, as some other position might have been, by any unfair means, but as a fair and honest expression of the views of the majority. The decision is much against my own views, but I have at least the satisfaction of feeling that the selection which has been' made does represent the honest conviction of the majority of the members of this House. As the Minister of Trade and Customs has pointed out, the right honourable member, at a later stage, said that, so far as he' was concerned, any proposal to rescind that decision would meet with his strongest opposition. We are asked now to re-open the question of sites. There seems to be only two reasons for that request: The one is to allow us to consider for the first time the claims of Canberra, and the other to enable representatives of New South Wales to level a charge against the representatives of other States, and particularly those of Victoria, of wanting to commit a breach of faith in not carrying out the spirit as well as the letter of the bond contained in the Constitution. That charge is new made practically for the first time. In 1904, the question of "" reasonable distance '' was merely mentioned by the honourable member for North Sydney, and it was not till last year that 'the charge of bieach of faith which arises out of it, and which has been repeated again this session, was made. The argument in support of that charge is based on the agreement alleged to have been entered into by the Premiers at the Conference at-the beginning of 1899. That agreement appears in the memorandum which the Premiers drew up. I know that these matters have been mentioned before, but since the charge has been repeated, it is just as well that we should consider the actual facts. The Premiers saidIt is considered that the fixing of the Site of Capital is a question which might be left to the Parliament to decide; but, in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South Wales, the Premiers have modified the clause, so that, while the Capital cannot be fixed at Sydney or in its neighbourhood, provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales at a reasonable distance from that city, and the Premiers have therefore agreed that in lieu of the original clause the following clause shall be substituted. The first point that one notices in regard to this agreement is that it is in the nature of a prohibition. The words used are not within a reasonable distance "" of "" Sydney, but at a reasonable distance "" from "" Sydney. The Premiers then proceeded to state what that meant. That statement was followed by the words which were embodied in the Constitution, and were their own drafting, and not that of some one who might be saidto have misunderstood or wrongly carried out what they intendedThe Seat of Government shall be determined by the Parliament and shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth, and if New South Wales be an original State shall be in that State, and be distant not less than 100 miles from Sydney. If it was intended by the use of the words ""at a reasonable distance from Sydney,"" that a site should be selected as near Sydney as the 100-miles limit would allow, it seems to me that the Premiers would have fixed not only a minimum but a maximum. They would have said, "" Not less than 100 miles, but as near fhat limit as possible,"" or "" Not less than 100 miles or more than 150 miles from Sydney."" Instead of doing so, however, they simply made the prohibition that we should not select a site within ioo miles of Sydney. That is the interpretation they placed upon what they said the agreement was. We must remember that the Constitution, as first framed, gave to the Federal Parliament an absolutely free choice in respect of all Australia. That was acceptedunpopular as it was supposed to be-by a majority of those who voted at the New South Wales referendum. Why that referendum was ineffective it is unnecessary to repeat. We all know the reason, and it is not a matter that can be dealt with without making a charge of breach of faith. Then we had a meeting of the Premiers and the Constitution was amended. The original Constitution, we must not forget, was drawn up by delegates elected by the people to prepare such a document, whereas the amendment was prepared by Premiers who, as Premiers, might be said to represent the States for which they spoke, but who had no mandate from the people to prepare any amendment of the Constitution. Their agreement, therefore, was valueless until accepted by the people, and what the people of Australia accepted - wha t they voted on - was not the paragraph in the Premiers' memorandum as to a reasonable distance, but a clause which provided that the Capital should be ""not less than ioo miles from Sydney."" That is the whole point. It is interesting to note what was the meaning placed on that provision by the public men at the time. The honourable member for Nepean the other night quoted from a speech by Dr Nash, in which he referred to the words of Mr - no w Mr Justice-Barto n and the right honourable member for East Sydney, immediately after the Premiers' Conference. In neither case was anything said that would justify the charge that there was any bond or any spirit in the bond that the Capital should be close to the 100-miles limit. Mr Barton said it would be their duty to see that the Capital was not placed too remotely from either Sydney or Melbourne. He certainly would not have said that, if it had been intended that the Capital should be as close as possible to the 100-miles limit. Then the right honourable member for East Sydney saidIn my opinion, if I may give it for anything it is worth, the Federal Capital, although in a country district, will be as near as possible to the ioo-miles limit. Mr Wise. On the day following that on which the Premiers'' memorandum was first published in the press, there appeared in the Age a telegram from its Albury correspondent to this effectThe determination that the site of the Federal Capital shall be in New South Wales with a reservation that it must be situated not less than ioo miles from Sydney, is regarded as largely increasing the prospects of the selection of Albury. They did not think that Albury would be debarred by the new clause. The people of Albury thought, as did every one in Victoria, that any place in New South Wales that was not less than ioo miles from Sydney was open to selection without any charge of breach of faith. It is still more interesting to note that a meeting of the Albury Federal Capital League was immediately called, and that the right honourable member for East Sydney, when returning to Sydney from the Premiers' Conference, was waylaid at Albury and interviewed on the result of the Conference. In the Age of the 4th of February appeared the following from its Albury correspondentBefore Mr Reid was permitted to resume his midnight journey he was pressed to unbosom himself about the question which to the good townsfolk of Albury for the moment dwarfs all other questions, viz. :-Where is the Federal Capital to be located? ""What of the Federal Capital""? Mr Reid was asked. "" Did n ' t I get it settled in New South Wales? What more could I do? I suppose you Albury people wanted me to fix it right off for Albury ?"" "" I do not know that there would be any strong local objections to that. But what do you think of Albury's prospects now?"" "" Don't ask me that. I should say we'll have it as near Sydney as we can get it. Ysu may depend upon that. Don't ask a Sydney man to give you the Capital at Albury. It isn't human nature."" "" Don't you think Victoria and South Australia will support Albury?"" "" Oh, you can ask them to support youthey'll probably do it-bu t don't ask any Sydney man. It is too much to ask ordinary mortals. They can't have it in Sydney or less than ioo miles from there, but you may depend upon it they'll have it as near Sydney as they can get it. That means that it will be probably somewhere about Goulburn."" If he had thought that the agreement was that the Federal, Capital should be located as nearly as possible to the 100-miles limit, the right honourable member would not have answered the Albury people in that way. He would have said, "" Albury cannot be chosen as the Capital site, because the Capital must be as near to the 100-miles limit as possible."" Just previous to the holding of the second referendum in Victoria, the Age and Argus published papers explanatory of the proposed amendments of the Constitution, for the guidance of the electors. The explanations published by the Argus were prepared by the honourable member for Bendigo, who said nothing about an agreement to have the Capital within a reasonable distance of Sydney. What he said wasThe amendment first in interest if not in importance is that relating to the site of the future Capital of the Commonwealth. the ]3ill as framed by the Convention it is provided that the Seat of Government should be determined by the Federal Parliament, and that it should be within Federal territory. amendment now proposed is that the Seat of Government should be in New South Wales, and be distant not less than ioo miles from Sydney. In all probability, if the matter had been left in the hands of the Federal Parliament, the Capital would have been fixed somewhere in New Soulh Wales; her strong claim, founded on seniority and the vast and suitable territory available for such a purpose would have told in her favour. The memorandum published by the Age was prepared by Mr now Mr Justice, Isaacs and Mr Mackey, now Minister of Lands in Victoria, and contained this statement on the subjectWith regard to the site of the Capital the Federal Parliament was previously unrestricted in its choice, provided the place selected was within territory vested in the Commonwealth. By the amendment the Parliament is limited to a selection within New South Wales, at a distance of at least 100 miles from Sydney. . . . The compact made must and will be honourably adhered to, and there will, it is hoped and believed, be not a moment's unnecessary delay in the fulfilment of the intention of the parties in arriving at the agreement. But in making the concession sentiment has already had full given to it, and it will be the manifest duty of the Parliament w.ithin the limit assigned to it, to select, as the Seat of Government, whatever site it considers most in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. It was upon those explanations, which were supported by the public speeches made at the time, that the people of Victoria voted. Later on, the See Government of New South Wales authorized a Commissioner to report on eligible sites, and he recommended, first, a Southern Monaro site, and, secondly, a site near Yass or one near Lyndhurst.",47
303,Mr SAMPSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,"If there were anything in the contention, it should have been raised then.",49
304,Mr WISE,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Yes , and it would have been raised. The Commissioner would have been told to confine his report to places as near to the 100-miles limit as possible. As a matter of fact, he had a free run of the whole State outside the 100-miles limit. Furthermore, the State Government offered the three recommended sites to the Federal Government, reserving the Crown lands round about them from further alienation. The matter was first dealt with in this chamber in 1902, when five of the six gentlemen who had formed the Premiers' Conference were members. Of them, the right honourable member for Under Swan and the late Mr C. C. Kingston voted for Bombala, while Sir George Turner voted for Tumut, all three ignoring The the alleged compact, while the right honourable member for East Sydney, who was present, said nothing about a breach of faith. That circumstance shows that they did not consider themselves bound to select a site as near to the 100-miles limit as they could get one. It is impossible to think that any one of them would have broken a compact to which he was a party, or that the right honourable member for East Sydney would have allowed him to do so without challenge.",49
305,Mr THOMAS BROWN,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Why was the 200-miles limit, which was proposed by Sir George Turner, not agreed to by the Premiers?",49
306,Mr WISE,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Because they thought the 100-miles limit sufficient. If it had been intended that the Capital should be as close to Sydney as possible, the agreement would have said that it should be not less than 100 miles, nor more, say, than 200 miles, from Sydney. The matter was weight discussed again in this chamber in 1904, and then the idea that the Capital should be near to the 100-miles limit was suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney. But the right honourable member for Swan and Sir George Turner voted for Dalgety, and, according to the Minister of Trade and Customs, the late Mr C. C. Kingston paired by telegram for that site. Again there was no protest from the right honourable member for East Sydney. If further evidence that there never was the agreement which has been mentioned be necessary, I would add that the Lyndhurst site is 191 miles, ancl the Canberra site 204 miles from Sydney, and yet those who support the contention against which I am arguing are in favour of one of those sites being chosen. Furthermore, neither the Lyndhurst, Yass, nor Tumut site, which have been offered to us by the present New South Wales Government, is within a reasonable distance of Sydney. Last week a Sydney newspaper was circulated amongst honourable members, in which there is an article referring to the-offer of these sites. The writer of that article saysOf these Tumut foils more than Dalgety to complv with the limitation of section 125 as to distance from Sydney, as well as in other rei pec Is. Referring to Canberra, of whose beauties and advantages we have lately heard so much, the writer says- ' An effort is being made behind the back of the Slate Parliament to secure the selection of a ,ile on the Canberra area. The most meagre information has been published about it, nothing indeed to justify the choice. Like Dalgety^ this place is in an isolated corner of the Commonwealth, not by any means central or equidistant from the Capitals of the respective States, and there is an effort to justify the - election as a "" Compromise between Sydney ind Melbourne."" But where does compromise :ome in ? Are these two cities the only great :entres of population in the Commonwealth that ill others should be discarded for their convenience, or are Victoria and New South Wales the only States in the Federal Union that are *o be considered ? We are told that we should vote for Canberra as a compromise. I cannot understand the offer of a compromise where a breach of faith is alleged. Were I a New South Wales representative who thought that a breach of faith was being committed, I should not allow a compromise, and should stand out for the fulfilment of the spirit of the bond. It is unnecessary, after the able speech of the Minister of Trade and Customs, to go into the merits of the sites. It was refreshing to hear a member of the direct Opposition this evening admit that Dalgety had merits, and that it might, in ':leven or twelve years, become a suitable site. Some peculiar figures have been given as to its distance from Sydney and Melbourne. According to the Commissioners appointed by the Federal Government, Dal2;ety is, as the crow flies, 228 miles from Sydney and 240 from Melbourne. Dalgety is therefore as nearly as possible equi-distant from the capitals of New South Wales and Victoria. We have been told that its selection : .s supported by .Victorians because it is near the border of this State, yet those who say that tell us at the same time that ; ts position is isolated, and that it will - iot be accessible by rail direct from Melbourne for many years to come. orable member for Nepean, although he Mr Wise. had to admit that he had never seen the country, spoke of it as terrible country to get through. Honourable members seem not to be aware that the Premier of this State has promised to ask the Victorian Parliament to authorize the construction of a railway from Bairnsdale to the border during the present session of that Parliament. Several surveys have recently been undertaken by the Victorian Railway Department, and three routes from Orbost have been suggested. No. i runs up towards Bonang, through country over which it would be expensive to take a railway, and where it 'is said that none but a narrow-gauge line could be made, except at great cost. Number 2 route which has found favour with many of the settlers is projected by way of Murrungowar and Mount Ellery. It is said to be rather an expensive! route, and only a narrow-gauge line is practicable. There are two other routes, both of which go up the Cann Valley, coming out in New South Wales near Bondi, about seventeen miles lower down than Bombala. Number 3 route represents an attempt to get into the Cann Valley by a direct line. It strikes'past Club Terrace, and from an engineering point of view is preferable to the other routes described. It would permit of a broad-gauge line with fairly sharp curves and fairly steep grades. The highest elevation crossed is 1,600 feet, the total length from Bairnsdale to the border 141^ miles, and the estimated cost of construction £ 7 , 0 0 0 per mile. The line finally decided on from Orbost goes by way of Mario and Sydenham Inlet. Thence it follows the Little River, crossing over the watershed into the Cann, and reaching the border near Bondi in about 142 miles. It is estimated to cost £ 5 , 7 5 0 per mile.",49
307,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,What is the estimated cost to the border?,50
308,Mr WISE,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The total cost of 142 miles at £ 5 , 7 5 0 per mile would be about £ 8 1 6 , 0 0 0 . The facts which I have just given are taken from the reports made by engineers for the Victorian Railways Standing Committee.",50
309,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,Is any estimate given of the time which the line would take to build?,50
310,Mr WISE,ITEMS COMMON TO,"It would not take very long. The distance from Bairnsdale to Orbost is 60 or 70 miles, and neither that part nor the part from there to the beginThe hon- ning of the Cann Valley would present much difficulty. It is only when one gets into the valley that the ground begins to rise, and even the gradient up the valley is not very steep. The only difference between route No. 3 and route No. 4 is that instead of going from Orbost direct through Murrungowar into the Cann Valley, the line would run round by the coast, and then turn up to miss the hills. Consequently the argument about the impossibility of constructing a railway through Victoria to the Dalgety site has no weight. In addition, a surveyor, resident in the district, waited last vear upon the Minister of Customs and myself, and showed us a plan of the country with a route marked on it which he said was practicable for a broad gauge line at no great expense, running from Bruthen through Buchan on to Bonang, and thence into New South Wales at Delegate. He stated that that line would be from 30 to 35 miles shorter than a line by Orbost. Mr. HALL - Coul d not those railway engineers upon whom the honourable member relies have discovered that?",50
311,Mr WISE,ITEMS COMMON TO,"They could if they had gone by that route, but their investigation was confined to a route through Orbost, the big town in that part of the district, and that took them away towards the coast. The idea was that the line was to be made first to Orbost, where the largest settlement was, and then an outlet to New South Wales could be sought. They were not looking for the most direct route to Dalgety. That gentleman attended to give evidence with regard to the direct route to Dalgety before the 'Railways Standing Committee, and pointed out its advantages in giving a shorter journey to the Federal Capital, but the Committee said that they had nothing to do with the Federal Capital in the matter, and had only to consider the question of a railway through Eastern Gippsland. There is no railway difficulty in the matter at all, and if the Capital is finally located at Dalgety, it will not be long before Victoria puts a railway through to it. Apart altogether from the Capital site question, the people nt Buchan and in the surrounding district have for years been agitating for railway extension, and as the whole of Eastern Gippsland is about the most neglected part of Victoria in that respect, I do not think that railway extensions c'an be denied fo the people there much longer.",51
312,Mr STORRER,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The same as southern New South Wales. Mr Wise.^Yes, the Monaro district has been denied a railway for years, and yet, as the Minister of Customs stated last week, almost all the recent Governments in New South Wales have pledged themselves to extend the railway from Cooma. A Bill actually passed the Legislative Assembly in the last Parliament, but was lost in the Council, providing for an extension of the Cooma railway to Bombala. Nearly - every independent visitor to the locality, and every expert, from Mr. Oliver, the New South Wales Commissioner, downwards, has spoken highly as to the suitability of Dalgety for the - Federal Capital, ancl now its advantages and attractions have been admitted by the honourable member for Parkes. With Twofold Bay, it seems to comply with every reasonable requirement of a 'Capital. It also complies with one of the conditions which the honourable member for North Sydney regarded as indispensable in connection with a Capital site-that it should be on a line that would form a main line between Melbourne and Sydney. That is what would happen if Dalgetv were made the Capital. As to its being a bleak place, the honourable member for North Sydney, who spoke the other night about its want of attractiveness, made the following statements in a speech in this House in 1904We must, however, remember that Australia is a new country, and that the beauties which we admire in other lands are not always-in deed, are not often-du e to purely natural features. Many Of the most famous beauty spots have been the creation of centuries; and many parts of New South Wales, which look very unpicturesque at the present time, will, in the course of a generation or two, become very different in character, and will possess some of those scenic beauties which are to be met with i in older lands. For instance, take England itself. I suppose that it would be possible to find thousands of splendid places for a Capital City in England. But the natural features of that country-that is, the formation of the ground-ar e not grand, are not imposing, speaking generally. I think I am correct in saying that there is not a mountain in the British Isles over 5,000 feet in height. There are very few mountains approaching that altitude. There are no great natural features in the shape of large rivers such as there are in the United States. But cultivation, the growth of trees and hedges, the construction of buildings, and improvements made by one, generation here, and by another generation there, have created many of those beautv spots in England which most attract the visitor to that country. We in Australia can, by the same means, turn many situations which are now not at all picturesque into sites which vears hence will display many of the beauties which prove an attraction in older countries. Therefore, scenic beauties, and the presence of grand natural features, have not so much influence upon my mind as they seem to have upon the minds of many honourable members - And after all, we have to remember that we are a Federal Parliament, and that our public Departments are created for business purposes-to perform important services for the community. Consequently, any fault that Dalgety may have on the ground of bleakness or absence of trees, can easily be cured. The question of the Federal Capital will be with us, as it was in the United States and in Canada, a vexatious and irritating one until it is settled, but once we determine to adhere to a site, the irritation will cease. I am satisfied that if this House shows that it is not variable, and that it is not likely to change its mind from its two previous decisions in favour of the southern Monaro site, it will be found that the present friction in New South Wales will die away, that the New South, Wales Government and Parliament will accept our decision, and will probably meet us in the same fair spirit as was shown by the late Sir John See after the Federation was inaugurated. If , on the other hand, we change our minds now, or defer the settlement of the question, the irritation will continue, and we shall be open to the charge of wanting to keep the Seat of Government in Melbourne longer than it should be. I have aJways said that one of the terms upon which Federation was entered into was that the Seat of Government should be in New South Wales, and it is our duty to select a site, and establish the Government there as soon as possible. That this has not been done before cannot be laid to the blame of the Federal Parliament. It is due to the action of the New South Wales Government in refusing to give us a site, or to treat with us in any way for the one that this Parliament selected. If we again select Dalgety, I am satisfied that we shall be carrying out in every way, not only the letter, but also the spirit of the bond.",51
313,Mr LIVINGSTON,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Barker) [8.25] I am not like the honourable member for Gippsland. because when before my constitutents I said I was dead against any bush Capital, and I am still of the same opinion. I cannot see why the people of Australia should not be allowed to choose their own Capital. It is argued that it would be necessary to amend the Constitution to bring that about. But we have altered it to change the time of the general elections, and it could be amended in this way just as easily. ' It is argued that we need to make the Capital the front door to Australia, but where could there befound a finer front door to Australia than Sydney Harbor-on e of the finest in the world, and with some of the finest country on which to build a Capital not far from Sydney, if that is ever wanted, and I do not think it will be. If we chose Melbourne, we should have here a city already built, and Houses of Parliament fit to legislate in for the next hundred years.",52
314,Mr STORRER,ITEMS COMMON TO,Where should we get the Federal territory?,52
315,Mr LIVINGSTON,ITEMS COMMON TO,"What do we want a Federal territory for? One would think that we were going to make millions of pounds out of it. If by building a Capital we could bring in a lot of money for the people of Australia, I could understand it, but if we spent several millions of pounds on it, we should not get a shilling's worth of return from it. It would be better tospend the money in developing the Northern Territory, from which we should get a big income in the next ten years; and, having done that, we could tell the people of Australia that we had money to build the Capital with. But, at present, we have not a shilling to spend on a Federal Capital. We are not going to build it with galvanized iron. If it is built at all, it should be built properly, to last for centuries.",52
316,Mr HUTCHISON,ITEMS COMMON TO,What would it cost to build it in Sydney ?,52
317,Mr LIVINGSTON,ITEMS COMMON TO,"We should not want to build it in Sydney. When Federation was inaugurated, it was stated that the cost of government would be lessened, but practically nothing has been done in that direction. We have too many Parliamentsand too many Governments, and are doing, nothing to lessen the cost of them, although a little has been done in South Australia to that end. It is time we turned our attention to developing Australia, instead of going on with a Capital .site scheme. No country in the world will pay for developing as much as Australia will. We cannot get the people away from the seaboard until we push our railways out. I do not want to say anything about Dalgety. Somuch' has been said for and against it that I shall be sorry if it gets into the newspapers on the other side of the world, for it will make people think that Australia is abad coun try. to go to. One South Australiansaid that Dalgety was a splendid country to live out of. The only advantage hecould see about it was that it had plenty of granite with which to build tombstones for legislators. That is not the sort of country to put the Capital in. The honto orable member for Parkes has put forward a scheme that would be acceptable to many people, and I am sure that if a vote were taken tomorrow, judging from my own in constituency, very few would vote for havhas ing a Federal Capital at all. The public are dead against it , and I think rightly so. For four States, at least, it would be much better not to have a "" bush"" Capital. It has been urged that if we establish a "" b u s h "" Capital, we shall get away from the influence of the big daily newspapers. Do honourable members imagine that those newspapers will not follow us to the persites. manent Seat of Government? It be a very bad thing for Australia if they - did not, and if they could not speak freely, inespective of whether this Parliament located in &. "" bush "" Capital, or any Capital. We shall always be safe whilst the press is in a position to criticise our actions freely. I shall be no party to deavouring to escape from press influence. pThe freedom of the press is synonymous with the freedom of the people. Whatever we may do, I trust that we shall not select the permanent Seat of Government until will of the people upon this question been ascertained by means of a referen- , claims of further rival sites. dum. I hope that the amendment of honourable member for Parkes will be carried.",52
318,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [8.32] - I cannot see my way into view. to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Parkes. What is its object? Its object, avowedly, is to continue of Government in Melbourne until the end of 1910, and, thereafter for a period of ten years to establish it in Sydney, also permit the people of the Commonwealth, during that interval, to make up their minds where in New South Wales the manent Seat of Government shall be'Iocated.",53
319,Mr WILKS,ITEMS COMMON TO,It also proposes an amendment of the Constitution.,53
320,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"But the object of amend that ing the Constitution is merely to allow effect to be given to these proposals. I presume that the idea of the honourable memsite ber for Parkes is that the provision which prevents the establishment the Capital within 100 miles of Sydney shall be retained- My own opinion that the sooner we face, and definitely determine, this question the better it will be for Australia as a whole. For almost ten years repeated attempts have been made deal with it . It is not correct to say that we have trifled with the matter. The Parliament, and the present Government, have attempted to deal with it seriously, and endeavouring to do justice, its settlement been delayed out of respect to the feelings and opinions of New South Wales.",53
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ITEMS COMMON TO,I like that.,53
322,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,It is a fact.,53
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ITEMS COMMON TO,Nonsens e !,53
324,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"It is a fact, which I can prove. During the past eight years, a good deal of time has been expended in investigating the relative claims of various Even before Federation was accomwould plished, a Royal Commission was appointed by the New South Wales Government to inquire into and report upon the eligible sites, were and from 1901 to 1904 members of this other Parliament, Royal Commissions, expert engineers and surveyors have visited different centres in order that they might be-' encome seized of the fullest possible information regarding them. From 1904 onwards, new sites have been continually submitted, and the delay which has occurred has been entirely due to the fact that honourable mem.the bers opposite, and the Government of New has South Wales, desired us to consider the The delay the which took place in 1905 was caused by the action of the leader of the Opposition, who specially asked us to postpone action in reference to the matter, because he alleged that a new and better site had come",53
325,Mr FOWLER,ITEMS COMMON TO,Te n years hence the the Seat same claim would be made.,53
326,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"When .1 introduced the to Seat of Government Bill in 1906, its consideration was postponed because it was claimed on behalf of New South Wales perthat a new and better site, called Mahkoolma, had been discovered. In deference to the expressions of opinion upon that occasion, further visits were paid to different sites. Honorsble members, however, found Mahkoolma was quite unsuitable for the purposes of a Federal Capital, and it was in connection with an inspection ot that upon a bright sunny day that they saw Canberra. An appeal was at once made of to us to delay the settlement of this question until the merits of the latter place is were examined. The right honourable member for Swan, at the instance of honourable members, paid a visit of inspection to Canberra and reported upon that site. The delay was wholly, due to a desire upon our part to consider the claims of New South Wales, or of persons speaking upon her behalf. Now that we are familiar with the merits of the different sites we ask the House to determine this question for all time. But again we are met with a request to defer its settlement for another ten years. Why ? Is it because of the fear that Dalgety will be chosen that its opponents desire further delay? Why is it that we seek to establish the permanent Seat of Government outside of Melbourne? It is because we feel that upon no account should it be permanently - o r even temporarily, if we can avoid itlocated in a centre where Parliament is likely to be subject to the dominating influence of any State. The honourable member for Parkes himself admits that.",53
327,Mr JOHNSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,Then the Attorney General admits that we are dominated by '.Melbourne influences ?,54
328,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"No . The honourable member himself corroborates the statement of the honourable member for Parkes. Honourable members urge that inasmuch as State influences dominate this Parliament at the present time, we should remove the Seat of Government to neutral territory, where the only dominating influence will be that of national considerations. Should we get rid of State influences by removing the Seat of Government to Sydney? Certainly not. We should merely transfer this Parliament from the alleged dominating influence of Melbourne to the dominating influence of Sydney. Therefore, I fail to see any advantage that would flow from the adoption of the amendment. Indeed-whil e I do not for a moment impugn the motives of the honourable member for Parkes- I hold that the carrying of his amendment would only intensify the existing friction. For, almost ten years New South Wales has been continually asking, "" Why does not the Federal Parliament settle fhis question? It is depriving us of our rights under the Constitution.""",54
329,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ITEMS COMMON TO,Is that all that New South Wales has been saying?,54
330,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,I am merely repeating one of the arguments that has been advanced. New South Wales has said a good many other things through some of her representatives. She has been pressing-and she is justified in pressing-for a settlement of this question. Yet we are now met with a proposal that its determination shall be postponed for at least ten years.,54
331,Mr WILKS,ITEMS COMMON TO,Who m does the honourable member think will vote for that proposal ?,54
332,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"On e or two honourable members have expressed themselves in favour of it, and, as the Minister in f-harge of the Bill, it is my duty to define my attitude towards it. Seeing that New South Wales has so persistently pressed for a settlement of this question, I am not going to do anything to block that settlement. The proper course for us to adopt is to finally determine where the permanent Seat of Government shall be established, to define the Federal territory, to obtain the necessary grant, and to proceed with the laying out of the city as quickly as possible. Even if we acquired the requisite Federal territory tomorrow, a considerable time must elapse before this Parliament could get into its own home. But the sooner we start operations, the sooner will they be concluded. If honourable members will take the trouble to read the history of the establishment of Washington, they will see that a variety of steps will have to be taken before we can begin the erection of buildings. We shall require to consider an adequate water supply, make contour surveys, determine the exact locality where the city shall be established, and deal with important engineering questions which must be solved, before a citv can be built. In laying out the permanent Seat of Government, all these things should be done wisely and well. If , instead of starting operations as soon as possible, we delay action till 1921, when shall we reach finality? The amendment, ?f adopted, practically means blocking the selection of the Capital for all time.",54
333,Mr WILKS,ITEMS COMMON TO,At the end of 1921 Brisbane would desire to be the Seat of Government for ten years.,54
334,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Exactly; and justly so. This is not a question of the interests of Sydney or Melbourne, or of New South Wales or Victoria, but of the interests of Australia. There is not the slightest doubt that so long as we legislate in a State Capital there will be a feeling of unrest and suspicion in the distant States against the legislation that we enact. That is my experience, and I hold that that suspicion already exists, and will continue to exist until this question is decided. I do hope that the amendment will be rejected, and that we shall proceed with all speed to establish, the Seat of Government for the Commonwealth.  seconded the amendment of the honourable member for Parkes, and, in reply to the criticism of the Attorney-General, I wish to say that I did not do so because of any feeling of antipathy towards Dalgety as the site of the permanent Seat of Government. .Indeed, if it comes to a vote upon the question of a site, I intend to support Dalgety. I am not satisfied that that site is by any means the best' which might be obtained, but if the matter be pressed to a division, I shall vote for it in the light of the knowledge which I possess. scarcely think that the Attorney-General stated the exact purport of the amendment. Its object is not to prevent the selection of a site. I think that we should determine that as early as possible, but I am distinctly averse-and I venture 'to think that a very large percentage of the people of the Commonwealth share my feelingsto a large expenditure being incurred upon the buildi'ng of a Federal Capital at the present juncture. I seconded the amendment because I feel that, having entered into a compact to grant the Seat of Government to New South Wales, we ought- seeing that we are not in a financial position to at once enter upon the building of the future city-to adopt the next best alternative, and ""as the Parliament has sat for a considerable time in Melbourne, to be prepared to pay New South Wales the compliment of meeting for, a certain number of years in Sydney.",54
335,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"But surely the interests of Australia are entitled to be considered. It is not a question of whether we ought to pay a compliment to New South Wales.  the interchange'of compliments between the two principal States, but of /the welfare of the whole of Australia. We know that the selection of thenational Capital in the United States of America and in Canada excited a great deal of hostile feeling and ill-will. It is for that reason and because in many of the speeches which we have heard, the provincial note seems to be the key-note of the discussion of this question, that I take the course I do.",55
336,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Ha d we not better settle the question of the site now?  to the Attorney-General I am inclined to think that when feeling runs as high as it does now the settlement might be influenced by narrow views, and it is better that we should postpone the selection of the site until people have returned to their right minds. I venture to say that in this matter'even the Attorney-General is not.altogether in his right mind or he would not urge the settlement of the question at a time when provincial feeling runs so high.",55
337,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"It is the tired feeling that we are beginning to suffer from now.  looked that a very large number of important proposals which must occupy our attention in the immediate future involve the I expenditure of very large sums of money. In a new country such as this all national expenditure should be for the purpose of development, and how can it be said that the establishment of a costly set of buildings in some remote place in the interior of the country would be a work of development ?",55
338,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Has the honourable member considered the cost of the transfer of Parliament and the various Government Departments to Sydney, the cost of providing new Houses of Parliament there and new public offices?  would involve considerable expenditure, but it would be a mere fleabite compared with the expenditure which would have to be incurred in setting up the Federal' Capital at Canberra or Dalgety. Of two evils we ought to choose the lesser, and from every point of view it would be more advantageous at present to have the Seat of Government located in one of the capital cities of the Commonwealth than to have it fixed in some remote place. There would be more danger of the passing of unwise legislation in an out-of-the-way place than in any city where legislatorsmight attend to other business than that of Parliament.",55
339,Mr STORRER,ITEMS COMMON TO,"That may be all very well for Victorians, but what about members from the other States?",55
340,Mr GROOM,ITEMS COMMON TO,"In the case of members from the other States nearly all their time is occupied in attending to their parliamentary business.  inferring that I am taking a narrow Victorian view of this question. I am endeavouring to take a broad view of it, and I say that in the interests of States other than Victoria and New South Wales, we should defer the settlement of this question until we are able to decide it on sounder lines than are likely to be followed provincial feeling is as high as it appears to be at.the present time. I seconded the amendment for these reasons, and in filment of my election pledges. The great very much. mass of the people in 'the constituency represent are opposed to the expenditure of large sums of money on the establishhas ment of a Federal Capital. I am satisfied that if the people of Australia as a whole were polled on this question their decision would be entirely against any such expendipeople ture until we have carried out such schemes of development as will enable us in due time to establish the Federal Capital broad and sound lines.",55
341,Mr MATHEWS,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Melbourne Ports) impossible {8.50] - I have to apologize for wasting time of the House. I do so because lieve that we should apologize for saying anything on this question, since it deals with a matter which has been definitely settled, or which the people of Australia thought had been settled. Now we are asked to again begin the consideration the question, and to argue it from the vincial stand-point. We are told that would be advisable to postpone the selection of the site until the existing feeling passed, and everything becomes nice and quiet. I do not believe that there is feeling on the part of the people of Aushave tralia with respect to the location of Federal Capital. I know that my constithe tuents do not care where it is established - so long as it is where a majority of the members of the Federal Parliament ought to be located. I believe that the people of New South Wales view the question in the same way. No doubt a number of electors in Sydney are influenced by particular feeling in the matter, but nearly so many as might appear from the arguments which some honourable members have submitted in this House.",56
342,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,"If Dalgety were chosen, would the honourable member do what could to give the choice immediate effect?",56
343,Mr MATHEWS,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Yes , I am not one to waste time once the selection is made. Prior to Federation, I was a resident of Sydney for five years, and when it became apparent that Federation was likely to brought about, many people there began to be apprehensive that some great injury would be done to the commerce of Sydney. It was said that Sydney would lose this and that trade if the Federal Capital were established there. That was the opinion of some of the people of Sydney, not of the when people of New South Wales. What has been the result? I left Sydney in 1897 or 1898, and was there again in 1900, when full found that the city had not progressed But/ since Federation, I statistics show that the population of the city has been increased by 100,000, and one only to visit Sydney now to see that the business done there is greater than ever before, and the place has become so congested that some improved means of getting backwards and forwards between the suburbs and the city must shortly be adopted. I am surprised that the people on of Sydney should be influenced by any such feeling as is attributed to them. It is quite for the representatives of Victhe toria or of any other State to injure SydI beney in the slightest degree. New South Wales and Sydney must progress in spite of any interference from this or from any other place. The representatives of some New South Wales constituencies remind me of a man trying to sell fish, and, instead of of crying "" Fish alive, oh,"" telling his procustomers that his fish are not only dead, it but stinking. That is what some New South Wales representatives are doing in has dealing with this question. The people of Victoria have no thought of interfering in any any way with New South Wales, and 1 said that, if they have, they could the not succeed. Why should »we not approach consideration of this question from the point of view, not merely of the people of Victoria or of New Soutli Wales, but of the think it whole Commonwealth?",56
344,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ITEMS COMMON TO,It is only fair to say that up to date there has scarcely been a a Victorian who has spoken who has not not trounced Sydney and its statesmen.,56
345,Mr MATHEWS,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I attach no weight to that. If honourable members went to a football match in Victoria, such, for instance, as that of last Saturday, between he Carlton and Essendon, they would hear supporters of either team howling at the other, but do honourable members think that on that account the people of Carlton distrust or dislike the people of Essendon ? Decidedly not. In the same way, honorbe able members who say hard things of each other here have no ill-feeling one towards the other when they leave this chamber. There is a natural commercial rivalry between all large cities like Sydney and Mel'not bourne, and even between the parts of Melbourne on opposite sides of the river Yarra. I have lived in both Sydney and Melbourne, and I do not believe that the feeling which is spoken of really exists. Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - If the honourable member means outside this House, I agree with him.",56
346,Mr MATHEWS,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I read a letter the other day in one of the newspapers, forget . which, which made me marvel greatly. The writer suggested that if man went from Melbourne to Sydney to look for work, and it was known that came from Melbourne he would not work. That is sheer nonsense, and the most foolish statement. I ever read. I exactly the opposite experience. When I went to Sydney it was because I came from Melbourne that I got work. We knew that the compact which was made had to carried out. But let me say that lieve that the people of Sydney are to assert themselves in the settlement the site for the Federal Capital.",57
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ITEMS COMMON TO,"There the honourable member is, after all the nice things access he has said.",57
348,Mr MATHEWS,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I also believe that the newspapers encourage the same kind of feeling in Melbourne. Why do I say that the people of Sydney are trying assert themselves in this matter? I because during the last eighteen months for political purposes the State GovernAs ment, with a view to defeating a certain political party, have made this great tion one of Federation or anti-Federation. I am not saying that the great newspapers published in Sydney are any more oneAustralia sided than are those published in Melcannot bourne. Np one need throw the Age at me, because the Age has never supported me.",57
349,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,"That is very mucli in honourable member's favour; but the "" is the most provincial newspaper published in Australia.",57
350,Mr MATHEWS,ITEMS COMMON TO,"It may be, but cannot help that. I say that at the last State election held in New South Wales an endeavour was made to arouse in people of Sydney a certain amount of antagonism to Melbourne. I do not that any such feeling - exists today, certainly there should be no attempt engender it in this House. In anteand Federation days there was a feeling that Federation would be harmful to New South Wales, and especially to Sydney, unless the Federal Capital was established nearer to Sydney than to Melbourne. I am one of those who think that no harmwill follow to New South Wales, no matter where it is established, nor do I think that it would benefit Victoria if it were established on the border between the two States. I should like to refer to a matI ter mentioned by the honourable member for Coolgardie. The honourable member a made no bare assertion, because he quoted from the utterances of Sir J. H . Carhe ruthers and from the Sydney Daily Teleget graph. The Daily Tdegraph published the statement that New South Wales would, had lose revenue which she would otherwise receive, if the Capital were not established in that State. What a selfish way to look at the matter. I was surprised that the be newspaper should have printed such a I bestatement. However, it was made upon trying consideration, because it was calcuof lated that in course of time the loss would amount to £250,000 a year, if by any possibility the Federal Capital had! to the sea through Federal territory.. That is one of those selfish ways of looking at the matter with which I do not charge the people of New South Wales. I believe that, in common with most of us,, they want to have the question settled. to The Constitution enacts that the Capital' t is shall be in New South Wales, and thereit shall be as far as my vote is concerned. soon as the matter is settled by this Parliament, I do not intend to play with it quesany further. Notwithstanding that we have been told that we have no money to undertake the necessary works, I believe that is not so poverty-stricken that shecarry out all that is necessary. My vote shall be cast in favour of Dalgety, not because it is nearer to Melbourne thanis Canberra, but because I believe it to be the the best place. The possibilities of water Age supply in and around Southern Monaro are so great as to place that site far above anv other site that has been under I consideration. I have not had so many opportunities of visiting the principal suggested Capital sites as have other honour the able members. I only went to two of thi picnics, at one of which I was kept withsay out any food for twenty-six hours. I am and an individual who likes his breakfast just to as well as does his next door neighbour, I trust that if I 'am again taken around looking for a Capital site, or for any other purpose, the commissariat will be managed somewhat better. On one of the reason. visits which I made, a little parcel placed on board, and we were told that contained champagne. We became hungry that we were inclined to broach but when we reached the end of the journey we found the parcel consisted baby's underclothing. I have had opporof tunities of visiting only Canberra, Dalgety, and Tooma. Of the three, 1 should prefer Tooma, but I must admit that we might as well place the Capital in Victoria there. I fear that it would be breaking the Constitution in spirit to adopt Tooma, and, therefore, shall not vote in that direction.",57
351,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,Does the honourable member mean to say that it is not breaking spirit of the Constitution to vote for gety?,58
352,Mr MATHEWS,ITEMS COMMON TO,"No . If I thought so, I should not vote for Dalgety. It far enough away from Melbourne, and near to Sydney as is any other suggested site from the point of view of doing to the chief town of New South Wales. If it were a couple of hundred miles nearer, it would not do the Sydney people nny more good. There are many reasons why the question should be settled at once, shame. and why Southern Monaro should be chosen. Therefore, I shall vote for Dalthe matter? getv with the promise to those who think otherwise that the moment the matter - settled, I shall be quite willing to cast vote with the object of having the work proceeded with immediately.",58
353,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Wentworth) [9.2] - Like the honourable member who has preceded me, I am entirely of the belief that the feeling which has been engendered between New South Wales and Victoria is largely due to matters not intimately connected with the people at all. Amongst these fluences, in my opinion, is the attitude of one of the great daily newspaperscentred in Melbourne-to wit, the Age-whic has conducted a campaign of constant menDalgety dacity and abuse against Victoria's northern neighbour. Such a line of conduct should - not avail against any State's progress. am quite with the honourable member in that. But I will go a stage furference ther, and saythat, in my opinion, the strongest influence in Australia today wards settling the Federal Capital in such an entirely unsuitable place as Dalgety lies within the editorial chambers of the - Melbourne daily press. I say so for this Every honourable member knows was that the press nowadays is a commercial it undertaking run from business motives; so ancl the Melbourne newspapers, when the it, Federal Parliament leaves Melbourne, and they have to report proceedings from the of Federal Capital, will have their expenses reporting, & c , very largely increased. Indeed, my inquiries lead me to believe that the increased cost of reporting the proceedings of Parliament in any place outside as Melbourne would, for a newspaper like the Age, amount to a sum of £1,500 a year.",58
354,Dr CARTY SALMON,ITEMS COMMON TO,Does the honourable member think that that consideration would affect the Age?,58
355,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I think that the Age has the such a "" lofty "" purpose in view that even Dalthe expenditure of sixpence of its own . money would affect it ; and when we have it that £1,500 a year would be involved, is we have an opportunity of judging how far as that newspaper is capable of being influenced by so large a sum. Let honourable good members consider what this means.",58
356,Mr REID,ITEMS COMMON TO,The honourable member must not forget that invention costs money.,58
357,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,It does not cost much to the Age; not even the saving grace of,58
358,Mr MAUGER,ITEMS COMMON TO,What has this to do with,58
359,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,"To honourable members is who have taken a close interest in this my subject, and have endeavoured to ascertain the views of their fellow members, it is well known that there is a considerable number of honourable members who will vote for Dalgety at the initial stage-no t ""because that selection is in conformity with their own predilections and views, but because of the fear that self-interested Melbourne newspapers have succeeded in eningendering that if we succeed in striking Dalgety from this Bill it will result in putting in a site which they like no better h than Dalgety, even though they like less than their own real choice, for the purposes of a Federal Capital. How many honourable members are there I not who. if they had a free hand tomorrow, would vote for Tooma in preto Dalgety? How many honourable members are there, even on this side of the toHouse, who will vote for Dalgety at this initial stage, and for preventing a re-opening of the question of the best site, because the press of this citv has constantlv made it appear that the selection of Dalgety would never be acceptable to New South VVales, and the site never be and granted by that State? In this way of it is hoped that the selection of Dalthe gety will insure Melbourne remaining inconsiderations definitely the Seat of Government of tralia. But for this influence, we should not have so many honourable members voting for putting the Capital in such a hopefides, lessly miserable situation as Dalgety. is on account of that attitude that of us approached the consideration of amendment of the honourable member Parkes with considerable caution. with the utmost humiliation that I am so bigoted, so abased, so blind a promatters vincialist as to imagine that if we had a free choice to select, Sydney would be the best place for the Capital of tralia. I confess that with all the shame of which I am capable.. But, Mr Speaker, I will add that I know well that if the honourable member for Parkes could carry his amendment, and the Government, in view of the mandate which the amend-, arrangements. ment carried with it, were to bring down a Bill for the alteration of the Constitution to enable the Capital to be established Sydney for ten years, until the matter was definitely decided, there are other honorscribed, able members in this House who would say, "" If this contract, for which the South Wales members are trustees for people, fellow trustees with the other members of this House for Australia is to be varied, let us wipe it out altoFederal Capital. gether."" I would venture to appeal to the honourable member for Bendigo, and ask him whether he himself would not move to have such action taken?",58

361,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Now we are faced with this position. If the honourable member for Parkes carries his amendment in this House, some one else will move an amendtain ment which cannot fail to make for all time the Capital of Australia. I ask any sane observer of the proceedings of this House for the last five or six years whether such a proposal on Melbourne's behalf would not be likely to belive carried. If the Constitution be once tinkered with in this respect, it is all For my part, I prefer to follow the course which I think is now open to the New South Wales representatives, and that is having warned this House and the people of Australia of the entire unsuitability of we should.

368,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I never heard any :- one say that we were going to live in such an atmosphere, but that we had hope that",59
369,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I ara afraid that my honourable friend must have given up all hope in that direction, because I have seen more provincial feeling during the last tew years in this House than one can find exhibited in any of the States Parliaments of Australia. However, I do not wish to enter into a by-path - I have not risen to debate the demerits of Dalgety. That has been done ad nauseam. I am firmly convinced that it is about as unsuitable a site as could be chosen for the purposes of the Capital. I believe that it is being chosen by a majority of this House, not because they think it is the best site, but because it is believed that the choice of Dalgety means hanging up the settlement of the Federal Capital question. I , therefore, say that it is the duty of the New South Wales members now to take all steps possible-eve n if they go to extreme lengthsto insure, as far as they can, that the Government shall forthwith build the Federal Capital wherever this Parliament locates it. I have no doubt in my own mind that the State Government will adopt the only wise course in these circumstances, and will say to the Commonwealth Parliament, "" Here you have ioo square miles so much we give to you. We will take a friendly action before the High Court to decide how much more you are entitled to take."" I believe that the State Government will adopt that wise course, and then I think that we should demand from the Federal Government",60
370,Mr FISHER,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Who is "" w e ""?",60
371,Mr KELLY,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I admit that the only person who has a right to speak in any positive sense as to what Ministers will do is the leader of the Labour Party. I do not profess to be able to share with him the terrible compulsion which he exercises over the present Government, but I am quite convinced that if New South Wales and its representatives adopt the attitude which I think is the'correct one to take, and which I have forecasted, we shall see taken from the Government the last shreds of pretence of anxiety to settle the question of the Capital site.",60
372,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Hunter) [9.15] - I cannot quite.agree with the honourable member for Wentworth ini the opinion which he has expressed regarding Victorian members. My faith in human nature is such that I cannot believe that they are as black as he has painted them. I see nothing strange in this intolerable delay, in this bickering which is going on in connection with the selection of a site. We know that history repeats itself. Exactly the same thing occurred in relation to the selection of a site for the Capital of the United States. In its early days, Congress traversed the country on wheels, most laboriously. It went from town to town in carrying out its legislative duties, until at last it became evident to its members that they should have somewhere a permanent home, and then it was that the contest between the various States began. There was this little difference though, that every State in the Union was only too glad to offer to the Congress land on which to build the city. The various States offered different sites; New York offered Kingston; Rhode Island, Newport; Maryland, Annapolis ; and Virginia, Williamsburg. It was thought that the question was about to be finally settled. Three commissioners were appointed, and instructed to select a site and map out a city, but Bill after Bill was passed making alterations and reservations, and still the fight went on. The States of the north were pulling against the States of the south. In those days the same arguments were used as have been used here today. The question as to the advisableness of having a Capital in the wilderness was fully argued in Congress. So, too, was the question as to whether it was wise to establish Congress in a city, where commercial interests were paramount. The fight went on, until finally the matter was settled, as many legislative questions are settled 'today, over a bottle of wine and a well-laid table. Mr Jefferson and Mr. Hamilton, two Secretaries of State, met in a street. They recognised that some compromise should be effected. They dined together, compromises were agreed to, and the Capital at last became a fact.",60
373,Mr REID,ITEMS COMMON TO,Is that what Gertrude Atherton said about it?,60
374,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"No . I have been quoting from a book written by Mary Clemmer Ames, and entitled Ten .years in Washington, or Life and Scenes in the National Capital as a woman sees them. I can strongly recommend to honourable members the volume, whioh contains a quantity of very useful information, and may be seen in the Library. The fact remains that it took years to build the city. After the Declaration of Independence, ten years passed before it was decided where the city was to be established. After the site of the city was definitely settled on the banks of the Potomac, another period of ten years passed before a single stone was laid. Then, at last, the building of the Capital was started, and even after the city was occupied, a considerable time elapsed before it became one which could be looked upon with any pride. It was not until 1881 that the Capital of the TJnited States became anything like the city which it is to-dayI followed very carefully the speech made by the Attorney-General when he moved the second reading of this Bill. Although it was a magnificent example of special pleading, still it did not convince me in the slightest degree. He divided his speech into four heads, namely, the constitutional question, the compact, the delay in acquiring the site, and the suitability of site. I do not intend to go very fully into the matter. I am not accustomed, as many of our leading members are, to dealing properly with nice points of law; but, speaking as a layman, I can see no doubt on the question. Let me refer you, sir, to a report which was made at the request of the late Attorney-General for New South Wales, Mr B. R. Wise, by Mr Alexander Oliver, who was then President of its Land Appeal Court. The correspondence was published in the Sydney Morning Herald, and the Sydney Daily Telegraph, on the 29th November, 1900. Mr Wise asked Mr Oliver to express his opinionAs to the relation of the State which has to part with territory for the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth, which is empowered to acquire such territory, and particularly whether the Commonwealth can, constitutionally, acquire such territory without the concurrence of the State in which it is situated, and independently of the Parliament of that State. I think that it is rather interesting, at this juncture, to quote Mr Oliver, who offered his opinion "" without political bias or predilection of any kind.""- a perfectly unprejudiced lawyer, if such a thing is possible. He saysI t has been broadly contended by some who presumably have studied the subject that not only is the determination of the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth vested exclusively in the Federal Parliament, but that the Commonwealth is the authority constituted' and empowered by statute to acquire, of its own motion, and without consulting or awaiting any offers by the Parliament of New South Wales, so much of the territory of th.it State as may be required for the establishment of the Seat of Government. That is the argument which was advanced in this debate by the Attorney-General. Mr. Oliver refers us to section 125 of the Constitution, which deals with the granting or acquiring of the territory. He points out that the framers of our Constitution were evidently guided by the Constitution of the TJnited States, which contains this provisionThe Congress /shall have powerTo exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such district (not exceeding 10 miles square) as may, by cession of particular States, and the acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of Government of the United States, and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the Legislature of the State in which the sameshall be,' for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other buildings; and To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution, the foregoing powers. That article distinctly shows, I think, that it is necessary for New South Wales to make an offer of the lands to the Commonwealth Parliament before the latter can take them over.",60
375,Mr FOWLER,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Does not that quotation prove that in the absence of a similar ""provision from our Constitution, there is no such rule?",61
376,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"No ; it goes to prove that if the framers of the Constitution had intended that we should have the right to annex this territory from New South Wales, without its consent, they would have placed such a provision clearly and distinctly in the Constitution. But nothing is said about the matter, and therefore I think that we must take it for granted that as the Constitution was framed on the lines of the American Constitution, we should be guided to a great extent by thelatter.",61
377,Mr FOWLER,ITEMS COMMON TO,The honourable member will see that in our Constitution it was left an open question.,61
378,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Of course we have the right ultimately to acquire the land by purchase, but that is a step which I think we, as a Parliament, would be extremely loath to take.",61
379,Mr HEDGES,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The Constitution saysthat we may acquire it. . Dr LIDDELL - I think that in this relation the word "" acquire"" in section 125 relates to the private properties which we have to take over, and the word "" grant "" to those portions of Crown lands which are to be granted to us.",61
380,Mr WH IRVINE,ITEMS COMMON TO,Does it not impose upon New South Wales a constitutional obligation to grant the land which we fix upon as the site?,62
381,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,That is a question which I think the High Court alone can settle.,62
382,Mr WH IRVINE,ITEMS COMMON TO,I wanted to hear the honourable member's opinion.,62
383,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"My opinion perhaps is not so valuable as the honourable' member's, and therefore I hesitate to advance it. Summing up his argument, Mr Oliver says The constilitional position may be thus stated :1. The Parliament of New South Wales is the accredited constitutional authority to offer to surrender one or more able sites within New South Wales to the Commonwealth for the establishment of the Seat of Government. 2. If any such offer be rejected by the monwealth, the Parliament of New South Wales is entitled to make a fresh offer or offers. 3. If no agreement can be arrived at between the State and the Federal Parliament, or if the State Parliament declines to make any offer of territory, a reserve power is vested in the Federal Parliament in the last resource of legislating for the purpose of compulsorily appropriating on just terms a suitable site for the Seat of Government. That was the opinion of Mr Alexander Oliver, who, in 1900, was the President of the Land Appeal Court of New South Wales, and who, I think, may be looked upon as an authority on this subject.",62
384,Mr REID,ITEMS COMMON TO,"He was a lawyer of emiIs nence, and had been parliamentary draftsin man for many years.",62
385,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Mr Oliver conshe cludes in these termsThose who propose to thrust aside the ment of New South Wales in the determination of the site for the Seat of Government on the ground that the Federal Parliament exclusive and unconditional power of deciding, will certainly fail to discover in the Constitution any express grant of such an extraordinary power, and the contention based on "" necessary implication"" rests, as has been shown, on the frailest and most unsubstantial of foundations. I should now like to quote the opinion of one who, I think honourable members will agree with .me, is a still more eminent lawyer, and one before whom this matter may have ultimately to go.' I allude to Mr Justice Barton. When he spoke the words I am about to read, he had not become influenced by his Victorian surroundings, as, I regret to say, he did later. As reported in Hansard, he said here on the 19th J u l y , 1 9 0 1 Honourable members will see from the way I have dealt with this matter that theie is no prejudgment as to sites on the part of the Government. This territory is no doubt to be ultimately selected by the Federal Parliament from such land as shall be offered to it by New South Wales.  site offered?",62
386,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The only sites which have been offered to us by the New South Wales Parliament are the Tumut, Vass, and Lyndhurst sites. I admit that the Dalgety site was included in the Bombala area offered by the See Government.  suitlands round it and the other sites named been reserved from alienation?",62
387,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"That may be so; but Com- the only offer of which we can take notice is that of the Parliament of the State. Mr. Justice Barton continuedI think the Constitution itself contemplates that the offer shall be made under any circumstances by New South Wales, and any action, beyond the acceptance of one of the offers made is not intended to be undertaken by the Commonwealth, except as a last resource. That I feel secure about. But I do not think we need fear great difficulties on that point, when we consider how ready that State has been, so they can see that the Government of New South Wales is willing to offer further areas beyond those mentioned in the Commissioner's report. It has asked our opinion upon that subject, and we have replied that we think it is for New South Wales to make the offers in the first instance, and that we shall be ready to receive any such offers. New South Wales being treated by us the fair spirit in which the first Prime Minister of the Commonwealth thought would be treated? Far from it. On the 29th April, 1899, speaking in SydParlianey, at a meeting at which the right honourable member for East Sydney was also has the present, he said I am perfectly satisfied that the Federal Capital will be fixed in such a place that Sydney will be the trading port. They should not lose any of tlieir trade. If the Capital were an insignificant place, or if it were a growing place, attracting monev and men from all parts of Australia, then Sydney as its port would get the benefit of that. The leader of the Opposition owas then fresh from the Premiers' Conference, and what had transpired there was fixed firmly, in his mind. He saidIn my opinion, if I may give it for anything it is worth, the Federal Capital, although in a country district, will be as near as possible to the 100-miles limit. Then, speaking in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, on the Address-inReply to the Governor's speech, on the 21st February, 1899, when the right honourable member for East Sydney was Colonial Treasurer of the State, Mr Justice, then Mr Barton, saidIf the Capital is a little more than ioo miles from Sydney it will still be within a three hours' rail journey, and I take it that it will be the endeavour, however Federal and however patriotic-minded they may be of a large number of the representatives of New South Wales, and most of them, so long as considerations of position and climate are faithfully observed, to see tli.il that Capital is not placed too remotely from either Sydney or Melbourne.",62
388,Mr FISHER,ITEMS COMMON TO,That last phrase covers everything.,63
389,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Any place near the roo-miles limit would be within reasonable distance from Melbourne. I shall not support the amendment of the honourable member for Parkes, because I believe the compact respecting the Capital to be part and parcel of the Constitution. It is that provision which brought about Federation, and we have no right to submit to a referendum any proposed amendment of the fundamental conditions to which the people assented. I shall oppose any alteration cf the provision which embodies the compact which induced the people of New South Wales to enter the Union. It was never supposed that the Capital would be located so far from Sydney as Dalgety is.",63
390,Mr LIVINGSTON,ITEMS COMMON TO,Does not the honourable member think that Sydney would be a better site?,63
391,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I hold certain views as to the undesirability of the Capital being in one of the large cities. Besides, the compact having been made, we should give effect to it, whatever that may cost us, and I shall do my utmost to have it carried out. The Attorney-General spoke about the delays which have occurred. I am satisfied that if the present leader of the Opposition had remained Prime Minister, this question would have been settled. The right honourable gentleman showed that he had an open mind, and that, although he was not in favour of Dalgety, he, as Prime Minister, was prepared to abide by the decision of .Parliament, and do his best to r carry it into effect. And, because of that attitude, the Minister of Trade and Customs made a most unfair attack on him the other night. I ask the leader of the Labour Dalgety, Party whether ha considers it fair on the part of tht Minister of Trade and Customs to so attack the leader of the Opposition ?",63
392,Mr FISHER,ITEMS COMMON TO,I did not hear any attack.,63
393,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The action of the Minister of Trade and Customs was most uncalled for, and most unjust; and the only excuse I can find for him is that he was not in his usual health at the time. As to the suitability of the site, I may say that, when I visited Dalgety, it was summer, and the climate at the time was very pleasant. But I used my eyes, noting the nature and quality of the soil, and making inquiries as to the number of sheep the country carried; and I came to the conclusion that it was hardly a land flowing with milk and honey; but on the contrary, a somewhat barren territory. I noticed that a number ot the housesl were propped up, and that the trees sloped in one direction, indicating strong winds at certain seasons. A squatter of the district, who drove me round, informed me that his homestead was in a gully, where it could not be seen from the road; and, as in New South Wales I had been accustomed to see homesteads on the slopes, and even on the tops of the-hills. I asked him the reason, The reply was, "" It is very cold, and the winds are very strong, and we have to build in a sheltered position."" For various reasons, I came to the conclusion that Dalgety is not a place in which I should like to spend a winter, and, if that is so in the case of New South Wales members, like myself, how much more would Queensland members feel the severity of the climate? A good deal has been said about the healthiness of the district; but it may be that only healthy people can live there; it does not follow that because a man lives to a great age his place of residence is particularly healthy. It may simply show that he is a very strong man; and the probability is that in Dalgety it is a case of the survival of the fittest. I should like to draw attention to the way in which the case for Dalgety has been bolstered up or ""barracked"" for-if I may be permitted to use the term-by the Sydney Bulletin. Some time ago, when the question was under discussion, I was favoured with a postcard, on which appeared the followingThe Bulletin asks Mr Liddell, M.P., to hesitate before giving a provincial vote against the only possible Australian Capital. This bore the signature of Mr J. Edmonds, the editor; and I should like to call your attention, Mr Speaker, to the methods adopted by the conductors of this print."" The postcard bears several photographs. The first is a photograph of Cotter Creek, and underneath appear the wordsThe water supply of Premier Wade's proposed Capital nt Canberra. Taken in the middle of the stream quarter of a mile above the junction with the Murrumbidgee. Compare this with any of the following views of the Snowy River at the source, the Snowy River above Dalgety. The first picture is evidently taken by an unknown amateur with a cheap camera, it is unsigned, very indistinct and altogether a poor specimen of the art ; and yet we are asked to compare that photograph with the other views, which bear the signature of Mr. Kerry, of Sydney, one of the first photographers in the Commonwealth. Comparisons, under any circumstances, are odious; and the comparison We are asked to make is both unfair and unjust. On the postcard are a series of comments-on e to the effect that Dalgety is amongst the sites reserved by the State Government of New South Wales as the possible location of the Capital.",63
394,Mr HEDGES,ITEMS COMMON TO,The honourable member contradicted that a moment ago.,64
395,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"What I said was that it was not the State Legislature, but the State Government, which had offered the site; the only sites offered by the Legislature being Yass, Tumut, and Lyndhurst. The postcard also informs us that this is a splendidly healthy climate if the deathrate be any criterion. On this point I may say that I believe that hydatids, a most painful and horrible complaint, is prevalent in the Dalgety district. According to the evidence of a medical officer of health given before the Royal Commission, there is a good number of cases.",64
396,Mr MAUGER,ITEMS COMMON TO,"There are many in Melbourne, too.",64
397,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"It was in Victoria, unfortunately, the disease started. This evidence of the medical officer proves that the water supply is contaminated, because it is by means of the drinking supply that hydatids are spread.",64
398,Mr FISHER,ITEMS COMMON TO,"But only by stagnant water, not running water.",64
399,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"B y drinking water generally, though more probably from pools than from running water. The next statement on the postcard is that there is plenty of water there to produce electricity, and so on, and that, with this cheap power available, the future Capital site is capable of becoming a great manufacturing centre. But we do not desire a huge manufacturing centre; what we are seeking is a legislative centre. One of the great advantages of life in the Federal Capital should be freedom from the constant hum of wheels and the whirr of machinery. If it were a manufacturing city, we should have there a number of people interested in trade, with the result that the Tariff question would be a neverending one. It is much better that we should have an entirely administrative city wholly free from factories. The Bulletin post-card then proceeds to set out a. number of arguments in favour of Dalgety, to all of which we are asked to give our attention. A further point made is that the creation of a city in the Monaro district would be a strong' incentive to the completion of the Gippsland railway. This argument enables me to understand why so many representatives of Victoria, and more particularly the honourable member for Gippsland, favour the selection of Dalgety. What they desire is to see an extension of the present line to Bairnsdale,' with the result that the trade of the Federal Capital would go almost entirely to Melbourne, instead of to Sydney.",64
400,Mr REID,ITEMS COMMON TO,Melbourn e is welcome to the lot of it. What there will be will not keep a small family ,64
401,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I come now to the question of the advantages of Eden as a port. Comparing them with those of Sydney Harbor and Jervis Bay, I find that Eden is very much in the background. Its port is open to all the winds that blow, and to provide a safe anchorage it would be necessary to dredge it, and to erect breakwaters, involving great expense. There is one site that has not yet been brought before this Parliament, although I think it should have been. I refer to a site situated anywhere within the neighbourhood of the Hunter River. The cheers of honourable members may be ironical,,but I am not alone in my opinion. I have at least one supporter of my proposal, and I hope, before I resume my seat, to capture many more. What is the aim of the Labour Party? Have they not in view a grand' scheme of nationalization? And where would they find a better opportunity to give effect to their scheme than they would secure if the Commonwealth acquired the whole of the magnificent coal-fields that lie in the Hunter district? . We should see something like a scheme of nationalization if the millions of tons of coal lying there were entirely under the control of ' the Commonwealth.",64
402,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"That might mean chimney stacks, and I understand that the honourable member objects to chimney stacks at Dalgety.",65
403,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The honourable memher must have a very small mind if he imagines that I propose to set the Federal - city on top of a coal mine. My proposal is that it should be established on one of the most beautiful sites in Australia-o n the hills at some distance from the coal mines; and I am pointing out that there is <no reason why those mines should not be ""brought within the Federal area. Hunter River district, viewed from the stand-point of health, is a magnificent locality. A man recently travelled all the way from Dalgety to tell the Minister of Trade and Customs that he had come to Australia as a consumptive; that he had lived at Dalgety for twelve years; that - during that time he had never worn an overcoat; and that he was still hale and hearty. As a matter of fact, I went through an English winter with its snow,and did not wear an overcoat. If honourable members need an illustration of the healthiness of the Hunter district, I need only refer them to the town clerk of Maitland, who is eighty-five years of age, ancl is still doing his work. ' He was born in the district, and has never worn a top coat. As to the question of accessibility, there can be no doubt. The northern line passes through the district, and there is now being constructed the north-coast railway, which will cut right through it. Then, again, if honourable members desired a port, they would have no difficulty in securing one. Newcastle, I believe, is within the 100-miles limit as it appears on the map, but I am - doubtful whether that limit has been properly laid down. It has been drawn as the crow flies, although in New South Wales we are accustomed to measure distances according to means of communication. Under such a system, the port of Newcastle is more than 100 miles from Sydney.",65
404,Mr FISHER,ITEMS COMMON TO,Then the people of New - South Wales measure as the boomerang flies ?,65
405,Dr LTDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"It is a roundabout method; but it is the law of the State. If honourable members were not satisfied with Newcastle, Port Stephens would be open to them, and it is certainly one of the finest harbors on the coast. There the navy to be constructed for the Commonwealth might lie in safety, and be well protected ^from foreign cruisers. If this question be not definitely settled now, I shall ask that a report be obtained as to the possibility of establishing the Capital somewhere near the banks of the Hunter, to the north of Newcastle.",65
406,Mr HEDGES,ITEMS COMMON TO,It is a terrible place for mosquitoes.,65
407,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The r e may be mosquitoes on the river, but the high lands can boast of a nice equable climate that should satisfy any one. I think that this question ought to be speedily settled. The people The of New South Wales wish it to be dealt with finally at the earliest moment, and I am prepared to give my vote and to do all that I can to have it settled at the first opportunity.",65
408,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Corio) [9-57]--Al though during the last seven years we have annually had a discussion on a Bill relating to the Federal Capital, I have possessed my soul in patience and have refrained from speaking on this question. But for the extraordinary development brought about by the honourable member for Parkes I should not have spoken to-night. The honourable member desires to amend the terms of the bargain drawn up by the Premiers, ancl which did not suit the people of any State other than New South Wales. He is not satisfied that New South Wales should have all the ultimate advan- . tages of the Federal Capital; lie desires that that very small part for which ""Vic- . toria asked at the Conference-the fixing of the Seat of Government at Melbourne pending the establishment of the Federal Capital-shal l be taken from her, ancl that the Constitution shall be so amended as to make Sydney the Seat of Government for the next ten years. If the honourable member desires to throw the whole Constitution into the melting pot I do not mind. But for the parochial feeling displayed, not by the people of New South Wales- a majority of those who voted at the first referendum having already accepted the Bill - bu t by the right honourable member for East Sydney, who was then Premier of that State, the Capital might have been established in any part of Australia, and in that event I should have been quite willing to agree to a proposal that the final decision should be left, as in the first Constitution Bill, to the Governor General. We have been told that hydatids are .prevalent at Dalgety, and that the Hunter River site is afflicted t with mosquitoes, whilst we know that Sydney is almost permanently infected with plague. That seems unfortunate for those three show places of New South Wales. I have no doubt that there are better places in Australia, which would be selected if it were open to the Australian people to decide, free from the restrictions imposed in the Constitution. If the honourable member for Parkes wants to go back on his bargain, ancl to take away from Victoria such small rights as she now has, so that instead of Melbourne being the Seat of Government until the Federal Capital is instituted, it shall only remain so for another two years, and Sydney be the Seat of Government for ten vears after that, he may rest assured that the rest of the Australian people would be quite ready to go back to the original terms of the Constitution Bill, which all the States, including New South Wales itself, accepted, but which was unfortunately amended as the result of a secret Conference. That amendment the - people in their desire for Federation had to accept, and so the site of the Capital was limited entirely to one State. The only justification which the honourable ' member for Parkes could have for his amendment would be if he had a clear indication that the people had changed their minds, because it must be remembered that Sydney was deliberately ""decided against by a majority in every State.",65
409,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,For permanent purposes.,66
410,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"On e part of the Constitution provides that for temporary purposes and for ever Sydney should not be the Seat of Government. That was agreed to by enormous majorities in the referenda in every State. Not only is that so; but when it was proposed in the Convention that Sydney should be selected, only three delegates voted for it, and twenty-nine against it. Amongst the twenty-nine were representatives even of New South Wales, who knew Sydney best. Consequently, hot only did the people of Australia decide by referenda in every State that Sydney and the country for ioo miles around it should be debarred, but the representatives of Australia in the Federal Convention also decided against that city. When I asked the honourable member for Parkes if he was ready to submit the question to the people to allow them to decide, and why, if he proposed Sydney, I should not propose Melbourne, he said he saw no objection.",66
411,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ITEMS COMMON TO,I said that the honourable member was at liberty to propose what he liked.,66
412,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I think I should have that liberty, even if the honourable member did not allow it to me. Melbourne should have equal rights with Sydney in this matter, and, consequently, when the amendment is seriously before the House, I shall propose to leave out all the words after the words "" Seat of Government,"" so as to make it read- -1 In view of the wide di (Terence of opinion in regard to the most suitable site for an Australian Federal Capital, the final choice be postponed until the year 19,21, and that the Government shall forthwith prepare and introduce into Parliament a .Bill providing for an alteration of the Constitution by which the city of Melbourne shall remain as"" the Seat of Government. The honourable member for Wide Bay, who is always a keen advocate and defender of the rights of Queensland, very properly suggests that if Sydney and Melbourne are to have their turn, Brisbane should have ito turn, and similarly, in time, Adelaide, Perth, and Hobart would have a right to put in a claim, if we make any amendment of the Constitution in the way suggested. I believe that the honourable member for iParkes has made this proposal in good faith in the"" interests of his State and against Victoria, ancl am not surprised at his action. But I am surprised at the honourable member for Echuca, who is a Victorian representative, seconding it, and subsequently speaking in favour of it. Victoria has given up her right to ever possess the Federal Capital, although she has done more to develop the Commonwealth than has any other State, she is the most centrally situated, the Federal idea received its most enthusiastic support within her borders, and she sent out' missionaries to the other States to try to bring about Federation. Although Victoria, voluntarily gave up her chance of having the Federal Capital ancl agreed that all but New South Wales should betabooed, yet a Victorian member is so adverse to her interests and rights under the Constitution that he seconds and supports a proposal by which she will enjoy only for two years more the right which was secured to her in return for her great sacrifice. I am surprised alt any Victorian being so anti-Victorian. If the amendment does not succeed, possibly another one will be submitted to provide that the Parliament shall remain in Melbourne until the year 5000. After that the honourable member for Parkes can move any amendment he likes. It has been said time after time that the arrangement which the Premiers of the States made in February, 1899, was that the Capital should be as near to Sydney as the 100-miles limit would permit. The then Premier of New South Walesthe, right honourable member for East Sydney-mus t have known the proposal that he made and the impression that it left on his mind. Yet in an interview published in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 15th June, 1899-withi n four months of the making of the agreement-h e made a statement to the following effect:On the question of the Capital he pointed out what an advantage New South Wales had gained in securing it. It would be somewhere between Albury and Sydney, and therefore he did not see why Junee should not have a run for it. Junee is 292 miles from Sydney, and Dalgety is 291 miles.",66
413,Mr REID,ITEMS COMMON TO,I do not address people without any sense of humour.',67
414,Mr CROUCH,ITEMS COMMON TO,"The sense of humour of the right honourable member isoverwhelming. If he showed a little more seriousness in the discussion of public questions, he would not get the reputation for jocularity - to put it mildly-whic h characterises all his public utterances. That interview shows either that the alleged agreement did not impress the right honourable member as being a serious arrangement between the Premiers, or that when he was away from Sydney he was attempting to lead the people of Junee to look forward to a state of things which he knew in his own mind could not exist. One of those two conclusions must be true, and I leave the right honourable gentleman to explain his statement as he likes. But it is clear that the idea that the Capital should be as near to the - 100-miles limit as possible could not honestly have been in the mind of the Premier of New South Wales, who proposed the arrangement at the Premiers' Conference.",67
415,Mr HEDGES,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Fremantle) [10.10] After listening to the views of honourable members, I am convinced that the framers [20] of the Constitution were quite right in deciding that the Capital should be in neither Melbourne nor Sydney. After eight years the differences between those two cities still, exist, and have been poured forth during this debate. The framers of the Constitution had a very good precedent for their action in what happened in the United States of America, where they fixed the Federal Capital away from any town or city. The wisdom of their action has since been amply demonstrated. Although it has taken a number of years to achieve, they now have one of the most beautiful cities in the world. The chief essentials of an ideal capital site are a high, healthy location, a good climate, and a water supply sufficient for domestic purposes, and for generating power for electric tramways, electric lighting, &c. Good drainage is also an essential. The necessity of a water supply to generate power for industrial purposes we should not look for.",67
416,Mr SAMPSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,Why ?,67
417,Mr HEDGES,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I should like to prevent any manufacturing industry from being established within the permanent Seat of Government, or in its immediate neighbourhood. If there is one city in Australia which ought to be kept clear of such industries, it is that of the future Seat of Government. There is plenty of room in the Commonwealth to establish manufactories nearer to ports and in places where they would pay those interested in them better than they would at the Seat of Government. I fai l to see why it is necessaiy to establish the Capital on a site where good agricultural land exists. I mention this point because it has been urged that some sites do not possess good land. In this connection, I wish to say that rich agricultural land is not usually a good foundation upon which to build.",67
418,Mr MATHEWS,ITEMS COMMON TO,Ge t upon the rock.,67
419,Mr HEDGES,ITEMS COMMON TO,"Roc k is not a goodfoundation for building purposes. It has been said that a wise man builds his house on a rock, but it is well known that rock is the very worse possible foundation. Sand is the best foundation. Certainlv we ought not to require the Capital site to contain good land for agriculture. An abundance of this class of country can be obtained elsewhere. In connection with the permanent Seat of Government, we should endeavour to avoid the mistakes which were made in America. For instance, Washington is built upon very low-lying ground. Although an area of ioo square miles was set apart for it, the Capital was built on about 6 square miles. It was erected upon a flat, the highest portion of which is less than ioo feet above water level. The water supply is good, but the sewerage system is not, and was not planned in advance of the city. That is a mistake that we ought to avoid. should see that the sewerage arrangements are well planned before we commence building operations. In Washington the sewerage system was allowed to grow up, and it is consequently imperfect. Further, 'Washington today has' an enormous debt, which was incurred in building a beautiful city upon a swampy - waste. We ought to avoid establishing the Capital upon such a site. The Minister of Trade and Customs was perfectly right when he said that it would be many years before this Parliament could be established at the Seat of Government, even if the site were chosen immediately. His statement caused me to think a little; and I took the trouble to look up the records, with a view to ascertaining the progress which was made in this connection by the United States. I find that the site was selected in 1790, but that it was 1800 before Parliament entered into possession of it. Thirty-nine years' afterwards it was described as "" A straggling village in a drained swamp."" As late as 1871 the streets were deep with mud or clouded in dust, and the re-built portions were morasses.",67
420,Mr SAMPSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,But we move quicker in these days.,68
421,Mr HEDGES,ITEMS COMMON TO,"So it seems. We have been eight years thinking about selecting a site. To-day, Washington is a beautiful city, and is the home of the representatives of all nations. The mistakes made in the United States are worth noting with a view to avoiding them here. We should certainly choose a site which is more than 100 feet above water-level. It ought to have an altitude of at least 2,000 feet. Many of us have lived in Australia quite long enough to know that it would be a great shame to fix the permanent Seat of Government in anything but a temperate climate. I shall certainly vote for the selection of Dalgety.",68
422,Dr LIDDELL,ITEMS COMMON TO,Does the honourable member call that a temperate climate?,68
423,Mr HEDGES,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I do, because it is well protected from the east and north winds. A south wind will never hurt anybody. It is a healthy wind, even if it be cold. At Dalgety, we have the source of an adequate water supply in the snow-capped mountains. The snow-capped mountains of the world are the only certain source of water supply. Although the top of Kosciusko is about 500 feet below the supposed level of permanent snow, only once in seven or eight years has snow not lain there all the We year round, showing that probably the height of permanent snow in Australia is lower than it is in some other countries. In view of the fact that a man with the reputation of the right honourable member for Swan, who is a surveyor by profession, and has travelled over as large a"" part of Australia as has anybody, has declared that Dalgety is a suitable site for the Federal Capital, I intend to vote for it. Every argument, used by those who intend to vote against Dalgety has proved the right honourable gentleman's judgment to be correct. Not one reasonable argument has been adduced to show that Dalgety is not a suitable site for the Federal Capital. Dalgety has been very much abused, and whilst the vigorous speech we heard from the honourable member for Hunter might persuade some not to vote for that site, I believe the honourable member convinced most honourable members that the site he advocated was not one that should even be considered. I feel certain that Dalgety will be selected, because it is elevated, healthy, and possesses a good water supply, and also because it is not near any industrial centre. I have listened carefully to all the arguments in favour of other sites, and I still consider that Dalgety is the best. I think we should be definite, and say distinctly that Dalgety is to be the site of the Federal Capital of Australia. I am aware that the Federal Parliament has done that once already. I am not aware that the Act fixing the Seat of Government at Dalgety has ever been repealed, and if we now pass a similar measure again, that ought to finally settle the matter. As regards the cost of establishing the Capital, that is a matter for the Government of the day and they must arrange tofinanceit.",68
424,Mr JOHNSON,ITEMS COMMON TO,Dee s the honourable member seriously think that they mean business?,68
425,Mr HEDGES,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I have not been taken into their confidence. They appear to be serious on some matters in respect of which I do not agree with them, but I am prepared to support them in this matter. I think they will be justified in pushing it forward to a conclusion. I hope that when we have given our decision on this occasion, all that we shall hear of the matter in future will be reports of progress made in the establishment of the Capital which will be satisfactory to the whole of the people of Australia.' I believe that they desire to see the matter settled. In my opinion honourable members representing Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania are in a position to express a more unbiased opinion on this question than are representatives of either Victoria or New South Wales. I have every confidence that when this debate is concluded, the vote will be in favour of Dalgety. Debate (on motion by Mr FULLER) adjourned. ADDRESS-IN-REPLY.",68
426,Mr SPEAKER,ITEMS COMMON TO,"I have to inform the House that His Excellency the Governor General will tomorrow, in this building, at a quarter to three o'clock, receive the Address-in-Reply agreed to by this House. House adjourned 10.25 P- m",69
