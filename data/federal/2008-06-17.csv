1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 2 pm and read prayers. NA Fuel Prices,17
2,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his comment on The 7.30 Report last night: … I know full well that motorists are suffering lot of pain at present. If the Prime Minister knows that motorists are suffering a lot of pain, why won'the cut the petrol excise?",17
3,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government, through the budget, has introduced a package of $55 billion in support of families under financial pressure. The government, through the budget, has introduced extra measures to support the financial well-being of pensioners and carers. The key question here is: what do you do to practically assist the bottom line for family budgets dealing with the rising cost of petrol, rising interest rates, increases in rents and the rising cost of food? Those opposite managed to deliver us 10 consecutive interest rate rises during the period in which they occupied the treasury bench. The package that we have offered in relation to a typical young family will deliver, through the budget, some $52.50 extra a week. That proposed by those opposite provides $2.50 extra per week. The maths speaks for itself.",17
4,Mr TREVOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline the need for the government to keep maximum downward pressure on inflation and explain any moves that will make the job more difficult?,17
5,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government was elected on a platform of responsible economic management. The government was elected on a platform of delivering assistance to working Australians under financial pressure. The government was elected on a platform of investing in this country's long-term future. It is on those platforms that the government intends to govern. When it comes to responsible economic management, a core discipline for any government around the world is how to conduct effectively the fight against inflation. Fola lowing recent comments by the G8, the IMF, the OECD and the Reserve Bank, and data released by the ABS, all members of this place should be able to reliably conclude that inflation is not a charade and not a fairytale; it is a real economic problem across the global economy, including here in Australia. In fact, when this government was elected we were bequeathed by those departing the treasury bench an inflation rate which stood at a 16-year high. We know the consequences which flow from not acting on inflation. If you have upward pressure on inflation it produces upward pressure on interest rates, which in turn affects all working Australians and businesses, which in time has an effect on the real level of economic activity and a real impact, therefore, on employment. That is the overall consequence of having sat idly by for 12 long years in office while these inflationary pressures built bit by bit by bit. Despite successive warnings by the Reserve Bank of Australia about infrastructure constraints, bottlenecks, the skills shortage Budget and the rest, those opposite failed to act and, as a consequence, the inflation rate was running at record highs when this government assumed office. In addition to that, it is important to reflect on what the G8 finance ministers had to say on 14 June about the serious nature of the inflation threat facing the world. I quote them in their concluding statement: Elevated commodity prices, especially of oil and food, pose a serious challenge to stable growth worldwide, have serious implications for the most vulnerable and may increase global inflationary pressure. That was at the most recent G8 finance ministers meeting, in Osaka. Here at home, Australia is facing its own inflationary challenge, as noted by the Governor of the Reserve Bank last week: … Australia's inflation rate has risen more than most of those in our usual peer group when measured on a comparable basis. … … … … the prospect of inflation has presented a larger and more immediate danger to us than it has, thus far, to the US. So said the RBA governor on 13 June. The evidence in relation to the inflation challenge is overwhelming. There is one party in politics which actually appreciates the gravity of the challenge, and it currently sits on the government benches. Then there are those opposite, who regard it as either a charade or a fairytale. The key question is: what we do about it? The government, earlier this year, indicated what its plan of attack was on inflation. A core element of that plan of attack on inflation goes to responsible economic management by delivering a substantial government surplus through the budget. What this government has doneand it is proud of this-is to deliver a $22 billion surplus through the budget. As a consequence of that, we may well ask what the alternative approach is. It is to conduct a $22 billion raid on the surplus, which is the cumulative impact of the measures which those opposite currently stand opposed to. But it is not just about the aggregate dimensions of that problem over the spread of the forward estimates; it is a here-and-now problem as well. If you go to the precise impact of the delaying tactics which the opposition are embarked upon in the Senate-and we are now at D-day when it comes to the Senate-and if you put together these measures which are being blocked by those in the Senate and calculate, as Treasury has done, the cost of this delay out to September, which is the first deliberative occasion on which the Senate can then re-examine these measures, you will see that the government stands to have a further $300 million raid conducted on the surplus. The precise figure calculated by the Treasury is $284 million. What happens is that that $284 million will come straight off the surplus because those opposite cannot make up their mind whether they are prepared to allow the government to embark upon a responsible course of action and deliver the substantial surplus which we judge to be necessary in the overall fight against inflation. So the Liberal Party stands opposed to these measures in the Senate. It is not just blocking or conducting a $22 billion raid on the surplus; in addition to that, the immediate consequence of it so doing is $300 million which will be lost to the surplus, directly off the top, by September. I would appeal to those opposite to come to their senses on this question, because this is a serious businesshow you fight the fight against inflation. If you fail to fight the fight against inflation by engineering an appropriate budget surplus through the government sector, you are dealing with potentially huge upward pressure on overall inflation and, as a consequence, upward pressure on interest rates-and we know where that logic goes. This government, elected on a platform of responsible economic management, has done the only responsible thing given the global and national economic circumstances that we assumed, having taken office-that is, to deliver a sizeable surplus. Those opposite have embarked upon an irresponsible course of action: a $22 billion raid on the surplus and $300 million on the trot, on the way through, until September. Those opposite, the Liberal Party, need to understand this: when you are dealing with responsible economic management it is not simply a game of party politics being played; there are real consequences for working Australians. If irresponsible measures continue to be adopted by those opposite, the consequences for inflation, the consequences for interest rates, the consequences for growth and the consequences for jobs are serious indeed. I would appeal to those opposite, on this D-day in the Senate, to come to their senses and for once adopt a responsible course of action when it comes to preserving this nation's long-term economic interests and those of working families. Revenue",17
6,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer Treasurer to chapter 5, page 10, of Budget Paper No. 1, which lists $19.7 billion worth of new revenue measures including tax decisions which will increase the price of premixed spirits, increase the price of cars, increase the cost of travel and increase the cost of private health insurance. How does putting up so many prices by increasing taxes help to reduce inflation?",19
7,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question, because the truth is that in this budget we cut taxes as a share of the economy. We cut taxes and we reined in the reckless spending of those opposite. It was their reckless spending that put upward pressure on inflation and that produced eight interest rate rises in the last three years. And now they want to do it again. They want to raid the surplus. This afternoon in the Senate they are going to start that process of raiding the surplus. They are going to move against our initiatives that are so important to build a strong surplus, to combat inflation and to put downward pressure on interest rates. I think it is pretty clear, going by the remarks of the member for Wentworth, that he must be the author of this strategy. He is the author of the strategy for the $284 million raid on the surplus that will take place if they delay all of these measures in the Senate at four o'clock this afternoon. We have had some advice on where the member for Wentworth is getting his advice. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Wentworth asked a very specific question, and I might add that, if the Treasurer does not know how to answer it, then we can ask",19
8,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for North Sydney cannot spoil his points of order by going into debate. If his point of order is relevance, I indicate to the member for North Sydney that I will be listening very the carefully to the rest of the Treasurer's response. The Treasurer.",19
9,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have built a strong surplus in this budget. The Rudd government has built a $22 billion surplus to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. This opposition irresponsibly and recklessly wants to raid that surplus in the Senate this afternoon at 4 pm. Of course, the member for Wentworth is the author of the strategy. Mr Hockey- Mr SPEAKER ",19
10,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. I have indicated that I will listen carefully to the Treasurer's response, and I am listening carefully to the Treasurer's response.",19
11,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We do have some advice as to where the member for Wentworth gets his positions from, and I think those opposite will be very interested. Last Wednesday, 11 July, at 140 Coppins Street, Richmond, there was a focus group.",19
12,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order in relation to relevance. The question is about a $20 billion tax increase and its impact on inflation.",19
13,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,20
14,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! When those on my right come to order. I will have to ask the Leader of the Opposition to state his point of order again.,20
15,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on relevance, the question is about the impact of the government's $20 billion tax increase on inflation.",20
16,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member will resume his seat. The Treasurer will respond to the question and the Treasurer has the call.,20
17,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am explaining where the member for Wentworth gets his advice to raid the surplus in the Senate at 4 pm this afternoon.,20
18,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The Treasurer was not asked about",20
19,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Cook will resume his seat. We have had the point of order on relevance. I am listening carefully to the Treasurer's response. If he were not being interrupted, I would hope that he would get to the end of the response quicker. The Treasurer has the call.",20
20,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This focus group was conducted by Millward Brown, who work with Crosby Textor. Either he is paying for research on himself or the Liberal Party is doing it, but either way the Leader of the Opposition does not know about it. These were the questions that were asked of the focus group. Mr Hockey interjecting",20
21,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for North Sydney is not assisting. I see that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is rising on a point of order. If it is on relevance, I have ruled and I am listening to the Treasurer. The Treasurer will bring his response to a conclusion. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr SPEAKER ",20
22,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the point of order is on relevanceMs Julie Bishop-I have not answered that yet, Mr Speaker.",20
23,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is it a different point of order? Ms Julie Bishop-It is further to the point of order on relevance.,20
24,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have ruled on the point of order. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. There have been successive points of order on relevance. I am listening to the Treasurer and I hope that he is now bringing his response to a conclusion.,20
25,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am referring to the member for Wentworth's budget-in-reply speech that he gave in this House. He managed to get a focus group organised to ask them what they thought of it. Do you know what the next question was? It was: what did they think of his website? The next question was: what did they think of his resume?,20
26,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Treasurer will bring his answer to a close. The member for North Sydney, who is rising, will resume his seat. The Treasurer will bring his response to a close. Mr Hockey-This is not a question; it is a point of order on relevance.",20
27,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. Has the Treasurer completed? If not, he will bring his response to a close.",20
28,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Certainly. My point is this: the member for Wentworth thinks his resume and his website are more important than the fight against inflation,20
29,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Treasurer will resume his seat. The member for Wentworth will resume his seat. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, it's on relevance.",21
30,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The response has concluded. NA,21
31,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"We have in the gallery today the former Speaker Stephen Martin. He is the former member for Macarthur and former member for Cunningham. At this point in time if we could swap positions I would be happy. We warmly welcome him to the House today. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA",21
32,Ms CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the reason why it is important that the government's inflationfighting surplus is left intact?,21
33,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question, because the government is building a strong surplus of $22 billion to fight inflation and to put downward pressure on interest rates. We had the Reserve Bank minutes released earlier today and they put the position that the fight against inflation remains a very key challenge for this nation-a very important challenge. I will just quote the minutes. They said: ... over the past year, inflation had picked up to an uncomfortably high rate, against a background of limited spare capacity and earlier strong growth in demand. As we know, there have been 20 Reserve Bank warnings over a long period of time about bottlenecks in the economy-about capacity constraints-which were ignored by those opposite. That put upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates. Of course, it fell to us from day one to take up this fight against inflation-an inflation legacy left to us by those opposite, who sat around the cabinet table and spent like drunken sailors. It has taken us to rein in that reckless spending and to do something about putting some capacity into the economy, which is why their actions in the Senate are so absolutely reckless-because in this country we do need to tackle inflation to put downward pressure on interest rates, because it is inflation that eats away at the living standards of families and strangles growth. They are completely irresponsible. Grocery Prices",21
34,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the TreasBudget urer to his recent newsletter, in which he advises people on how to reduce grocery prices. Amongst the Treasurer's top 10 tips are: shop for specials",21
35,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,21
36,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will resume his seat. Those on my right and some on my left are not assisting.,21
37,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I go to the Treasurer's tips for reducing grocery prices: shop for specials, compare prices, shop during quiet periods, challenge the store manager",21
38,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,21
39,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. When the House comes to order we will continue.,21
40,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The fifth tip is: Ask for products not on the shelf. Can the Treasurer advise whether his 10 top tips for reducing grocery prices will form the basis of the government's ‘grocery watch' stunt?,21
41,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,21
42,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Whilst the last part of the question brought in too much argument, the Treasurer will respond to the question.",22
43,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition just demonstrated how terminally out of touch every one of those people over there is-absolutely terminally out of touch. Mr Dutton-Just look at the body language. He thinks you're a dud.,22
44,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Dickson is warned! The Treasurer has the call. The question has been asked; the Treasurer is responding.,22
45,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have conducted a price watch in my electorate since 1993-well over a decade-and, do you know what, it is one of the ways I stay in touch with my electorate, absolutely, and it is how people like you get so out of touch; it is how those oppofind site get so out of touch. They do not have a clue what life is like around the kitchen table. They have not got the faintest idea. And it is because they are so out of touch that they brought in Work Choices. Only somebody terminally out of touch could bring in Work Choices to rip away at the wages and working conditions of Australian working families. They have learnt nothing at all. They have demonstrated they are completely out of touch with the lives of average Australians. If they think that the average Australian who goes shopping thinks that those tips are ludicrous or laughable, they have not got a clue about what is going on in Australia. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I seek to table the government's ‘grocery watch' scheme. Leave not granted. Budget",22
46,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Minister, how will the government's fiscal policy assist in the fight against high inflation and high interest rates? And, Minister, what are the consequences of this policy not being implemented?",22
47,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Inflation in Australia is currently at a 16-year high, at a rate of 4.2 per cent. What that means is that ordinary Australians throughout the country are experiencing rising prices in supermarkets. It appears I have to remind the opposition about or perhaps introduce them to the concept of what a special is because clearly they appear to have no idea. Ordinary Australian working people do know what specials arethere are little labels on the shelves underneath the product with the word ‘special' and a price on it-and they have to look for specials because prices are rising. So perhaps you might want to do a little bit of a trip to the supermarkets of Australia yourselves to out how most Australian working people actually live. It is crucial that we have a tough fiscal position, a strong budget, to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. That is why the government has delivered a $22 billion surplus and that is why we brought spending down from a growth rate of five per cent in the last budget, delivered by the member for Higgins, to a rate of one per cent, and that is why it is crucial that the government's budget legislation is passed in the Senate. Some of the items that the opposition is proposing to block would blow a giant hole in the surplus, and even delaying the key initiatives in the budget-things like the condensate excise initiative, the luxury car tax, the means test for family payments-will blow a significant hole in the surplus; in fact, Treasury calculates about $284 million simply from that delay. The opposition has taken an ultra-populist line in response to the budget. They have thrown responsibility out the window. They are feeling everybody's pain: the teenagers who are losing their access to cheap alcopops, the foreigners who are paying more for their visas, the big resource companies who are losing their tax breaks, the millionaires who are losing their family payments-the opposition is feeling their pain. Yesterday I urged the opposition to heed the wise words of the member for Higginsadmittedly, they were from 12 years agoand, sadly, it appears that I spoke too soon, because it appears that the honourable member for Higgins has joined the irresponsible populist bandwagon too, which is a source of great distress to me. In today's Financial Review there is an interview with the member for Higgins where it states that he ‘warned against an excessive short-term response' to inflation and pointed out that when the CPI had gone negative he did not pump up the economy. Therefore, by implication, if the CPI-the consumer price index-the rate of inflation, goes above the Reserve Bank's target zone, then there is no reason for tightening the budget, there is no reason for strengthening the surplus. Perhaps, as he is the architect of the wasteful, profligate, growing-too-fast budget that this government inherited-the 2007 budgetwith five per cent real growth in the middle of a mining boom, perhaps I expected too much from the member for Higgins. Although I certainly do not welcome his recent conversion to the cause of fiscal incontinence, I do note that there is something else happening with the member for Higgins. He has been working hard on his application to join the book club. After all these years of pouring scorn and vitriol on people who write, he has decided, belatedly, he wants to join the book club. As a member of the book club, including, I am sure, various other members-the Treasurer and so on-we welcome the interest of the member for Higgins, but there is one word of caution: we write about issues. It is a pretty safe bet that the member for Higgins's book is going to be about ‘me, me, me' and that will be the end of it. It certainly will not have any serious savings initiatives. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. How is this relevant to the question that was asked of the minister?",22
48,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister for Finance and Deregulation will return to the question.,23
49,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition's response to the budget has been all over the place. Their position changes virtually on a daily basis. They are sniping at most of the major initiatives but relentlessly avoiding taking responsibility for the wider picture and relentlessly avoiding taking any clear position on the inflation problem and what the fiscal settings in this nation should be. This is the core question they have to answer-indeed, it is the core question the member for Higgins should be asked to answer: what fiscal settings would be appropriate for dealing with the inflation problem? The government will not be diverted from our task of putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. We intend to do everything necessary and everything possible to preserve the integrity of the surplus and to ensure we have a strict, responsible budget position. Unlike the opposition, who appear not to know what specials in supermarkets are, we understand the pressures that ordinary families in this country are under, we understand the rising prices that they are having to pay and we understand the importance of getting inflation under control. The opposition are putting this at risk-they are putting the government's efforts to put downward pressure on inflation and get the inflation problem under control at risk by their actions in the Senate. They should think again. They should act responsibly in the interests of working people in this country. Child Care",23
50,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Which of the government's powers is she proposing to use to penalise childcare price rises such as 10 per cent by ABC Learning Centres and 13 per cent by Warringah council? Does she think that these price rises are fair and can she explain how publishing childcare prices on a government website is going to keep them down?,24
51,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Warringah for his question. Obviously the government are a substantial player in the childcare market, and we have a range of policy levers at our disposal because we are a substantial player in the childcare market. On the supply side, the levers at the government's disposal include our election commitment to introduce up to 260 new childcare centres. That is a significant contribution to the childcare industry and the childcare market as we know it. In terms of the locations of those centres, we are looking at establishing new centres in areas where the market is not working. One of the reasons that the market may be perceived to be not working in an area is that there are higher fees than in other locations. When we are working out who should be the providers for those new centres we are obviously going to be assessing diversity of provision and equity of access, including through new private and/or community partners. Significantly, when we are selecting the providers for these new centres, a track record of affordability will be taken into account. So it cant policy stream, a significant policy measure, which will make a difference for childcare centres. On the demand side of course we have introduced, through the recent budget, an increase in the childcare tax rebate, which-as I presume the member opposite appreciates-is not income tested. So that is a significant measure on the demand side to assist working families. We are of course reviewing the regulation in the sector to ensure national consistency in quality standards and licensing. Finally, as part of this suite of policy measures, we are looking at the transparency and indeed acting on the transparency of the sector. This is actually implementing a pre-election commitment. I know that it is not fashionable amongst the Liberal Party members to implement pre-election commitments; it is fashionable to make them, to describe them as rock solid, rolled gold and all that sort of thing and then to back down on them later. The member for Warringah would probably remember all about that from the last parliament. I know it is not fashionable with the member for Warringah to make an election commitment and then actually implement it, but the government committed before the election to a major transparency measure to make sure that parents had access to information about fees, availability of places and quality standards. I think the thing that members opposite should be reflecting on, as they show throughout this question time just how out of touch they are, is what a track record of failure it is that, after 12 years in government, they left a situation where parents looking for child care could not get ready information on fees, availability or quality. That is the situation they left after 12 years of inaction; and, as part of a suite of measures dealing with affordability, accessibility and qualis a signifiity, we are acting on it.",24
52,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I just indicate to the member for Warringah that the latter part of the question was asking for an opinion. It could have easily been fixed so that is why I ignored it. When somebody asks a minister whether they think something or other is fair I think that is slightly outside the standing orders. Mr Tuckey interjecting,24
53,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor should not go near the cognitive processes of members. I hope that he does not believe that that was an overly great reflection upon him. Budget,25
54,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. What measures will the government implement from 1 July to help families with the rising cost of petrol and groceries? What is the government's response to market research which has been undertaken on the budget?,25
55,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question because this is a government that does deliver for working families and those finding it tough to make ends meet around the kitchen table. We do understand that, at the end of the week, a lot of people have trouble paying the bills. We absolutely understand why they need to shop for specials. We on this side of the House are absolutely in touch with the fact that people are under tremendous cost-of-living pressure at the moment and that is the reason we are putting so much effort into tackling inflation. That also why we put so much effort in the budget into delivering the tax cuts from 1 July this year-because prices are going up at the supermarket and at the petrol bowser and inflation is high, as the Reserve Bank has indicated again today. On top of that we have this oil shock going on. So many people do have to shop for specials and that is why they need the tax cuts that we are delivering in this budget. In two weeks time, a young couple earning $87,000 a year will have an extra $20 in their pay cheque each week from tax cuts alone. That will help them. That will help them with the rising cost of living. That will help them with rising petrol prices. But it is not just tax cuts. There is a range of measures we are bringing in that were never contemplated by those opposite while they were in government. A typical young family with two young children will be $51 to $54 per week better off as a result of our initiatives, which will kick in in a fortnight. Let us just take child care. From 1 July this year, this young family will receive a 50 per cent rebate for their children's child care, saving them $24 a week. That recognises cost-ofliving pressures. The family will also be eligible for a $375 education tax refundsomething the Liberals never delivered. And the Liberals never delivered on child care either. They made people wait. They make them wait initially for 18 months to get some relief for their out-of-pocket childcare costs. We are delivering in all of those areas. Meanwhile, the shadow Treasurer is sitting around organising focus groups asking questions like: do they think he was an old Liberal or a new Liberal? I think we got the answer today from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: he is an out-of-touch Liberal. The pretender from Point Piper is an out-oftouch Liberal, and he is an out-of-touch Liberal because he does not understand that we is need to fight inflation and we need to do it for all of those people out there that are being hit by the high cost of living. We have to do it; otherwise, they will face permanently higher interest rates. This team opposite left this country with eight interest rate rises in three years-10 in total attributable to them. That is their legacy to the Australian people and they still do not get it-they still do not understand that we have to fight inflation to put downward pressure on interest rates. This government will do it, and they will continue to behave recklessly. For doing that they will be condemned by the Australian people. Education Funding",25
56,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Will the Deputy Prime Minister rule out parents having to pay new levies or higher school fees to help fund the installation and operational costs of the government's promise to put a computer on the desk of every upper secondary school student?,25
57,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted to get a question from the shadow ministerabsolutely delighted-and I certainly will be answering it. Can I say when it comes to the reaction of the Catholic and independent schools sector to the government's recent announcement of computers in schools, rather than rely on the shadow minister I would prefer to rely on Bill Daniels, the Executive Director of the Independent Schools Council of Australia, and Monsignor Tom Doyle of the National Catholic Education Commission, who have both welcomed this new investment. This new investment was made into schools that applied and were invited to apply because they had a student-tocomputer ratio of one to eight or worse-the legacy of the Liberal Party to Australian students in those schools. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question was about whether parents will have to pay new levies or higher school fees as a result of this initiative.",26
58,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The question is to do with the program of instituting computers to upper secondary schools. Over many, many years, despite those who asked the questions believing that they require yes/no answers or the like, that has not been the way in which the relevance test has been used in this place. The Deputy Prime Minister will respond to the question.",26
59,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Can I answer the honourable member's question this way. Before the election of the Rudd Labor government, independent and Catholic schools were funding the introduction of computers wholly and solely through fees and fundraising. What are they doing now? They have a government that has a National Secondary School Computer Fund of $1.2 billion that is working with them. There was no dedicated fund for computers in schools prior to this government. Prior to this government, schools were left to their own devices. There was no dedicated focus, no care or concern from members opposite about computers in schools-absolutely nothing of substance happening. Here is a government that has come along and is prepared to work in partnership with schools with a $1.2 billion investment. What I can certainly say to members opposite is we understand that schools want assistance from government to get computers into schools. We are providing it and there is no-one on this side of the parliament that is so out of touch that they would utter a statement like that uttered by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She said: … I'm yet to see a school that is not well served with computers. There is no-one over here that out of touch. We understand schools want assistance, and we are providing it. Same-Sex Relationships",26
60,Mr DANBY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Attorney-General. Will the Attorney General inform the House of what the government is doing to remove discrimination against Australians in same-sex relationships, under Commonwealth superannuation laws? Attorney, are there any obstacles to these moves to remove this discrimination?",26
61,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question; he has been a long-time advocate for the removal of discrimination. Three weeks ago I introduced the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth LawsSuperannuation) Bill. That bill will do nothing more and nothing less than remove discrimination against a group of Australians who for far too long have suffered an injustice and, moreover, will remove discrimination suffered by children brought up in those households. Many members will be disappointed to learn that today the opposition has used its numbers in the Senate to delay passage of this legislation by referring it to a committee without any end date and specifically with a provision that it will not report until subsequent legislation is introduced and considered. ",26
62,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The legislation will not undermine marriage. Both sides of this House have supported legislation that confirms marriage is between a man and a woman; it is the position of both parties. Indeed, so much was acknowledged by the shadow Attorney-General when he was asked about it in a radio interview on 5 June. The question was: Could you answer me and our listeners really, really simply, how a change in a piece of legislapresentation. tion regarding superannuation will in any way question or challenge or chip away at the tion of marriage? And the reply from the shadow Attorney General was an honest: I don't think it will. One of the main reasons the opposition has referred the legislation to a committee is because of its proposal to have coverage of people in close personal relationships-the example given was of two elderly sisters living together and caring for each other. But we have made it perfectly clear our purpose is to remove discrimination as a matter of principle, and in that process there will most certainly be winners and losers. For instance, two elderly sisters on the age pension would each currently receive $546.80 per fortnight. If, as the opposition proposes, they are recognised as a couple under Commonwealth laws then each would receive $456.80 per fortnight. In other words, they would be $180 worse off per fortnight. Indeed, they would also lose $500 per year in a utilities allowance. We would certainly ask the opposition to have regard to that. They made great play earlier in the year at the prospect of carers suffering a reduction in benefits; this is most clearly something that would reduce the benefits to carers by about $180 per fortnight. There is no question that this delay will cause hardship. It is inappropriate in these matters to be overly dramatic or emotional, but it is unquestionably the case that there is a prospect of superannuants dying before this legislation is passed and their partners or their children being deprived of the benefits of the legislation. Perhaps to avoid embarrassment, perhaps indicating some goodwill on the part of members opposite, it has been proposed that it can be backdated-indeed, I heard an interjection to that effect during my But the trouble with that is that we are talking about reversionary benefits, institubenefits that are paid fortnightly or monthly-in other words, sustaining the family-that are a regular income for the family. The delay would effectively deprive or create a hiatus in the income of that family unless and until that legislation is passed. It would also introduce very complex issues with respect to recovery. The law, as I understand it, is that trustees are required to make payments; they have a duty to make payments under the law as it currently stands, and in circumstances where that law was subsequently changed there are very complicated issues regarding recovery. In short: this law will do nothing more and nothing less than remove discrimination against a group of Australians and their children who have suffered an injustice for far too long. Indeed, I think that was recognised, in fairness to him, by the member for Sturt in his contribution in the debate. I would again implore those opposite to support the expeditious passage of this legislation. Workplace Relations",27
63,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the fact that over 42,000 working days have been lost due to strikes and industrial action in the first three months of this year, which is almost as many as were lost in the entire previous 12 months. Would the Prime Minister explain to the House why there has been such a significant increase in strikes and industrial action under this Labor government?",28
64,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When you are dealing with enterprise bargaining, it follows that these things come in seasons and in sequence. Obviously there will be tips up and tips down in the level of industrial activity. That is the first point. The second point is this: those opposite, having had 12 years to act on the undersupply of skilled labour in this market, should have thought clearly what the consequences were for the economy overall. After all, they received 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank of Australia about infrastructure bottlenecks and skill shortages. They failed to act systematically, and as a result we have these factors at work in the economy today. As a result of that, it does alter the overall bargaining equation. We believe, through the industrial relations system that the government is introducing based on the dual principles of fairness and flexibility, that we will have at its core productivity based wage increases-best for the economy, best for workers, best for global competitiveness. If those opposite, after 12 years, could not act more effectively on providing enough skills for the economy given its long-term needs, then they should hang their heads in shame. Education Funding",28
65,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on the reaction to the first round of the digital education revolution?",28
66,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Canberra for her question and I also thank her for participating in the launch of the first round of the government's digital education revolution, which happened on 12 June. Through that first round, 896 schools will receive 116,000 computers, including 1,600 for 13 schools in the member for Canberra's own electorate. This is a $116 million investment, the first instalment of our $1.2 billion commitment to bring secondary schools into the 21st century. I thank the member for Lowe for handing to me during the course of question time a letter from one of his principals, Maxine Kohler of the MCDonald College. This letter says: I would like to thank you and the federal government for including the MCDonald College in the first round of the national secondary school computer rollout. The 86 additional computers will make a very valuable contribution to the learning of our students and the staff is excited about the prospect of this additional education investment. Of course, those words of praise join words of praise from teachers and principals around the country. I was also assisted in the launch of the first round of the digital education revolution by the member for Maribyrnong. I would like to thank him for his participation. At the school we visited, the principal, David Adamson, welcomed the 529 computers his school will receive, saying: We have been held back by a lack of facilities, and this is going to accelerate our progress. This commentary joins the commentary of the Ulverstone High School principal, who said of their 113 new computers: I reckon it's one of those things where any big investment does make a difference. The principal of the Corio Bay Senior College said: Most of our current computers are very old, which makes it difficult for any students who are trying to do online research. It's not really sisted learning if the students are sitting twiddling their thumbs. She went on to say how pleased she was that Corio Bay Senior College would get 170 new computers through round 1. The principal of San Clemente High School in New South Wales, Tony Kelly, said of the 117 new computers his school will receive: There's no way in the world we could have afforded to pay for them. Bruce Armstrong, the principal of Balwyn High School, described the 533 new computers his school will receive as an exciting opportunity. We also received positive comments from teachers. Victor Davidson, for example, from Birrong Girls High School, said: We've got 210 computers. Now I feel assured my work to get students to engage in ICT is worthwhile. Of course, these words of praise from principals and students echo the words of praise from the leaders of the Independent Schools of Australia and the National Catholic Education Commission, Mr Bill Daniels and Monsignor Tom Doyle respectively, both of whom welcomed this new investment. When we line it up, what do we see? We see the leaders in education welcoming this investment. We see principals welcoming this investment. We see teachers welcoming this investment. We certainly saw some very excited students on launch day welcoming this investment. The only people who are whingeing and carping about this sit over there: the members of the Liberal Party. Amazingly, we have had people like the member for Wannon complaining even though six schools in his electorate will get 280 computers in this first round. The member for Paterson has been complaining, saying that his schools have been ‘shortchanged' despite the fact that 10 schools in ashis electorate will receive a total of 1,392 there computers. One can only imagine what he thought of the performance of his own government on the basis of that. The member for La Trobe has also complainedMr Wood interjecting",28
67,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for La Trobe!,29
68,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"despite receiving 269 computers for schools in his electorate. This whingeing, carping and moaning is from an out-of-touch opposition that sailed through 12 years of governmentMr Wood interjecting",29
69,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for La Trobe is warned!,29
70,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"with education ministers who used to say things like: ... I'm yet to see a school that is not well served with computers. Those opposite might be living in a bubble, be out of touch and be unable to join in the spirit of enthusiasm for the digital education revolution, but people who lead schools and who teach in schools understand this is a worthwhile investment. I thank them for working with the government to change our classrooms into 21st century classrooms. Small Business",29
71,Mr CIOBO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the recent Sensis survey of 1,800 small businesses which shows that the number of small businesses that believe the government's policies support them has plummeted from 46 per cent to only 10 per cent. Prime Minister, which of the government's antismall-business policies will be changed to reverse this dramatic decline in small business confidence in the government?",29
72,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you were out there in the business community and had copped 10 successive interest rate rises in a row courtesy of the fiscal indiscipline of those opposite, it would have an effect on your confidence as well. It does not just affect people on mortgages, important as that Mr Ciobo- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order of relevance. The question was very",30
73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. The member for Moncrieff will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is starting his reply. I will listen to carefully, but the Prime Minister has just started.",30
74,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. Firstly, there is an impact on confidence after 10 interest rate rises in a row; and, secondly, when this government assumed office, inflation was running at a 16year high, and that has an effect on confidence as well. The flow-through effect of that in terms of activity and unemployment, unless you actually turn things around, is there for all to see. That is why this government is committed to undertaking a policy based on fiscal discipline, fiscal rectitude and a $22 billion surplus, in contrast to those opposite, who are in the process of conducting a $22 billion raid. Beyond that, the government can also embark upon a serious program of business deregulation. I draw the attention of honourable members to the work currently underway by the minister for small business through the Council of Australian Governments looking at key critical questions of the compatibility of business regulation right across Australia. For 12 years in office, those opposite had ample opportunity through the Council of Australian Governments to do something cooperative with the states on the business deregulation agenda. If you are a small business trying to become a medium-sized business and operating in one, two or three states, one of the huge barriers to entry is practical questions like the conflicting arrangements for the registration of business names and other conflicting business regulatory arrangements. This government has actually taken this challenge seriously. Currently-before the relevant working group of COAG-we are examining 27 separate items of legislation and regulation which impact right across the business community. That is a practical course of action which we have embarked upon in our first six months in it office. After 12 years in office, they had done zip. Alcohol Abuse",30
75,Ms REA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Home Affairs. Will the minister please update the House on police views on binge drinking?,30
76,Mr DEBUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bonner for her question and indicate that last week I attended the regular national meeting of police ministers and police commissioners. There was there unanimous agreement that alcohol related violence and binge drinking is the single biggest drain on police resources across the country, particularly on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. One police minister spoke of a recent visit to Los Angeles, where law enforcement authorities apparently expressed amazement that so many Australian venues have 5 am liquor licences. That is something that we are hearing more concern about from our local communities. Mr Simpkins interjecting",30
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Cowan is warned!,31
78,Mr DEBUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In March, the day after the Prime Minister announced a new national strategy to address the binge drinking epidemic, the police commissioner in New South Wales, Andrew Scipione, said that any move to tackle alcohol abuse was a ‘wise investment'. He described that abuse as an enormous national problem and he said that 70 per cent of every police engagement with a member of the community in the streets of New South Wales has alcohol as a factor. That is an astounding statistic. Recent research shows that the New South Wales Police Force spends the equivalent of the salaries of 1,000 full-time constables just to deal with alcohol related issues. Two weeks ago, Commissioner Scipione said drinking habits have changed. There had been what he called a normalisation of binge drinking, with many young Australians now going out determined to get drunk whatever the consequences, and that involved both men and women. The commissioner pointed out that he was not himself a wowser. He said it was, however, time to listen to the community and to work to change the drinking culture. Those comments were echoed by commissioners and commanders across the country. Young people who binge drink think they are bulletproof. Young men get into fights and young women are left vulnerable to sexual predators. The link between alcohol use and road trauma is also well known. There is a wealth of evidence to show that a substantial proportion of assaults are alcohol related. A trends and issues paper by the Australian Institute of Criminology is to be released later this month and it will show that recorded assaults have increased steadily over the past 10 years by over 40 per cent. There is recent research which conservatively estimates that alcohol related crime in Australia costs $1.7 billion a year. Nobody wants to spoil the enjoyment of having a few drinks, but moderate consumption is not the problem. Police commissioners have praised the government's recent decision to increase the tax on premixed drinks. We cannot ignore advice from officers who are in the front line dealing with a major national problem. Frankly, criticism of any measure to reduce binge drinking is very hard to fathom. A definition of binge drinking can indeed only assist responsible drinking. Northern Australia",31
79,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The minister would be aware that 300 million megalitres of Australia's water is in Northern Australia and only 80 million megalitres is in the south. In light of the depressing reality that the north uses only one per cent of this water and provides less than five per cent of agricultural production, could the minister discuss with local councils a small developmental loan fund, secured and guaranteed by Queensland government land resumed for irrigation purposes? Finally, is the minister aware that just two million of the six million hectares of black soil destroyed by the prickly acacia weed will, with sugar and some grain, increase Australia's beef production and, with a green car, provide Australia's oil requirements indefinitely?",31
80,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for the question. The issues that he raises are particularly important issues at a time when the nation is experiencing such drought, and they were among the issues that came up at the 2020 Summit. At the 2020 Summit significant discussion took place about the fact that we do have so much more water in the north of the nation and we are experiencing such severe drought in the south of the nation. Of course, it is not simply a case of shifting the agriculture and transplanting it from one part of the country to the other, for the obvious reason that in the north of the country overwhelmingly the rain that does fall falls in particular months of the year and you then have knock-on impacts in terms of what can be grown there with soils as well as one of the critical problems being the increased proliferation of pests and diseases in the north of the country. There has been success with respect to agriculture for some time, with mangoes being grown in the north of the country outside of the sugar regions themselves. More recently, there have been expansions of industries such as the peanut industry across Northern Australia. So it is an issue not simply in Queensland but across the whole of Northern Australia. I have been talking at length and am still working through some proposals with the member for Brand, who has policy carriage in this area in his role as Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia. Some of these opportunities may also be advanced in having plant varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases through the development of some GMOs, genetically modified organisms. There may be some further opportunities in the north of Australia coming out of that. With respect to the proliferation of weeds, I am pleased the honourable member refers to the fact that you can actually get around the food versus fuel argument through biofuel options which do provide very real outcomes at the same time in terms of beef production. These are issues that the government is still working through. The honourable member is aware, with respect to biofuels, of some of the work I have reported to the House previously, which is being jointly done by the Minister for Resources and Energy and me. Aviation: Open Skies Policy",31
81,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"3.08 pm)My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Will the minister advise the House of recent achievements in developing an open skies agreement between Australia and the European Union?",32
82,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wills for his question. Last Friday the aviation relationship between Australia and the European Union, Australia's largest aviation market, took a significant step forward. European transport ministers approved a mandate for the European Commission to negotiate an EU-wide comprehensive air services agreement with Australia. I welcome this decision as an important step towards a historic open skies agreement which could deliver greater competition, more flights and lower airfares between Australia and EU countries. It is a step that could never have been secured by the previous government. The decision of the Rudd Labor government to ratify the Kyoto protocol was clearly instrumental in achieving a shift in European opinion and a shift in the European agreement to this mandate. An EU-wide comprehensive air services agreement could remove many if not all of the existing limitations for Australian and European airlines operating between Australia and the EU. The Rudd government has actively pursued an open skies agreement and it was discussed when the Prime Minister met with the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, in Brussels in April of this year. More recently, I hosted a lunch in Parliament House on 5 May where the potential open skies agreement with the EU was discussed with Mr Bruno Julien, the Ambassador and Head of Delegation of the European Commission to Australia and New Zealand, and Mr Francois Descoueyte, the French Ambassador to Australia. Of course, France takes over the presidency of the EU from 1 July. In order to progress the important open skies agreement with the EU, I will be travelling in July to meet with the EU and with the French and German transport ministers. Recent progress with Europe builds on the Rudd government's success in concluding an open skies agreement with the United States. It has been only three months since the Prime Minister signed the Australia-US open skies agreement and the benefits of competition are already being felt. This has the potential to lead to cheaper airfares and a greater variety of cities served. This is a win for consumers, a win for the tourism industry and a win for the Australian aviation industry. Achieving an international air services policy which serves our national interest is a key issue being considered in the development of the government's aviation white paper, which will be finalised by mid-2009. Member for Robertson",32
83,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement at a press conference in Japan on 9 June, in answer to questions about the member for Robertson, when the Prime Minister said: ... I understand my office has been in contact. ... I understand she has issued a statement ... Given that the member for Robertson did not issue a statement until the following afternoon of 10 June, what involvement did the Prime Minister's office have in the preparation of that statement?",33

86,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I just can't. You are asking me about events last week. It is just the truth. We are talking about the events of a week or so ago. I was in Japan and there were events unfolding back here. What I know for a fact is as follows. My statement at the time was that it appeared that there had been an unacceptable pattern of behaviour in relation to the honourable member. Furthermore, I indicated that the honourable member had agreed that there would be appropriate counselling. Furthermore, I said that it would be proper for all members of parliament to reflect on the fact that no-one is guaranteed of a future in this place. Those have been my consistent comments on this matter since then. They remain my position now and I await the outcome, as all honourable members do, of the police investigation. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was referring to a press conference on 9 June, not 11 June.",33
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. Afghanistan  is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister outline the role Australia is playing in development and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan?,33
88,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I was And pleased last week to represent Australia at the successful International Support Conference for Afghanistan in Paris. That conference very much underlined the Australian government's approach, which is that in Afghanistan we need to secure two things: firstly, peace and security through combat or military enforcement action; and, secondly, to build the Afghan nation through civil reconstruction. The conference in Paris was a very necessary step in aligning the civilian contribution and the military contribution and an important follow-up to the Bucharest NATO summit. It sent a strong message of international community commitment to Afghanistan's rebuilding, reconstruction and development. Nearly US$20 billion was pledged, including a $250 million contribution from Australia, which of course is in addition to our troop commitment in the south of the Afghanistan, part of which involves a reconstruction task force. Australia joined with the international community in making the point that the time has now come for the Afghan government itself to assume a greater responsibility in administration of civil reconstruction and to assume a greater responsibility in addressing the major threats to Afghanistan's stability. I made the point to the conference and generally that Australia saw four main threats to Afghanistan's reconstruction: firstly, the ongoing security situation; secondly, the need for the Afghan government to ensure good governance; thirdly, the essential need for building the capacity of state institutions; and, finally, the need to address and attack Afghanistan's significant narcotics problem. The conference underlined these things and also made the point that, in addition to an enhanced international community commitment to this civil reconstruction, there needs to be greater coordination of international efforts. The conference expressed its very strong support for the United Nations Special Representative, Mr Kai Eide, in his role. In the course of the conference I had the opportunity of speaking to Mr Eide and also the Secretary General of NATO, my foreign minister counterparts from the United Kingdom, France, Pakistan and Italy and the Secretary of State of the United States. In these meetings I emphasised Australia's long-term commitment to Afghanistan, including the essential need to parallel-track both military enforcement action and civil reconstruction. I also emphasised Australia's very significant concern about the potential deleterious consequences to our troops in the south of Afghanistan near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. It is quite clear that the potentially deteriorating situation on the AfghanistanPakistan border is a matter which is now of necessary interest not just to Afghanistan and Pakistan but also to the region and the international community generally. I indicated that Australia pledged $250 million for civil reconstruction. We particularly see that as occurring in agriculture, good governance, law enforcement and cathe pacity-building of state institutions. My attendance at the conference as Australia's representative followed upon a trip to Afghanistan, where I had the opportunity of having discussions with the new Commander of the International Security Assistance Force, General MCKiernan, about the implementation of the political and military strategy from Bucharest and also the prospects for civil reconstruction. It is true to say that the work being done by Australian troops-both in a military sense and also in a reconstruction sense-in Oruzgan province in southern Afghanistan is very much appreciated by the international security forces and very much admired by NATO members and the international community. In conclusion, I welcome very much the recent announcements from NATO states that their military commitment is being upgraded. I welcome very much the announcement overnight by the British Secretary of State for Defence, Des Browne, of the increase in the United Kingdom's contribution in Afghanistan, which is its largest military contribution. I welcome very much the announcement by the Italian Foreign Minister that the so-called caveats applied to the deployment of Italian forces will now be made significantly more flexible, and I welcomed this in my discussions with Foreign Minister Frattini. It is unambiguously the case that Australia's long-term commitment in Afghanistan, both militarily and in civil reconstruction, in our national interest. There is absolutely no doubt that it is also in the international community's interest. There is no doubt that Afghanistan, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area, is currently the international hotbed of terrorism. And that terrorism is potentially quickly mobile-to the north and west for Europe and to the south and east for Asia and Australia. That is why Australia's ongoing, long-term, enduring commitment to Afghanistan is of both a military enforcement and civil reconstruction nature. Member for Robertson",33
89,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement at his press conference in Japan on 11 June. In answer to questions about the member for Robertson, he said: There appears to be a pattern of unacceptable behaviour here. Will the Prime Minister explain what he meant by ‘a pattern of unacceptable behaviour'? Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. That question is clearly outside the standing orders. The statement speaks for itself, and the question is out of order.",35
90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wants to speak to the point of order, I will allow her to do so. At the moment, I see it as being similar to a couple of questions from yesterday, but I will allow the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to approach the box.

The question is not in relation to the behaviour of the member for Robertson; it is is in relation to what the Prime Minister saidhis own statement in relation to his actions.",35

As I said yesterday, I am trying to be consistent with the rulings that I have given-and, to be consistent with the rulings that I have given, I would have to rule it out of order.

99,Mr HOCKEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"No, it is not overreached. Mr Speaker, I move dissent from your ruling about ruling that question out of order. Page 538 of the House of Representatives Practice nowhere precludes asking a question about the Prime Minister's own words. Mr Albanese-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: as I understand it, your last ruling was to give the Deputy Leader of the Opposition an opportunity to rephrase her question. Is the dissent being moved in that position?",36

101,Mr HOCKEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I am moving dissent from your ruling because you have broken all practice in relation to this. There is a litany of examples where there has been a range of specific questionsMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the dissent motion that the member for North Sydney has to speak on is your ruling relating to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He failed to move dissent when you ruled the question out of order. He failed to move dissent at that point in time. It was available to him. He chose not to do so. You then made a ruling, and he then moved dissent from that ruling.",36
102,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"The Leader of the House will resume his seat, and the member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The ruling I gave was that the question was out of order. It is not a ruling when I then offer the opportunity to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to rephrase her question.",36
103,Mr HOCKEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I am reluctant to move dissent in this situation, but I make the point that you have broken new ground as Speaker in relation to questions that are available to the opposition. When we cannot ask the Prime Minister a direct question about public comments he made as Prime Minister about the behaviour of one of his own members, then this parliament is reduced to a shambles by that sort of ruling. There is a rich history in this place over the last 12 years of questions that have been asked in relation to individual members of parliament and in relation to the Prime Minister's discussions with those members of parliament. If you are relying on page 538 of the House of Representatives Practice, I refer you to questions that were asked in September 2007 in this parliament by the member for Brisbane. There was a question about the behaviour of the members for Bonner, Bowman and Moreton and the police investigation in relation to that. Why at that time did the Speaker allow questions to be asked about a police investigation when you, Sir, ruled them out of order yesterday? I will go one step further. In September 2007 the now Leader of the House asked a question of the then Speaker about the printing entitlements and the police investigation relating to the members for Bonner, Bowman and Moreton. It goes further. In 2001 the Labor opposition asked almost 20 questions without notice in this House regarding Ian Macfarlane, the member for Groom, and the application of a GST by his own federal political party. That is assumed to be a breach of page 538 of the House of Representatives Practice but-do you know what?-the Speaker allowed those questions to be asked. Furthermore, in March 2005 the Labor opposition asked five questions without notice in this House about the behaviour of Senator Ross Lightfoot, a member of the Senate. They asked a question to the Prime Minister about what Senator Lightfoot had done and the Speaker at that time allowed those questions to be asked. I might also note that the member for Griffith-the now Prime Minister, who is walking out of the chamber; he is running away-asked a question. The member for Griffith asked a question about Senator Lightfoot. He was allowed to ask that question in the chamber. The Speaker allowed that to proceed. Then, if you are relying on page 538 of the House of Representatives Practice, Mr Speaker, in February 2005 the Labor opposition asked four questions without notice about the behaviour of Graeme Hallett, an employee at that time of the then Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads. But, Mr Speaker, yesterday and today you are ruling out questions where we not inquire about the behaviour of the member for Robertson but ask the Prime Minister specifically about what he said to the member for Robertson and what he said publicly about those discussions. Mr Speaker, if we cannot ask those basic questions that go to the heart of democracy about whether a Prime Minister has formed a view about one of his own colleagues, but more significantly if we are not allowed to ask a question about the Prime Minister's own public statements, then we do move dissent from your ruling. We are very concerned about a trend that this is establishing. It is not page 538 of the House of Representatives Practice that you are relying on, Mr Speaker, and it is certainly not the standing orders you are relying on. We cannot find an example where a question to a Prime Minister has been ruled out of order when it goes to the heart of the Prime Minister's own public statements. We cannot find an example of that. This is new ground that you, as Speaker, are treading upon and it cuts to the heart of the value of question time. Mr Speaker, if we still go to page 538 of the House of Representatives Practice, as you, Mr Speaker, appear to be relying on and as the Prime Minister relied on yesterday in relation to police investigations, I note that from November 2005 until May 2007 the member for Griffith, as shadow minister for foreign affairs, joined in in asking 190 questions without notice about issues before a royal commission. Forget the police investigation run by the New South Wales police; the opposition previously asked 190 questions whilst a royal commission was being held on the subject matter. The Speaker at the time allowed those questions to be asked. If we go back to 2002, we see that the Labor opposition asked over 60 questions without notice in the House with regard to the so called ‘children overboard' issue. At that time, the now Minister for Trade specifically referred to staff of the Prime Minister: Tony Nutt and Tony O'Leary. Over the years, the Labor opposition specifically referred to numerous staff-even going back to 1996, when they were asking about travel rorts. But, no, under you as Speaker, we are not allowed to ask questions that involve the staff of a member of parliament or of the Prime Minister. This is a significant issue for this parliament. If you, Mr Speaker, are creating new ground in restricting the questions that can be asked of a Prime Minister about his public statements, it cuts to the heart of the value of this chamber as a chamber of the people. We believe that we have the right-and it goes to the foundations of what this parliament stands for-to ask the Prime Minister questions. We have the right to ask the Prime Minister questions about public statements. We have the right to ask the Prime Minister questions about his duties and responsibilities as Prime Minister. In this case, he made his comments in Japan, as Prime Minister, at a prime ministerial press conference. Furthermore, the Prime Minister has made further statements, even earlier in question time, and the same principle applied to the last question as applies now. But you, Mr Speaker, have two different rulings on the question of admissibility. If we cannot ask questions about an issue that goes to the integrity of a member of parliament-or, indeed, to the integrity of the Prime Minister-then question time is enormously devalued. It also, I might add, affects the impartiality of the chamber. It is a very serious issue. The Prime Minister, in this situation, was asked a specific question about his specific words, his public comments. The specific point, which I made, was: to what was the Prime Minister referring when he said-and it is public-that there was ‘a pattern of unacceptable behaviour'? That goes back to a press conference the Prime Minister had on 11 June, where he said: … there appears to be a pattern of unacceptable behaviour here. The Prime Minister, as Prime Minister, has formed a view. If we are not entitled to ask the Prime Minister why he has formed a view about a member of parliament-and it goes to the heart of his responsibilities as Prime Minister-then what are we doing here? This goes beyond page 538 of the House of Representatives Practice, it goes beyond the standing orders and it cuts to the very heart of democracy. If an opposition cannot ask questions of a Prime Minister, then it devalues not just the Prime Minister and not just the parliament but also the democracy that we all believe in.",36
104,Ms JULIE BISHOP,DISSENT FROM RULING," Mr Speaker, I second the motion. This government and this Prime Minister promised the Australian people that the government would be open, accountable and transparent, essentially inviting the opposition to ask this government and this Prime Minister in question time questions that the Prime Minister would answer in an open, accountable and transparent way. Mr Speaker, today I asked a question, which you allowed, regarding a press conference that the Prime Minister gave in Japan on 9 June-this was my first question. At the press conference, the Prime Minister answered questions about the member for Robertson-and I put that information in my question, which you allowed, and then I quoted the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said: … I understand my office has been in contact, and … I understand that she has issued a statement … Then I asked whether the Prime Minister's office had any involvement in the preparation of that statement. You, Mr Speaker, allowed that question, and the Prime Minister stood up; he got the date wrong and thought it was another press conference, but nevertheless he attempted to give some sort of answer to the question. He said he would go away, work out the timetable and come back. I then asked a second question based on another press conference two days later in Japan, where the Prime Minister, in answer to questions about the member for Robertson, said-and I again quoted him: … there appears to be a pattern of unacceptable behaviour here. I then asked the Prime Minister if he would explain what he meant by ‘a pattern of unacceptable behaviour'. The Prime Minister himself said at that press conference, when he was answering questions about the member for Robertson in public, rebuking her publicly, that his talk with Ms Neal was: … a clear-cut conversation between me as the leader of the parliamentary Labor party, and as the prime minister, and with her as a member of the parliament. So the Prime Minister was telling the world at large that his statements about the member for Robertson were made in his capacity as the Prime Minister of this country. If we are denied the opportunity to ask the Prime Minister of this country what he meant by a phrase he used in a press conference in Japan, then we will have our hands tied for the next 2½ years in the lead-up to the next election. This government promised to be open, transparent and accountable. Mr Speaker, you must not use standing order 100(c) to suggest that the question I asked was anything other than to the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister of this country must answer questions that go to the very essence of his role Prime Minister. He chose to use that opportunity to make a statement in public, at a press conference, about the member for Robertson. The Australian people are entitled to know what he meant by a ‘pattern'. We are not talking about one incident. The Australian people do not have the opportunity to go down to the Lodge or turn up at Kirribilli and ask the Prime Minister, ‘What did you mean by that?' We as the elected representatives of the people of Australia are entitled ask the Prime Minister, ‘What did you mean when you, as the Prime Minister of this country, said at a press conference in Japan that “there appears to be a pattern of unacceptable behaviour”?' The Australian people are entitled to know what he meant. The forum for the Australian people to ask that question is through the elected representatives, in question time, in this chamber. Mr Speaker, this question should not have been ruled out of order, with the greatest respect. We spent time overnight reading your statements yesterday in Hansard and, with the greatest respect, I am cognisant of the statements you made. I sought advice and I spent a lot of time drafting these questions to ensure they did not offend whatever interpretation you, Mr Speaker, put on the standing orders. So we directed the question to the Prime Minister's statement, and you allowed that in question 9. You allowed a question about the Prime Minister's statement and what that statement meant. The statement said that his office had been in contact with the member for Robertson and that he understood the member for Robertson had issued a statement. The fact is she had not issued a statement; therefore, we ask, ‘What did he mean by that? What did he mean by the issuing of that statement?' The second question, question 10, is again in the same form, exactly the same form, as the question that you allowed. Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister as must be required to answer this question. (Time expired)",38
105,Mr ALBANESE,DISSENT FROM RULING," Mr Speaker, I rise for the fourth time to speak in support of your ruling, consistent with the way in which I think any independent observer of this chamber who has looked at the way that you have held yourself in your high office since December would acknowledge: you have carried out your duties in an impartial way to which has brought honour to this chamber. The fact is that this motion is the fourth motion of dissent from your ruling. When there is a bad Newspoll, you can almost, like clockwork, find those opposite performing a stunt in an attempt to distract from their own issues. Mr Speaker, your ruling is absolutely correct. It is consistent with the rulings that you made yesterday. It is consistent with page 538 of House of Representatives Practice. It is consistent with standing order 90, which says: All imputations of improper motives to a Member and all personal reflections on other Members shall be considered highly disorderly. There are avenues open to people in the chamber if they are serious about these issues. Standing order 100(c)(i) states: (c) For questions regarding persons: (i) questions must not reflect or be critical of the character or conduct of a Member ... their conduct may only be challenged on a substantive motion; Standing order 100(d) states: (d) Questions must not contain: (iii) inferences; (iv) imputations; It is quite clear that not only was your ruling correct but, at the time it was made, that ruling was not challenged; it went unchallenged. When parliament last sat, the member opposite, the shadow minister for the environment, was excluded from the chamber for one hour for repeatedly defying your ruling. You then allowed him back into the chamber, a precedent which I do not believe had been made before. That was a generous precedent from you that was not challenged by those opposite. Mr Speaker, you have gone out of your way to be fair in the way that you have presided over this chamber, in spite of the behaviour we have seen from those opposite in moving some 290 points of order, in interrupting almost every second question and in moving dissent motions just because the Manager of Opposition Business did not have a chance to speak. Rather than being the most serious thing that can be done about the conduct of this magnificent chamber, motions of dissent have now become a vehicle for an opportunity for the competitors for Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition to speak. Mr Speaker, it is very clear that your ruling is correct, and that is why it should be upheld. It is clear that the Prime Minister has conducted himself appropriately and dealt with this matter appropriately. The Prime Minister has said that the comments were very inappropriate, that they were out of step with all parliamentary standards past and present. The Prime Minister has said that he strongly believes it was appropriate that the comments be withdrawn. With regard to the police investigation, the Prime Minister has said that it is appropriate that that police investigation take place without political interference and the use of parliamentary privilege to interfere with that, just as the previous Prime Minister did in this chamber. It is extraordinary that this is all the opposition wants to talk about when there are serious long-term challenges facing this nation. We have inflation at 16-year highs, we have Australian families who have had 12 consecutive interest rate increases, yet we have from those opposite an obsession",39
106,Mr TUCKEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The member is supposed to be explaining to this House the worth of your decision, and he is making a very poor case.",40
107,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The minister knows that he has to be relevant.,40
108,Mr ALBANESE,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I am certainly doing so. This dissent motion, like the others, is not actually about the rules and procedures of this House. It is about an opposition struggling for relevance, a divided opposition obsessed with itself, determined to look outward in order to distract from its own inefficiencies and its own inadequacies. We saw it on display again today with the questions that were asked by those opposite. As usual, they left the low-grade stuff to the end, as they always do. We have heard from those opposite that there was going to be an attempt to refer this matter to the Privileges Committee. Have we heard anything from those opposite advancing those arguments? Nothing whatsoever. It is actually the occurrences in this parliament that are the responsibility of this parliament; occurrences outside are being investigated by the police. And it is appropriate that that be the case. We opposite have said that we are quite prepared for there to be scrutiny of occurrences in this chamber, but there will be scrutiny of all the occurrences in this chamber, including, might I add, what appears to be the draft Hansard that was changed on 28 May. Mrs Mirabella is in Hansard interjecting, ‘You pathetic man hater,' across the chamber. You will not actually find that in the real Hansard. You will not find that because it has been expunged and changed. Perhaps that is why we have not heard any matter with regard to privileges. The fact is that this dissent motion reflects an opposition leader in an increased state of desperation-an opposition leader who has been rejected because of the negative, carping role that they are playing, being prepared to blow a $22 billion hole in the surplus. We know that the shadow Treasurer, the person who wants to be the Leader of the Opposition, is clearly already out there holding focus groups about himself in Melbourne.",40
109,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Order! The Leader of the House knows that he has to refer to the matter before the chair.,41
110,Mr ALBANESE,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, quite clearly your ruling is correct on this matter. An opposition in search of a quick, cheap headline does not change that one iota. There is something ironic about those opposite talking about the dignity of the chamber. These are the people who brought in a cardboard cut-out of the Prime Minister. In opposition I disagreed strongly with the then Prime Minister. We did not treat the chamber like that. We did not treat dissent resolutions as a matter of convenience. We did not move points of order in one out of every two questions. We did not refuse, when provided with the opportunity by the Speaker, to rephrase questions to get them in order-even though the Speaker has been generous in allowing the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to do just that. Yesterday, we had you, Mr Speaker, refer specifically to page 538 of the standing orders and the opposition deliberately defied that and asked a question that they knew was out of order. They know this question was out of order. They only moved it so as to move a dissent motion, and they are exposed on it by the fact that they moved a dissent motion after you gave them the opportunity to rephrase the question. This is an opposition that is out of touch, as best shown by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who ridiculed those people who would search for specials in supermarkets. That is absolutely outrageous. (Time expired)",41
111,Mr WINDSOR,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I would have to check the record but I do not think I have ever supported a dissent from a Speaker's ruling. I am about to do that today because I believe that if this ruling is allowed to stand it would create a precedent that this parliament may well live to regret. The substance of the question is almost irrelevant in terms of this particular issue. I understand that the government is trying to protect a member, but the question is to the Prime Minister of this country. The question is about a statement that the Prime Minister made and, if the standing orders as you interpret them, Mr Speaker, allow for this to happen into the future, I think the general public would be very disappointed that an opposition or other member of this House-an Independent or whoever-is not allowed to ask the Prime Minister about a statement that he made whilst he was overseas. I do have the utmost respect for you, Mr Speaker. I would have to check the record but I am pretty sure I have never supported a dissent ruling, though that might be found to be incorrect. I urge you, Mr Speaker, perhaps on another day, if this ruling is to stand, to explain very clearly-not to the people in this building but to the general public-why a member of the opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, is not entitled to ask the Prime Minister a question about a statement he has made as part of his Prime Ministerial responsibilities.",41

113,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The member for Sturt will resume his place. ,42
114,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The member for Sturt will withdraw. That was a reflection on the chair. The member will withdraw the remark. ,42
115,Mr MCCLELLAND,DISSENT FROM RULING," Mr Speaker, in examining your conduct, as the motion seeks to do, it is appropriate also to examine the context of the debate that has occurred over the past two days on this issue. It is also appropriate to examine the conduct of all parties in this chamber. Indeed, one would ask: what more did you need to do to keep the show on the road, as it were, and to keep the situation flowing, where the opposition was entitled to ask the executive to be accountable for its decisions in accordance with the provisions of the standing order? You went out of your way to facilitate the Deputy Leader of the Opposition rephrasing her question-a course of action which I might infer from her body language she was well intending to do until she was pulled to order. Why was she pulled to order? Because the opposition's actions in this respect have more to do with political tactics than the substance of the issues. The purpose and intent of question time is to hold members of the executive accountable for their actions and not for their opinions. It is a very, very important exercise. It is where the process of democracy literally hits the road. Members of parliament from both sides of the House have the opportunity to represent their constituents and ask members of the executive about why they are doing something with respect to public policy, and that is underlined, I might suggest, by standing order 98, which says: A Minister can onlyand I will emphasise that word ‘only'be questioned on the following matters, for which he or she is responsible or officially connected ...

122,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Will the minister update the House on the predictions for this year's wheat crop?",43
123,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I note his strong engagement with the wheat growers in his electorate of Wakefield and their support of the need to reform wheat marketing. More information on the future of this year's wheat crop was made clear at 10 am today with the release of the ABARE Australian crop report. The area sown to wheat is forecast to be a record 14 million hectares for this year 2008-09. The forecast crop is still only a prediction-and, given that we had a bad season in May, it is still being revised and the most recent revision is slightly downwards. The current forecast is for 23.7 million tonnes, a significant increase on last year's harvest of 13 million tonnes. Looking at the future of this year's wheat crop, the most important part of that futurealong with the total tonnage-is under what system it will be sold. The new system will, for the first time, allow growers a choice: if they wish to sell through a pooling arrangement then they can do so and if they wish to sell through a different mechanism then they can also do so. Providing this sort of choice for this year's wheat crop is an important part of the future of the crop. Many people have said that these options for the future have only come out of the wheat for weapons scandal, but the warnings actually came much earlier than that. In the year 2000 the Productivity Commission concluded that the benefits of single desk marketing, be it for wheat, sugar, barley or rice, could be achieved without a monopoly buyer or seller. I will quote the Productivity Commission report of 2000: ... producers can benefit from the increased of services provided in a more competitive environment. The national competition policy review, also in the year 2000, eight years ago, concluded that a single-desk operator is less responsive to both its clients and its suppliers. In eight years the warnings have not changed; what has changed is that we no longer have a government willing to neglect and fail to act on difficult economic reforms. The monopoly did let down wheat growers. This is not only about the $300 million in bribes paid to Saddam Hussein. If you look at the 2006 growers report from the Export Wheat Commission, you will see that it found that those who did not export through AWBI were getting higher prices than the AWBI in the container market and that delays in executing a contract for the sale of wheat to India cost growers $9.5 million. This pain to growers under the single desk system will not be part of this year's wheat crop. The 2007 growers report looked at chartering arrangements and found that, for 39 vessel charters, the national pool was $14½ million worse off for growers than it would have been if prevailing commercial shipping rates had been used. I have directed the Export Wheat Commission to investigate this issue and I am awaiting their report. The 2007 growers report addendum, released only yesterday, concluded that AWB Ltd's hedging strategies were speculative and placed unacceptable risks in the 2005-06 and 2006-07 national pools. Given that the monopoly has, year after year, let growers down, it is important that, as we wait for the Senate debate on this issue, we also reflect on the response of the Leader of the National Party when I allowed an extra permit through earlier in the year for Glencore to also be allowed to export wheat. What happened there? For the first time in some years, Australian wheat growers were allowed back range into the Iraqi market-a benefit again for wheat growers. These are difficult economic reforms. These are challenges that have been put to the previous government dating all the way back to 2000. They are challenges that this parliament and this government are happy to take on. All the evidence points to growers being the beneficiaries of the changes. Member for Robertson",43
124,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his announcement of his intention to improve the standards of behaviour of members of parliament. I also refer the Prime Minister to his press conference in Japan on 11 June, where he said: There appears to be a pattern of unacceptable behaviour here. Will the Prime Minister explain to the House what he meant by that term?",44
125,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For consistency, the first part of the question is in order.",45
126,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am more than happy to answer the question. ‘Unacceptable' means not acceptable, ‘pattern' means a series of events and ‘behaviour' means what you do. That is just the truth. As a consequence of that, having observed what transpired in Australia, I therefore took action on that in relation to an agreed activity concerning counselling. That is my answer to the substance of the question. On the other point which was raised, I will add to an answer to an earlier question which was asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She questioned the sequence of a statement. I made in Tokyo and a statement made by the member for Robertson. The statement. I made in Tokyo was dated 9 June, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to it before. A journalist asked me: ‘Have you spoken to the member for Robertson? What would you say about what was going on and disciplinary action?' The answer from me was: No I haven't. Secondly I understand my office has been in contact, and thirdly I understand that she has issued a statement, and I draw your attention to that. That is a transcript of me, in Kyoto, on 9 June 2008. There was a media statement from Belinda Neal, the member for Robertson, on Sunday, 8 June 2008. That is the sequence. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",45

131,Dr NELSON,PRIVILEGE,"by leave-I move: That the following matter involving the Member for Robertson be referred to the Privileges and Members' Interests Committee: Whether the Member for Robertson has committed contempt of the House: (1) when on the evening of Wednesday, 28 May 2008 in a Main Committee debate the Member for Robertson said to the heavily pregnant Member for Indi, that “your child will turn into a demon if you have such evil thoughts”, “you'll make your child a demon”, “you'll make your child a demon” and again, “evil thoughts will make your child a demon”; (2) when the Member for Indi sought the intervention of the Deputy Speaker and said “I have become increasingly offended and would ask the Member for Robertson to withdraw a comment she made earlier, the comment being: ‘Evil thoughts will turn your child into a demon.' I ask her to withdraw unreservedly”, the Member for Robertson advised the House, “That statement was not made, so I will not withdraw what the Member imagines she heard.” (3) when the Member for Indi pursued the matter, and said to the Member for Robertson, “You made that comment; it was heard by another member as well. You made that comment. I ask you to withdraw,” the Member for Robertson advised the House that, “I did not make the statement that was said to you. You did not hear it correctly”: That further, when the Member for Robertson rose in the House at 9.01 a.m. on the following morning, Thursday, 29 May 2008 and on indulgence made the following statement: (4) [the Member for Robertson]: “Yesterday in the Main Committee there was a robust debate and very many robust interjections with both the Member for Indi and me. The Member much later in the debate interrupted another speaker and asked for some comments I had made to be withdrawn and I did not do so. I have had time to reflect on the incident and, though the comments were not completely accurate, I do unreservedly withdraw any remarks that may have caused offence to the member.” (5) that the House notes the Member for Robertson's assertion that the “comments were not completely accurate” is disputed by the facts, in particular that: (a) in addition to the Member for Indi, the Member for Robertson's ‘demon' comments were clearly audibly to the Member for Maranoa who was present in the Main Committee the night before; and (b) that the audio tape from the Main Committee highlighting the ‘demon' comments by the Member for Robertson has now been widely broadcast on news services across Australia via the Nine MSN website.",47
132,The SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Just before we proceed, I think I am obliged to indicate and make some comment about the length of the motion. This is a process that would have been handled in a different way if precedence was sought and, on that occasion, things would have been read into the record. It is on that basis that I will allow the motion at the length it is. Is the motion seconded? Ms Julie Bishop-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",48
133,Mr ALBANESE,PRIVILEGE,"I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “The House refer the issue of the exchange between the Member for Robertson and the Member for Indi on the 28th of May and the subsequent withdrawal and apology by the Member for Robertson at 9 a.m. on the 29th of May to the Privileges and Members' Interests Committee.” That is actually the appropriate way that we conduct affairs in this House. We do it professionally and we do it in a way which brings credit to all those who have the privilege of being in this chamber. That is an extraordinary motion. You cannot refer something to the Standing Committee on Privileges and Members' Interests for determination by moving a two-page motion containing innuendo, a position and assertions of fact. Those on this side of the chamber have nothing whatsoever to fear from the privileges committee investigating any member at any time. This is a very interesting precedent, however-I do say that. A number of interjections have crossed this chamber from time to time. I just make that point-including from the member for Indi. I look forward to an appropriate investigation of just these matters, because those opposite, as obsessed as they are by short-term political opportunism, need to understand that, every time they choose the short-term political opportunistic road, eventually it comes around. Just as the behaviour before this House in relation to the Friday sittings led to a diminution of private members' business and a diminution of the ability of private members to put things before this chamber, just as the four motions of dissent from the Speaker's ruling that have been moved lead to a cheapening of the way that standing orders are discussed in this chamber, and just as moving over 280 points of order means that, when points of order are raised, they are taken less seriously than they would be otherwise, those opposite need to understand that there is a consequence for their short-term political opportunism. Those on this side have made it very clear-the Prime Minister made it clear and I made it clear this morning when asked-that, if the opposition want to refer things to the Privileges Committee, then the government would have no objection to that whatsoever. They are so predictable, in fact, that we prepared the amendment. One of the things characterising those opposite is that they ways go a step too far. Today, in trying to make a point about supermarket prices, they ridiculed people who would look for specials. In the way that they conduct both policy debates and procedural debates in this chamber, they continually go a step too far because they are so desperate. It is not about the people of Australia; it is about their internals. Everything that they do is about their internals. Today we had the shadow Treasurer",48
134,The SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Order! I remind the Leader of the House that he has to refer to his amendment and the original motion.,49
135,Mr ALBANESE,PRIVILEGE,"due to move a matter of public importance on the economy. That is trashed by what they have done before this chamber. It is all about whether the member for Wentworth, the member for Curtin, the member for North Sydney or the Leader of the Opposition has an opportunity a point of order on such a serious issue as a reference to the privileges committee, but the Leader of the House is required to speak to the motion, not about other internal matters.",49
136,The SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,The Leader of the House will return to the amendment and the original motion.,49
137,Mr ALBANESE,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, I will respect your ruling because this chamber functions when there is a bit of respect and a bit of decency across the chamber. That is why we will be voting for this amendment. I call upon those opposite to stand up for a bit of common sense and vote for this amendment. This is a big test of the Leader for the Opposition. Is he fair dinkum about the reference to the privileges committee? Our amendment, and not the thing that he moved, represents a true reference. This is how you refer things to the privileges committee. To help the member for North Sydney and all of the al- members, this is what you are going to be voting on: ‘That the House refer the issue of the exchange between the member for Robertson and the member for Indi on 28 May and the subsequent withdrawal and apology by the member for Robertson at 9 am on 29 May to the Privileges Committee.' That is the appropriate motion-vote for it.",49
138,The SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Order! The original question was that the motion be agreed to. To this the Leader of the House has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,49
139,Dr NELSON,PRIVILEGE,"Thank you, Mr SpeakerA government member-He's already spoken!",49
140,The SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,The Leader of the Opposition has sought the call and I assume that he is closing the debate.,49
141,Dr NELSON,PRIVILEGE,"Yes, Mr Speaker, I am closing the debate and I will speak to the amendment that has been moved by the government and to the substantive motion. This has been an extraordinary two weeks for Australian public life. It has been an extraordinary day in this parliament. Earlier today, Mr Speaker, we have had the decision made by you in this place that the Prime Minister of this country, when making a statement about a particular matter, cannot be asked specifically about it. This motion in particular relates to one of the most serious transgressions by any member of the parliament, and that is a misleading of the House. That is the fundamental difference between the motion that I have moved and the amendment subsequently moved by the Leader of the House. This is a referral to the Standing Committee on Privileges and Members' Interests which relates not only to remarks made by the member for Robertson on 28 May but also to a subsequent statement made in this chamber by the member for Robertson which in our very strong view is a misleading of the House and needs to be considered, as moved by me, by the privileges committee. It is worth recalling precisely what the motion is that I have moved in this House. I ask every member of the House for a moment just to be quiet and to reflect on what was said by the member for Robertson on 28 May. On 28 May the member for Robertson said this to a heavily pregnant female colleague who happened to be the member for Indi: ‘Your child will turn into a demon if you have such evil thoughts,' ‘You will make your child a demon,' ‘You will make your child a demon,' and, ‘Evil thoughts will make your child a demon.' By any standard that is an extraordinary statement to be made by anybody to a pregnant woman but, in particular, to make such a statement in the parliament of Australia is a denigration of parliamentary standards. It was also clearly recorded by Hansard. When the member for Indi sought the intervention of the Deputy Speaker, she said: ... I have become increasingly offended and would ask the member for Robertson to withdraw a comment she made earlier, the comment beingas I said‘Evil thoughts will turn your child into a demon.' The member for Indi asked specifically that the member for Robertson withdraw unreservedly. The important point of this referral, as I have moved it, is that the member for Robertson said then: That statement was not made, so I will not withdraw what the member imagines that she heard. In other words, the member for Robertson made a statement to the Deputy Speaker in the Main Committee, which every Australian has now heard on national television, having heard the recording of the member for Robertson making this statement. Then the member for Robertson said again: That statement was not made, so I will not withdraw what the member imagines that she heard. In other words, the member for Robertson was seeking to inform the House that she had not said something which she clearly had. Further to that, I would find it difficult to imagine a more inflammatory thing that could be said to another member in an advanced state of pregnancy. To say it is bad enough; to then deny that she said it when it had been recorded by microphones, by the parliament, by Hansard is why this motion that I have moved is so important and why the amendment moved by the government debases the fundamental principle that is at stake here. When the member for Indi pursued the matter-and I think none of us should need any prompting as to understand why the member for Indi might want to have proceeded with the matter-she said to the member for Robertson: You made that comment; it was heard by another member as well. You made that comment. I ask you to withdraw. The member for Robertson again said: I did not make the statement that was said to you. You did not hear it correctly. Again, under extraordinary provocation, the member for Indi specifically asked the member for Robertson to withdraw and not only did she not withdraw but she denied that she had actually said it. She denied it although it had been recorded by the parliament and it has now been broadcast, as we know only too well, to all Australians. On the following day, the member for Robertson rose in this place-I remember it very well: it was just after nine o'clock on Thursday morning, the 29th-and on indulgence made the following statement. She said: Yesterday in the Main Committee there was a robust debate and very many robust interjections with both the member for Indi and me. … … … The member much later in the debate interrupted another speaker and asked for some comments I had made to be withdrawn and I did not do so. I have had time to reflect on the incidentshe saidand, though the comments were not completely accurate, I do unreservedly withdraw any remarks that may have caused offence to the member. So even in the statement here in the main chamber on the morning of the 29th the member for Robertson again has sought to deliberately misinform this parliament, if not mislead it, about what actually occurred in the Main Committee the evening before. This is by any standard an extraordinary and a very serious transgression of parliamentary standards. The government diminishes itself and the Prime Minister diminishes himself by seeking to move an amendment which debases the fundamental principle that is at stake here, and that is that member says something which should be withdrawn, if any member says something which he or she subsequently denies saying, then that member is not upholding the fundamental principles that are the architecture of this building and everything that is supposed to go on inside it. That is why the motion that I have moved cannot be amended in the way proposed by the Leader of the House. I further moved that the House notes that the member for Robertson's assertion that the comments were not completely accurate is, as I have said, disputed by the facts and that, in addition to the member for Indi, the member for Robertson's ‘demon' comments were clearly audible to the member for Maranoa-that of course will be investigated by the privileges committee-who was in the Main Committee on that particular evening. But, more importantly, the audio tape from the Main Committee highlighting the ‘demon' comments by the member for Robertson has now been widely broadcast on news services across the country. The government and the Leader of the House are actually compounding the misleading of the House and the falsification of a statement by the member for Robertson by moving this amendment. The government is trying desperately to avoid this motion being passed in its current form and the member for Robertson being referred to the privileges committee because it will expose contempt of this parliament and the fundamental processes of democracy and integrity that are supposed to be upheld by members when they come into this place. Whatever the member for Robertson or anybody else thinks that they can say at any other place, the fundamental principle is that, when you come to this parliament and say things that are inappropriate, that are offensive and that if any diminish the people whom you purport to represent and you are asked to withdraw them, you withdraw them. You do not turn around and say, ‘I didn't say them.' You do not say to a woman in an advanced state of pregnancy who has been told that her child will have demon thoughts: ‘You're imagining it. I did not say it. It was not said.' The member for Maranoa knows that it was said. Every Australian who has heard the audio knows it was said. We in this parliament then heard the member for Robertson the following morning, after reflection overnight, seek to withdraw these remarks-that in itself was appropriate. But, in the process of seeking to withdraw the comments, the member has compounded the most serious transgression of a member of parliament, as far as procedure is concerned, by seeking to mislead the House or at least not fully providing the facts in relation to the incident of the night before. The Prime Minister has made a lot of standards for the Labor Party to meet. The Prime Minister has said that there would be transparency. But the front page of the Australian newspaper this morning says, ‘Rudd turns back on Neal'. Importantly, in the text of that story, the Prime Minister's office made a statement. The Prime Minister made a statement in Japan that he does not want to talk about here, but that is another issue we have dealt with. The Prime Minister's office said in relation to this entire matter: It is now a matter for individual members if still wish to raise a matter of privilege in the house. The Prime Minister believes the comments were very inappropriate. He also believes they were out of step with all parliamentary standards past and present. It is not often I say this in response to the current Prime Minister, but all I can say is ‘Hear, hear'. That is exactly what it is. It is out of step with all parliamentary standards, past and present. But it is not only the standards of the member for Robertson that are out of step; it is also the standards of the Prime Minister that are out of step-in a government that seeks to amend this motion of referral to the Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests that would prevent the privileges committee from getting to the truth of what actually happened. The truth of it is that the member for Robertson made the most provocative statements to the member for Indi-not on one occasion but on several occasions-and she repeated them. When asked to withdraw the statements, she denied that she had actually made them-and then, coming into the main chamber to explain herself, she misled the parliament in the process. What the government is trying to do, and what the Prime Minister is trying to do, is to bring this down to some sort of petty dispute between two MPs on different sides of the House. You know better than anybody, Mr Speaker, that that is the norm of the parliament-that members on one side contest the ideas, views and opinions of those on the other side. We all know that. That is breadand-butter democracy. But this goes much further. This goes to what I would suggest are the most provocative, offensive remarks made to a pregnant woman in this parliament since Federation. It then goes to the fact that the person who made these remarks denied having made them despite having made them on more than one occasion. Further to that, they and despite all of the evidence from the member for Maranoa and the Deputy Speaker who was in the chair at the time and the audio that has been played to all of Australia, she then seeks to mislead parliament in explaining herself the following morning. We take this matter very, very seriouslyas I know you do, Mr Speaker. That is why we will not accept the removal of the words from the motion as I have moved it. In fact, it is absolutely essential that the privileges committee consider the contempt of the House by the member for Robertson in the terms and for the reasons that I have outlined. To accept the amendment of the government is to take the teeth out of the privileges committee in getting to the real basis of this. The real basis of this is that the member for Robertson has defied the standards of the parliament, defied the standards of her own party and defied the standards proclaimed by the Prime Minister. It is absolutely essential that this motion as I have moved it stand in full. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Clare, J.D. Albanese's amendment) stand part of the quesCombet, G. tion.. The House divided. [4.54 pm] (The Speaker- Mr Harry Jenkins) Ayes………… Noes………… Majority……… NA Abbott, A.J. Andrews, K.J. Bailey, F.E.

155,Mr SIMPKINS,DENTAL BENEFITS,"I rise to speak on the federal government's Dental Benefits Bill 2008 and Dental Benefits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. Before moving into this bill, I need to state what the government says this bill will do. The explanatory memorandum says: From 1 July 2008, the Government will provide up to $150 per eligible teenager towards an annual preventative check for teenagers aged 12-17 years in families receiving Family Tax Benefit Part A ... and teenagers in the same age group receiving Youth Allowance or Abstudy. Let us not beat around the bush here: $150 vouchers to tell young people and their parents that they need more work done-that is all it is. I heard earlier today that a classic check-up will be well in excess of $150. At least this initiative will offset that cost. To use one of the Prime Minister's favourite script lines, I find it amazing that when the government talks about these vouchers it can do so as if this is something new. I draw upon a webpage titled ‘Dental health' from the WA Department of Health site. There is actually a section about the school dental service which says: Committee Free basic dental care is provided to all school Membership children from pre-primary to year 11 ... I find it amazing that the Rudd government is providing $150 vouchers to school students who are already entitled to the state provided basic dental care. When I saw that line on the website, I thought, ‘Okay, parents can then use the voucher to offset the cost of a filling or other work identified through the state government provided basic dental care.' But no, the explanatory memorandum clearly covers that: BILL 2008 ... the Government will provide up to $150 per eligible teenager towards an annual preventative check for teenagers aged 12-17 years in families receiving Family Tax Benefit Part A ... It does not look like there is much flexibility there. A person just listening to the headlines or the announcements could very easily believe that dental care was being provided by the government to teenagers, and people in the suburbs of Cowan, and across Australia, would say that getting a filling is a basic part of dental care-a filling is an integral element of going to the dentist. That is what Australians tell me. So, when this bill is put up as some kind of comprehensive dental strategy, some grand initiative, I question it, and the people of Australia will question the hype and the spin that will not match the reality. This bill-this illusion-will bitterly disappoint Australian families, who were provided with great expectation only to have their hopes dashed. In Cowan, although clearly a majority of voters supported me and my side of politics in the election, I remember very clearly a conversation I had with a young man in Ashby during the campaign. This young man told me that he was a student and that he had severe dental problems. I recall he was 21 or 22 years of age and at university. He told me that he was going to vote for Labor because they had promised a national health plan. He said to me that he did not have health insurance and could not afford to get his teeth fixed. He was confident in the future and supported the Labor Party because they were going to bring in ‘free dental care' for everyone. That was one vote that the Labor Party took from me in Cowan, but I recommend to the government that it not rely on him next time. Expectations were built up so very high, but the harsh reality is that he is too for his check-up, and even the check-up would not have fixed the severe problems he had. The harsh reality is that this bill comes at the cost of the demise of the coalition's dental program, under which chronic and complex dental problems attracted Medicare support over two years up to the value of $4,250. That program, between 1 November 2007 and 30 April this year, provided 311,943 services to Australians suffering from chronic and acute dental problems. The government want that all gone and would prefer to point to the savings derived from the pain and misery of Australians with those sorts of severe problems. Again, this is a terrible illusion of action, where the government attempt to persuade parents that they will achieve something new while marginalising those with acute and chronic problems. Yes, there are more teenagers in Australia than there are sufferers of acute and chronic problems, so I suppose the Rudd government did their sums and identified that more votes would be available by the perception of action with teenagers than actual action for those with major dental problems. I say it again: there is a harsh reality coming for parents of teenagers if they believe the smoke and mirrors show of the government, and there is a harsher reality for the government which, after creating the strong perceptions of action on housing, transport and food costs, have also failed in this bill to bridge the gap between perception and reality. Perhaps it is best to go back to some basic economic theory to address the great problems with rising dental costs to the consumer in Australia. The reality is that of supply and demand. For instance, in this country, only around 10 per cent of dentists work in the state systems, and this is a key point. Where, then, are the initiatives to increase the supply of dentists and staff in the state systems? I old cannot find anything in this bill. All we have is the Rudd government saying that they would negotiate with the states and territories to ensure patients with chronic conditions have access to treatment. It is fine to have an intention but, without any supporting funding in the budget or forward estimates, this statement by the government is nothing more than a glib one-liner, a smokescreen that seeks to deflect close scrutiny of this facade of a bill which is nothing more than a hollow impression of action, which is sadly consistent with the modus operandi of a government addicted to spin. I mentioned before that the government of Western Australia already has a standing commitment to school dental services. These are provided through school dental clinics and mobile dental vans. A few weeks ago I received an email from the Parents and Citizens Association of a primary school in Woodvale within my electorate of Cowan. I will not name the person who sent it to me as I have learnt that there are some occasions on which principals and sometimes even members of P&Cs get counselled by representatives of the state government after contacting them, but I will read the email. It says: On behalf of the P&C associationit did name the school but I have taken that outI would like to voice our concern about ble closure of our ... school dental clinic at Craigie Heights Primary School. That supports the school in question here. It goes on: It has come to our attention that the clinics are understaffed and lacking in modern equipment. With the clinics being understaffed there is a waiting list of up to 6 months at Craigie and other clinics are 41 months. We feel that if these clinics are forced to close then families will feel the financial burden of attending a private dental clinic with some dren not receiving any dental care at all. It also mean a loss of jobs. This is a school with primary school students who are not covered under the government's plan. The state of Western Australia says that they provide these services. Unfortunately, they are failing and the closure of the clinic at Craigie Heights Primary School in the electorate of Moore, which serves schools in Cowan, is evidence of this fact. It is therefore important to question the Rudd federal government's mantra of ‘ending the blame game', because in the end who is responsible? The service must be delivered. The states have failed and this bill has not addressed this problem, which is having a great impact on Cowan and Australian families. For those who might say, ‘Well, the suburb of Woodvale is a pretty well-off area; perhaps they don't need clinics as much as other places,' I would say that Woodvale is no beachside suburb of Perth; there are no million dollar houses in Woodvale. Woodvale families have to buy petrol, they have to buy groceries and they have to pay housing costs, as do the majority of Australians. Some may say, ‘Just as well that Craigie being closed is a one-off case,' or, ‘Just as well the clinic down the road in a lower socio-economic suburb, such as Girrawheen, isn't closing.' I am afraid that it certainly is. The clinic at Girrawheen Primary School is closthe possiing on 20 June. Those who know Cowan know that Girrawheen as a suburb-the majority of the people there-strongly supports the Labor Party. I do not really know why. The area is beset by law and order problems, and Labor has closed a school and is going to close another school at the end of the year. Now the state Labor government cannot some even maintain the dental clinic that serves not only Girrawheen Primary School but also Blackmore Primary, Rawlinson Primary, Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Primary and the chil- Emmanuel Christian School. Why is the will clinic closing? Because there is not enough staff to maintain it. In fact, there is not enough staff to maintain the other clinic at Craigie. That is because of an ongoing pay dispute. Again, I find it amazing that the Labor Party-the party that professes to be for the people and for the workers-cannot do their job in this respect. It is their responsibility to provide these services to the children of Cowan and they are not fulfilling that responsibility. Girrawheen is a long way from Canberra but the failure of Labor to do their job in Girrawheen has a human result. Yesterday my office was called by Karon Anderson, a resident of Girrawheen. Karon informed my staff that she called the dental clinic at Girrawheen Primary School for appointments for her son Leslie and her daughter Joslyn, who are teenagers. I understand that Leslie had earlier this year been informed that he had fillings that needed attention, and his mother called the clinic for an appointment to get the work done. I also understand that Joslyn had a similar but less urgent need to see a dentist. When Karon Anderson called the clinic, the staff said that they were closing at the end of this week-as they are-so they were only doing emergencies. It is important to make the point here that if young Leslie Anderson needs a new filling, as I understand he does, the bill we currently have before the House will not be helping him. A $150 voucher will not get him a new filling or a repair for a filling, and the explanatory memorandum to this bill says exactly that. It may serve federal Labor's interests, when a clear and present failure of a state government is exposed, to regress to the standard call of: ‘End the blame game.' But when is someone actually going to be responsible? When is the buck going to stop? The rules by which this government operates are that anyone can be blamed by this government provided that a Labor politician somewhere is not at fault or called to be responsible for their policy failures. Again, it amazes me that backbenchers opposite can stand up and talk about this bill in glowing terms, as they do. The bill provides $150 for a check-up. That is it. The sum of those great expectations of the Australian people is $150, and it cannot be used for a single filling. That has come at a cost to the program that offered, as I said at the start, up to $4,250 to achieve serious work; not just a part payment for a check-up which will tell teenagers that they might have more work to be done but a payment for some serious work for chronic disease and dental illness. Each time young people like Leslie Anderson or that young man in Ashby whom I mentioned earlier take a breath, they probably feel that air running down into a dental nerve. They looked to the state government and then to the former federal opposition, now the government, to fulfil their promises and they expected to see that done. The free state dental clinics and the federal dental plan that they thought would provide them with free dental care have not helped them and will not help them. The people of Australia heard the message that Labor wanted them to hear at state and federal levels. The message was that dental care would be fixed by Labor. The passing of this bill will not help the school dental clinics servicing Cowan and will not help the people I have mentioned today. There is not a filling in sight; just the smoke of this planned perception and very real deception. I will now draw upon some independent commentary regarding the states and territories and their responsibilities. The Australian Dental Association said: For far too long, the States and Territories of Australia have failed to meet their obligations to ensure proper delivery of dental care to poor and disadvantaged Australians. They went on to say, with regard to the federal government: Instead it has provided the State/Territory Health Services with additional funding … to prop up schemes that have not delivered to date. It's a Band-Aid solution at best. I have made my position clear on this matter. The government left the very clear impression that this policy embodies a comprehensive national dental plan. There are people out there on the streets right now who think that specific remedial dental treatment is part of this policy and this bill. The only comprehensive dental treatment that was on offer was in the coalition's plan. If you needed a significant amount of work done as a chronic sufferer from dental problems, there was only one option, and that was the policy provided by the former government and not this government. I call upon the current government to preserve the former coalition government's highly effective initiative, which remains the only effective response to serious chronic dental problems, as opposed to the government's so-called Commonwealth dental health plan. I will conclude, as a nonexpert in dental matters, with a quote again from those who do know about the subject, the Australian Dental Association, which describes the government's plan in this way:",56
156,The CDHP,DENTAL BENEFITS," that is, the Commonwealth dental health plandelivers too little for too few people and will be effective.",60
157,Mr MARLES,DENTAL BENEFITS,"I rise to speak in support of the Dental Benefits Bill 2008 and related bill. I start by thanking the member for Cowan for his contribution in this debate. As he set out the description of the difficulties that have been faced by people in his electorate, he neatly set out the very basis on which these bills are now required. The fact of the matter is that the parlous state of dental health care in this country is absolutely the reason for the need for these bills, because of the years of neglect by the Howard government. As the member for Cowan asked the question, ‘When is the blame game going to end?' and raised the concern about buck-passing, I could only look at him and think that on that side of the House there is an enormous amount of buckpassing. The reason we are in this situation is a blame game which was pursued for 12 long years. We on this side of the House do take responsibility, and the buck does stop here. The buck stops with the Rudd government. For that reason, we are actually doing something about the issue of the parlous state of dental health care in this country, and that is very much what these bills are about. These bills provide for a legislative framework which is aimed at delivering $780 million, through two dental health initiatives, to this country. Of course, these measures were announced as part of the budget that has recently been announced. It is just another budget measure which is being put forward to overturn the 12 years of neglect and noninvestment that we have seen in this country as a result of the former Howard government. Fifty thousand Australians each year are hospitalised for preventable dental conditions, and Australian adults rank second not worse in the OECD for their overall dental health. That is a disgraceful and shameful position that we find our country in. The measures proposed in these bills will seek to alleviate Australia's dental health crisis and assist our overall health system. If we look at the state of dental health in our country at the moment, it makes for very sad reading. Six hundred and fifty thousand Australians are on public dental waiting lists. In 2007 the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported that 30 per cent of Australians reported avoiding dental care due to cost, 21 per cent said that costs had prohibited them from having recommended dental treatment and 18 per cent reported that they would have considerable difficulty in paying a dental bill of $100 or more. Further statistics indicate that tooth decay ranks as Australia's most preventable and prevalent public health issue, with more than a quarter of Australian adults having untreated tooth decay. One in six Australians over 15 have avoided particular foods due to poor dental health. In New South Wales, the hospitalisation rates for children under five for dental conditions rose 91 per cent in the decade between 1994-95 and 2004-05. Our poor state of dental health is not only a public health issue-although it is a very considerable public health issue-but also a social issue. There is a significant link between dental health care and socio-economic status in terms of both the cause of dental problems and how people's dental health contributes to their overall social interaction. The fact of the matter is that if you have broken teeth it leads to poor self-esteem and it makes it difficult to interact within our society. Dr Anne Sanders from the Australian Research Centre for Population Oral Health, based at the University of Adelaide, made a comment about exactly that link when she said: If we could grade the social conditions of society from excellent to poor we would find that population oral health status followed precisely the same gradient. Where social conditions are excellent, oral health status tends also to be excellent. Where social conditions are poor, oral health likewise is poor. This is so because the oral health of populations is socially determined. This is also a fact, or a phenomenon, which has been identified in Victoria. In 2002 the Victorian Auditor-General's report on the state of oral health of Victorians said: Poor oral health may cause people to avoid social interaction and personal contact, reducing their quality of life. So poor dental health in this country is not only a public health issue but also a very significant social issue, which is why it is absolutely critical that it be addressed, and the Rudd government means to address it. In Geelong, where my electorate is, we face all these problems, as does the rest of the country. Currently in Geelong the approximate waiting times for public dental health assistance amount to 30 months for general dental care and 37 months for denture care. Statistics provided by the Barwon Health Community Dental Service in Corio in February this year were that there were 2,249 patients waiting for general dental care and 571 for denture care, a 43 per cent increase on the previous six months. While dental health may not be on the radar of the Commonwealth opposition, the Victorian Liberal opposition do at least recognise that dental health care is a problem. The Victorian state opposition health spokesperson, Ms Helen Shardey, recently asked this question: ‘When will the Brumby government realise the dental problem is not just a small toothache but an excruciating pain across Victoria?' In that question Ms Shardey has correctly identified that dental health is an issue but she has completely missed the mark in terms of laying the blame for why this issue has come about and how it needs to be fixed. It is absolutely ironic that she should be pointing to the state Labor government when it is in fact the neglect of the former Howard government, in its refusal to properly fund public dental health, that has given rise to not only small toothaches but also large and excruciating pain. The Rudd government understands that a proper dental health service cannot be provided by our states if it is not first funded by the Commonwealth government. The Howard government did not do that. In 1996, when the Howard government came to power, one of its initial acts was to scrap the Commonwealth Dental Health Program, which was introduced by the Keating government, and in doing so it ripped $100 million from public dental health services. After eight years of Howard government neglect, in 2004 it started to take some dental health measures through Medicare in relation to those who were suffering chronic illness or who had complex care needs. But the criteria for the program that was put in place at that time was so restrictive and the process for gaining access to that program so complex that the program was, at the end of the day, an utter failure. It assisted 7,000 people at an expense of $1.8 million to the public purse over three years, despite the program originally being forecast to assist 23,000 people at an expense of $15 million. By September last year only 14 preschoolers had had their dental needs addressed through that program. The reality is that the Howard legacy on dental care is one of failure and neglect. They started by ripping money out of the system and then they designed programs that were so intricate that, at the end of the day, they were guaranteed to fail. As with so many other areas of public policies, 12 years of neglect has resulted in the current parlous state of dental health care in Australia. The Rudd government is absolutely committed to addressing that neglect, to building a system that can meet the public need for dental health care and to ending the blame game over the issue of dental health. As I mentioned, the Rudd government is providing an initial investment through the budget, of which this bill is a part, of $780 million to address the current state of dental health. This money is going to be provided through two schemes. There will be $290 million over three years provided to the Commonwealth Dental Health Program and $490 million provided over five years for the Teen Dental Plan, which of course is the subject of these bills. That is in stark contrast the Howard government initiatives, which over four years to April 2008 provided less than $50 million. This government's programs are deliberately targeted to assist those who are currently most in need of dental services, and they will be done in partnership with the states and territories, precisely so that we end the blame game and start a cooperative approach to the way in which this country is governed. Could I mention briefly the Commonwealth dental plan. This assists states to reduce waiting times. It will provide for up to one million dental consultations over the next three financial years. The funding is being provided in accordance with strict conditions targeting people with chronic diseases as a priority; for example, cancer, cardiac patients and those suffering from HIVAIDS. It seeks to meet the challenges left by years of the Howard government's neglect and ineptitude and it will assist the most vulnerable and the most in need, in particular by prioritising Indigenous people and preschool children. The Medicare Teen Dental Plan, which is of course the subject of these bills, is a very important initiative. It will provide up to $150 per eligible person towards an annual preventative check-up, which can be used at a private dental clinic. Those who are eligible are persons aged between 12 and 17 in families receiving family tax benefit part A or persons in the same age bracket who are receiving either the youth allowance or Abstudy benefits. It is estimated that ultimately this will cover about 1.1 million teenagers. The preventative check will cover the examination and, where clinically required, Xrays, scaling and cleaning of teeth and other preventative services. The plan will be administered by Medicare using client eligibilto ity data from Centrelink. It will operate on a calendar-year basis without just being distributed in January of each year. Following the first year of the program, vouchers will be valid for the entirety of the calendar year, even if the family circumstances alter during that year. As I said at the start, dental health is not only a public health issue but also a social issue. So this program provides for an intervention during the teenage years of a person's life-a critical point in their lifewhere they can go forward with good dental health. They will be able to engage in the normal social interactions, so if they are looking for jobs or engaging in study or other social activities their dental health will not be an issue. This bill, along with the Dental Benefits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 also provides for the dental benefits scheme. These two bills will have the combined effect of legislating for the creation of a new dental benefits scheme which will be established to implement the Teen Dental Plan program. The DBS will also provide the legislative framework that will allow the Minister for Health and Ageing the discretion to make dental benefit rules whereby the minister may seek to make additions to the scope of dental benefits items in the future. Unlike the Medicare Benefits Schedule the DBS allows provisions to be targeted to specific groups-for example, by means testing or by age. In summary, these bills absolutely cut to the core of what the Rudd government is all about-that is, providing services to those who are most in need-and in doing so rectifies the neglectful practices of the Howard years. This program seeks to cut through the red tape of previous programs to provide much greater access and to provide a much less complex system. It is a program that will be delivered hand in hand with the states, precisely so that we can end the blame game. The Rudd government understands the pressures on working families when it comes to prioritising household incomes, and the Rudd government believes that these bills will allow families to prioritise preventative dental health care in their family budgets, both for their benefit and also for the benefit of the wider community by alleviating the strain on the public health system. These measures will greatly benefit the people of Corio and the people of Australia, and I commend these bills to the House.",60
158,Mr NEVILLE,DENTAL BENEFITS,"It gives me pleasure to rise tonight to speak in this debate on the Dental Benefits Bill 2008 and related bill but no pleasure to listen to some of the claims that have been made by the government, to the breast-beating that has been going on and to the talk of the blame game. It is as if the government have been wound up like toy soldiers when everyone comes in and trots out the same line. The line is about the blame game: ‘Let's look at the blame game.' With the exception of a four-year period in the early nineties, dental services have, since Federation, been the sole responsibility of the states. It is plain and simple. It has never been any different. That is my first point. What happened in the mid-nineties? In its dying days the Keating government plucked a program out of the air-much akin to some of the moves that Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister, has pulled in recent days in association with his Asian tour-following a paper called the National Health Strategy background paper. Out of that the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Keating, designed the Dental Health Program. It was mentioned in the 1993-94 budget and it started in January 1994. It was available to both private and public dental practitioners. It was only available to people over 18 who had various types of cards-health cards, benefit cards, pension cards, DVA cards and the like. Its estimated cost was $278 million, and it delivered 1.5 million services over the four years. By the admission of the government of the day, it was a catch-up scheme. Again, this is plain and simple. It was never intended to be an ongoing program for dental care. How do we know this? We know it because no mention was made of it in any forward estimates. In the years following the introduction of that scheme in the 1993-94 budget it could have been updated and rolled on into the future but it was not. The Keating government, if re-elected, almost certainly would have dropped it. There was no provision made for it. And we are told that this dreadful coalition government cut it out! That too is incorrect, because this so-called terrible Howard government actually completed the program. In fact, over that period $245 million was spent. So let us get that first myth out of the way. It was never meant to be an ongoing program; it was a program to help the states, which had got behind, to catch up. There was no intention by the Keating government to take that over on a permanent basis. Indeed-and I will come to this further in my address-if the Rudd government had intended to really enter the field they would have done something more substantial than introduce the program that we are debating tonight. The coalition introduced, in two stages, a dental program to help people whose health was affected by bad teeth. The whole business of dental care needs to be handled by one or the other levels of governmenteither all by the state or all by the Commonwealth-or it needs to be very carefully segmented. You cannot have bits and pieces here and there, because inevitably, when you go down that route, some people miss out. Under the coalition government's program, which had really only just got started, $41.4 million was to be spent in the first year. Over four years it was to be $377 million, and the current government projected forward another year for a five-year program of $491 million-which is amazingly close to the cost of the teen dental component of the government's overall program. I do not knock the idea of helping teenagers to have good dental health albeit that this is confined to a certain extent by means testing. What does it deliver when you really get down to the nitty-gritty of it? You receive a voucher, you go to a dentist and you can get up to $150 worth of work done. In one sense this is commendable-everyone in that category, if they want to take it up, will be able to get an assessment done. But that is all they will get. They may get a cleaning and scaling of their teeth but that is all that they will It is estimated that some dentists charge up to $190 for a first comprehensive assessment, so $150 is at the lower end of the spectrum. So those children or young people will get their dental assessment, but if the family cannot afford dental care and cannot get into a dental hospital in their state then where do they go from there? What has the net advantage been for anyone? The assessment could say, ‘You've got to have four teeth seen to,' but mum might say, ‘We can't afford it.' So you have a $150 assessment and nothing else. As I said, this plan is commendable in one sense, but if it had included, say, two occasions of service-or even just one occasion of service-then a kid with a broken tooth, an abscessed tooth or whatever it might be could at least be treated for those particular immediate ailments. I have heard the government tonight talking about people being in desperate pain. My understanding of it is that all state dental hospitals are supposed to see people with acute pain immediately, and if that is not happening then they as members of parliament should be doing something about it; because, let me tell you, even though I am a federal member, if I see something unfair happening at the state level then I am not frightened to step in-not frightened for a second. We are going to spend the equivalent of what would have been cut out of the Howard government's program for five years on this teen dental health program. I would think that, for that amount or for a similar amount of money, you could get a lot better value if you extended the dental program for primary schools into secondary schools. I know that not all states have that. I understand that South Australia, Queensland and one of the other states have these dental fixturessometimes they are permanent fixtures in the school grounds, such as a small brick buildget. ing, and sometimes they are a caravan that alternates between three, four or even five schools. They are generally run by a supervising dentist and dental therapists. I know that might mean some changes to dental therapy training because when you are dealing essentially with milk teeth-as you do with a lot of primary school children-the level of dental expertise required is probably less. But I would have thought that if the government wanted to put all kids on the road to good dental health then it might have considered spending that amount of money-or perhaps up to $1 billion-on equipping the states with dental clinics for schools. If you could not contain that within that price range then could you not use your CCD sociological profiles of areas and say the schools in the areas with the poorest profiles would get the dental clinics first? In other words, you would essentially get the dental care to those people in most need and have kids leaving school at 18 or thereabouts with reasonable dental treatment-it may not be the ant's pants, but certainly preventative dental care would have taken place. At the age of 18 the kids can either go to uni or-as for perhaps 70 or 80 per cent of them-go out into the workforce to apprenticeships, to work in shops and other jobs in the community. They will be earning money of their own. If they come out of school with some pride in their teeth then isn't it more likely that they might wish to look after them and budget from their own savings to do that? Let me tell the House that when I started my first job I had to do that and I do not feel any the worse for it. It was difficult. It was an impost. I have crooked teeth and I have always had trouble with my teeth. It used to cost me a fair slice of my meagre income at the time for a year or 18 months. I have never regretted that. I do not think that kids, given the opportunity of having their teeth looked after by the state until they are about 18, would do anything else but respond positively-getting the resources while they were 19, 20, 21 or 22 to be able to keep it up. So, whilst I think that symbolically this Teen Dental Plan is very good and will help some people with assessments, I ask the question: what will it do for people in real terms? The government is going to put another $290 million into the states-which was essentially what the Keating plan did. Actually the figure there was to be $278 million. In fact, it is not as much, on adjusted figures, as the Keating government was to put into actual dental care, albeit with a means test. It worked to varying degrees. I am sure it did do some catching up. It is said that 200,000 families got into the system and that there were 1.5 million occasions of service. I think that is about 7½ services per family treated. So, obviously, it did get to a small segment of the market, and it probably looked after those kids and families well-but it depended on the goodwill of the states. One state minister, who shall remain nameless, said to me: ‘Wasn't this Commonwealth stuff the greatest joke of all time! As fast as the Commonwealth put it in the top, we took it out the bottom.' That was the attitude of the states. It was just a top-up. Rather than say, ‘Oh, look, let's match this and get a lot more done,' I bet you that the attitude in every state was, ‘Well, we are getting all this Commonwealth money; we will not have to go so hard in the next budget with dental care.' It would be interesting to do a study on the extent to which the states over that period of the Keating plan-and I do not deride the Keating plan other than to say that it was a catch-up program-increased their dental care and whether they kept it in line with CPI or with the general cost of health. That would be a very interesting exercise. Another aspect of this-and I am not straying from the subject, let me assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker Mr Ripoll interjecting",63
159,Mr NEVILLE,DENTAL BENEFITS,"I am sure the member for Oxley will be quite relaxed when I tell him what I want to talk about. I want to talk about health insurance and the fact that the government is raising the threshold from an income of $50,000 per annum to one of $100,000 per annum. I am not against the lifting of the threshold. It has not been for some years. I would have been reasonably relaxed about it if the threshold figure had been fixed at $65,000 or $75,000 per annum, having been taken in line with a growth figure per year in the health budget or with CPI. But to take it up to $100,000 is definitely going to cause a lot of people to drop out of private health insurance. It is probably going to affect the younger married sector who are pretty healthy and who say, ‘Oh well, we don't really need this and we'll drop out.' The government estimates that 500,000 families will drop out of private health insurance as a result of lifting that threshold-in other words, they will no longer have to pay the levy. Various other sources-economists, commentators, the AMA and so on-estimate the figure as somewhere between 800,000 and one million. That is nearly twice the figure estimated by the government. Here is the point I want to make-I am sure the member for Oxley will understand it now: amongst that one million people are people who are taking the extras on their private health insurance, including dentistry. I do not know the percentage figure-I would like to know it; I think I would find it very enlightening-but that means that when they drop out they also drop out of having the capacity to pay for dental care. As a result of this, a proportion of those people will shift to the state system. Not all of them will. Some will still say, ‘We can put a bit aside for dental care because we do not have to pay the health insurance premium,' but most of them will probably say: ‘We will now go on to the state system. We are not going to have private health insurance. We will go on to Medicare for our normal health services and on to the state system for other dental care.' That is going to add to the number of those seeking dental care. I also question whether the government lifted has really thought through-and this also impacts indirectly on this dental matter-the idea of the superclinics. I have not found a community yet-although this may not be the case in the outer metropolitan suburbs with which I am not familiar-where anyone wants one of these superclinics. There are perfectly well-run, bulk-billing clinics in Bundaberg that are seven-, eightand ninedoctor practices but which have only four or five doctors. What possible good would it be to build a superclinic in Bundaberg where we cannot get doctors in the private sector? We cannot get enough doctors in the public hospital. How in heaven's name are we going to be able to get the doctors into these superclinics? I am told that the government may consider tendering these things out. That would introduce a third level of compliance. You would probably have private doctors, public doctors and these superclinic doctors. The government is equivocating even about that program. It was going to be $5 million, but now it is up to $5 million. Now it may not be a new superclinic; it might be the renovation of a building-in other words, they might do up the old outpatients' building somewhere that has been closed for a few years. But why would you invest the quantum that would be required to do that at the expense of what could be going into dental care? I recognise, all Australians recognise, that dental care has not been as good as it might be. We all recognise that. But we need to have a wider strategy that involves, for one thing, the fluoridation of water in those states that do not have it. I would like to see an examination of the ability of dental health clinics to be used in secondary schools. I would like to encourage people to stay in private health insurance and even encourage people to take up dental benefits within that private health insurance. I think that in that way we can share the burden fairly and give the state clinics a better chance of catching up and doing the job that they were destined to do. They are interesting bills, symbolically good; but in practice, in delivering things on the ground, no, they fall very short.",65
160,Mr RIPOLL,DENTAL BENEFITS,"It is a great privilege to speak in support of this bill, the Dental Benefits Bill 2008, and the cognate Dental Benefits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. I note, before I begin, that it is always interesting to hear from the now opposition because it is always the case that we as the government should be doing more but, when the coalition were themselves in government, they did nothing at all, particularly on this issue. They come in here and complain and bleat on, but for the 12 years they were in government not once did they take up the measures that we are moving here tonight. Not once did they reason that more could be done. It is easy for them to come in here and criticise us for not doing enough and say that this does not go far enough, but the reality is that they did even begin the process-and that is disappointing. It is disappointing for all those people that missed out on all of the possible dental services that they needed over the past 12 years. What we are finally seeing here with these bills is Australians getting a decent dental healthcare program, something that the Rudd government have made a top priority, something that was part of our election promises and something that we will be delivering through this legislation. The reintroduction of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program and the new Teen Dental Plan are just the start of a continued commitment to Australian health, including Australian dental health. Previously, dental health was a major issue in my seat of Oxley in Queensland, where many ordinary people suffered because they could not afford proper dental care, let alone check-ups to get the sort of assessment they needed to then go and get further care. A petition about this in my electorate was signed by 1,400 people, making very plain to me, and to the parliament, their strong support for these types of programs. It was a very serious issue then and it is a very serious issue today. I am very proud to have the Minister for Health and Ageing here in the chamber. I am very proud to support this and that we are actually getting on with the job of helping ordinary people get better access to dental health, something that was neglected at the federal level for many years. Let me just take a little bit of time-and I am conscious of time tonight, as so much of it was wasted today by the opposition-to indulge the House with the recent history of dental health in this country. For 12 long years we saw the previous government continue to neglect and, in fact, refuse to act on Australia's escalating dental crisis. It was the previous government, the Howard governnot ment, that now sits opposite, that cut Labor's Commonwealth Dental Health Program in 1996, ripping $100 million from the public dental sector across the country. They then continued to ignore the growing impact of their neglect, which led to a whole range of problems-problems like 650,000 Australians on public dental waiting lists across the country; 50,000 Australians hospitalised each year for preventable dental conditions, putting additional pressures on our already strained hospitals; and dental conditions constituting a quarter of hospitalisations of children. These are significant numbers and significant issues and significant peoplepeople who deserved better but were treated very poorly by the previous government, those now sitting in opposition. There are more problems. Up to one in 10 visits to GPs is caused by dental problems, again placing more strain on GPs, dental clinics, hospitals and the health system in general in this country. More than one in five Australians go without recommended dental treatment because of the cost; it is just too expensive for some people. I heard the comments of the previous speaker, who said this did not go far enough, that in fact this is just for a check-up. It is actually a lot more than that, but you need to at least make that first, conscious decision to provide that access, to get that cost out of the road so that people can make proper decisions and be advised what they need to do next. I think that is the very first and the most important step. One in six Australians avoids certain foods because of dental problems. The aged, the frail and the young endure a lesser quality of life because of this, and I think it is our responsibility to do everything we can-and we are, through these bills. These facts are indeed an indictment of the previous government. What is frightening is that, all along, they knew what was happening but they did nothing. Today they can support these bills and help ordinary people or they can just bleat and carry on, although for 12 years they did nothing. These are good bills and should be passed. The list goes on. Tooth decay ranks as Australia's most prevalent health problem: 25½ per cent of the Australian adult population have untreated dental decay. During the last 12 months, one in six Australians aged over 15 have avoided certain foods because of problems with their teeth. Between 1996 and 1999, five-year-olds experienced a 21.7 per cent increase in deciduous tooth decaythat is, teeth falling out. Hospitalisation rates for children under five for dental conditions increased by 91 per cent between 1994-95 and 2004-05. There was a 42 per cent increase in children being treated in hospitals for dental cavities between 2000 and 2005. These are terrible figures, terrible statistics and a terrible shame. They are a terrible indictment of the previous government. According to the OECD, the dental health of Australian adults ranks second worse in the OECD, with a rapid deterioration in dental health observed in the teenage years in particular. The previous minister for health, Tony Abbott, and those opposite repeatedly refused to accept any responsibility for Australia's dental health crisis and continued to play the blame game, leaving it to the states to pick up the pieces. They took no responsibility, they blamed everyone else and, in the end-even worse-they just did nothing. That is the truth of the matter: they just did nothing. They left it to others. By contrast, this is yet another election promise that Labor are delivering on. We have a massive agenda of reform and work in front of us to ensure Australians have a better quality of life. The dental blame game is now over and funding of $780 million will be allocated over five years to these two new and very important dental programs. The Rudd government's Teen Dental Plan will assist one million Australian teenagers between the ages of 12 and 17 with dental costs. This is very good news. There are a whole range of other measures, and, as I am conscious of the time, I will respect the proceedings of this House and try to do everything I can-while there are many more good things that I can say about this program, I think it is self-evident in what we are trying to achieve and what will be achieved by it. I give it my wholehearted support. This bill ensures that there will be an overwhelming recommendation of support for people's dental health care, and I seek the support of the opposition to guarantee that over one million young people can now have affordable dental care and that others can access this program as well. I commend the bill to the House.",67
161,Ms ROXON,DENTAL BENEFITS,"in reply-I thank the members for contributing to this debate on the Dental Benefits Bill 2008 and the Dental Benefits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. I acknowledge that many members on this side of the House, and the occasional one on the other side of the House, are pleased that this measure is going to provide significant benefits to many hundreds, in fact thousands-if not over one million-teenagers and other people who will be assisted through the Commonwealth Dental Health Program across the country. These two bills will allow the government to deliver on a key part of its election commitment to improve dental health for working families and address Australia's dental crisis. The government has committed a total of $780 million over five years for two new dental programs: the Medicare Teen Dental Plan and the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. Both of these programs are squarely targeted at people who are most in need of help, many of whom could not afford dental care without this assistance. We will work with the states and territories and the dental profession to expand the provision of dental care, with a focus on treatment for those in greatest need and preventative care for eligible teenagers. These significant commitments will help ease Australia's dental crisis, help end the blame game and start addressing the serious problems in oral health that the Howard government ignored for more than a decade-not least the 650,000 people left to languish on public dental waiting lists across the country. The passage of these bills will enable the Medicare Teen Dental Plan to commence next month. The government is providing $490 million over five years for the Medicare Teen Dental Plan, which will provide up to $150 per each eligible teenager towards an annual preventative check. This will target those who are aged between 12 and 17 in families receiving family tax benefit A. Teenagers in the same age group receiving Youth Allowance or Abstudy will also be eligible under the program. About 1.1 million teenagers will be eligible under the Medicare Teen Dental Plan each year, and the Medicare Teen Dental Plan will operate as part of the broad Medicare arrangements through a new dental benefits schedule. Under the Commonwealth Dental Health Program, the Rudd government will be providing an additional $290 million over three years to improve access to public dental services, working in cooperation with the states and territories. This marks a stark change from the last decade of the Howard government: playing the blame game and criticising the states for not doing enough on dental health. Commencing in July this year, the Commonwealth Dental Health Program will assist the states and territories to reduce waiting times by funding up to one million additional dental consultations and treatments over the next three years. This means that pensioners and concession card holders will be able to get more help. It will assist the poorest members of our community and people with the poorest dental health. It will also give priority to Indigenous people and preschool children, groups that the Howard government's dental program clearly failed. We are negotiating with the states and territories to ensure that those with chronic disease will still be given priority through this program. In summing up, I again wish to thank the members for their contributions to the debate on these bills. In the debate we heard the member for North Sydney claim that the opposition ‘clearly understands the burden of dental disease in our society'. In fact, we heard many opposition members bemoan the poor dental health of many Australians. But it seems to me that the member for North Sydney and the opposition are crying crocodile tears when it comes to dental health. If they really understood dental disease, why did the former government rip $100 million a year from the Commonwealth Dental Health Program and ignore dental health as an issue for more than a decade? The member for North Sydney professed concern for the 650,000 Australians on public dental waiting lists, and yet, bizarrely, after 11 years of inaction, argued that it Rudd government which is leaving them languishing on these waiting lists. Let me provide the House with some pretty basic historical facts. As I have said, it was the previous government that ripped $100 million a year of funding from public dental programs, leading to an explosion in waiting lists. The member for North Sydney says he cares for those people having to wait too long for dental care, but it is something that, when he sat on this side of the House for 11 years, he did not care sufficiently about to convince his government to do anything to fix the problem. And now he still offers nothing to fix the problem, instead engaging in the tired old blame game, saying it is simply the states' fault and ignoring the history of the government he was a part of. It is only the Rudd government, now having come to office, that is working to address the public dental waiting lists through our $290 million investment in the Commonwealth Dental Health Program alongside our $490 million investment in our kids' teeth through the Medicare Teen Dental Program. We now understand, as of today, that the opposition is also planning to disallow the closure of the former government's failed chronic disease dental program. As I have said in this House before, we do acknowledge that some people got help from that program if they could navigate the complex referral process and the red tape, but many, many people-often the most needy in the community-did not get help and it was not a targeted program. You could be assisted if you had a particular chronic disease in particular circumstances, but you could not be assisted if you had poor teeth simply because of your poverty, simply because you did not have proper health care, you did not have early enough dental care, you did not have a good diet-any range of these problems that can cause severe oral health difficulties is the would not qualify you for assistance. For example, over the four years to 30 April 2008, in the whole of the Northern Territory no services at all were provided to children and young adults aged up to 24 years. In South Australia over the same four years, no services at all were provided to children up to the age of 14-zero. This means, as I have noted before, that any children born in the Northern Territory or South Australia during the entire life of the Howard government did not get any assistance for their dental care during the life of that government. And now we have the opposition saying that we are not doing enough or that they want us to continue their program as well as invest our new $780 million. It really is pretty cheeky, I have to say. In total, over the four years to 30 April 2008, the Howard government's failed scheme will have spent less than $50 million compared to the $780 million that the Rudd government is investing in dental health. In disallowing the closure of the failed chronic disease program, the opposition will be opposing the savings measures that will help pay for the Rudd government's better targeted programs. We think this is thoughtless, reactionary opposition. It is opposition for opposition's sake. We see it on dental care, on hospitals, on alcohol and on unfair tax slugs like the Medicare levy surcharge. The opposition is following a clear pattern: do nothing for 11 years and then attack the new government for pursuing the path of reform. The Liberal Party has until the end of the month to choose between responsible economic management and responsible health policy and short-term, cheap politics. I hope that they will make the right choice. In conclusion, the Rudd government is delivering on its election commitment and making a $780 million investment in Australia's dental health, an investment in preventative care for our kids and treatments for the most needy in the community. It demonstrates that the Rudd government can make the tough decisions to close down ill-targeted programs which have demonstrably failed and to replace them with targeted programs that help more Australians and those most in need, such as pensioners and concession card holders. The programs demonstrate the Rudd government's determination to address the immediate pressures on Australia's dental health system and the 650,000 people on public dental waiting lists who are the Howard government's sad legacy, and they demonstrate the Rudd government's commitment to building for Australia's future by encouraging our teenagers to develop good dental habits and to preserve their dental health for the long term. Together, these programs will attack the sorry state of dental health in Australia and they mark the start of a new era in dental care and preventative health. Question agreed to.

164,Mr KEENAN,INVESTMENT TRUST,"I want to begin my remarks today by going over some of the history of the measures contained within the Tax Laws Amendment (Election Commitments No. 1) Bill 2008 and cognate bills that are before the House for discussion. I want to go over that history because I think we need to understand some of that history to understand how slippery and tricky this government has already become. In the measures that are contained within this bill, the Australian taxpayer is being asked to fork out hundreds of millions of dollars seemingly to essentially protect the government from an embarrassment of their own making. This is money that is going to be taken out of the pockets of hard working Australian taxpayers and put directly into the pockets of taxpayers in other countries such as the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom. Or, worse, the money that will be taken out of the hands of the Australian taxpayer will just go directly into the treasuries of other countries. It will go directly into US Treasury or the Chancery of the UK. This is a measure that reveals that we have a government that really does not seem to have a clue about economic and taxation policies. We are being asked to spend $630 million over the forward estimates period. It is an expenditure that is really just a tax cut for foreign investors who invest in Australian property trusts. I do not need to remind the House that all this is being done in the context of a budget that increases taxes and increases expenditures, a budget that increases the pressure on average Australians who are trying to make ends meet. With the exception of the coalition tax cuts that have been delivered by the government in this budget by Wayne Swan, this is the only other tax cut that this budget contains. I think it is worth pondering why it is that this group is being so favoured by this government. The government are happy to slug you if you like to have a Jim Beam with Coke, they are happy to slug you if you want to drive a Tarago people mover that comes in over the luxury car tax threshold and they are happy to slug you if you live in a rural area and need a four-wheel drive to get around. If you like to travel, they are going to slug you. You had better watch out if you are a consumer of gas in Western Australia, because they have a $2½ billion tax grab and the Prime Minister has been unable to rule out whether it will increase the price of gas in Western Australia. This government are going to slug you if you have private health insurance. But, strangely enough, if you live in Japan, in the US or in some of the other countries around the world, we are going to give you a tax cut. I find this a relatively absurd proposition. While the government are delivering the coalition's tax cuts they are telling the Australian people that these will be the last tax cuts that anyone will receive under the this government. They do not really believe in cutting the taxation burden, so they are happy to deliver the coalition's tax cuts that they were forced into promising during the last election campaign. The only other people to get a tax cut will be foreign investors in Australian property trusts. There is absolutely no explanation as to why this is the case. There is no reason why foreign investors in property trusts have been so favoured by this government. We really need to ask: what is the reason? What is the rationale? Why are we discussing $630 million coming out of the pockets of Australian taxpayers and going into-in many cases directly into-the treasuries of other countries with no discernible benefit to the Australian taxpayer? Why is it that we have a government that is so parsimonious with its own citizens-saying, ‘Oh, no, we're not going to give you access to any more of your money that you have earned; the era of tax cuts has come to an end'-and so generous to foreign investors? We can only understand this by examining the history of this measure. After the 2007 budget, the then opposition, now the government, were desperately casting around for something to say in reply to the budget. They came up with an idea to make Australia a financial services hub of the region. That is actually not a bad idea; in fact, it is traordinarily good idea. Sadly, the then government had been pursuing that policy goal for 12 years. It had been doing it by reducing the taxation burden for Australians and providing a competitive regulatory regime for the financial services industry in Australia. The opposition needed to come up with something in reply to the budget, so they decided they would plagiarise this idea of Australia as a financial services hub for the region. Of course, they needed to put some meat on those bones and come up with a policy that they could point to that would achieve that. So they plagiarised a suggestion from industry, which was to reduce the rate of withholding tax for foreign investors in Australian property trusts. The problem with that is that they did not seem to have any idea about how much that measure would actually cost. They have been adamant, and they were adamant in opposition, that the measure would cost some $15 million per year. We are actually discussing $630 million here tonight, but the opposition were adamantly saying that it would only cost $15 million per year, which wildly underestimated the actual cost of this measure. Indeed, Treasury and the then Treasurer stated publicly on many occasions that the then opposition's proposal would cost in excess of $100 million per year. But the then opposition were not to be moved from the idea that what they were proposing-this tax cut for foreigners-was only going to cost the Australian Treasury $15 million per year. I would like to remind the House of some of the things that were said in this House about a year ago. They really show that this government has absolutely no credibility on economic matters. I quote the then shadow Assistant Treasurer, now the Assistant Treasurer, talking about the costings for this measure that we are discussing tonight. On an ex23 May last year he said in this House: Let me deal with the matter of costings, because the Treasurerthe then Treasurer, of course, the member for Higginswent out and said: ‘The Leader of the Opposition has his sums wrong. This wouldn't cost $15 million a year; it will cost $100 million a year.' The then shadow Assistant Treasurer went on to say about this outrageous costing of $100 million a year that the government came up with: How much credibility does the Treasurer have on this issue? Zero. He said that it was not correct to say that: ... Labor's proposal will cost the taxpayer $100 million a year. Labor's costing is conservative, and it is thorough. I think we will find in a minute when I go through the costings for this bill that that is complete and utter unadulterated rubbish. I will go a little more into what he had to say because it goes to credibility. Only last year, the then shadow Assistant Treasurer said: The Treasurer thinks he is going to get away with saying that this costs $100 million ... Many times in this chamber he attacked what the then government was saying about this measure costing in excess of $100 million. He said that the then government would have absolutely no credibility if it stuck to that costing and he was adamant during many debates in this chamber that the measure that was being proposed would only cost $15 million per year. If I may, I will go to what the costings actually are for this measure because I think this is a pretty interesting indication of the slipperiness of the then opposition, now the government, on this issue. In fact, even up until a couple of months ago the Assistant Treasurer was blithely repeating to journalists that he essentially did not believe Treasury's costings on this. Funnily enough, when the Assistant Treasurer gave his second reading speech last week on this bill, guess what he did not mention at all? What was the one thing that the Assistant Treasurer did not mention when he gave his second reading speech? He made absolutely no reference to costings. The Assistant Treasurer spent the last year talking about the costings of this measure saying that it was only going to cost taxpayers $15 million. He spent the last year attacking the then government for correcting him and saying, ‘No, it's going to cost in excess of $100 million a year.' Then he comes in here and takes a totally different tack last week when he is making his second reading speech on this bill and he never once refers to costings. I have a good idea why that is. It is because the costings contained within his own legislation show what a joke his arguments were that this was only going to cost $15 million. The financial impact of these measures is substantially more than that. In fact, it shows that, when the then government was arguing that the measure would cost in excess of $100 million, we were actually being conservative. That is a very conservative estimate of what this measure is actually going to cost. I want to turn to the costings. The nature of this bill is that the rates come down over a three-year period. In the first year the rate 22½ per cent; in the second year, it is 15 per cent, which was what the government actually promised before the election; and then in the third year it moves down to 7½ per cent, an extraordinarily low rate for any taxation measure in Australia. The financial impact of these measures in the first year will cost taxpayers $60 million. In the first year, as I just said, the withholding tax will be 22½ per cent. Even when the withholding tax is 22½ per cent, not the 15 per cent that the then government was advocating, the cost of that is $60 million. Remember that the Labor Party were arguing that the withholding tax rate of 15 per cent was only going to cost $15 million a year. Already that is four times the estimate that the opposition supplied the Australian people with prior to the last election. In the following year when the withholding tax rate goes down to 15 per centwhich was of course the magic target the government promised prior to the last election-it is going to cost $125 million. So, it is not going to cost the $15 million that they promised prior to the election, nor the $100 million that the Treasury estimated. Now it is actually going to cost $125 million in the second year. The following year it is going to cost the Australian taxpayer another $210 million and in the final year of the forward estimates it is going to cost another $235 million. If I am not mistaken, that makes a grand total of $630 million over the forward estimates period. So that is the final costing for this measure that the then opposition said would cost the Australian people $15 million a year. I think that is outrageous. For so long the Australian people were promised that this measure was actually not going to cost terribly much and it turns out that it is actually going to cost a truckload. As I said, the Assistant Treasurer failed to mention the costings in his second reading is speech. This measure means that the rate will come down over time from 22½ per cent to 15 per cent and then finally to 7½ per cent. That is in excess of what the Labor Party promised prior to getting into government, which was 15 per cent. But not once has this new rate actually been justified. Why is it that foreign investors only investing in Aushave tralian property trusts will pay the 7½ per cent rate of withholding tax? I cannot think of anybody within the Australian system that gets a more generous treatment than that. Certainly, Australian citizens do not get anywhere near that level of generosity when they make their investments. Why are we now levying a different rate of withholding tax on income from property trusts than we are from other types of investments? Why are we levying a different rate than, say, the rate that we levy on interest or the rate that we levy on dividends? The government has not provided one word of explanation as to why its stated policy goals have suddenly changed. In fairness, there is actually some logic to the 15 per cent rate because that brings it down to be generally in line with the withholding tax regimes on other investment types. That is actually justifiable. I pause to say that even the most gung-ho members of the industry are only calling for this withholding tax to be brought down to 12½ per cent over time. As far as I am aware, nobody within the industry was actually calling for the rate to be 7½ per cent and I would be fascinated if the government could actually provide any evidence of anybody who thinks that this was an appropriate response. I think we need to ask ourselves why this is the case. Why would a government essentially deliver a windfall to foreign treasuries out of the pocket of the Australian taxpayer? We all know the answer to that. What is happening is that they are covering up for the fact that they totally misrepresented the costings of this measure prior to the last election. They did not give the Australian people a chance to examine the costings for this policy and they stuck to their guns even though there was ample evidence that those costings were incredibly inaccurate. This bill contains measures that the opposition would normally be very happy to endorse. We are ultimately the parties of lower taxation in Australia. We have a record that a tax-and-spend Labor Party will never be able to match and we see their approach within this latest budget. There are arbitrary and relatively wide-ranging tax hikes on certain industries all of which, as is the nature of tax hikes, will ultimately flow back to Australian consumers. We are the parties that over many years authored consistent tax cuts for the Australian people. We provided muchneeded tax relief in successive budgets over the 12 years that we were in government. We are also the parties that wholeheartedly embrace foreign investment. We understand that foreign investment creates jobs and prosperity here in Australia. We also have a good record of championing Australia as a regional financial centre. Indeed, we did just many things to enhance Australia's competitiveness to make it a regional financial hub. From the tax perspective alone, we accepted the great majority of the recommendations that were made by the Board of Taxation when they were reviewing Australia's international taxation arrangements. Remember that they recommended that the rate of withholding tax for foreigners investing in Australian property trusts should be 30 per cent-that was their recommendation. This is obviously an important issue for the industry. Every player within the Australian financial scene would like to see Australia become a regional investment services hub. Debate interrupted.

166,Mr JOHN COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"Calare) (8.30 pm)Yesterday at Peak Hill near Parkes in my electorate, there was a tragic accident on the grounds of a service station. My sympathy is with the family of the man who died as a result of that accident. Police were told that the explosion occurred while two trucks were involved in a refuelling procedure. Children from two schools had to be evacuated. But it was great to see recognition today for the local firefighters, who were praised for their bravery and their quick action in bringing the blaze under control. It was a very, very tragic accident. That accident brings to mind the issue of fuel prices. In my electorate of Calare, which is certainly the largest in New South Wales, and right around Australia, the price of fuel and the price of petrol in particular-because the excise obviously does not deviate in it is an incredible cost to everybody. In an electorate like Calare, it is not uncommon for people to travel 100 kilometres every day to and from work. That is a huge cost even for people who might have good jobs, because the cost of transport today makes a big hole in their wages. In the fight for survival in the bush, the cost of fuel is an enormous issue. It is an enormous issue for those involved in production. Farmers are now paying up around $1.90 for diesel just to put a crop in, and that is no small thing, especially in times of drought. A school bus operator with a fixed contract, in my electorate, is absorbing the rising cost of diesel, which at last report, as I said, was $1.90 and going skywards. His business is becoming very, very marginal, if not unprofitable, because that sort of cost is not built in as a rising factor in his contract. It is all very well to bring in Fuelwatch, but quite obviously the government knows it will not have a flat effect but will have a negative effect for the people in country areas because the scheme will not be imposed on them. I do not think it will have any effect anywhere else either, and it will probably have a negative effect for users around Australia, particularly in areas like mine. Thank heavens it is not being imposed upon us. I think this government should think very hard about what Brendan Nelson suggested the other day. The idea of a reduction of 5c a litre has had water thrown on it and been ridiculed put on it by those opposite, but I do not think they travel very far. Somebody in my electorate who travels 100 kilometres a day to work and back would save $150 a year on that basis-and many people do travel that distance. You have only got to go from Molong to Orange or from Narromine to Dubbo and you are going to be doing 100 kilometres a day. A saving of $150 a year may not be very much for those who do not use a car much or do not travel very far when they do, but I can assure you that, for people in my region who travel thousands of kilometres sometimes just to go to the hospital, it is not uncommon to travel 300 kilometres on a round trip to see a doctor. Mr Truss-It's a legitimate tax cut, isn't it?",75
167,Mr JOHN COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"As the Leader of the Nationals has just said, it is trying to help people, but those opposite do not like it because it is not their idea. Fuelwatch will cost them nothing and give them nothing. It is good spin, but it certainly will not help the people of Calare. Something serious has to happen to help people. In an area like mine, where travel is part of everyday lifewhether it is for pleasure, whether it is for business or whatever it might be-something must happen to relieve the pressure on working families-the favourite phrase of the Prime Minister. There are no harder-working families than the ones in the biggest electorate in New South Wales, Calare, and I think they deserve more than they are getting. They need more than someone watching their fuel prices. Let us give them the five cents, because for a lot of them it is 150 bucks a year-and it might be a lot more than that for many of them. Braddon Electorate: Aged-Care Facilities",76
168,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I am really pleased to discuss two aged-care facilities which I had the great privilege of opening in the last few months. Both are great examples of community selfhelp. Both are examples of community based not-for-profit organisations that are trying look to the future and are looking to government-they have certainly looked to their community and got support-to consolidate and reinforce the belief in community based not-for-profit organisations. We need to and will support them into the future. The area I come from, unfortunately, has a markedly ageing population-one of the highest and fastest-growing aged populations in Tasmania and one of the fastest growing in Australia. The services these facilities provide are first class, but they are going to need support. It is very much an issue for both sides of this House. We all have aged-care communities in our electorates and we need to be able to help them sustain their services into the future. The first facility I had the great privilege of opening was Emmerton Park in the far north-west of Tasmania on 29 April. Mr Speaker, you know it well because you visited it many, many years ago when you were kind enough to support me as a lowly candidate in the 1998 election when I had the great privilege of being first elected to this place. You might not remember, Mr Speaker, but Emmerton Park was in a 40-year-old motel and they developed services from there, but it became so large and the demand was so large that the demand on the facility to reach standards was too much. So you would be very pleased to know that they have built an $8 million-plus facility to cater for 60 beds for the full range of services, and most of it came from the community. But the federal government kindly-and I recognise both the former government and ours for this-was able to contribute $2.5 million towards it. The state government contributed $1 million towards the cost of it and the local community contributed nearly $800,000. The rest was raised by the community itself and the to local government. So I congratulate Jonathan Smith and his board and the mayor, Daryl Quilliam, on the creation of Emmerton Park, the 60-bed supermotel. The things they have in them nowadays-it is a credit to them and a credit to that wonderful community in the far north-west. I hope you all have the opportunity to go up that way and visit sometime. Mr Speaker, you would also be aware of another facility that is located in Burnie. It is called Umina Park. ‘Umina' is a beautiful name, because it means ‘repose', which is a great description of what it means to be in this home. Again, it was built for around $8 million and is part of OneCare, which has now consolidated itself in Tasmania. The new wing, Westpark Grove, provides 40 beds and a full range of low care, in the main, through to high care and high-care dependency and secure wings. Of course, Umina Park itself, which has something like 198 residents, has the full suite of services, which is going to be the future. You are going to have gated communities, where you go in and start to purchase services of support until you move on to the lower but dependent care, to high care, to high dependent care and-hopefully not for anyone here-to dementia care itself. That is, first and foremost, part and parcel of what is going on. I congratulate OneCare. I congratulate Roz Hill, who is a director at Umina, Michael Powell, the chair of the board, and Jeff Briscoe, who is the chair of OneCare in Tasmania, for their excellent work and the wonderful contribution they make to their communities. They look to this place to help them provide these services into the future. Looking around this House, I know that everyone here cares and that it is something we need to look to in the future. It was a great honour to open both these magnificent homes for the aged. Mental Health",77
169,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ryan) (8.40 pm)Mental health is an extremely serious issue in our society. We probably all know someone, directly or indirectly, who has or is suffering from a mental health illness. Those suffering from mental illness are suffering an illness. Mental health is an illness; it is not just a personality problem or a passing mood problem. Those suffering from mental issues are not crazy people or mad or insane. They should not be forgotten in our community. They are ill and they require the very best treatment that a rich and prosperous country like ours can deliver. Some one million Australians experience some form of mental health illness, which can be in the form of depression or severe and sustained anxiety. The Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research, based at the University of Queensland, which is one of this country's great universities and is in the Ryan electorate, reports that each employee with depression symptoms would cost their employer up to $9,665 a year. The interesting aspect of the UQ research was that $7,878 of this amount could be recouped if sufferers of mental health problems had accessed treatment right at the very beginning. So just from this economic perspective we can see how significant it is for us as a nation to tackle mental health issues. I know that the Rudd government has allocated $50 million towards mental health services, including $20 million to tackle suicide prevention, particularly for young Australians. This is a good start, and I am pleased that it has been done. But let me just make one comparison with what the Howard government invested in mental health. In May 2006 the Howard government invested a massive $1.8 billion in mental health programs. The Howard government's $1.8 billion package was a remarkable and innovative funding package. For one thing, it allowed clinical psychologists and clinical psychiatrists to bill patients under a Medicare entitlement. The consequence of this was that in its first month of operation, some 45,000 Medicare billing transactions took place involving clinical psychologists and psychiatrists and accredited GPs who were able to take advantage of the new Medicare coverage. The $1.8 billion funding package also provided for more mental health nurses, some 650 new respite places and the employment of some 900 support workers to help with the daily chores of the sufferers of mental health problems. The $1.8 billion funding package of the Howard government was funding well beyond the substantial resources that had already been committed to mental health through the national mental health plans that have a five-year lifespan and are negotiated between the states and territories and the Commonwealth. I refer also tonight to an aspect of mental health that is very important for me as the member for Ryan, because I have had the opportunity of seeing many local constituents about this particular aspect of mental health. I want to talk about bipolar disorder very briefly. Bipolar disorder is a term used to describe extreme fluctuations of mood. The term describes the exaggerated alternating pattern of emotional highs and lows-the low being a reference to depression, in particular. The intensity of the associated signs and symptoms varies. Bipolar disorder can range from a mild condition to a terribly severe condition, and there may be periods of regular behaviour in between. The mood swings pattern for each individual is generally quite distinctive, with some people having episodes of mania only once a decade, while others have daily mood swings. Bipolar disorder can commence in childhood, and this is of interest to me because many young people who could potentially have great lives ahead of them may not reach their potential. Some people develop their first episode in their mid to late adulthood, so it varies dramatically amongst Australians. I raise that here because I have recently been invited to join a not-for-profit association that has its roots and its conception in the Ryan electorate. I will be pleased to elaborate further on this at another time. The Bipolar Expedition is something which I am very proud to be part of, and I want to commend Dr Tim Silk, who is based at the University of Queensland, for his leadership and stewardship, and also to commend the committee members of the Bipolar Expedition, which aims to raise significant funds to bring bipolar disorder to the attention of the Australian public as an issue within the Australian community. I also want to thank all those who are associated with voluntary work in bipolar disorder for their contribution to making the lives of so many Australians much easier. (Time expired) Blair Electorate: Roads",78
170,Mr NEUMANN,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to speak tonight about a motorway up in my electorate which has often been regarded as Queensland's worse national highway-that is, the Ipswich Motorway. There have been some media reports which have misconstrued the Rudd government's position in relation to the Ipswich Motorway. The Ipswich Motorway is the main arterial road from Brisbane, and approximately 80,000 vehicles a day travel along it. It services Ipswich, which has 150,000 people. In the next 15 years another 150,000 people will be added to that, and there will be great growth in the Lockyer Valley as well as in the old Boonah shire. For those interstate who do not quite understand where Ipswich is in relation to Brisbane, it is about where Parramatta is in relation to Sydney, and Toowoomba is about where the Blue Mountains are. The Ipswich Motorway leads from Brisbane to Ipswich quite and veers off to the Logan Motorway down to the Gold Coast. It keeps going to the south, going into the Cunningham Highway, which goes down towards Warwick and into western New South Wales. It veers off to the north, up to the Warrego Highway, which goes from the Brisbane Valley up towards the South Burnett region. As I say, it goes along the Warrego Highway towards Toowoomba and western Queensland. So those from interstate can see how important that motorway is. It is a vital link between Ipswich and Brisbane, and also for other parts of Queensland and also western New South Wales. For 11½ years the Howard government did very little in relation to the Ipswich Motorway. Mr Truss-Wrong! Absolutely wrong!",79
171,Mr NEUMANN,ADJOURNMENT,"It is interesting that the member for Wide Bay interjects. It is all words now, but there was no action for 11½ years. Where were the National Party and the coalition on the Ipswich Motorway for 11½ years? It is all rhetoric. Their response to the Ipswich Motorway can be characterised by three things: ignorance of the issue, inertia and inaction. Mr Truss-And hundreds of millions of dollars!",79
172,Mr NEUMANN,ADJOURNMENT,"No, inaction. I can tell you what, Mr Speaker: it is quite clear that the coalition says a lot now but did nothing for the people of Ipswich on the motorway. The member for Oxley and I have campaigned on this issue for years against the coalition government, which fought against the upgraded Ipswich Motorway, I can assure you. The Ipswich Motorway upgrade is important for the safety of property and people in the Ipswich area, and not having the upgrade-because of the opposition of the previous government-has been holding back economic development. The reality is that the Ipswich Motorway is going to be upgraded in four stages, just like the M1 between Brisbane and the Gold Coast: the Dinmore to Goodna section, which the coalition steadfastly refused to upgrade; the Goodna to Wacol section; the Wacol to Darra section; and the Darra to Rocklea section. The coalition government had a report back in the middle of 2003 and did nothing in relation to it despite the requests of the Queensland government and the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Campbell Newman, a Liberal. Despite the support of the coalition opposition in Queensland, of all the councils in the surrounding area and of the Queensland state government, the coalition did nothing much in relation to the Ipswich Motorway. The reality is that we will be investing lion to upgrade the busiest section. Of course, $255 million is being put towards the Ipswich-Logan interchange, and it will be completed by 2009. Seven hundred million dollars is going to the Wacol to Darra section, which will be completed by 2010. A further $100 million has been set aside for the Wacol to Darra section stage 2. There is $1.14 billion to upgrade the most critical section, the Dinmore to Goodna section, which Labor pledged during the election campaign. I am pleased to say that the Prime Minister has declared that we will honour our commitment to the Ipswich Motorway in full. We will upgrade the Ipswich Motorway from Dinmore to Rocklea. The Prime Minister said today: “On the Ipswich Motorway, we committed ourselves to its upgrade prior to the election … For the remaining 6km as you describe it through to Rocklea, we will either have that submitted for consideration by Infrastructure Australia to be funded out of the Building Australia Fund or alternatively from the next round of AusLink funding. Either way we will be honouring that commitment. He went on to say: It's basic for us, for the people in that corridor who have suffered from very poor treatment in terms of their major road connections through the city of Brisbane for far too long … Far too many people frankly have found themselves in real difficulty on that road in terms of traffic accidents as well. Labor is committed, and the Rudd government is committed, to upgrading the Ipswich Motorway in full. As the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has said on occasion in the past, this is the most critical funding priority. On 29 January 2008 he said: There is no more important road project than the Ipswich Motorway on our priority list. No more $2.2 bilimportant anywhere. (Time expired) Recycling",79
173,Mr WOOD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to discuss Australia's need for a national container deposit scheme. In my electorate of La Trobe, I am lucky enough to see many of Australia's most unusual and exotic creatures, such as the lyrebird, the wallaby, the echidna and the platypus, living in their natural environment. In particular, one of the things I have been most fascinated by is going around the local creeks in the Dandenong Ranges and never actually seeing a platypus but hearing the stories about how we have them living there. But one of the biggest problems is weeds. I must digress for one second and say how upsetting it was that the Rudd government removed a $450,000 commitment to removing wandering trad, a weed which is clogging up the creeks, in my electorate. Also, sadly, in these creeks we have bottles and containers, which are a great nuisance to the local animals and, in particular, to the platypus. There is something that seems quite remarkable. Recycling is a very important issue in my electorate, and all the people of La Trobe do their utmost to recycle. In particular, Clematis Creek-where there is talk that a platypus has been seen recently-is bounded by two shires, the shire of Yarra Ranges and the shire of Cardinia. Both councils have very strong recycling programs, yet when I go down and have a look at Clematis Creek I come across bottles and cans. Two or three weeks ago I was walking along Sherbrooke Road in Sherbrooke and, to my amazement, every 20 or 30 metres I saw bottles and Coke cans. This area abuts Sherbrooke Forest, a beautiful place. It just goes to show how uncaring some people can be about where they drop their rubbish and, with a lot of these cans and bottles having been there for a number of years, it shows that rubbish is not being collected. In 1975, the Dunstan Labor government of South Australia, fed up with people not heeding the anti-litter message, passed the Beverage Container Act-and I congratulate them on doing that-which legislated for a container deposit refund system. It was hoped that the Beverage Container Act would reduce the amount of litter in the streets. Every plastic bottle has the words ‘This bottle can be exchanged for a 5c refund when sold in South Australia' printed on its label. So you see this refund message in South Australia but not in Victoria. On visiting Adelaide several years ago, I noticed a sizeable reduction of litter in the streets; in expired) fact, I did not see one soft drink bottle or aluminium can. The success of container deposit legislation in South Australia is self evident. I believe that the best way to tackle the littering problem and encourage recycling is to establish a national container deposit scheme. Based on South Australian figures, a national scheme could save up to 500,000 tonnes of packaging landfill each yearequal to about 12 billion bottles and cans. That would be 12 billion bottles that are currently not being recycled, that are lining our streets and that are flowing into our stormwater drains and down our creeks or taking up space in landfills. Figures from the 2007 Clean Up Australia Day show that beverage containers and associated litter account for more than 20 per cent of all litter collected, up from 18.5 per cent of litter collected in the 2001 Clean Up Australia Day. Container deposit legislation will provide more incentives for people to recycle and can work in conjunction with existing kerbside recycling services. The advantages of a container deposit scheme are not limited to environmental benefits. I recall when I was in the scouting movement how we used to collect bottles and cans for the 5c refund. What I am proposing here, as has been proposed by environmental groups, is a national scheme where there is a 10 per cent item deposit on cans and bottles. I strongly support this and believe it is in the interest of not only my electorate but electorates right across the country. I disagree with those who are opposed to this because it will affect the kerbside recycling done by the council. It will mean that the council will have another avenue of funding and at the same time we will be doing our utmost to protect the environment. (Time Chifley Electorate: Blacktown Girls High School Chifley Electorate: Media Article  to speak tonight on the adjournment debate to congratulate Blacktown Girls High School and six students in year 10: Shuravi Paul, Jade Lambert, Myo Khine, Shae-Lee Hourigan, Tatupu Vaoga and Rachelle Lupingna. These students at Blacktown Girls High participated in a program called Future Problem Solving Australia. It is an initiative that aims to give young people the skills to design and promote positive futures for the society in which they live. The aim of Future Problem Solving is essentially to develop critical, creative and futuristic thinking skills. In October last year the team travelled to Perth as regional representatives where they emerged as national champions in the Community Problem Solving Division. They are the only public school in New South Wales to reach the national round and now the only public school in Australia to be invited to the international round. I am pleased to say that the international round was held at the beginning of the month in Michigan, USA, where these students were judged overall winners in three categories: education, health and civic services. I wish to congratulate their coaches, teachers Martina Rapisarda and Narelle Best. I particularly want to congratulate Blacktown Girls High community for the environment that they obviously encourage. This is an outstanding achievement by these six students from Blacktown Girls High. Mr Speaker, I hope that should they accept my invitation to come to Parliament House you might be pleased to receive them and perhaps even pass on your congratulations as well. On a less happy note, in an article in the Daily Telegraph on 16 June 2008, a constituent in my electorate, Mr Garry Nean of Lethbridge Park, said that his son was allegedly misquoted and labelled a bludger. Mr Nean claims that he and his family were randomly approached by a reporter, David Barrett, and a photographer from the Daily Telegraph while they were outside his son Steven's home. He claimed that David told him he was trying to understand the lifestyle situation for families in relation to the budget. Mr Nean told my office that David did not immediately identify himself or who he worked for until Mr Nean asked for identification. So much for the journalists' code of ethics. David asked Garry if he was working and Garry replied that because of an operation and as a result of a workplace accident he now has a caged fusion to the back and is unable to work and therefore receives the disability support pension. Garry's wife, Noeleen, is on a carer's pension, while Steven is also on a disability support pension. Garry alleges that Steven was misquoted by the Daily Telegraph reporter. Instead of saying that Steven would ‘wake up at 8.30 am and then it's coffee, cigarettes and bludge all day', Garry claims that Steven actually said that in the morning he would have a cup of coffee, a smoke, then take the kids to school. Mr Speaker, you would agree that there is a great disparity between what was printed in the article and what Steven had allegedly said. Garry claims that he asked David if anything would be printed and that David said it would not. Garry said that he asked David not to print anything. After Noeleen arrived home, Noeleen called David Barrett, the journalist, and again asked if anything would be printed. However, this time the journalist said that it depended on his editor and the circumstances of other people interviewed. Following the release of this article, Today Tonight approached Garry at his house and asked to do a follow-up interview, which he declined. I do not think it is correct for journalists prey on vulnerable people in our community, and I think it is a very serious allegation to misquote them. I hope the Mount Druitt Community Legal Centre will see what legal redress my constituents have to such abuse by an important profession, by individuals who should know better.",80
