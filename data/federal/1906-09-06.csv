1,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Postmaster-General whether he is prepared to reply to my questions of Friday last regarding a paragraph which appeared in the Age newspaper on the 30th ultimo, wherein he is reported .'to have said that the Government had a written pledge, in a letter from the contractor for the new mail service, to the effect that Melbourne and Sydney would be ports of call, &c. ?",13
2,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :.1. The report referred, to is substantially correct. a. A letter from the contractors' representative, written voluntarily, more than a fortnight before the contract . was.. accepted,, intimated that. the steamers under the contract would proceed to Melbourne and Sydney for commercial purposes. 3. No. I hope that the steamers will go on to Brisbane. PENNY POSTAGE.",13

5,Mr WILKS,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Dalley) [2.36] - Althoug the Printing Committee has recommended the printing of a paper relating, to the bursting of rifles, it has omitted from the list of papers to be printed a dered on the motion of the honourable ber for New England, asking for a deasked tailed account of the expenditure upon Royal Commissions and Select Committees. I cannot understand why it has not recombe mended the printing of a return of so public interest.",14
6,Mr KELLY,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Wentworth) [2.37] - S many Royal Commissions and Select Compointed, mittees have been appointed since Federaorder tion that I agree with the honourable memof Parliament. ber for Dalley, that the country should know exactly what expense has been curred thereby. A return giving the formation has been ordered by the House, and no attempt should be made to smother it.",14
7,Mr WATKINS,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,That is not worthy of the honourable member.,14
8,Mr KELLY,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not reflect honourable member or upon any other member of the Committee, but I think motion that when a return of this importance is ordered, it should be printed. In my opinion, any information ordered be furnished by the House is of sufficient importance to be printed and publisher! broadcast for the information of the printed. people. Mr WTT.SON (Corangamite) [2.38] As a member of the anti-Select-Committeefor and-too-many-Royal-C6mmissions party now being led by the honourable member Dalley, I feel that the information which he his referred should be printed and published broadcast. The people desire to know how their money is being spent. I shall not discuss the question whether the expenditure on Royal Commissions and Select Committees has been a wise one, but the Printing Committee should have allowed the return ordered by the House in relation to it to be printed, so that honourable members could use it when questioned on the subject. I hope that the Committee will again consider the matter, and I therefore move That the following words be added :- "" and that the return presented to the House on l at h August' last in regard to Royal Commissions be also printed.""",14
9,Mr LIDDELL,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Hunter) [2.40] - The public have a right to know how their money is expended, and whether members of Parliament receive more remuneration h than the £400 to which they are entitled under the Constitution.",14
10,Mr CHANTER,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The public have been given this information. It has already been return orprinted in the newspapers. mem- - Mr LIDDELL - I am frequently what I find in politics that it pays me to leave home and spend my time in Melbourne. It is suggested that I must making money by attending the sittings much of Royal Commissions, or in other employment of that sort. It should be made o known that Royal Commissions are not apas many people seem to think, into increase the salaries of members",14
11,Mr MAHON,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I rise to a point of order. inIs it competent for a private member to inmove now for the printing of a document laid on the table on a former occasion? I am under the impression that only a Minister can move such a motion.,14
12,Mr SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Any member can at any time move that papers be printed. upon the Standing order 322 saysWhen a Paper has been laid on the table, a may be made at any time, without notice, that the Paper be printed.",14
13,Mr WATKINS,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Newcastle) [2.41] - As to a member of the Printing Committee I repudiate the suggestion that we desire to prevent any document from being The return in question was treated as other returns are treated. Gene- rally, when an honourable member wishes the printing of a return, he asks that it may be printed, or that request is made for for him by some other honourable member. to The Committee have allowed the printing o88 Printing [REPRESENTATIVES.] of this return to stand over until some one asks that it be printed. I have no objection to the .printing of it. The first consideration of the Committee is the keeping down of expense by preventing unnecessary printing.",14
14,Mr WILKS,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Dalley) [2.42] - It seems to me a strange thing that a return giving the details of expenditure amounting to ^26,000 has not been recommended to be printed, while that recommendation has been made in regard to a paper referring merely to the bursting of rifles. Am I to understand that every paper recommended by the Printing Committee to be printed has formed - the subject of a request such as the honourable member has referred to?",15
15,Mr WATKINS,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"No ; but that is generally the case in regard to returns. There is no objection to the printing of this return so far as the Committee is concerned, but if honourable members had desired that it be printed, they could have gone the usual way about getting it done.",15
16,Mr WILKS,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Then I must regard it as an oversight on the part of the Printing Committee that the printing of this return has not been recommended, and honourable members will be supplying that oversight if they support the motion for the printing of it . '",15
17,Mr MCDONALD,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Kennedy) [2.44] - I think that it is time that a reform was carried out in regard fo the printing and circulating of public documents. not know who is to blame, but only a fortnight ago I received three copies of a return by three different posts, and it is a common occurrence to receive two copies of the same return. No doubt my experience is the same as that of other honourable members. In my opinion, if the House does not order a document to be printed, the Printing Committee should not have power to do so. Another matter to which I wish to refer is the ordering by Ministers of the printing of papers prepared by private members. I do not wish to mention names, but that has occurred recently on two occasions. I called attention to the practice twelve or eighteen months ago. I should like to know whether, in the event of my deciding to write an essay, arrangements would be made for printing and circulating it. If that course is adopted in one case, it should be followed in regard to every honourable member who may desire to place his views before the House in that form. Personally, I do not think that such Committee. documents should be printed. With regard to the particular document which has been referred to by the honourable member for Dalley, there appears to be an impression that the mere printing of it will cause to be circulated information with which the general public have not yet been made acquainted ; but that is an entirely erroneous view to take.",15
18,Mr WILKS,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The honourable member has not yet seen the details of the return?,15
19,Mr MCDONALD,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Yes , I have. The whole of the particulars have been printed in a number'of Queensland newspapers. If it had been desired that the return should be printed, the honourable member for New England should have moved in that direction-i, n fact, it is not too late for him to take that course. It is idle to contend that the mere printing of the return and its circulation amongst honourable members will lead to any further publicity than that which has already been given to it.",15
20,Mr WILKS,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Would not that apply equally to all important papers and returns laid upon the table?,15
21,Mr MCDONALD,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"No . I do not think so. I rose more particularly to express the hope that next year some more definite method would be adopted for the distribution of Parliamentary papers among honourable members. It would be sufficient to supply honourable members with a complete set of all papers laid upon the table of I do either House, without, as at present, duplicating the documents in manv cases.",15
22,Mr KELLY,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Wentworth) [2.48] - I entirely agree with everything that has been said by the honourable member for Kennedy on the question of curtailing, as far as possible, the expense incurred in connection with the printing of Parliamentary papers. I think, however, that it is very undesirable that honourable members who may desire to obtain, upon the spur of the moment, certain information contained in Parliamentary papers, should have to hunt through the files of the newspapers in pursuit of it.",15
23,Mr CARPENTER,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The honourable member has the contents of the return referred to pasted in his scrap book already.,15
24,Mr KELLY,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Does the honourable member think that I desire to use the return for any particular purpose-is that the reason why my honourable friends do not wish to have it printed? I can assure honourable members that I have not the return pasted in my scrap book; but since it is regarded as a proper document to appear there, I shall take care to possess myself of a copy. I do not know whether any honourable members are affected by the return. But, quite apart from personal or party considerations, it is due to the House that all returns containing information of importance should be printed. On the other hand, the abuses which the honourable member for Kennedy has referred to in connection with sending out a number of practically private documents, and more than one copy of other documents, should be put an end to.",15
25,Mr TUDOR,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Yarra) [2.50] - I have no objection to the return as to the cost of Select Committees and Royal Commissions being printed. I think that the honourable member for New England is to be congratulated upon having so readily obtained the return he desired. During the last Parliament I moved for a return, and, although two years elapsed before the next Parliament was elected, the return was not forthcoming; presumably the reason was that it referred to the payment of the minimum wage in the Public Service. I moved for a return upon a certain Friday, and upon the following'Tuesday the honourable member for 'Grey moved for a similar return relating to another portion of the Public Service. The information that was brought to light showed that there had been such a. large amount of sweating in two of the States that I presume it was not considered desirable to make public all the particulars that had been asked for.",16
26,Mr HUTCHISON,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The honourable member should have insisted upon getting the information he desired.,16
27,Mr TUDOR,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I made frequent representations upon the subject, but I was always told that we should soon obtain the return. I do not think that the return furnished at the request of the honourable member for New England will be of very much use for election purposes in its amended form. If only the 'particulars originally asked for had been given, such, for instance, as the amount of money received by each member, and not stating the number of days occupied by members of the Commission in travelling, and in attending meetings of the Commission, and the Administrations by whom they were appointed, some interesting facts might not have been brought to light. As it is, I do not think that the return will be so useful as an electioneering pamphlet as some honourable members seem to think.",16
28,Mr STORRER,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Bass) [2.53] - I suggest that the amendment should be withdrawn, that the report of the Printing Committee should be adopted, and that a motion should afterwards be tabled for the printing of the document to which special reference has been made. I am perfectly willing that the return should be printed, but I could not support the amendment, because I consider that it would cast a reflection upon the Printing Committee.",16
29,Mr LONSDALE,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"New England) [2.54] - I have only just heard that the Printing Committee have decided that all other papers except the return furnished at my request shall be printed. If the cost of printing the return would be so large as to involve the Commonwealth in a deficiency, I could understand why the expense should not be incurred. The question, however, is whether the information is such as should be communicated to the public.",16
30,Mr TUDOR,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The public already know; it has been published in every newspaper in Australia.,16
31,Mr LONSDALE,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not think that any attempt should be made to hide the information contained in the return. The more honourable members fight against the details being made public, the more it will appear that there is something behind their objection. I never for one moment imagined that any honourable member would refuse to let the public know the cost of Royal Commissions.",16
32,Mr WATKINS,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Who has done so?,16
33,Mr LONSDALE,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,The Printing Committee.,16
34,Mr WATKINS,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"No , they have' not.",16
35,Mr LONSDALE,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I understood so. I want to know what objection there is to having the return printed.,16
36,Mr DEAKIN,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [2.56] - I was unaware that the return had not been printed. There is no need to occupy any further time in discussing the matter. If the amendment be withdrawn, I shall immediately afterwards move that the return be printed. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Question resolved in the affirmative. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) agreed toThat the Return to the Order of the House, dated 26th July, 1906, giving particulars in regard to Royal Commissions, which was presented on 29th August, 1906, be printed. ELECTORAL EXPENDITURE.",16
37,Mr CHANTER,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"At the present time paid organizers of the Farmers', Property Owners', and Producers' Association are travelling through the Commonwealth expending large sums of money, and I should like to know from the Prime Minister if , under the Electoral Act, that expenditure will be charged to the candidates on whose behalf it is being incurred?",17
38,Mr DEAKIN,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,No doubt if this expenditure can be connected with particular candidates it can be debited to them.,17
39,Mr CHANTER,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,That can easily be done.,17
40,Mr KELLY,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Would a person be allowed to spend a large sum of money in an electorate in favour of a candidate to whom he was opposed, with a view to preventing him from being elected?",17
41,Mr DEAKIN,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,I believe that cases of that kind have come before electoral courts; but am not sufficiently familiar with the exact wording of our section to be able to express an opinion off-hand.,17
42,Mr TUDOR,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I also should like to ask whether the expenses incurred by the political organizations that lare spending a large' amount of money in supporting candidates for election to this Parliament, and are circulating a large amount of political literature, will come within the meaning of the previsions in the Electoral Act, which limit the amount of money to be spent by a candidate in securing his return ?",17
43,Mr DEAKIN,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I have looked at the Act, and find that the whole question turns upon what is meant by money spent ""on behalf of the candidate."" Looking at the matter cursorily, I should say that the words ""on behalf of "" means something like agency, that the expenditure must directly and intentionally be incurred on behalf 6f the candidate. How much further the provision goes could only be settled by the High Court.",17
44,Mr SALMON,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I should like to know whether, under section 185 of the Electoral Act, any one incurring expenses on behalf of a candidate without his written authority would render himself liable under the penal provisions of the Act?",17
45,Mr DEAKIN,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The whole question rests upon the meaning of the words ""on behalf of.""",17
46,Mr WILSON,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"1 should like to ask a question relating to the numerous protectionist associations which are springing up. in Victoria and elsewhere. Since the Attorney-General visited my electorate, protectionist associations have been springing up like mushrooms. The Labour Leagues have also been working for a considerable time throughout Victoria and New South Wales, and have been spending large sums of money. I should like to know whether these organizations, and the farmers', producers', and property owners' organizations, if they work impersonally, commit any offence in any way likely to affect the candidates supported by them?",17
47,Mr DEAKIN,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The section to which reference' has been made relates only to expenditure, and not to personal service.",17
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"As the Prime Minister has just given a couple of interpretations to the provisions of our Electoral Act, I desire to know whether the term ""on behalf of "" will cover the expenses of the labour leader, who has been at such pains to secure the vote of the Hume electors for the present Minister of Trade and Customs, and whether it will also cover the expenses of Miss Powell, who has been doing so noble a work upon behalf of the labour members in New South Wales?",17
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The leader of the Labour Party has never visited my electorate, and the honourable member knows it.",17
50,Mr WILKS,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Pu t them upon the free list, like oranges.",17
51,Mr SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I have already had occasion, to call members to order three times, and I would point out that it is of little use for honourable members to ask questions and for Ministers to reply to them if there is so much disturbance in the Chamber that the replies cannot be heard.",17
52,Mr DEAKIN,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,In only one of the cases referred to by the honourable member for Parramatta would I venture to express an opinion. I am sure that any Court would look with a lenient eye upon assistance rendered by a ladv to my honourable colleague.,17
53,Mr BROWN,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"In view of the number of questions which have been put to the Prime Minister regarding the expenditure of large sums in connection with the approaching elections, I desire to know whether he will consider the advisability of appointing a Royal Commission to ascertain the source of these political funds ?",17
54,Mr DEAKIN,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"The appointment asked by the honourable member would enlarge the expenses of Royal Commissions- a subject which we have just been discussingbecause it is quite certain that contributions able member of one kind or another are made from all sources. There is one class of expenditure to which we ought to take exception, and that is where the interests of great corporations are sought to be assisted by large donations to party funds.",18
55,Mr LONSDALE,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,Why does the Prime Minister object to expenditure to assist great corporations? In my own electorate there has been for some time past an. organizer of the Labour Party. should like to know where the funds come from with which his expenses are defrayed ?,18
56,Mr SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"Order ! I must request the honourable member to ask a question, and not to argue the matter.",18
57,Mr LONSDALE,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware that honourable members belonging to a certain party in this House, who are responsible for raising the question of where the funds come from with 'which to prosecute the forthcoming campaign, are themselves employing in various electorates organizers who are being paid?",18
58,Mr DEAKIN,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND SELECT,"I do not know where the funds come from. I should be very glad if I knew a little more as to where they were going to. NA ACT. Mr HIG'GINS - I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether, having regard to the near approach of the general elections, he will consider the desirability of bringing in a Bill to remedy a. defect in the Electoral Act by providing that members who are found guiltv of unfair practices at elections shall forfeit their seats?",18
59,Mr DEAKIN,AMENDMENT OF ELECTORAL,I will take the matter into consideration.,18
60,Mr CHANTER,AMENDMENT OF ELECTORAL,"Wit h reference to the promise made to me during last session, that an opportunity would be afforded me to bring in a Bill to amend the Electoral Act, I should like to know whether the Prime Minister, in view of the crop of cases that will probably come before the High Court, will afford facilities for the consideration of the Bill before the session closes?",18
61,Mr DEAKIN,AMENDMENT OF ELECTORAL,"I should be very glad to say ""Yes"" to that and similar applications, but am afraid that, although the opportunity may be offered to the honor",18
62,Mr CHANTER,AMENDMENT OF ELECTORAL,The Prime Minister promised to afford me an opportunity of dealing with the Bill last session.,18
63,Mr DEAKIN,AMENDMENT OF ELECTORAL,And we cannot refuse the honourable member an opportunity to lay his Bill before the House. But I very much doubt whether the time available will permit us to dispose of a disputable question such as the measure would involve. I Mr CHANTER - If the Government will give me an opportunity of doing so I shall deal with it.,18
64,Mr DEAKIN,AMENDMENT OF ELECTORAL,But other honourable members will also desire to deal with it. TASMANIAN MAIL SERVICE.,18
65,Mr STORRER,AMENDMENT OF ELECTORAL,I should like to ask the Postmaster-General whether he has yet accepted a tender for the new Tasmanian mail service?,18
66,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AMENDMENT OF ELECTORAL,"In reply to the honourable member, I desire to say that negotiations are proceeding, and I hope to be able to give the information desired in ai day or two. DEFENCE-. ADMINISTRATION.",18
67,Mr KELLY,AMENDMENT OF ELECTORAL,"I - wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether the recent proposed changes in Defence administration were submitted to the Council of Defence or to the Military Board, with a view to obtaining die advice of either of those bodies upon them ?",18
68,Mr EWING,AMENDMENT OF ELECTORAL,I will endeavour to let the honourable member have a reply to his. question upon Tuesday next. TARIFF AGREEMENT: NA ZEALAND.,18
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"As I see the Minister of Trade and Customs in his place, I should like to ask a very imporo tant question. It has reference to oranges. Upon the motion for adjournment on Friday last, I asked the Minister why, under the Reciprocal Tariff Agreement, which had been concluded with the late Prime Minister of New Zealand, oranges were to receive no preference? The honourable gentleman's answer was as follows:Jn reply to the remarks of the honourable ber, 1 can only say that it was not for lack of trying that we failed to induce the late Mr. Seddon to extend preferential treatment to tralian oranges. Both the Prime Minister and myself went almost to the point of breaking off negotiations with the late Prime Minister of New Zealand, in order to secure a preference to oranges, and to various other articles. But we could not induce him to 3'ield. At that stage the honourable, member for Hindmarsh interjectedDid he give any reason for refusing to extend preferential treatment to oranges? The Minister's reply wasHe did. His reason was lhat their admission would interfere with the growers of oranges in certain parts of New Zealand. I now wish to ask whether the Minister is aware that there is no duty levied upon the admission of Australian oranges into New Zealand?",18
70,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I was aware of it, but the honourable member was not.",19
71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Does the Minister say,19
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,As k a question?,19
73,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Minister has already answered my question. I now wish to ask whether he was aware, at the time that he made his statement, that there was no duty upon oranges in New Zealand, and never has been?",19
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"In reply to the honourable member's question, I wish to saythat it is absolutely true that a long and very heated discussion took place between the Prime Minister, myself, and the late Mr Seddon upon the question of whether New Zealand would extend a preference to both Australian oranges and lemons. Our proposal was that a preference should be extended to Australian oranges by imposing a duty upon oranges from other countries. That is what took place, and the discussion was a very keen one. The honourable member did not know until he reached Sydney, and was endeavouring to make a little political capital out of the question, that he was barking up the wrong tree. «",19
75,Mr TOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I do not believe a word that the Minister savs.,19
76,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Will the honourable member for Parramatta withdraw that remark.,19
77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I withdraw it, sir.",19
78,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I wish to ask the Minmemister whether that portion of his reply reported in Hansard, in which he says that the late Prime Minister of New ZeaAus- land refused to grant a preference to Australian oranges, because of the interference it would occasion to the industry in New Zealand, is correct ?",19
79,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I have already answered that question. Both the Prime Minister and myself desired that a preference should be extended to Australian oranges and lemons by the imposition of a duty upon oranges which were imported from abroad.,19
80,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,I wish to ask the Minister what particular oranges he was referring to when he requested the late Mr Seddon to levy a duty upon oranges imported into New Zealand from countries other than Australia?,19
81,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"If the honourable member does not know, I am not going to enlighten him upon the subject. GENERAL ELECTIONS. . Mr TOSEPH COOK - I desire to ask the Prime Minister if he is aware that, owing to the action of the Government in another place, a. proposition has been made which, if adopted, would prevent the possibility of the general elections taking place, at the very earliest, until the beginning of December?",19
82,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The Government are aware that, under the Standing Orders of another place, it has been discovered, in connection with the Senators' Election Bill, that a call of the Senate is required, for which three weeks' notice has to be given. After taking the question into consideration with us, my honourable colleague has this afternoon given notice of motion to suspend that standing order. We had in view the very contingency to which the honourable member for Parramatta has referred, namelv, that if the ordinary course of procedure were followed, it would involve a postponement of the elections. Otherwise we had no objection to it. If time had permitted we should not have objected to the delay of twenty-one days, but thatdelay would have affected the date of holding the general elections as the honourable member has suggested, and consequently my colleague has to-dav submitted a notice of motion, which I hope will be dealt with tomorrow, or at a very early date, thus permitting the Bill to be dealt with, and obviating the postponement of the elections.",19
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,To what extent will the dealing with the Bill be delayed?,20
84,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Til l the 18th instant, so that every member of the Senate will thus be afforded an opportunity of being present, and of considering the question of whether the standing order shall be waived.",20
85,Mr TOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,That will involve delav until the 19th inst.,20
86,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"There was reason to ask for some delay, and under the circumstances I think that the date suggested is a fair one. The Bill has already practicallv nassed through all its stages in another olace, and I do not apprehend that its consideration will occupy very much time in this House. ADDITIONAL SITTINGS : CLOSE OF THE SESSION.  Prime Minister whether there is any truth in the statement which is made in the newspapers today that he intends to ask the House to sit'on Friday evenings and also on Mondays, and if so. when these additional sittings are to be initiated? should also like him to say when he anticipates that the session will close?",20
87,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"I hope to make a statement upon that question not later than tomorrow. I have been engaged with my colleagues in. examining the measures which appear upon the business-paper, with a view to diminishing the size of some of them.",20
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Yet ' new Bills are to be introduced.,20
89,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"The two Bills of which notice was given today contain only about four or five clauses. I hope that the sittings of this Parliament will close about the end of the month. That will afford honourable members an opportunity to visit even the most distant electorates. To enable us to rise by the time. I have indicated will necessitate ting, and I propose to submit to the House a motion in reference to that matter. ",20
90,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,Not this week.,20
91,Mr TOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"Perhaps if I am permitted to make a statement, it will facilitate matters generally. I hope that when the Prime Minister and his colleagues are taking into consideration the question of the remaining business of the session, they will jettison a portion of their programme- I mean as far as they consistently can do so. If they will do that, I promise upon behalf of the Opposition that we will use our best endeavours to bring the session to a close at the earliest possible moment, without involving extra sittings of the House. POSTAL OFFICIALS' OVERTIME.",20
92,Mr TOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH AND NEW,"the Postmaster-General, ufon notice I. Is it a fact that sixteen officers of the Money Order Branch, General Post Office, Sydney, receiving salaries of ^160 per annum and under, were compelled to remain after official hours, until 9 p.m., to bring up certain arrears of work, for which no payment has been made ? 2. Were such arrears caused by the delay of the Department in filling temporarily, or otherwise, vacancies on the staff caused by continuous illness and the death of two officers and the resignation of others? 3. What amount in salaries, if any, was saved lo the Department by the delay in filling the vacancies? 4. What amount would be due to the sixteen officers if overtime allowance were authorized for the period workedin May last (882 hours in the aegregate) ? 5. Does the Postmaster-General not consider I that the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Regulation No. 62 should apply to the case under notice, that is, that "" overtime"" or equivalent time off be granted for every hour worked in excess of 88 hours per fortnight? 6. Will steps be taken to obviate in the future the necessity of requiring officers to work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. for lengthy periods?",20

96,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Echuca) [3.18] - In resuming the debate on this very important question, I desire to say that I am pleased to see the Minister of Trade and Customs in his place. Last night several very important points were raised,, but in his absence honourable members were unable to obtain the information required. I trust that the Minister will be able to supply these details, and so to clear up some of the doubts that exist. May I also express the hope that the discussion of this question, which last night engendered so much heat, will be continued today in a calm and deliberate manner. It 'is a purelv business proposition, respecting which there is much room for honest differences of opinion. Let us try to approach it in a reasonable way, and to arrive at a decision that will meet with the approval of all parties. One naturally wonders why a proposal in regard to one, and only one, machine used by the farmers should have given rise during the last two months to so much turmoil in the House and in the country. It is, to say the least, remarkable that such bitter feelings should have been aroused in connection with this matter, but I trust that these will be dissipated, and that we shall be able to arrive SCHEDULE. Fixed Rates. at a satisfactory determination. I address myself to this question entirely from the protectionist stand-point. I have always been a protectionist, and, as honourable members are aware, battled as hard as did any one for the Tariff introduced in 1901 by the right honourable member for Adelaide. I supported almost everv duty proposed by the then Minister of Trade and Customs, and indeed have never changed my views on the fiscal question since I first entered the political arena twenty-one years ago. If high duties are required, and can be justified, I am prepared to support them; but the sincerity of one's views with respect to the policy of protection is not to be judged by one's attitude with respect to a mere 5 per cent, or 10 per cent. duty. In the case of many articles, a duty of 10 per cent, might be far too high, whilst in others a duty of 50 per cent, might be insufficient. Everything depends upon the special circumstances relating to the proposed duty; we have to consider whether we have the raw material to enable us to produce at a satisfactory price the goods to which it is to be applied, and to have regard to various other considerations. It is impossible to lay down a hard-and-fast rule with regard to the imposition of protective duties. Every proposition must be dealt with entirely on its merits. Whilst I am prepared to impose such duties as will enable local manufacturers to employ up-to-date machinery, to pay fair wages, and. to place their goods on the market at a reasonable price, I am not prepared to entirely remove the stimulus of competition. When a local industry is firmly established, competition will reduce the price of its products, and we should impose such duties as will enable the local manufacturers to give their employees a fair remuneration for their labour. Whilst I hold these views, I have also to remember that for the last twenty-one years I have been representing farmers, who do not look upon many of these proposals eye to eye with their friends in the cities. I have on all occasions been opposed by free-traders, but as a protectionist have always carried the day. At the last general election, when I stood, as a supporter of fiscal peace, and preferential trade, I secured a larger majority than was obtained by any other candidate. I have always found that the farmers are not opposed to the imposition of reasonable duties, and that they are just as sincere as are residents of large cities in their desire to help town industries. They recognise what a large home market means to them, and that they cannot hope to obtain that market unless they are prepared to assist in establishing industries of all kinds in the Commonwealth. At the same time, the farmers want fair play, and I for one am determined that as far as lies within my power, they shall have it. I wish to view this question from every stand-point, and to do what is right to my own constituents as well as to those engaged in city industries. I also desire to be prepared to give a reasonable answer-on e that will carry conviction-to any question that may be put to me in regard to any vote that I cast for the imposition of a duty, and I feel that it would be almost impossible for me at the present stage to satisfactorily explain the proposal submitted by the Government. At present, the whole question is much obscured, but I trust that the Minister of Trade and Customs will be able presently to clear up the differences of opinion that exist in regard to it.",21
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What differences of opinion?,22
98,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I shall indicate them presently. I have put to myself the questions : Is the duty proposed by the Government a justifiable one? Will it be fair to the makers of harvesters and those engaged in the industry as well as to the users? Do the circumstances connected with the industry warrant the imposition of the duty proposed by the Government? And these are points that we should carefully consider. I have taken part in the work of revising a good many Tariffs, and have always found that special attention is given to farming interests. It is invariably recognised that it is only at rare intervals lhat farmers can obtain from the policy of the protectionist the benefits rived from it by those engaged in many other industries, and that to place high duties upon their tools of trade would be to unfairly fetter their operations. In support of this statement. I would refer honourable members to the duties on agricultural implements which prevailed under the various States Tariffs prior to Federation. In New South Wales they were free, and in Victoria they were subject to a duty of 15 per cent. I do not know that they were ever subjected to a higher duty in this State.",22
99,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"There was also a duty of 25 per cent, on agricultural machinery, as distinguished from agricultural implements.",22
100,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Quite so; but I am dealing with the duties on agricultural implements. Under the Victorian Tariff, as I have said, ithose implements were subjected to a duty of 15 per cent., whilst certain agricultural machinery was dutiable at 25 per cent., and reapers and binders were free. In Queensland these implements-wit h the exception of a few rated under a general classification of 25 per cent - were free. In South Australia some were subjected to a duty of 15 per cent., a few were rated at 20 per cent., and a number were free. In Tasmania they were free, and in Western Australia they were free in some cases and in others dutiable at 5 per cent. Five per cent, is the highest duty ever levied on agricultural implements in New Zealand. These figures support my contention that special duties to meet the requirements of the farming industry liave always been imposed on agricultural implements. In the Tariff submitted by the right honourable member for Adelaide in 1901, a duty of 15 per cent, was proposed. We are now invited to make a very grave departure from that rate of duty, and I wish to know clearly and distinctly from the Minister of Trade and Customs why this proposal has been made. The honourable gentleman should give us an explanation, in order that we may be able to justify our votes. Is the industrystruggling? Is it being crushed by competition? We have no evidence that it is. On the contrary, all the evidence goes to show that under a duty of 12J per cent., those engaged in it have been able to hold their own in the Commonwealth, and to compete with foreign manufacturers in open markets abroad. Some of them have even done more than that, because, according to de- a return submitted last night, they have been able to find a market for their machines in countries where their foreign competitors have established factories. In these circumstances, one may well ask why we are invited to agree to this high duty on harvesters. Since Federation the local manufacturers have had a very much larger market open to them. There was no complaint that the Victorian Tariff of 15 per cent, was insufficient, and now local manufacturers, instead of being confined to the State market, have the markets of the Commonwealth open to them. The Victorian manufacturers of these implements, who number sixteen out of the twenty-four engaged in the industry in the Commonwealth, ought to be well satisfied.",22
101,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,These harvesters were not imported under the Victorian Tariff.,23
102,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am referring to agricultural implements generally. According to the figures which have been laid before us, the local production of harvesters is increasing very rapidly. A few years ago the annual output was only 300, while at the present time it is over 1,900. Implements are a very costly item to farmers. A wheat farmer has to pay at least ^300 to equip his farm with all the implements necessary for its proper cultivation. That is a very large sum for a struggling man to find, and those who have not the money buy on credit, giving bills, and paying high rates of interest. not so hard for men who have made their way, and are prosperous; but we should be careful not to increase the burdens of those who are only beginning, with very little but their strong arms and stout hearts to help them. The Tariff Commission found that the harvester industry is prospering, and the free-trade members of the Commission thought that it is doing so well that the present duty should not be increased. If I were a free-trader, I should be inclined to take that view; but, as a protectionist, I am of opinion that the protectionist members have made a fair, reasonable, and even generous recommendation. They suggest that the duty shall be increased from 12J per cent, to 25 per cent. I have not hitherto voted for a higher duty on agricultural implements than 15 per cent., andi am not sure that I am not pledged to my constituents not to do so. However, on this occasion I shall support the 25 per cent. duty. The Commissioners give good reasons for their recommendation. They show that this is an Australian industry, evolved by Australian brains, and built up by Australian enterprise; that it is suited to our conditions and growth, and capable of very great development; and that its continuance will enable farmers to get replacements easily and at reasonable rates. Furthermore, they point out that if the industry spreads, it will provide work for a very large number of people. We must provide some stimulus for the inventive brains of the community, and let our young people know that if they are prepared to studv hard, and submit inventions which will aid industry and help progress, they will be rewarded. The advantages of protection have been shown in America in nothing more clearly than in the stimulation of inventive talent. Every one there who thinks that he can devise an improvement in any piece of machinery sets his brain to work to do so, knowing that if he succeeds he will be sure of a reward. Coupled with the recommendation of a duty of 25 per cent, are conditions preventing the increasing of the present prices, and requiring that within two years not more than £ j o shall be asked for a machine ; while the pavment of fair rates of wages, and the provision ofproper conditions of employment, are also insisted upon.",23
103,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"How does the honourable member propose to guarantee the observance of these conditions? It is Mr MCCOLL - I am not concerned with that matter at the present time, but I shall be glad to assist in framing measures which will secure their observance. The honourable member for Moira last night spoke as if these conditions had been: put forward by the Government; but, as a matter of fact, they were first suggested by the Tariff Commission. This is the first attempt that has been made to safeguard the interests of manufacturers, workmen, and consumers alike. The Commissioners probed this matter to the furthest limit.",23
104,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is what they did not do. I take exception to that statement.,23
105,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It is very seldom that the Minister speaks in regard to Tariff proposals, although he is. in. charge of the legislation which we are discussing. The Committee will, no doubt, be glad to hear from him on this point.",23
106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I shall not speak more than is necessary.,23
107,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The evidence taken by the Tariff Commission shows that a fair valuation for imported harvesters including an addition of 10 per cent., is £ 4 1 ; but the Government have insisted upon a valuation of £ 6 5 . We have received no information which justifies such a valuation. On the other hand, the evidence accepted by the Tariff Commission, and the statements of the late Minister of Customs, show that £ 4 1 is a fair valuation. The honourable member for Gippsland told us last night that, when he was in office, he thought that the valuation was too low, and, therefore, caused inquiries to be made in the countries from which the machines were shipped, to find out their cost.",23
108,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Thos e inquiries amounted to nothing.,24
109,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"They convinced the honourable member that ^£41 was a fair valuation. The Minister may have information justifying his action in insisting upon a valuation of ,£65; but that information has not been put before the Com- mittee. If the Minister will lay it before us, it will receive due attention. It does not, however, seem likely that machines costing £ 6 5 in the country of origin could be shipped here at an expense of £ 1 2 or £14, and sold at a profit in competition with the locally manufactured machines. I think that if the cost of producing the imported machines were as high as the Minister would have us believe, the local manufacturers would not require the protection of a duty. The honourable member for Moira said last night that if it is vided that the cost of the machines to the producer shall not exceed a certain sum, it will not matter how high the rate of duty may be. I have had numerous letters from constituents asking me to vote against any increase of duty, but my reply to them has been that I shall consider, not the rate proposed, but the price which the consumers are likely to pay, and that I shall not vote for a duty wKich will make this price unreasonable. ' Hitherto the rates of duty on agricultural implements have been lower than the rates on other machinery; but if the Minister raises the duty on harvesters to 42 per cent, ad valorem on the Commission's valuation, or to 25 per cent, on his valuation of £ 6 $ , a new standard will have been created, and the rates of duty upon other implements may be raised correspondingly, while it will be impossible to protect the purchasers of those implements. It must be remembered that the« conditions suggested for preventing an increase of price will be very difficult to inforce. Before the duties can be reduced to punish manufacturers for increasing their prices, resolutions will have to be arrived at by both Houses of Parliament, and other action will have to be taken. It would be easier for - a back-block farmer to pay an extra charge than to go to the trouble of trying to move Parliament for a [143] reduction of duties. Once the duty is raised, it will take a great deal of influence to get it lowered again. A good deal has been said about the conduct of the importers ; but I do not think that we have any more reason for trusting the local manufacturers than for trusting other persons, since some time ago the largest local maker approached the other local makers and the importers, and got them to agree to increase the price. Then, I am given to understand, he began to secretly undersell those with whom he was in agreement, so that the arrangement broke up, and prices fell again. The Minister of Trade and Customs has claimed that prices were reduced because of his action in increasing the valuation of imported harvesters. It seems to me that the effect of such action could be only to increase prices. The real reason for the drop in prices was the breaking down of the conspiracy to which I have alluded. The Minister should be frank and straightforward with the Committee. No doubt the f;iee-traders are opposed to any increase of duty, but I think pro- that a large majority of honourable members are in favour of a duty of 25 per cent. Everything turns upon the valuation to be adopted. The rate proposed by the Minister, although only 25 per cent, on his valuation of £,65, is 42 per cent, on the generally accepted valuation of £ 4 - X Last night statements were made by the honourable member for Moira and the honourable and learned member for Wannon with regard to the prices of stripper harvesters. The latter honourable member submitted price lists, in which the cost of the machine was given at .£70, and even less. I think that the limit of price fixed by the Tariff Commission is too high, and that we shall have to decide for ourselves what the price should be. I believe that very important developments will take place in the near future in connection with the agricultuial industry. In all probability large areas of country which are not now regarded as suitable for wheat growing will be brought under cultivation, and we shall need to carefully consider the probable effect of any legislation we mav pass upon those settlers who may engage in the development of the arid lands of the Continent. We should do everything we can to encourage local industry. I believe that the Australians are as bright a race as can be found in any part of the world, and my desire is to bring the farmers and the manufacturers into line, so that one class may help the other, instead of them being brought into conflict. We need protection for our industries, but we should exercise wisdom and discrimination in imturers the home market. posing duties. We should not clap on high duties without considering their effects the consumers, as well as upon the manuplace facturers, and should be prepared to justify every impost. We all remember that, when reapers and binders were not subject to duty, the farmers were robbed to the extent of 70 or 80 per cent, above the legitimate price, and we know that when attempts made to develop our iron industry, they were blocked by honourable members holding free-trade principles. I trust that Ministers will afford the fullest information with regard to the proper valuation to be placed upon stripper harvesters.",24

We have amongst us scarcely any free-traders who double the duty. are prepared to stand to their principles. The honourable member for Echuca stated that the free-trade members were prepared to vote for a fixed duty of £ 1 0 per machine-.,25
111,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No ; I stated that they might object, but that the majority of honit orable members would vote for a duty that amount.",25
112,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I understood that the free-traders were prepared to vote for equivalent of a 25 per cent, ad valorem duty upon the machines.

What does - he mean by that? Does he mean that the any farmers are purchasing two machines instead of one, or that the imported machines are taking the place of articles that ought were to be manufactured here? There can be no such thing as supplementing, the local supply, without displacement of the local article. Every machine made in America or Canada, and sent to Australia, displaces the Australian product, restricts the investment of Australian capital, and deprives Australian workmen of the employment that interestshould be available to them.",25

117,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"My honourable friend appears to be afraid to grant too much protection, and yet I challenge him to cite a single instance in which an effective protective duty has done any harm. I ask the honourable member for Echuca whether is not a fact that in those cases in which of the highest duties have been imposed the price of the article has been decreased, the quality has been improved, the workmen the liave had their wages increased, and the consumer has been benefited in every way. If that be so in the case of hats and clothbe ing, and other goods, why should not the to same conditions apply to machinery? The him. honourable member cannot cite a case in are Australia. America, or Canada in which a good, stiff, effective duty has injured the My contention is that every machine that is imported displaces the Australian article, and increases the difficulty do of providing employment for the skilled shall artisans of the Commonwealth. In the days we were frequently told that New South Wales under free-trade was pro- 'progressing as rapidlv as Victoria under Some striking figures bearing this point are supplied by the Chairman of the Tariff Commission. The numI ber of men employed in the agricultural implement industry in Victoria is given as that 1,600 as against 300 in New South Wales. the Under free-trade in New South Wales the number of men employed was 160, as These figures t is show conclusively that under free-trade the agricultural implement industry did not develop in New South Wales. I wish to refer to some statements made by honourable members opposite to the effect that the agitation for increased duties upon stripper harvesters is a purely Victorian movement. Some honourable members have gone the length of asserting that the increased duty is being proposed in the interests of one man. They forget that in Victoria alone there are a number of works in which stripper harvesters and similar machines are produced. I might mention, for example, the establishment of Messrs. Nicholson and Morrow-the firm from whom the stripperharvester was pirated. I am sure that if some of my free-trade friends could be induced to visit the works ot the firm I have referred to tomorrow, they would recognise the possibilities for improvement, and would change their views with regard to the industry. The agitation for an increase of duty comes not only from the manufacturers, but from their employees, and the complaints that have been made by Victorian manufacturers have been repeated upon sworn evidence by manufacturers in other States. Take South Australia, for instance, Messrs. Martin and Company, Hawke and Company, J. and D. Shearer and J. F. Bagshaw and Sons Limited, manufacturing firms in South Australia were as emphatic as those in Victoria in denouncing the Tariff and foreign competition, the latter of which they described as destructive and illegitimate. Yet my honourable friends opposite prattle about this movement for increased duties as being a Victorian- a one-man agitation. They have entirely ignored the report that has been placed in their hands. The Tariff has had a detrimental effect upon manufactures, not only in Victoria, but in other States.  a man over to South Australia to stir up the manufacturers there.",25

I repeat that Senator Trenwith's expenses were paid by the trades-unions, and that they were perfectly right in acting as they did.",26

125,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member may be acquainted with the politics of New South Wales; but when he makes a remark of that kind he does not know what he is talking about. At any rate, I have shown that South Australia is just as loud in its complaints regarding the effects of this combine as is Victoria. I come now to another firm in South Australia-that of Mr Rees. His firm had spent nearly ,£2,500 to perfect its plants and to effect improvements to the machine before they received any return. "" We are now,"" said Mr Rees, "" threatened to be extinguished by this American combine. If the duty be not increased the Australian manufacturers will cease to exist as manufacturers, and will merely keep small repairing shops, which means very little work for the mechanics.""

I find that the Clyde Engineering Company Limited, and the Meadow Bank Manufacturing Company, supported the complaint,- and suggestions were made in Victoria and in South Australia. Now I ask honourable members what becomes of the statement that these complaints are confined to Victoria, and that it is only Victoria which is agitating for an amended Tariff? If honourable members realized the position, they would know that right through the States, from Western Australia to the southern end of Tasmania, there has been an awakening of the people which is unprecedented.

There can be no doubt whatever that the complaints are far-reaching, that they have a good foundation, and that they are not confined to Victoria, to say nothing of one firm.

My candidature would not be in accord with the fitness of things. Seeing that I know more about city life than I do about rural life, I do not offer myself as a candidate for a farming constituency. But I would not mind contesting such an electorate if the honourable member for Grey opposed me as a free-trader. The honourable member for : Echuca knows full well that the highest duty that was ever imposed in Victoria did not injure the farmer. He is also aware that the farmers of New South Wales have always returned protectionist candidates. The cry that we shall injure the farmers and the producing ' in terests by protecting our implement manufacturers is a mere sham.

148,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Nobod y supposes that the farmer pays for them. The farmer himself knows that he does not. He is served more cheaply now, and had less to complain about than he has under free trade conditions. When the duty upon agricultural implements in this State was at its highest, the Victorian - farmer was better served than was the farmer of New South Wales - primar y producers - ^15 6s. 6d.;",28
149,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is why Victoria lost 1.10,000 of her population within ten years.",28

151,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Allowin g for the natural increase, she did.",28
152,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is another fallacy. Victoria lost her miners, her builders, a her tramway constructors, and her artisans, but her manufactories maintained her in her hour of trial and difficulty.",28

154,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable and ten learned member is talking nonsense. I should like to know who are the fat men to whom such frequent reference has been,28
155,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Then the honormember has only to read the evidence before the Tariff Commission.,28
156,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I will read something is infinitely better than that evidence, to be namely, the income tax returns.",28
157,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Oh ! - Mr Mauger - Will not those returns constitute a test?,28
158,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,No .,28
159,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Then I should like to know what will. Do the members of the Tariff Commission profess to have investigated the relative positions of manufacturers and primary producers ? Certainly not, and the honourable member is aware of that fact. There is no better test than that afforded by the income tax returns. I find that, according to the latest issue of the Victorian Year Book, apart from public companies, and the class described as "" indefinite,"" the primary producers pay the highest amount of income tax. The Sydney Morning Herald points out that according to this authorityThe average paid by each taxpayer of this class is £ $ 12s. / d . , the next highest being the commercial taxpayer with ^5 5s. 3d., then following professional with £ 2 7 - 'od., and indusI S trial with £ 3 13s. 4d. We find that the merchants-the importers - and not the manufacturers pay the largest amount of income tax. Honourable members opposite should speak, not of the "" f at "" manufacturer, but of the "" f at "" importer. Here are the figures taken from more detailed tables:-Merchants , an average of £ 1 5 ns. per taxpayer; graziers lawyers, £ i 1 8s. 4d.; doctors, £ 9 ns. 4d.; and manufacturers, £ 9 14s. i d . The manufacturers, instead of being the wealthiest members of the community, and enjoying the largest incomes, are only fourth on the list, whereas the importers are first.",28
160,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Who m does the honourable member include in that category ?,28
161,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"This return relates only to Victoria, where the manufacturers are supposed to have grown "" fat."" Mr MCWILLIAMS* - Some of them are doing very well.",29
162,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I hope that they are. I have shown beyond doubt that the importers in this State have the largest incomes, and that the primary producer comes next. Thesefiguresprove conclusively that there is nothing in the contention that the so-called "" bloated "" manufacturers are robbing the community. There are some 44,000 employees in manufacturing industries under Wages Boards in Victoria, and about 19,000 have yet to be brought under them., I am glad to notice that the present State Government have recently taken steps to bring something like another 5,000 employees under the operation of these Boards.",29
163,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But if the employers remove to the shires, they will be able to evade the Wages Boards provisions of the Factories Act.",29
164,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What we ought to do is to transfer to this Parliament the power to pass industrial legislation.,29
165,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Will our honourable friends opposite help us to effect that change ? - Mr Mauger - They have shown very little inclination to do so.,29
166,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member should put them to the test.,29
167,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have tried to, but have not yet had an opportunity to divide the House on a motion relating to the question.",29
168,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Will the honourable member support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lang?,29
169,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Certainl y not; no reasonable, sensible, or honest man would think of doing so. The workers recognise that capital and machinery are dearer and rents are higher in Australia than they are in other parts of the world, and all they ask is that they shall be paid a good day's wage for a fair day'sr work. The figures I have quoted prove conclusively that there is no foundation for the statement that manufacturers are making enormous incomes. I do not pose as their apologist. I know that there are selfish manufacturers, just as there are selfish importers.",29
170,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But the honourable member ""plays their game.""",29
171,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member does not know what he is talking about. If my attitude on this question may be so described, I would sooner play the ""game"" of the Australian manufacturer than that of American exporting rings, trusts, and combines, which we cannot regulate. We cannot determine what shall be the wages and hours of labour of those employed by foreign rings, whose ""game"" is being played by the honourable member.",29
172,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am playing the game of the man who uses these machines.,29
173,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member ought to know that when reapers and binders were free under the Victorian Tariff, the local farmers were fleeced to the extent of £ 1 5 or £ 2 0 per machine by the very men whose cause he is now championing. He ought to know that the history of unrestricted imports is one of high prices, robbery, and jobbery. The honourable member is advocating the cause of the foreigner, whilst I am advocating that of the Australian manufacturer. In doing so, I maintain that I am championing the cause of the Australian worker, and seeking to lay a foundation for good wages and reasonable conditions and hours of employment in the Commonwealth. In taking up this position, I am supported by the representatives of the working classes in Victoria. When the Tariff was under consideration in 1901, the following resolution was passed at a conference between representatives of the Trades Hall Council and the Protectionist Association:That this conference, while heartily supporting the principle of wages boards and arbitration, is strongly of opinion that protection at the Customs House is a first essential; and urges that, in the interests of wage-earners, effective protection should first be given to Australian producers and manufacturers, with a view to securing the "" new protection,"" in the form of wages boards and arbitration. The members of that conference recognised that protection must come first; that the work must be here before we can have good wages, and that when we have secured the work for the men, this Parliament-o r as the law now stands, the State Parliamentmust insist on reasonable conditions of labour being observed. I would direct attention to a very interesting return published in the Age on 24th ult., showing that the importation of goods, the manufacture of which offers scope for local employment at fair wages, is increasing at an alarming rate. I find, for instance, that the imports of machines and machinery last year were of the value of ^851,797, whilst those imported during the first seven months of this year were of the value of ^1,067,841. These figures show very clearly that there is every reason for passing a Tariff which will give our manufacturers a home market.",29
174,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Most of the imported machinery is patented.,30
175,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is not so.,30
176,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That which is not patented here, could be manufactured in Australia.",30
177,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is so. lieve that all machinery except that which is protected by patents should and could be manufactured in Australia, and no duty will be effective or satisfactory to me unless it secures the local market to the local manufacturer.",30
178,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Cowper) [4.25] - The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has directed attention"" to a phase of this question that has not been considered as fully as it might have been. After referring to the cost of distribution, he urged that the profits made by the local manufacturers are not very large, and that the farmers could not do better than buy agricultural implements and machinery made in Australia. The honourable member also contended that every machine imported into Australia displaces an Australian machine, and an Australian workman. That assertion could be made of almost any imported article. It is worthv of note that the honourable member refrained from making any allusion to the way in which the farmers have been blackmailed by manufacturers, who have been demanding very high prices for their goods. I have no sympathy with the Massey-Harris Company, or the International Harvester Company. I certainly have none for the local manufacturers who combined with the foreign firms to fleece the farmers.",30
179,Mr HUME COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The local manufacturers lowered the price after they left the combine.,30
180,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"And they could further reduce the price of their machines by ,£10 and yet secure a good profit. The Tariff Commission has revealed the fact that the farmers are simply being black-mailed by have. the local manufacturers of harvesters. As the result of the disclosures made by Butter Commission, the dairymen have established co-operative societies to with their produce, and I think that the time is not far distant when those engaged in primary industries will co-operate to wipe out, not only the local, but the foreign manufacturers who have been fleecing them. I . for one, would give them every assistance in taking steps in that direction. It is outrageous that a profit of ^40 should be secured on one of these machines. The Massey-Harris Company have conclusively proved what is the cost of their harvesters.. With all due deference to the Minister of Trade and Customs, I wish to say that I am prepared to accept the opinion exI bepressed by his predecessor in office-the honourable member for Gippsland-that the invoices in respect of the Massey-Harris machines imported into Australia are correct. When holding office as Minister of Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Gippsland was disposed to believe that these machines were being invoiced at a price below their real value; but when he went to the fountain head he secured information that satisfied him that the invoices were correct. The report of the Tariff Commission shows that this industry, instead of languishing, is in a verysatisfactory condition. Indeed, I know of no more profitable industry in Australia. Instead of having under consideration a motion to increase the duty on harvesters, we should be taking steps to prevent our farmers being treated in such a scandalous way as they have been. The present state of affairs should not be allowed to continue. The farmers, by co-operation, could, like their fellow workers on the Continent of Europe, secure their machines at cost price. It is monstrous that £,\o should be paid by way of commission on the sale of the harvester. I cannot agree with the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta that an ad valorem dutyshould be imposed. As a rule, an ad valorem duty operates fairly, but it would not be safe to place the working of such a duty in the hands of a Minister who, for Customs purposes, has arbitrarily raised the valuation of these machines from ^38 to £ 6 5 each. Under the Customs Act, the importers of harvesters have no right of appeal'-the y have no means of redress.",30
181,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I think that they will,30
182,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I do not think that the Custhe toms Act provides' any means of redress. It must be given as a concession. It has deal been said that the Canadians and Americans have pirated the Australian machines; but a plough which came from America was very quickly copied in Australia.,30
183,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the honourable member say that there is in Australia good plough made on an American model,31
184,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes ; the ""Bluebird"" such a plough. If the Australian model has been copied, it is the greatest ment that could be paid to its inventor.",31
185,Mr SALMON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,If the honourable member were the inventor he would not be pleased about it.,31
186,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I might not like it. The stripper-harvester, however, is not the vention of the brains of any one man. According to the Tariff Commission, harvesting implement was in use in ancient Gaul. This machine is the result of many brains, not all of them possessed by Ausinto tralians, though I understand that the latest improvements are Australian, and give every credit to those who have perof fected it.",31
187,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The modern harvester is entirely the product of Australian brains and enterprise.,31
188,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Australia n farmers not be fleeced when they want to purchase it. The honourable member for Moira presents a farming constituency, and tried to prove that the local manufacturers not receive too much for their implements. He denounced in unmeasured terms the importation of harvesters from Canada and America, but he did not mention . fact that Australian harvesters are being imported into Canada, eleven having been sent there last year.",31
189,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"As patterns, I suppose.",31
190,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Stripper-harvester s hitherto not been much used in Canada, but, - no doubt, the farmers there are ginning to try the Victorian implement, if rates of duty are increased. and I hope that there will be a good market for it in the Dominion.",31
191,Mr HUME COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"How can there he good market for it there with a 45 per cent, duty against it?",31
192,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The Canadian rate, according to the Commission, works out at about I 3 i per cent. Honourable members wish to impose a fixed rate of £ 1 6 per machine, although it has been shown that the ject of wages? locally made implement has an advantage of some £ 1 8 over the imported implement. The honourable memis ber for Moira tried to show that' the higher the duty the less the consumer - to pay; but the Victorian stock tax did not discussion. work out in that way. Victorians could not buy cattle more cheaply because of the tax. The honourable member for a Gippsland, although he has declared that ? he will support a duty of; 25 per cent^ is says that had he been a member of the Commission, he would not have recomcomplimended so high a rate. He considers that the locally made implement has an advantage of £ 2 0 . The evidence before us shows that the Australian production of harvesters is increasing every year. Something like 4,000 machines are now being inmade in Victoria, and a fixed rate of ,£16 on each imported machine would make a a difference of something like ^64,000, which is too much to take out of the pockets of the primary producers to put the pockets of the manufacturers. The farmers must take this matter into their I own hands, and, by co-operation, get rid both the foreign and the local manufacturers who are living on the game. I am proud of our Australian workmen, who can turn out articles equal to any imported; the advantages derived from High duties should go, not to them, but to their employers. I do not blame Mr MCKay for retrying to get as much as he can from a Minister who listens to his comdo plaints with a sympathetic ear. His business, however, is not in a languishing condition. In 1897 he manufactured 75 machines, on which it is estimated that the he made a net profit of ,£20 each, or now .£1,500 altogether. In 1898, his output was 150 machines , and his profit .£3,000; 1 in 1899, his output was 301 machines, and his profit ,£6,000; while in 1.904, his profit have was .£30,000; and in 1905, ^38,600. It is trying to throw dust in the eyes of the befarmers to say that prices will be reduced They should bear in mind this profit of .£38,600 made by one firm, and, by proper co-operaa tion, supply themselves with agricultural machinery. I shall oppose the Government proposal.",31
193,Mr STORRER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I ask, as a point of order, whether honourable members must not confine their remarks to the amendment proposed last night, which deals with the sub",31
194,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The whole question so involved that it is impossible to confine honourable members to the amendment, and I has have, therefore, allowed the usual general  Government propose to levy a fixed duty on imported harvesters of \j£i6 per machine. According to the report of the Tariff Commission, the natural protection given to local manufacturers against the competition of the Massey-Harris machines is ^14 16s. 6d., and against the competition of the International harvesters .£12 3s. 6d., the difference being accounted for, I believe, chiefly by a difference in railway charges. If to this natural advantage the proposed duty is added, it will be seen that the local manufacturers are as'king for an advantage of ^30 16s. 6d. in connection with the Massey-Harris machine, and of ,£28 3s. 6d. in connection with the International harvesters. We have the testimony of the chief of the Customs Office in Canada that the cost of the Canadian machines is ^38 each. Therefore, what is desired by the local manufacturers is a protection of more than 75 per cent - a prohibitive rate such as must delight the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. It might be well contended that the existing duty is sufficientlyhigh, seeing that none of the local manufacturers have shown that they are suffering from the foreign competition. Mr MCKay, who is the prime mover in the agitation for prohibitive duties, has had to admit that last year his output was 1,930 machines, and the Tariff Commission estimates that his net profits on each machine, on last years selling price, which was ;£8i, amounted to ;£i8 2s. 7d. That being so, why should we impose the monstrous duty now asked for. On thesefigureshis profits amounted last year to over .£34,700. which is more than 200 average farmers make in any one year. Those figures show that the industry is fairly protected. But still the manufacturers are not satisfied. It is evidently desired to shut out the imported article altogether, and leave the farmers to the tender mercies of the local firms. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports would have us believe that the consumers would be perfectly safe under these conditions. We have, however, had evidence that, some time ago, the manufacturers deliberately entered into a conspiracy to rob the farmers. - stated in trie report furnished by the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission that the local manufacturers increased the price of stripper harvesters from X° 3 to £ 8 1 . We are now asked to hand over the farmers body and soul to those who have had no mercy upon them in the past, and who would have as little consideration in the future if their operations were not to some extent checked by outside competition. It has been urged that a high duty should be imposed to protect local manufacturers, because higher wages prevail in Australia than in the United States or Canada. As a matter of fact, however, the Commission show that the rates* of wages paid in Canada are practically the same as those ruling in the works of the Sunshine Harvester Company.",31
195,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Accordin g to the statements made by some honourable members, the Sunshine Harvester Company pay lower wages than any other firm.  regard to the statements made by other honourable members, but I am relying upon the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission. I intend to quote the rates of wages paid, and to make an allowance for the extra hours worked in Canada - According to the evidence given before the Commission, fitters in Canada are paid £ 2 13s. per week, whilst in the Sunshine Harvester works they are paid £ 2 ns. 6d. per week. Joiners in Canada are paid - Q2 15s. 5d., and in Australia £ 2 ns. 3d. Painters in Canada are paid £ 2 16s. 8d. per week, and in Australia 15s. 6d. Blacksmiths, in Canada are paid f.2 16s. 6d. per week, and in Australia £ 2 9s. 6d. per week! Right through, the piece, the rates paid in Canada are higher than those received by the workmen of the Sunshine Harvester Company. I desire to be perfectly fair, and I intend to make a deduction from the Canadian wages, owing to the fact that the operatives work for sixty hours per week, as contrasted with the forty-eight hours worked in Australia. According to the experts who were examined by the Commission, 30 per cent, of the cost of producing the machines is represented by labour. It is admitted that in Canada the cost of producing the machines is .£38, but a South Australian manufacturer mentioned a much smaller sum as representing the cost. On the assumption that the machine costs .£38 to produce, the wages represent I^£i2 8s. If we make allowance for the extra hours It is worked by the Canadian mechanics, the local manufacturers are at a disadvantage, as compared with those in Canada, of ^£2 9s. 4d. per machine, in respect to wages. And yet, in order to compensate the Australian manufacturer for this small loss, we are being asked to impose a duty equivalent' t 0 £ 3 ° per machine. It seems to me that the request that is now being made upon us is a most brazen one. Now I desire to say a word or two with regard to the action of .the Minister of Trade and Customs in increasing the valuation of imported harvesters to , £ 6 5. It is a dangerous thing for a Minister to increase a duty at any time. He has very large powers, and they should be used with extreme care. Commission have made a full inquiry into the valuation of imported harvesters, and the protectionist members-no t the free trade members-of that body have come to the conclusion that there is not a tittle of evidence to justify the increased valuation. Under these circumstances, it seems to me that the only manlv course open to the Minister is to acknowledge that he has made a mistake, and to refund the duty collected over and above that which would have been levied upon the lower valuation.",32
196,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The Minister made no such mistake. twopence for such protectionists as could bring in a report of that kind. not the evidence they should have had before them.  when the Minister will be very glad of the support of the members of the Commission who came to the conclusion to which I have referred. His statement is a mere subterfuge. He should either prove that the evidence given before the Tariff Commission is wrong, or produce the testimony which he states that the members of the Commission have not seen, and which would prove that he was justified in increasing the valuation to ^ 6 5 . He should do this, or admit that he has made a mistake.",33
197,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have made no mistake, and the courts will prove it, yet.",33
198,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is that why the Minister tiied to prevent the courts from proving it?,33
199,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not like tectionists of the milk and water order. Witnesses were frightened to go before the Commission and give evidence, owing to the action of some members of the Commission.. I could not induce one witness to go, because he would not submit to be bullied by the Commission.",33
200,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Was the Minister trying to find witnesses?,33
201,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No , I was not.  mean to say that any witness who was willing to give evidence would not have received the protection of the Chairman, and fair play at the hands of the other members of the Commission.",33
202,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Some witnesses did not receive fair play. They were bullied by a member of the Commission from Tasmania.,33
203,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Order ! I must ask the Minister to cease these continuous interjections. The Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Let honourable members cease attacking me.,33
204,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The Minister made an unnecessary reflection upon a public man. .  should be exercised by any Minister in raising the valuations of imports in such a manner as to practically increase the duty to which they are subject. I am prepared to believe that the Minister did what he thought was right, but now that the Commission, after due deliberation, have stated that there was not a scintilla of evidence has to justify the fixing of the valuation of I would not give stripper-harvesters at £ 6 5 , the Minister should justify his position, or withdraw They had the increased valuation. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I shall withdiaw the duty on salt if the honourable member likes.  suppose that such statements hurt me? If so, he is mistaken. There is the more necessity for the Minister to justify his position, because his predecessor was so satisfied with the previous valuation that he declined to increase it.",33
205,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,But'he did increase it from £26 to £ $ .  which satisfied him that £ 5 8 was a fair valuation.,33
206,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Bu the did not obtain the evidence.  upon the evidence of a man who was inproterested in the trade, and that is a verydangerous thing to do in any case. The Minister acted upon the evidence of a man who, in the face of a sworn declaration upon the other side, said that to the best of his belief the invoices were wrong. The Commission have succeeded in obtaining very complete evidence as to the cost of stripper-harvesters, and, if I were the Minister, I would not sit in my chair an hour before I would justify myself or acknowledge that I had been misled by the information supplied to me, and take the manly course of withdrawing the increased valuation.",33
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not think that the honourable member can accuse me of having failed to take a manly course.  it was a dangerous thing for the Minister to increase the valuation. Such a course should be adopted only under extreme pressure, and after the Minister had satisfied himself that there was the fullest warrant for such a step. The conditions under which the local industry was being carried on were not such as to call for any special action. The local manufacturers were not being subjected to any very severe hardships. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports knows very well what was the reason for the agitation. The Minister cannot ignore the fact that eight gentlemen who must be credited with being as much concerned for the welfare of the manufacturing industries as he is himself, have come to the. conclusion that there is not a scintilla of evidence to justify the increased valuation. In the face of the report of the Commission, the Minister should either produce evidence to justify his action, or acknowledge his mistake.",34
208,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I other side prove their case.  any further time. I am satisfied that there is no justification for an increase of duty equivalent to £ $ 0 per machine, or 75 per cent. The direct and indirect protection now afforded to local manufacturers is quite sufficient, and I would not grant them one penny more. I would not give them a fraction more. I will vote with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, believing that in doing so I am extending to the industry more protection than it really deserves. I need scarcely mention that one manufacturer connected with it has netted no less a sum than ,£34,000 during one year. An industry which can yield such returns ought to lie very well served by a fixed duty of ,£10 per machine.",34
209,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Bendigo) [5.1] By way of personal explanation, I should like to say that the Minister of Trade and Customs has seen fit to make a remark which seriously reflects not only upon the Tariff Commission, but upon myself as Chairman of that body. He has stated that he understood that witnesses were afraid to appear before the Commission",34
210,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I not only understood it, but I know it. names, if necessary.",34
211,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The Minister stated that he understood that witnesses were afraid to come before the Commission lest they should be bullied and insulted, and be denied fair play. All I can say is that every witness who"" came before us received a fair hearing. He was fairly ex-' amined as to his evidence-in-chief, and in the ordinary course he had to submit to cross-examination all round the table cross-examination by protectionists and free-traders alike. It is quite true that at times a witness may have been pressed severely by members of the Commission in the exercise of their undoubted rights. But whenever witnesses were frank in their answers they had no reason whatever to complain of being pressed unduly, and when ' they appealed for it they invariably received the protection of the Chair. I will say, on behalf of the free-trade members of the Commission, as well as the protectionist members of that body, that when-, ever the Chair decided in favour of a wit-' ness, he immediately received the consideration which the Chair directed should be extended to him. Although sometimes shall make the the protectionist, and at other times the free-trade, members of the Commission were severe in their cross-examination of witnesses, they always yielded to the Chair whenever the Chair appealed to them to give fair play to witnesses. Some witnesses wished to claim privilege, and did not want to answer questions-indeed , they had to be frequently appealed to by myself in that connection. I had occasion many times to point out that, in their own interests, they ought to give full answers to the questions put to them, otherwise they would probably suffer, and be prejudiced. In the course of their examination, some manufacturers positively .refused to give evidence regarding the cost of the production of their manufactures. They were willing to give private and confidential information, but, asChairman of the Commission, I declined to receive any information except such as we could publish to the whole world, and such as I could repeat upon the floor of the House.",34

217,Mr THOMAS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Are we to accept every statement which appears in the newspapers ?,35
218,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"At any rate, this statement is true.",35
219,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Then it is scandalous.,35
220,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I must ask able members to maintain order.,35
221,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Robertson) tion [5.6] - I am very much surprised to learn from the Minister that manufacturers afraid to appear before the Tariff Comwhich . mission when they discovered that it real searching Commission of inquiry. am interested to hear that they were prepared to tender evidence which they the power to offer and the withholding which was calculated to prejudice their terests in the eyes of those who read Commission's reports. It does appear me that the Commission has done a very great deal of good work, inasmuch as demonstrated that many men are prone to make statements which they are not pared to substantiate upon oath. In Parliamentary lobbies some men are quite ready to make all sorts of statements which they are not willing to subscribe to upon oath. I think that.the Minister of Trade and Customs has shown very clearly that these individuals are not truthful, otherwise they would have appeared before the Comme mission and have given evidence. I say that the stripper-harvester industry appears ' to be a very flourishing one. No single to firm enjoys a monopoly of the trade.. In a Victoria there are sixteen firms engaged in",35
222,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,On e firm practically enjoys a monopoly.,35
223,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am aware Mr H . V. MCKay does more business than does any other firm. He is an enterprising man, who has devoted his attention to perfecting the machine which he manufactures. I have no grievance against him. It is to his credit that he has perfected his machine by utilizing the brains of every inventor who has introduced an improvement which he has not talken the precaution to patented. In New South Wales there are five firms engaged in the industry. In been South Australia there is a firm which is .producing a machine that is quite equal to busithat turned out by Mr MCKay. During course of this debate very little has been said about the firm of Messrs. John Martin and Co., of Gawler. When I was a boy the Citv of Adelaide was called "" the farivillage,"" but it was there that the idea of the stripper-harvester had its germ.",35
224,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Messrs . Martin and Co. do not manufacture agricultural implements so much as they do general machinery.,35
225,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is so. honorThe firm has an immense business, and it undertakes even the construcof railway locomotives. There is not an invention which it has not the means were of acquiring. It produces a harvester is quite equal to that manufactured was a by Mr MCKay, and if there be any I blame attaching to the latter, that blame not also rests upon this firm. The price had charged by Mr MCKay for his harvester of would soon be reduced if the price of the inSouth Australian machine were reduced. the Why should we single out Mr MCKay for a to special advertisement? Why do we not condemn the manufacturers of harvesters in it has New South Wales? If censure is to be administered, it should be apportioned all preround. The Tariff Commission has thothe roughly investigated this question-  Customs declares that it has not. He savs that witnesses feared to appear .before the Commission lest they should be bullied.",35
226,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It appears to that the Commission were not warranted in investigating the claim of the manufacturers of stripper-harvesters as exhaustively as they did. 'But they have chosen to do so, and the evidence which they elicited conclusively proves that the local manufacturers of these machines are able to produce them at a cost of , £ 4 1 , including the cost of labour. An operator who is engaged in the industry informed the Commission that it cost ,£25 to produce a machine, and he estimated sundries at an additional £ 5 . But accepting the Commission's own figures as correct, the cost of manufacturing the stripper-harvester is ^ 4 1 , apart from an additional £ 2 1 for distribution. would make a total of £ 6 2 , and as these harvesters are sold to the farmers at ^ 8 0 , a clear profit of £ 1 8 is made upon the sale of each machine. In New South Wales and South Australia the manufacturers can make a profit of ,£18 2s. j d . on each machine. Surely that is a sufficient profit upon an outlay of £ 6 2 . Mr Martin stated that it cost him no more to produce his machine than it would cost elsewhere, and that he was willing to sell it for . £ 6 3 . admit that it was not the perfected machine of today, but, nevertheless, the cost of manufacturing it was quite as large. Honourable members must recollect that in twelve months the stripper-harvester will have been still further improved upon. Experience shows that when so improved, its cost of production will probably be less than it is at the present time. In these circumstances, why should the selling price be more than £ 6 0 ? When these machines were selling in South Australia at £ 7 0 was being charged for them in Victoria. The farmer is well able fo take care of himself if he is an unrestricted choice. He has the readv cash and. if fie is allowed buy in the cheapest market. sonable competition, the man who has chines to sell will be readv to dispose of them at a fair profit. There' may combination to keep up the price of vesters. Judging from the fact that a fit of /"".iS per machine is being That accepting the figures as sworn to Companies' representatives, and accepting the expenses of an Australian-made stripper-harvester, merchandising profit on the Landing cost, including duty... Selling expenses Merchandising profit Selling price ... am inclined to think that there is. As one who has had considerable business experience, I am disposed to think that many people will be crowding into this industry if they are once satisfied that they can secure such a profit.",35
227,Mr SALMON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Why is not the sewing machine industry crowded, since in that a profit of 300 per cent, is made ?",36
228,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"As a matter of fact, many firms have crowded into that industry, and different fields are allotted to them. The names of certain This makes of sewing machines are familiar to us in Australia, but when we go to other parts of the world we hear for the first time of entirely different brands. The position is the same in regard to the manufacture of agricultural implements and machinery. In Victoria machines that are not employed in New South Wales a.r<> used, and vice versa. At present there are sixteen firms producing these machines in Victoria, three in South Australia, and I five in New South Wales. I remember when the number was far less, and it seems probable that others will soon enter the industry, for a profit of ,£18 per machine is an excellent one. I can understand a protectionist arguing that an industry ought to be "" put on its feet"" as it were, and protected from competition abroad, where the cost of production is less. But the position is very different in regard to the harvester industry. The local manufacturer can compete with the foreign makers of these machines. According to the report of the Tariff Commission, a Massey-Harris machine costs j£6o to given produce and land, and an International harvester, £$5, whilst locally the cost of to do so, will manufacture is £41. With rea- Sir JOHN QUICK - ^ 3 8 is the factory macost of the Massev-Harris machine. Mr HENRY ' WILLIS - In support be a of mv statement. I would draw the attenhartion of honourable members to paragraph pro16 in the report of the Commission on made, I stripper harvesters. by the Massey-Harris and International Harvester estimated factory cost, and the estimated selling the following three tables will show the sale of these three machines :Massey International Australian Harris.

229,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,",£6 o is. 4d. is not the factory cost of the Massey-Harris machine.",37
230,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is the factory cost plus freight and other expenses incurred in landing the machines in Australia.,37
231,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Includin g the profit.,37
232,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I shall say nothing about the profit, but the figures I have read cannot be disputed. The difference between the expenses incurred in selling these machines is certainly remarkable. I meet the - agents - all over New South Wales, and, so far as I can judge, there is very little difference between the expenses incurred by the travellers of the several firms. If anything, the agents of the Massey-Harris Company travel in better style, and yet, whilst their selling expenses amount to ,£17 16s. n d . per machine, that of the Australian manufacturers is -£21 17s. sd. An allowance of ,£17 f ° selling expenses ought to be sufficient for anv manufacturer to work upon. The Government now proposes to impose a duty of ,£i6 per machine, and if that impost were added to the merchandising, profits already secured by the local manufacturers they would make a profit of £Z4 2s. 7d. on everv machine sold by them: I do not think, however, that the increased duty would be added to the present selling price. It seems to me that the proposal is practically one to prohibit the importation of harvesters, and that even the reduced duty of .£10 suggested by the Chairman of the Tariff Commission mav be regarded in the same light. If all 'that is desired is the imposition, of a protective duty, why should such an impost be proposed ? If , on the other hand, prohibition is desired, why stop at aduty of £ 1 0 per machine? Why not impose one""ofi .£50? I am satisfied that the introduction of American machines is advantageous to the local manufacturers, as well as to the farming community, since it compels the local makers to adopt up-to-date methods, and to produce an article equal to the imported one. The United States of America, with its population of 80.000.000, is the home of inventive genius. of an inventive turn of mind in the old country, being unable to secure that assistance which should be accorded them, emigrate to America, where they find scope for their genius. It is for this reason that the United States produces more improved machinery than does any other country. There is a field there for brains. Manufacturers there will improve on the machines that we bring out from time to time, and if we give them a chance to export to Australia our farmers will be advantaged. It seems to me, however, that both the Minister of Trade and Customs and the Chairman of the Tariff Commission desire to prohibit these imports, and that, if we are to Have prohibition, we might just as well vote for the motion as for the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. That honourable member is a shrewd business man, who has presided in an admirable mariner over the deliberations of the Commission. If he thinks that there is an opportunity for the local manufacturers to add the increased duty to the price which they charge the farmers for their machines r",37
233,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is it not proposed to provide that the price shall be reduced within two years to -£70?,37
234,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is a very plausible condition; but I would remind honourable members that one Parliament o cannot bind another any more than a Ministry can bind its successors in office. The local manufacturers will treat with disdain any proposal we may make as to the way in which they, shall manage their own business. They would be quite justified in doing so. What right have we to interfere and to sav that they shall reduce their prices? If we wish to secure reduced prices we should allow competition, to prevail.",37
235,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Where was the competition during the reign of the combine?,37
236,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The combination in Australia was to keep up prices and prevent competition. There is, undoubtedly, an understanding amongst the manufacturers that the price of these machines shall not be reduced, because the rates prevailing in all the States are very similar. It is a common occurrence for business men to meet at their clubs and elf.ewhere, and when they do so they naturPeople ally discuss business matters. The tendency amongst them is to keep up the price of their products, and to keep down the pi ice of their raw material. We cannot regulate their trade. They have to pay their way, and to take risks; but, seeing that we have had in Australia a combination to prevent competition, is it reasonable that we should prevent the importation of machines by persons who are not in a ring?",37
237,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The importers were in the combine.,38
238,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I think that said a local manufacturer was in the combine.,38
239,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They were all in it.,38
240,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Quite so. cost There is nothing novel in such a procedure. Bv-and-by, when we reach that socialistic state about which we have heard so much, we may hear no more of this system, and is just possible that when a member of a combine does something of which the others do not approve, the "" fat will be in the fire,"" to use a colloquialism-and we shall cient protection. have competition, and reduced prices. What will the effect be? Will not the farmer be able to garner more wheat, to put larger quantities on Victorian to the market, and thus to sell at lower prices? But, if you put him to the pense to which he was formerly put. the price of your loaf will be increased. am not here to legislate for the primary producers as a class; but I point out that they pass on the benefits given to them, afford and enable the consuming public to pura chase more with its money. Those who member wish well to the masses of the people should make things easy for the primary producers. I think that a profit of £ 1 on a harvester is quite enough. The proThis posed duty would be prohibitive, and if , by prohibiting importation, we destroy competition, prices will keep up. Already chines have been sold for as little as £ 6 and, no doubt, the jealousies of the local manufacturers, caused by the endeavours to get ahead of one another by purchasing large lines of timber, by buying up tin in large quantities, and by paying higher wages than are agreed upon, in order to get better men, will from time to time cause a falling-out among them, as the result of which prices will go down. But that is not a reason why we should prevent competition from outside. Such competiit tion is likely to bring prices down to ^ per machine, and perhaps to an even lower sum. According to the Tariff Commission's report, ai number of farmers gave evidence in opposition to the proposal to increase the duty on stripper-harvesters. They dently' thought that the prices would increased if the duty was raised, and considered that the existing rate is suffifor ciently high.",38
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I was among farmers last week, and they were all of the contrary opinion.",38
242,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"One witness that it costs from ^ 1 4 to ^ 1 5 to bring a harvester from the factory in, North America to the warehouse in Australia. Is not that natural protection enough? He arrived at his estimate by considering the of setting up the machine, taking it to pieces, packing it, providing cases, paying freight by rail from the factory to the shop, paying freight by sea, and the exi t pense of insurance and landing in Australia. In the opinion of the farmers generally, according to the Tariff Commission, the local manufacturers ailready have suffiMr James MCGregor, who is a farmer, estimated the actual cost of turning out a machine fit for work at .£30, and, as an operator in one of the factories estimated the cost at £ 2 5 , showing how it was made up, Mr. exMCGregor was not far out. He told the Commission that, if £ 2 0 were added I to the cost of production to provide for the cost of marketing, and another £ 1 0 to provide a profit, the manufacturer could to sell at £ 6 0 , instead of at £ 8 i difference of over £ 2 0 . The honourable for Moira said last night that these machines would come down in price to £ 7 0 ; but his farming friends sav that 8 £ 6 0 would be a sufficiently high "" price. is not the opinion of a'free-trader.",38
243,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes , it is. Mr McmaGregor is the only pronounced free-trade 3 , farmer in that portion of my constituency and rivalries in which he lives.",38
244,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am pleased to learn that there is a free-trade farmer in the honourable member's constituency. If all his constituents are as intelligent as is Mr MCGregor, he represents a very intelligent electorate. I hope that, at the next election, he will find that the number of free-traders in his division is larger than was at the last election. Very little has 6 3 been said by the protectionists on behalf of the farmers. They do-not appear to care much about the farmers. Is it because the farmers have fewer votes to give than those connected with large manufacturing centres ? eviTheir efforts are making things easy for be the 500,000 manufacturing people round they about Melbourne. The honourable member Gippsland made a speech last night which ought to weigh with every protectionist. He is a protectionist whom everv one respects, and told the Committee tihar, when Minister of Trade and Customs, he thought that more protection should be given to the harvester-making industry, But, having gone very thoroughly into the matter, he found that, on the information placed before him, he would not be justiried in increasing the protection now enjoyed by the manufacturers. He discovered that the local manufacturing industry is standing on its feet. It has arrived at that position in which, theoretically, it is the object of protection to place industries; it is able to stand alone, without needing to be bolstered up.",38
245,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Wh v not sav nursed up?,39
246,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Eve n after industries are able to go alone, the protectionists are afiaid that they may fall and insist upon bolstering them up to keep them on their feet. The free-traders, on the other hand, say, Throw away the crutches. Let there be a fair field, and the local manufacturers will do well."" As I have shown, the manufacturers of harvesters could make a profit of the price of their machines were only £ 6 0 each - used",39
247,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is pure assumption, since the Tariff Commission was not - able to obtain from the manufacturers all the figures necessary to determine the cost of their machines.",39
248,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Every depart ment in a factory has to pay its way, just as every department in a soft-goods warehouse has to do so. The heads of the departments in these harvester factories have given evidence, upon which, in addition to the evidence tendered by the firms themselves, the Commissioners arrived at their conclusions.",39
249,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Commissioners say that the manufacturers would not supply the facts which they wanted.,39
250,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"They say that certain manufacturers would not produce their books to show the profits which they were making. Presumably those profits were so huge that the manufacturers are afraid that if they were known they could not obtain more protection. But the protectionists of Victoria vote foihigher duties, not because they are needed, but because that is the policy of the State, which the people drink in every morning, As the public here believe in protection, 'their representatives feel that they must give it to them, and therefore the country is poor compared with other countries where the people have more of the comforts and blessings of life, and are able to put by more for rainy davs. Of what use would it be for me to talk free-trade in the division of Moira ? But this is a national Parlia'ment, and, while the people of Victoria may ask for high duties, the farmers in other States do not believe in paving from 20 to 30 per cent, more for what they buy than is a fair price. The farmers in imconstituency think that they should not pay more than',£60 for harvesters, seeing that that price will give a good profit to the manufacturers. They do not like to be asked to pay ^ 8 1 when they know that a firm will sell three machines at £ 6 3 each. There are men in my constituency who could buy fiftv machines at a time.' The holdings in Victoria and South Australia are small compared with the immense areas I ! under cultivation in New South Wales. The honourable member for Moira last night referred to the time when that State could not produce sufficient grain for its own or more i l requirements, and seemed to spurn it for that reason; but I remember when Victoria to get its grain from South Australia. and when, even earlier, South Australia used to get its grain from Chili.",39
251,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,We have found out how foolish we were.,39
252,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It is better to get grain from Chili than to go without flour; and everything must have a begin ning. Every year the farmers of New South Wales are adding to their cultivation areas, and before long that State will be able to supply breadstuffs for the whole Commonwealth. It already supplies its own requirements, and has an export trade. The people of New South Wales did not go into wheat-growing formerly, because they could make more money in other ways.",39
253,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They could never make as much money per acre from wool as they have made from wheat.,39
254,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Perhaps not: but what they considered was their total income. In some parts of New South Wales there is now intense culture, and what were sheep-walks have been found to contain good agricultural land. In the earlv davs however, sheep-raising paid better than anv' thing else, and therefore the people in the country districts stuck to sheep. Now that they can make more monev by <*rowin <»rain e they are bringing larger"" area's under cultivation. They are carrying on operations on the same large scale as the farmers of California and Canada. There is no justification for prohibiting the importation of stripper-harvester's. It would be against the best interests not only of the consumers, but of the manufacturers themselves, to shut out the imported machines. Our object should be to obtain a perfect machine. The stripper-harvester in use today will not answer our purposes ten years heiice. Our producers have to compete in the markets of the world with the farmers of Canada and the United States, and unless we are able to give our settlers the most up-to-date appliances they will be placed at a great disadvantage. A duty of £ 1 6 would undoubtedly prevent the importation of stripper-harvesters from abroad, because it would not be possible to add the duty to the present price. The. machines are sold at as high a price as the farmers can afford to pav. and there is no likelihood of their submitting to an increase of rates. The manufacturers would, no doubt, obtain ^ 9 0 per machine as formerly if they could, but they know jhat the farmers would not stand such an imposition. The Government did not come into power as prohibitionists, and I do not think that they would be justified in imposing prohibitive duties.",39
255,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Coul d the honourable member sav what reduction was made in the cost of machines when the duty was reduced ?,40
256,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Busines s cannot be regulated in the way that the honourable member's question suggests. manufacturer will reduce his price for various reasons. He may want money to meet his obligations at the end ofi the quarter, and he may bring down the price of his wares in order to turn them into cash. Sometimes his banker orders him to sell off his stock in order that he mayobtainmoney with which to reduce his overdraft. All manufacturers have not large banking accounts or unlimited credit, and I know that many of them have a hard struggle to make ends meet. I think, however, that we shall do the best thing for the manufacturer as well as for the consumer by imposing only a fair duty. Mr MCKay sends his machines away to the Argentine. He states that if he did not get rid of his surplus in that way he would have to dismiss his men and shut down his works. He sells' his machines in the Argentine at a profit, but he would sell them all the same if he did not make any profit. It appears that, during the first seven months of this year, he has sold 'fifty more machines than during last year. It may be said that Mr MCKay dumps his machines into the Argentine in order to clear the market and make more money out of the local consumers. We must not take any notice of the bald assertion of the prices being brought down when duties are reduced. We are interfering too much with the manufacturers, and making things harder for the producers. We should not deprive ourselves of the opportunity to take advantage of the brains of American inventors and manufacturers. It would be against the interests of the farmers and of the whole community to do so. It must be remembered that South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales are now exporting grain to the old country, and that our producers must keep themselves abreast of the times in order to successfully compete in the world's markets. The idea of the local manufacturers, apparently, is that the high duty will prevent the importation of harvesters from abroad, and enable them to obtain a higher price for their machines. The honourable member for Moira told us that the farmer had no right to complain, because, among other things, he obtained his land on time payment. But I would point out that the farmer buys his land on credit, and pays interest upon the principal until he has completed the purchase. Therefore, it cannot be urged that he is placed in any position of special advantage in that reA gard. The honourable member pointed out also that the farmer had received the advantage of technical education provided by the State. What does that mean? If by means of technical education the farmer is shown how to grow ears of wheat containing 120 grains as against 60 grains formerly produced, he will be able to grow a larger quantity, and as a result prices will be brought down, and the general community will Be benefited. The farmer may iDe benefited by the increased output, but the consumer will also derive considerable advantage, and the little ones belonging to poor families in the old land will get more to eat.",40
257,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The landlords derive the advantage. The agricultural labourer in England is no better off today than he was fifty years ago.,40
258,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The whole community benefits. The land-owner is no doubt just as bad as the manufacturer. It must be understood, however, that he, as well as others, has to submit to competition. The honourable member for Moira also told us that railway freights in Victoria and New South Wales were reduced for the benefit of the farmer. They were reduced in order to encourage the farmer to put more land under cultivation and to provide more traffic and freight for railways. If I had my way, a great deal of the produce grown in the far distant parts of the country would be carried at a loss, in prder to encourage the settlers to bring larger areas under cultivation. If the reduced rates had the desired effect, the railways would be amply repaid by the greater volume of traffic that would be carried over the lines in the future. The railways of South Australia have been the best managed in the Commonwealth, because they have been worked on commercial lines. The railway authorities of South Australia have afforded every encouragement to the settlers in the back'blocks beyond Goyder's line of rainfall, where the crops no not produce more than three or four bushels per acre. Many farmers of South Australia have told me that at times they have been on the verge of starvation, and have not been' able to obtain sufficient food for their little ones. railways, however, which have been extended far into the interior, have rroved a great boon to them, and have lightened their burdens very considerably. Foi instance, there is the railway to Farina, extending hundreds of miles into the interior. If the Government were to charge the farmers beyond Goyder's line of rainfall the same rate that they charge the men who are settled within ten or twenty miles of Adelaide, they would drive them off the land. It is necessary to open up railways to develop the country. By so doing we secure a greater volume of trade. We obtain more breadstuffs, and we bestow more blessings upon the communitv as a whole. MT-. BATCHELOR - But wheat is not grown at Oodnadatta.",40
259,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am aware of that. Oodnadatta is in the centre of Australia-in the arid portion of the continent. I can recollect the time when the South Australian railway terminus was at Terowie, and when the railway system of that State was altered to the 3' ft. 6 in. gauge and extended to districts where the production of cereals was very much less per acre than it was in the more favoured spots. The South Australian Government has been constantly extending its railways beyond the area within which cereals are produced. Of course, I know that grain can be grown there successfully. One has only to read the articles which the honourable member for Echuca has contributed to the Argus newspaper to appreciate what the can be accomplished by means of the system of dry farming, which really resolves itself into the conservation of the natural moisture by earth mulching. I hold that something should be done for the producer. He does not get any consideration to which he is not entitled. Everything that he gets is passed on to the consumer, and competition regulates the prices.",41
260,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,There is no fund other than that which is contributed by the people.,41
261,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Exactly . The source of all wealth is the land. We can have no prosperity in the country if we injure the primary producers. Consequently I ask, "" Are we going to give the manufacturers all the benefits which accrue from improved methods of agriculture? Are we going to assist them to make profits amounting to ;£io,ooo, ^20,000 and even The ,£30,000 annually?"" It seems to me that the policy of the Government is to impose a prohibitive duty upon stripper-harvesters and other agricultural implements and machinery. That, I contend, is a most improper thing to do. Ministers have no mandate from the country to give effect to such a policy, and I hope that, when they appeal to the electors, they will receive a lesson which will prevent them from again bringing forward similar proposals.",41
262,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"WideBay^ [6.3] - The question under consideration has been presented to honourable members in many aspects. The last speaker has adopted a line of reasoning of his own, which I do not propose to follow, beyond saying-in regard to his statement concerning the benefits which have been derived in Great Britain by reason of the adoption of improved methods of agriculture-that , in my opinion, those benefits have not been reaped by the persons who ought to have enjoyed them. The employees have not benefited to the extent that they should have done. They have not received the remuneration which really belonged to them as the result of the improved methods of labour which"" have been applied to the cultivation of the soil. But we are now called upon to decide whether the duty upon stripper-harvesters shall be £ 1 0 or jQx6 per machine. In myopinion, the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Lang is an impracticable one. No doubt he has introduced it for the purpose of giving effect to his particular views; but I know of no means by which it would be possible to distribute the increased duty proposed in the way that he suggests. Honourable members of the Opposition have frequently pointed out the great advantages Which are enjoyed by the sugar growers of Queensland as the result of legislation enacted by this Parliament. The honourable member for New England has often complained of the payment of the bounty to the growers who produce sugar hi Australia exclusively by white labour. I wish to ask him whether he will adopt the same course in regard to stripper harvesters that has been adopted in the case of the sugar industry ? Personally I am prepared to extend to the manufacturers of stripper-harvesters even more generous treatment than has been meted out to the sugar-growers. I am quite willing, to support a proposal under which the Government will be enabled to levy an Excise upon these machines equal to half the amount of Customs duty, and I am further prepared to legislate in the direction of securing the return of the whole of that Excise duty to the employers who will conform to the awards of Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts. If in any State these institutions do not exist. I am quite willing that the Excise should be returned to the employers who comply with the awards of the Wages Boards or of the Arbitration Court in the adjoining State. But I would prevent any other employer from participating in the bounty. I put this suggestion before the Committee in the hope that I may educate certain honourable members who have been complaining of the sugar industry.",41
263,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am opposed t'o granting the manufacturers an increased duty for the purpose of levying an Excise.,42
264,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not object to the honourable member's view. But, assuming that the Committee agree to the increased duty proposed, what will he do? Some reference was made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to the effect that Federal Tariff has had upon the iron industry in Queensland. He quoted figures to show that there had been a decrease in the number of employees in that industry since the establishment of Federation. That decrease was inevitable. But it was not the result of the operation of the Federai Tariff. It was due to the competition of Victoria, and other States, whose industries were better established. I suppose that the honourable member would be surprised to learn that shipping companies carry machinery from Melbourne to the north of Queensland for less freight than is charged for carrying it from Maryborough to Townsville, which is only a fraction of the distance?",42
265,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Are there increased wharfage charges at either place?,42
266,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No . A perusal of the report of the Shipping Commission will disclose the reason for this state'of things. The shipping combination can practically wipe out a small port. It can prescribe conditions regarding rebates which effectually prevent manufacturers from sending machinery by any boats other than its own. Upon every consignment of cargo carried by the combine a secret rebate of io per cent, is granted. Thus, if a manufacturer traded with a small schooner, he would by that innocent act sacrifice the whole of the rebate that would otherwise accrue to him. These cojnditioins have militated against the expansion of the iron industry in Queensland more than has the Tariff. I do not say that the Tariff which Parliament passed extended sufficiently high duties to the iron .industry. In my opinion, those duties should have been much higher. Personally, I am of opinion that the iron industry should be nationalized. Another factor which has materially affected foundries in Queensland is that about the time of the establishment of the Federation, the Government railway workshops were established at Ipswich. This naturally deprived the foundry there of a large amount of work. Queensland's loan policy came to an end. and that end brought many changes.  State free-trade was established.",42
267,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Quite so; I shall refer presently to that point. With the cessation of its loan policy, Queensland had less money available than it had before for the - construction of railways, bridges, and other the public works, including sugar mills. T may say, in passing, that the people of that State, through the Government, have loaned over £500,000 to the sugar growers to provide the machinery necessary to enable them to get their produce to market. The point is often overlooked that a mill costing something like £50,000 is necessary to the successful production of sugar, and that whe.e the area under sugar cane is not sufficient to justify the erection of a mill of that capacity, a crop is practically worthless. The cessation of the State borrowing policy, interfered with the erection of large mills and the carrying out of many public works, whilst the establishment of Inter-State free-trade enabled the ironfounders of other States, and mora particularly of Victoria, to enter into serious competition with the local manufacturers. Although I have not the figures at hand, I am clearly of opinion that the number of hands employed in the iron industry has not increased in proportionto the increase in the output. The capacity of a worker is increased from time to time by the .introduction of improved machinery, so that, whilst the output of an industry may increase, the number of hands engaged in it may concurrently be reduced. That is a well known feature of industrial life  riveting machine, for instance, has duced the field of employment in the iron trade.",42
268,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is so. By means of a small hydraulic machine, two men things. are now able to do what was previously the work of ten. I presume that honorwho able members do not regret the introduction of labour-saving appliances. It is said that improvements in machinery lessen the field of employment, but I that that contention is altogether correct. It should not be the ambition of an intelliamendment gent democratic Parliament simply to make ber for Lang? work for the people. It should rather be our desire to see that every person who willing to engage in useful labour shall ceive a wage sufficient to enable him to into operation. live in comfort and to enjoy a few of the luxuries of life. If that, we ought to make room for others who nave some tangible and learned practicable ideas on the subject. Unize fortunately, however, the Commonwealth Parliament has not the power to inforce wages conditions. Although, as the Prime Minister has said, the framers of the stitution "" builded better than they knew,"" I think, in this respect, the instrument is defective.^ The Parliament which has the power to impose Customs and Excise duties is the only effective body to determine what shall be the wage conditions in the industries to which those duties apply.",43
269,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,An amendment of the Constitution would soon remedy the trouble.,43
270,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am glad that the Opposition are not entirely opposed to such a proposition.,43
271,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Hear , hear.",43
272,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"To use a well-known Australian term,, the Parliament, when imposing duties, is "" hobbled"" by the fact that it is not free to enact that those employed in the industries to which they relate shall not be in a worse position than they were before. Whilst some of the States Parliaments have devised various means to insure the payment of fair wages and the observance of reasonable conditions of labour, others, unfortunately, have made no such provision for the protection of the workers. In some cases high duties have had a mischievous effect.",43
273,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The v have not helped the wage earners.,43
274,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Whils t high duties have the been imposed the wage earners have been reneglected. But of recent vears a new principle, that of ""the new'protection."" has come into plav.",43
275,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is the oldest of old,43

277,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is the effect of the moved by the honoiable mem,43
278,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,If such an amendment is were passed it would be futile. The Comremonwealth has no machinery to bring it,43
279,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Then the duties would not we cannot do come into operation.,43
280,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable and member would be the last to penala good man. I would remind him that, although the great bulk of those engaged in thrt industry were readv and willing to pay fair wages, and to have regard to reasonConable conditions of labour, these duties under the amendment would not come into operation if one manufacturer refused to do so.",43
281,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The amendment is absurd. It would not touch the question.,44
282,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I think it would be futile.,44
283,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the honourable member agree with the statement of the Minister of Trade and Customs that the members of the Commission were grossly unfair to witnesses?,44
284,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not, and I regretted to hear the Minister make it . I am sure that if the honourable gentleman had given the matter a moment's consideration, he would not have made such a seriou« statement.",44
285,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I have the newswould paper containing a full statement of whole matter.,44
286,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I know that the able gentleman, whose goodness of heart one will deny, speaks at times rather bluntly, and I think that, in this instance, he expressed himself rather roughly.",44
287,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I did not reflect the slightest degree upon the Chairman the Commission.,44
288,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I cannot endorse that statement.,44

294,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I should not find fault with a Government which refused to notice of such recommendations. mission appointed by the Crown has none of the responsibilities of the Executive. might bring down, proposals for the imposiI tion of certain duties which, if adopted, would deprive the Executive of the revenue necessary to carry on the administration the country.",44
295,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Commission has merely made recommendations to the Parliament.,44
296,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The terms of their appointment are very limited. The Commission was appointed to inquire into the effects of the Tariff, and its business was to report in general terms upon the result of their investigation.",44
297,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,To diagnose the disease and not to suggest the remedy?,44
298,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is for this Parliament to prescribe the remedy. Silting suspended from 6.30 to 7.30 p.m.,44
299,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member for Corinella has asked, in effect, what be the use of the investigations of the the Commission if it did not make definite and distinct recommendations. I am honorsurprised at such a question from so no acute a mind. The Commissioners were appointed to inquire into the effects, good, bad, or indifferent, c f the present Tariff. It would have been sufficient for in them to report that certain industries were of becoming lean and attenuated and others too f at and prosperous. While they might have indicated the remedy for both diseases-becaus e it is as bad for the body politic that industries should be too lean as it is that they should be too fat-it would for Parliament to prescribe the remedy said to be applied. I have Dointed out that a might be deprived of revenue They have as the effect of a report of a Commission. That of course is a side issue; but, undoubtedly, the action of a Commission in I making definite proposals may be a source but I of embarrassment to a Government. The to power to increase Customs valuations is in the Minister of Customs; but it be imshould be most sparingly exercised, and when exercised, opportunity should be given to those aggrieved to test the matter a Court of law without being met In my opinion, there is nothing more dangerous than to allow the Executive to increase duties at take will. This should be done only by the A Comdirect vote of Parliament. While I do not impugn the motives of the Minister of It Trade and Customs or of the Government, say that a democratic Parliament should guard with the greatest jealousy its right to impose taxation. I shall support the of recommendation of the Tariff Commission, not because it is their recommendation, but because, - in my opinion, the evidence permits of no other course being taken. No information has been laid before ""us indicating that a fixed duty higher than £ 1 0 a machine is necessary. But as this Parliament desires to benefit the workmen as well as the manufacturers, and as it cannot appoint Wages Boards to determine questions of remuneration and conditions of employment, I think that the imposition of an Excise duty amounting to half of the import duty ..should be agreed to, giving a bounty of the same amount in every case where a manufacturer conforms with the conditions prescribed by a Wages Board or an Arbitration Court, or, where there is no such authority, pays the rate of wages which is the mean between the rates so prescribed. If this is done, our legislation will benefit the workers as well as the manufacturers.",44
300,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Boothby) [7.36]I am very glad that the honourable member for Wide Bay has brought the discussion back to the amendment, to which I propose to confine my remarks. The general debate has been useful, but it will be wise for us now to focus our attention on the point raised by the amendment of the honourable member for Lang.",45
301,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That amendment is farcical.,45
302,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I admit that the honourable member's proposal is impracticable, and cannot be seriously considered; but I assume that his object is that the workmen in protected industries shall share with the employers the benefits obtained from duties, an object with which - all honourable members must be in sympathy. I ask the Committee to try to devise some scheme which will achieve that object. Notwithstanding the platform utterances of some honourable members, who suggest that the protectionists seek merely to fatten a few manufacturers, we know they credit us with the belief that good wages, short hours, and healthy conditions are more likely to be obtained for workmen under protection than under free-trade. Unfortunately, however, the workmen have not always participated in the benefits which have accrued, by reason of the imposition of the duties, to the industries with which they have been connected. I question very much whether the benefits given to the stripper-harvester industry by protection have been' fairly shared by the men engaged in' it. The fact that the largest manufacturer of stripper-harvesters in Australia moved his works to Bray brook in order to esca.ce having to comply with the conditions laid down by a Victorian Wages Board shows that manufacturers are not always ready to fall in with the desire of a majority of the people that the workmen shall share fairly in the benefits of protection.",45
303,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Mr MCKay has denied that he moved to Braybrook to evade having to comply with the conditions of a Wages Board.,45
304,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If he wished to be brought under a Wages Board, he could easily agitate for that to be done, and, no doubt, would be successful. I have been termed a weak-kneed protectionist; but I shall be still more weak-kneed unless I receive an assurance that what obtained immediately after the passing of the last Tariff will not be allowed to continue. I was prepared to impose pretty high duties on many articles, but became weak-kneed in regard to protection when I saw how some manufacturers, and some of those who were very prominent in advocating the new protectionist doctrines, neglected to fulfil their obligations directly they received, or were certain of receiving, the benefits of protection. I happened to be the chairman of the inaugural meeting held at the Town Hall, Adelaide, at which the Protectionist Association of South Australia was formed, about a year prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth. At that meeting the new protectionist programme was adopted as the policy of the party in South Australia. That programme included the passing of a Factories and Shops Act, containing provisions relating to Wages Boards and arbitration, and so on. The principle underlying the policy was that the workmen, as well as the manufacturers, should share in the advantages of any protection that might be granted.",45
305,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Where does the consumer come in ?,45
306,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am now dealing with the question from the point of view of the producers-the manufacturers and their workmen. The question of where the consumer comes in is another matter, which I do not wish to consider just now. M*r. MCWILLIAMS - It is a very important question.",45
307,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I admit that. It must be acknowledged that the prices of many articles- I do not say all-upo n which duties have been imposed, have not been increased as the result of the protection accorded to the local manufacturer. Where there is strong local competition and a sufficiently large output, the tendency is to reduce prices, and to thus confer benefit upon the consumers. The manufacturers and workmen, of which the Protectionist Association was composed, worked together loyally until the Federal elections were held. Just prior to that time the Holder Administration succeeded in passing through both Houses a Bill upon the lines of the Victorian Factories and Shops Act, providing for the establishment of Wages Boards in connection with certain trades. Legislative Council inserted a provision that the regulations made under the Act should be laid upon the table of both Houses, and that if disallowed by either House, should not become operative. The Federal elections were held, and the majority of the candidates elected were protectionists. Towards the close of the Tariff debate in this Parliament, the regulations under the South Australian Factories Act were disallowed by the Legislative Council. No particular reason was advanced, but it appeared that some manufacturers, having attained one of the objects for which the Protectionist Association was formed, desired to prevent the introduction of the Wages Board system. I do not accuse the manufacturers of having directly caused the disallowance of the regulations, but the Chamber of Manufactures did its best to prevent the passing of the regulations, and further, when somewhat later a Commission was appointed to take evidence in Victoria as to the working of the Wages Board system, it requested the affiliated body in Melbourne to bring forward the strongest evidence possible against ""the Wages Board system. If the manufacturers had desired to carry out their share of the compact, as members of the Protectionist Association, they might have petitioned the Legislative Council to allow the Wages Board regulations to pass, and thus bring the conditions in the State into line with those obtaining in Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia. From that day to this there have been no Wages Boards in South Australia, and whatever advantage has accrued from the protection given by the Tariff has been derived by the manufacturers alone. Although I believe in protection, I do not propose to give one fractional part of a percentage of additional protection to any industry until I can feel assured that the workman will receive a fair share of the advantage conferred.",46
308,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the honourable member think that sufficient provision is made under the Government's proposal ?,46
309,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No ; I propose to ask the Committee to adopt conditions similar to those which have already been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Wide Bay-condition s which seem to be fair and workable. I do not agree with the proposal that any manufacturer who The fails to pay his workmen a fair and reasonable rate of wages shall pay Excise equal to the Customs duty levied on the imported article. Under that arrangement, the Minister of Trade and Customs would be called upon to decide what is a fair and reasonable rate of wages, and I do not think we should leave a question of that kind to the decision of any Minister. The question as to what is a fair and reasonable rate of wages must, of course, always be a matter of opinion. I much prefer the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay that an Excise duty shall be imposed, and that the full amount of the Excise shall be returned to the manufacturer in all cases in which the manufacturers are complying with the conditions imposed by a Wages Board or by an award of an Arbitration Court. "" Fair and reasonable wages"" might mean anything, but the award of a Court or the determination of a Wages Board would be definite in character, and could easily be enforced. Where no Wages Board existed the best plan would be to require that wages shall be paid according to the highest rates provided for in anv Wages Board determination or Arbitration Court award. The honourable member for Wide Bay suggests that the wages should be paid upon the basis of the average of the rates ruling elsewhere under the Wages Board or Arbitration Court decisions. But if we required that the highest rate should be paid, the manufacturers would probably agitate for the"" extension of the Wages Board system, and I think that would be a good thing. The Wages Board system is based upon co-operation, and is to be preferred to that under which an Arbitration Court is called upon to make awards.",46
310,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is. providing that the workmen are not dismissed for sticking up for high wages.,47
311,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Of course, sometimes the object sought to be attained by those who favour industrial tribunals for the settlement of trade disputes are defeated by employers who take a mean advantage.",47
312,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"What is the advantage of having Wages Boards, instead of an Arbitration Court?",47
313,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"In the case of Wages Boards, all the arbitrators are familiar with the actual conditions existing in the trade which is the subject of inquiry. Each Board consists of three representatives of the employees and three employers, presided over by a Chairman chosen by the parties, or appointed by the Government. Most matters in dispute are settled between the representatives of the respective parties, and others in regard to which no mutual agreement can be arrived at are speedilydealt with by the Chairman. I would ask the Committee to devote their special attention to the question of devising some scheme which will insure that the workmen shall obtain a fair share of the advantage derived from the protection granted to the industrvimmediately under discussion. Personally I strongly favour the scheme 'which has been outlined by the honourable member for Wide Bay, and I hope that it will be adopted. I believe that he has hit upon a plan which is practicable, and which will achieve the end that we have in view. I feel confident that the adoption of such a proposal would insure better conditions to the workers in these industries, and would prevent the possibility of the manufacturers reaping the whole of the advantage conferred by any duties that we might impose primarily for the purpose of benefiting the whole industry.",47
314,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Corinella) f8.2l - I think that this debate has shown that it would be as easv to sink a cork as to sink the fiscal issue before it has been settled in some form or other. The strength of the feelings which still continue to be displayed by honourable members upon either side of the Chamber shows that there has been no surrender of principle so far as their fiscal views are concerned. I have listened attentively to the remarks of the honourable member for Boothby concerning the necessity for insuring that the employees, as well as the manufacturers, shall share in any benefits that may be conferred by any protective duties that we may impose. I do not commit myself to saying that the suggestion of the honourable member for Wide Bay is practicable or-if it is-that it is the most practicable way of achieving our object. But I do say, without any hesitation, that unless the protective system can be so developed as to insure to the workman his proper share of the benefits of Customs duties, I would cease to have any violent enthusiasm for those duties. It is a common charge against protectionists that they are in some mysterious way animated by a desire to fill the pockets of a few manufacturers at the expense of the community.",47
315,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,There is a big difference of opinion upon the other side of the Chamber upon that question.,47
316,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member who has interjected ought to know that the gangway here is quite as significant as is that in the centre of the Chamber-mor e so, in fact, because he himself sits cheekby-jowl with some of the most violent free traders in Federal politics. s",47
317,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They are not nearly so violent as are some free-traders who sit in the corner occupied by the honourable and learned gentleman.,47
318,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"At the present moment the only violent free-traders in my corner are members of the party which the honourable member himself leads. In connection with the necessity for insuring to the workman his share of the advantages of the protection which we extend to manufacturers, we must remember that we have to begin with Customs duties, and I have never regarded those duties as anything but a beginning. In imposing Customs duties, it seems to me that it is necessary to impose duties which will give to the local manufacturer an advantage equal to the inevitable disadvantage from which he suffers in competition with his foreign rival. For instance, there are differences in the rates of wages which he pays, in the hours worked by his employees, in the rates of interest which he has to pay, and in the wideness of his market-difference s which he cannot overcome by his own efforts. He can overcome differences in methods or defects in machinery, and. therefore, he is entitled to no protection so far as they are concerned. He is, however, entitled to protection in respect of the differences which he cannot overcome. But in extending that protection to him we are bound to see that these differences are real. In other words, when we are extending protection to the manufacturer because he has to pay higher W'ages, and to concede better conditions to his workmen, it is our duty to see that he does pay those wages and grant those conditions. It is because I believe that the unrestricted competition of foreign countries with Australia would mean either the stoppage of the development of our manufacturing industries or the decline of wages to a lower level than we conceive to be right, that I am a protectionist. To use the words of the leader of the Opposition - word s which have been very freely criticised- "" we cannot compete with the cheap labour of over-crowded countries."" I do not think that we can, so long as we desire to maintain the rates of wages and the standard of comfort which obtain in Australia. Consequently if we desire to develop our manufacturing industries we must recognise the fact that the foreign competitor can beat the local manufacturer unless we extend to him some advantages to enable him to start on equal terms with his competitor abroad.",47
319,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Our farmers have to compete in the world's markets.,48
320,Mr FOWLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What are the cheap labour countries to which the honourable and learned member refers? Do they include Canada and America ?,48
321,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I refuse to listen to the siren voice of free-trade upon my left rear. When we are placing the local manufacturer upon equal terms with his foreign competitor there is no necessity to levy a higher duty than will achieve the results I have indicated. That would only be an encouragement to charge unnecessarily high . prices. Mr HUM E COOK - The proposal of the Commission is that the prices shall come down.,48
322,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am discussing the general question at the present moment. The proposals before the Committee are to increase the duty upon stripper-harvestersto double it. The Government proposal, and the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, alike claim to constitute a doubling of the present duty. In other words, they claim to be equal to an ad valorem duty of 25 per cent. The Minister of Trade and Customs has declared that a duty of £ 1 6 upon harvesters is valent to an ad valorem duty of 25 per cent, upon £ 6 5 , which is his valuation of these machines for Customs purposes. On the other hand, the honourable and learned member for Bendigo and others contend that their true valuation is £ 4 0 , and that a fixed duty of jQio per machine would be equivalent to an ad valorem duty of 25 per cent. I have read with a good deal of care the report of the Tariff Commission on this matter, and a portion of the evidence which was given concerning it. I do not pretend to have read all the evidence. If any honourable member has done so, I can only regard with humble respect the height to which he has attained. From what I have read, it is perfectly clear to me that there is a difference of opinion as to what is the proper dutiable value of the stripper-harvester. I frankly confess that, although I have an opinion as to which case is the better one, I do not pretend that a conclusive case has been made out by the evidence which is now before the Committee. We know that at the present time it is proposed to grant a commission to take evidence in Canada upon this very question.",48
323,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Whic h the Government are opposing.,48
324,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I assume that the Government will not now oppose the issue of that commission any further. If they do they will be acting in contravention of the spirit of the Minister's promise.,48
325,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,There was a reason given for their opposition.,48
326,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But no reasonwould justify the Government in opposing the ascertainment of the true facts of a matter which is so vital. The evidence in support of the contention that £ 6 5 is the proper valuation of these machines for Customs purposes is by no means conclusive, neither is the evidence in support of the statement that £ 3 8 represents their proper value. Each piece of evidence is open to the objection that it comes from an interested quarter, and that there has been no opportunity of thoroughly testing its accuracy. Although the Tariff Commission came to. a clear decision-as it was. justified in doing-upo n the weight of evidence presented to it, I hold that when we can obtain fuller evidence upon the point we ought to get it. All parties are agreed that a fixed duty, which would be equivalent to an ad valorem impost of 25 equiper cent., should be levied upon these machines. The real difference of opinion is as to what specific duty would represent an ad valorem rate of 2 s per cent. The evidence upon that point is conflicting, and therefore we should not determine it until fuller infonmation is forthcoming. Consequently, it is the duty of the Committee to revert to the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, and to levy a duty of 25 per cent, until the real dutiable value of the machines has been ascertained, when a specific duty can be imposed. I am not in a position to form a final opinion as to what the real dutiable value is; but I agree with the Government that a duty of 25 per cent, will afford sufficient protection to the manufacturers of stripper haivesters. It will fully cover the disadvantages under ordinary trade conditions to which they are subjected. It will cover whatever difference in wages may exist.",48
327,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I must admit that the honourable and learned member has advanced a very strong argument in favour of an ad valorem duty for the time being.,49
328,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I yet hope to see the Government recognise that we are not at present in a position to finally decide what is the true dutiable value of these machines, and that we should really prejudge the case by imposing a duty of £ 1 6 or £ 1 0 .",49
329,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Minister is preparing to climb down.,49
330,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member speaks as a free-trader, whilst I speak as a protectionist desiring to see a proper decision arrived at. I am satisfied to accept the ad valorem rate proposed by the Tariff Commission - It seems to me that, notwithstanding, the objections that there are to the rate, there is no way out of the difficulty except to revert to the proposal of the Commission that an ad valorem duty of 25 per cent, be imposed. I am sure that if the investigation now proceeding showed that the Minister's estimate of £ 6 5 was too high a valuation, he would not desire a duty of £ 1 6 per machine. If the vestigation showed that the real dutiable value was £ 5 0 , I am sure that he would be satisfied with a duty of £ 1 2 10s.",49
331,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Certainly .,49
332,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If the investigation showed that £ 4 0 was the correct value, I feel confident that the honourable gentleman would be satisfied with a duty of £ 1 0 .",49
333,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Yes; but I am quite satisfied that such a valuation would be wrong.,49
334,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am aware that the honourable gentleman holds decided opinions in regard to this question. I doubt whether £ 3 8 is the full dutiable value of these machines. I think that there yet remain to be taken into consideration items which will increase that valuation by some amount large or small; but in any event we wish to know what the real value is. If we had before us the result of the law suit now in progress, we could impose a fixed duty; as we have not, I think that, in fairness to all concerned, we are forced to revert to the proposal of the Tariff Commission that an ad valorem duty of 25 per cent, be imposed. I , for one, am ready to support the imposition of such a duty. I am not readv to support a duty of £ 1 6 , because I am not satisfied that £ 6 5 is the true valuation, nor ami I ready to support a duty of £10, since I am not satisfied that £ 4 0 is the true valuation to place on these machines.",49
335,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The existing duty is £ 8 per machine, and if, notwithstanding that duty, the local industry is endangered, surely the duty should be more than £ 1 0 .",49
336,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The duty of £& has been in operation for only a month or two.,49
337,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Since October of last year.,49
338,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"In estimating what duty should be imposed, we have always ""to consider what are the disadvantages to which the local manufacturer is subjected as compared with his foreign) competitor. I have not heard any one suggest that 25 per cent, will not compensate the local manufacturer for the disadvantages under which he labours. That being so, I am not prepared to agree to a fixed duty which would amount to more than 25 per cent. On the other hand, I am prepared to agree to an ad valorem rate of 25 per cent., in view of two proposals before the Committee; the first being that the interests of the artisans shall be looked after in the most direct in- and effective way, and the second that the interests of the consumer shall be considered. I am not sufficiently expert in these matters to determine what should be the exact reductions in price insisted upon); but I do say that the evidence before the Tariff Commission-and the report of the Commission-lead s one to the conclusion, from which it is hard to escape, that vendors of stripper-harvesters have been securing more than a fair profit. I care not how honourable members view the figuies, the only reasonable inference to be drawn from them is that more than a fair profit is derived when these machines axe sold at £ 8 1 , and that, with one or two exceptions, was the combination price. Consequently it is our bounden duty to see that, whilst we are trying to benefit others, the consumers do not suffer by being compelled to pay a price that is obviously greater than that which returns a fair profit. That, indeed, is the sole object of one part of the Bill for the Preservation of Australian Industries. On the facts before us wo are more than justified in declaring that the price of these machines must be reduced. We have been told that we do not know what is the cost of producing the Australian stripper-harvester, although there are indications that it is something like £,37 o r £ 3 8 - When those indications were brought under the notice of those concerned, they refused to give any information on the subject, and it is fair to assume that there could have been only two reasons for that refusal. In the first place, they feared, perhaps, that by giving the information required they would disclose to their competitors a trade secret the publication of which would injure them. think that in this case any such injury could result from the disclosure of the cost of production. The only alternative reason is that the Australian makers considered that if they disclosed the cost of production they would lay bare the fact that they were making an excessive profit. to me, therefore-and if I am wrong I may easily be put right-that all the indications point to the conclusion that the price has been too high, and that the Government proposal to insist on a reduction in return for an increase of duty wihich will give to the local manufacturer a larger command - and I am inclined to think almost complete command-of the local market, is not only justifiable, but necessary. Lastlv, I wish to refer briefly to the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay, that an Excise duty should be imposed. My view of an employer of labour in Australia is that he is very much like an employer of labour anywhere else, and that he is very much like an employee. There is a great deal of human nature in a man, whatever his position in life may be, and he is liable to view many matters through spectacles which are coloured to a greater or less extent by considerations of self-interest. In these circumstances, we must do our best to see that a duty passed with the intent to assist the employer and employee alike, and controlled with the intent that the consumer shall not be injured, shall be so regulated as to control the industrial conditions largely on account of which it is imposed. It is comparatively easy to fix the rate of duty, and comparatively easy to control the selling price; but, in the absence of direct legislation, it is far more difficult to control the relations between employer and employed It seems to me that the main object of protection is, not to insure the aggregation of fortunes, but to insure the development of employment. That being so, any practical proposaland I do not know that the honourable member for Wide Bay is wedded to that which he has put forward-whic h will insure that result deserves consideration. I should not say "" I will not agree to the'imposition of a duty unless we can devise a satisfactory scheme to regulate the relations between employer and employee,"" because I believe that, with a duty, we should be more likelv. by means of State legislation or otherwise, to arrive at a satisfactory I do not position in this regard than we should be without it . We have not performed our duty as regards Customs .and industrial matters until we have insured the passing on to the employee of his share of the advantages to be derived from protective duties. That has always been my opinion. It seems The other day I looked up the first speech I made on protection, and may say that I then founded my advocacy of the principle . on exactly the same grounds that I have put forward this evening. I am very glad indeed that the splendid meeting which the Minister is said to have had at Albury last night has had such an excellent effect upon him that he is prepared to consider favourably views that are put forward even from this Cave of Adullam.",49
339,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I said that I was prepared to consider them.,50
340,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I know that the Minister is very careful to leave a loop-hole by which he may escape. One can never build round him a wall so solid that he is unable to find in it an opening big enough to allow him to escape, if he desires to do so. But he said that I had made out a very strong case in favour of reverting to an ad valorem duty.",50
341,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I said that the honourable and learned member had made out a good case for reverting to an ad valorem duty whilst the matter was in doubt.,50
342,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable gentleman may have had such a proviso in his mind, but did not give utterance to it. If sucli a condition is to be imposed, all that the Committee can do at present is to revert to the ad valorem duty. We cannot say that the duty shall be "" jQ- per stripperharvester on the value being determined by the Courts."" When the lawsuit has been determined, the Minister may bring down a proposal for a fixed duty in lieu of an ad valorem one; but I am dealing with the requirements of the present moment. A strong case has been made out for reverting to the ad valorem duty, and the Minister must refute it, if he is to adhere to his present proposal. The amendment which has been moved will achieve no result except that it will afford grounds for the ployment of lawyers to interpret its meaning; but the lawyers' industry is one which seems to be able to thrive without assistance from the Customs. I am glald that the Minister is considering this proposal. These who advocate an ad valorem rate are as true protectionists as is the Minister, who has proposed a fixed rate of jQi6 per machine.",51
343,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I much prefer a fixed to an ad valorem rate.,51
344,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I see many reasons for adopting a fixed rate, and, if we knew the actual dutiable value of these machines, should be prepared fo agree to a fixed rate equivalent to 25 per cent, ad valorem: but, as we cannot get that knowledge in this liament, we must, in fairness to all concerned, adopt an ad valorem rate. I hope that the honourable member for Bendigo will carry out his intention of proposing such a rate in default of action by the Minister carrying out his suggestion. hope, too, that the Minister will recognise what a strong case has been made out for this suggestion, and that we are on the horns of a dilemma from which there is no escape. If the suggestion is accepted, the question at issue can be quickly settled. The industry will then be given the opportunities which protectionists think that it requires, and time will be afforded for the discussion of proposals for assisting other industries requiring relief.  confident that the honourable member for Lang is not serious in regard to his amendment.",51
345,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"He hoped to carry it, but it was a vain hope.  he builds his hopes on such proposals it is not strange that he comes to the ground. The members of the party to which I belong, whether free-traders or protectionists, will not give high protection to the harvester industry unless the workers employed in it are benefited. That is a plain and unvarnished statement of our position.",51

Both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade and Customs have told us that the workerswill be protected, but, with all due respect to them, I wish to see some Partangible proposal put forward. This is what MT. MCKay, according to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, told his workmen on one occasionBe careful of what you do, men. If youvote for factory legislation many of you will be put I out, because I shall introduce labour-saving machinery. No labourite and no trade unionist objects to labour-saving machinery, because history shows that in the long run it means increased employment. Therefore, that threat will not scare the workers.

The firm of John Buncle and Son said, in its replyWe are very desirous that a Wages Board should be in operation for the agricultural implement trade, as, in our opinion, it would be better for all parties concerned, and also bring the standard of wages higher than what they appeaj to be in some shops.",52

The maximum wage provided for moulders is 60s. per week, and the lowest 40s., whilst moulders' labourers receive the extravagant wage of 38s. a week. It is further providedOne improver to every two journeymen or thereof employed in the process, trade, or business of an ironmoulder, receiving not less 8s. per day, employed on work other than pipe moulding, or on work incidental thereto. Where pipe moulding is carried on either alone in conjunction with other work, one improver, or one additional improver, as the case may be, to every twelve journeymen or fraction thereof, exclusively employed on pipe moulding work, receiving not less than 8s. per day. On the 13th October, 1904, Mr MCKay addressed the following letter to the Chief Secretary of Victoria: With reference to the application of the Board conditions to the iron moulding, steel moulding, and malleable iron departments of the Sunshine Harvester Works, I would respectfully point out that in consequence of the Act I am prevented from making any use of this costly part of my Ballarat factory. At considerable expense I have arranged for a temporary supply of castings from my factory in Braybrook. I would respectfully request that something promptly done to remove the embargo of Wages Board conditions from the implement and harvester business. This is a man who wants more protection. I tell the Committee plainly that no member of the Labour Party,'whether he be a protectionist or a free-trader, will give any further protection to this industry unless we are assured that the workers will be benefited to the same extent as are the manufacturers. I ' believe that the conditions proposed by the honourable member for Wide Bay will bring about that result, and I am satisfied that the Minister will carry out his promise in that regard. Mr MCKay continues1 further request that if this cannot at once you will give me an assurance that the Wages Board conditions will not come into operation at the factory in Braybrook. If you will do that I am prepared to considerably extend the factory, and will instal some more costly machinery, while if there is any chance of the Wages Board conditions being applied there I do not feel justified in spending the money. As this whole matter involves a most serious question, X would respectfully urge that it receive your early and earnest consideration. Why did Mr MCKay remove his works to Braybrook, if not with a view of placing himself beyond the jurisdiction of the Wages Board and of obtaining cheap labour ? He stated in his sworn evidence before the Tariff Commission that he wanted four improvers to one journeyman, and as many apprentices as he liked. I do not th'ink that it is desirable to grant high protection to an industry in which any such conditions exist, and I shall certainly vote against the proposed duty unless the interests of the wage-earners are fully safeguarded.",52
362,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"New England) [8.50]. - It is well known that I am opposed to the present proposal, and that I am not willing to give to manufacturers increased facilities to obtain higher prices for their machines. I certainly object to giving them any increased advantage by way of duty unless they share it with their workmen. Whilst workmen cannot be protected to any extent by law, I think that we should do what we can to insure that Wages in this case, at any rate, there shall be some truth in the constantly reiterated statement that higher duties will confer benefit upon the workmen. Neither of the amendments proposed would, in my opinion, bring about the desired result, but 1 would support the honourable member for Wide Bay if he altered his proposed amendbe ment to provide that Excise duty corresponding with the import duty levied upon the machines shall be charged, and that it shall be returned to the manufacturer upon his producing satisfactory evidence that he has increased the wages of his workmen to the full extent of the duty.",53
363,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member is whistling for wind now.,53
364,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If increased protection is to be given, we should take care that the workmen derive the advantage of it. Do not let us play any games. I am altogether opposed to the duty; but if the majority are determined that it shall be levied, let its imposition be subject to some condition such as I have suggested. The be done Wages Boards do not increase the pay of the workers to any great extent. For the most part, they content themselves with adopting a minimum wage. If the Labour Party are honest in their endeavours to benefit the workman, they will insure that any advantage derived from protective duties shall pass direct into his pocket, instead df into those of the manufacturer. I have read the reports of the Commission.",53
365,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Did the honourable member read the evidence ?,53
366,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No . Life is too short for that. I am bound to say that the summary of the evidence contained in the report of the four protectionist members of the Commission proves that there is no need for an increase of duty, and I cannot understand how the Commissioners could come to any other conclusion. The evidence shows that the industry is not languishing in Victoria. The manufacturers admit that neither their profits nor their trade has decreased, and yet the Commissioners recommend that an industry which is not languishing, but which, on the other hand, is highly prosperous, shall have conferred upon it the advantage of a higher protective duty. Where is the intelligence of the Commissioners? They point out that the duty on harvesters in Victoria was reduced from 15 to 12J' per cent., and that the duty upon machinery n.e.i. was reduced from 25 to i 2 per cent. I do not understand why they should have taken the trouble to drag in '''machinery n.e.i.,"" because that item did not include agricultural implements. They apparently desired to show that the duties had been reduced to an excessive degree. We are told that the imports of agricultural implements have increased. The returns from 1899 to 1903 no doubt show a large increase, but if die imports for 1899 and 1905 are compared it will be seen that there has been a considerable decrease. Why do the members of the Commission say that there has l>een an increase of imports? Apparently, to enabie them to justify their recommendation. In 1899 the imports of agricultural implements were valued at -^280,195, and in 1905 at £329,634. In the former year no stripper-harvesters were imported, whereas in 1905 machines of that character to the value of £85,000 were imported. If this amount be deducted from the £329,634, it will be seen at once that the importations of other agricultural implements in that year were valued at only £240,000, or £40,000 less than the value of the imports in 1899. During the first six months of 1906 the imports of agricultural implements were valued at only £103,000, so that there has been a further considerable falling-off as compared with last year. There has not been any decrease of duty; but, on the other hand, taking the Commonwealth as a whole, there has been an increase. If the protectionists like, they can urge that, because of the increased duty, production within the Commonwealth has been stimulated. present them with that argument. duty upon the imports in 1899 averaged 6 per cent, whereas the duty paid upon the imports in 1905 averaged 9 per cent. It is shown most conclusively by the manufacturers themselves that the industry is not languishing. This evening we have heard some special pleading on behalf of the local manufacturers. Certain statements have been made regarding the cost of producing these machines. In this connection, I would point out that Mr Moore, in replv to a question which was put to him, stated that the machine of the International Harvester Company could not be invoiced at £ 2 6 , because that amount represented, approximately, the cost of the material employed in its manufacture. Mr MCKay swore that the labour involved in the production of his machine represented about one-half L of its cost. In other words, the total cost of these machines is about £39 Mr. MCKay further stated that they ought to be invoiced at £ 6 0 , but he declined to give any reason in support of his statement. ""Under these circiimstances, Parliament should say to the local manufacturers, "" Unless you can show that your industry is being ruined, we decline to grant you any assistance.."" The Chairman bf the Tariff Commission has sfated that he and the other protectionist members of that body have arranged with these manufacturers that they shall reduce the price of their machines within two years from the granting of the increased measure of protection which they recommend. What right have we to enter into arrangements of that character ?",53
367,Mr FOWLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Tariff Commission has entered into no such arrangement.,54
368,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am speaking of the protectionist members of that body. I am aware that the honourable member himself, the honourable and learned member for Illawarra, Senator Clemons, and Mr Wamsley signed a report in opposition to that presented 'by their protectionist colleagues. We have been told that we have no evidence of the cost of producing these stripper-harvesters. I say that we have clear evidence that £ 3 9 represents, approximately, the actual cost of their production. The four protectionist members of the Tariff Commission report that the machine's are worth about £ 4 1 . They affirm that the I local manufacturers make a profit of about The £ 1 8 upon the sale of each machine. If that is not sufficient, I do not know what is. One witness who appeared before the Commission stated that he believed they could be manufactured for £ 3 0 . Subsequently, a couple of witnesses from Mr. MCKay's factory were sent along to reply to his statements. Of course, according to their own evidence, they attended voluntarily. There is no douot that they were assisted largely by Mr MCKay.",54
369,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Why does the honourable member say that?,54
370,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am certain of it. If the honourable member chooses to read  he will come to the conclusion that they must have obtained a good deal of their information from Mr MCKay's office. When they were questioned as to the cost of producing these stripper-harvesters, they could not give any information, but they did not hesitate to express the opinion that the other witness did not know their cost.",54
371,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,How does the honourable member think that the witness to whom he has referred knew it?',55
372,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member can support the men who are seeking special privileges if he chooses, but I intend to put my own case, and he is at liberty to reply to it. I cannot fail to notice that honourable members in this House, who profess to be such ardent friends of the working man, are constantly fighting for special privileges to favoured individuals. Those who condemn monopolies are the very men who vote to assist wealthy individuals like Mr MCKay.",55
373,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"How did the witness, of whom the honourable member speaks, know the cost of these machines?",55
374,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"He admitted that the actual cost of producing the machine, including material and labour, was about £ 3 0 . Two witnesses attempted to rebut his evidence, but when questioned as to the cost of producing the machines, they declared that they could give no information. Mr MCKay knew that this witness had appeared before the Commission, but he could not send anybody to contradict his statement. Consequently it is fair to assume that it was correct. It has been said that the wages paid in the Canadian and American factories .are lower than those which are paid in Australia. I very much question that statement. The four protectionist members of the Commission affirm that time and a quarter is paid for overtime in Australia, whilst no such concession is made in Canada. They declare that in the Canadian factories the employees work sixty hours weekly, as against forty-eight hours in Australia. I venture to say that the statement in reference to time and a quarter being paid for overtime in Australia is not correct. The evidence given before the Commission shows that in Mr MCKay's - factory the employees are paid the same rate - for overtime that they receive for their dinary hours of labour. It also shows that in the Canadian factories the employees work, not sixty hours weekly, but fifty of the Massey-Harris Company, in analyzing the evidence tendered by Mr MCKay, stated that the average earnings of the employees were 34s. weekly, but Mr MCKay's foreman said that the average wage was £ 2 os. 2d. weekly. He did not submit any figures or time-sheet in support of his statement. He merely divided the annual amount disbursed in wages by forty-eight, deducting four weeks for holidays. His estimate as to the average wage paid includes the amount disbursed in the factories by way of overtime. If we set the overtime against the holidays, and assume that the overtime worked equalled four weeks in the year, we get back to the position put by Mr. Patterson. As evidencing the wages which are paid in Mr MCKay's factory, I may mention that some time ago an inspired paragraph appeared in the Age newspaper stating that 130 men had been dismissed from employment, and that the wages paid to them amounted to £200 a week. That amount divided amongst 130 workmen would mean an average of about 30s. weekly. We know very well that the factories experience a slack time at the end of the year, when there is no demand for harvesters. Reference has been made to the cost of the material employed in the manufacture of these machines. The members of the Commission who signed the report in favour of higher duties allege that the cost of the raw material here is higher than it is in Canada and America. On what ground dp they make such a statement? They have simply accepted the unsupported testimony cf certain witnesses. They have no proof of their contention. On the other hand, the free-trade members of the Commission give the exact figures, which show thafJ the cost of raw material in Canada and America-wher e high duties prevail-is higher than it is in Australia, where iron and steel can be obtained free of duty. Any man of ordinary intelligence on reading the summary of the evidence prepared by the members of the Commission who favour higher duties must come to the conclusion that their recommendation is a wrong one. On the other hand, the report of the free-trade members of the Commission is the honest outcome of the evidence. orThe members of the Commission were not appointed to report according to their preconceived ideas or fiscal prejudices; but to act as a jury, and to base their reports upon the evidence. One cannot read the report of those in favour of higher duties without realizing that their conclusions are absolutely opposed to the weight of evidence. Mr MCKay practically refused to give any information to the Commission. Tf the summary of the evidence is correct, however, he admitted that he had made a better profit since Federation, and that his business in 1905 was three times greater than it was in 1901. Despite these facts, the protectionist members of the Commission came to the conclusion that he was being ruined. They ignored his own evidence, and that of other wrtnesses, as well as the returns as to imports of machinery. Victoria has beer; unfortunate in the selection of her legislators, since they have destroyed the self-reliance of her people. They have sought to make the people wealthy by taxing them up to the hilt. Instead of freeing the people they have burdened them in every direction, and are seeking at the present time to make their load of taxation still heavier. The export of Victorian-made implements to other States has increased since 1.899. In that year the exports of machinery from Victoria, to the other States w-ere valued at £92,000, whereas those sent out in 1905 were of the value of £134,000-a n increase of £42,000. In 1905, Victoria imported machinery of this class of the value of only £118,000, or £J:6.OOO less than the value of her exports. And yet we are told that she has suffered by the reduction of the duties prevailing under the old State Tariff. I come now to the number of hands employed in the industry. interesting to learn that in X899 there were 1,107 hands employed, whereas in 1905 there were 1,624, an increase of 517. The number of hands employed in this so called languishing industry in the Commonwealth increased by over 1,200 between 1899 and 1905.",55
375,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The number only decreased during the two drought years.,56
376,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is so. large imports to which special reference has been made took place immediately after the drought, and were chiefly the result of a very successful season. The summary of the evidence prepared by the protectionist members of the Commission shows that there is really no justification for these proposals. The industry is progressing, the profits derived from it are enormous, and it would be simply outrageous by destroying all competition to allow these engaged in it to secure larger returns. t 44] l",56
377,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,This proposal means reducedprices.,56
378,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The price of the locally made machines may be reduced, but the .result of the Government proposal may be that the farmers of Australia will have to pay for obsolete machines the price at which up-to-date ones could otherwise be obtained. As a matter of fact, no reduction will be secured under the Government proposal, since the International Company have alreadv reduced their machines to £70. If the local manufacturers had the interest of the farmers at heart, and desired at the same time to capture the whole of the trade in these machines they would reduce their prices. They could materially reduce them, and still derive a very substantial profit from the industry. If they took this step, they would soon shut out fqreign competition, and no cjne would 1 complain; but the free-trade party certainly protests against the imposition of high duties to assist manufacturers who are alreadv making large profits, and have not been injured in any way. I fail to understand how any men of intelligence could submit such a report as that .furnished by the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission. The Minister is prepared to believe anything, and to take any course that will help his friends, the manufacturers. The Labour Party should not vote for an increased duty subject to It is the Excise proposals indicated by the honourable member for' Wide Bay. The adoption of such a proposition would be of no assistance to the workers. If an increased duty is to be imposed, let us say distinctly that the whole of the benefit derived from it shall go to workers engaged in the industry. I am opposed to these proposals, but if the duties are to be increased, let us provide that the advantage shall be enjoyed by the men who work in the factories. We cannot secure that result by The means of Wages Boards. Before resuming my seat, I should like to say that, in mv opinion, the statement made by the Minister that some people were afraid to go before the Tariff Commission because of the way in which witnesses were bullied is unjustifiable. I have seen nothing in the evidence to warrant such an assertion. I have no hesitation in saying that perjury was committed before the Commissionthat men. went before it deliberately and wilfully to perjure themselves for the sake of gaining a few shillings. I would not accept the evidence of Mr MCKay.",56
379,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member would have to accept service of a writ if he made such a statement outside.,57
380,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Perhaps so. If they would permit me to plead that the statement was true in fact, and allow me an opportunity to prove it, I should be quite prepared to make it outside. One of the witnesses examined before the Tariff Commission in Sydney swore that the pine in the Don Dorrigo scrub was equal to Oregon and kauri, although, as a matter of fact, it rots if exposed to the weather for twelve months. The Don Dorrigo scrub adjoins my electorate, and as I have used thousands of feet of timber taken from it, I am in a position to express an opinion upon it. According to a newspaper, report, the witness in question made the statement. I have attributed to him, his desire being, apparently, to secure the imposition of heavy duties on Oregon and other timbers. If any of these men would allow me to plead justification, I should be prepared to repeat outside the statements I have just made, because I have no hesitation in saying that, to a large extent,- absolutely untrue evidence was given by certain witnesses. I shall oppose anv increase of duty, but if an increase is ried, I shall endeavour to insure that the benefit of it shall' be enjoyed by the workers, and not by the wealthy manufacturers whose profits.today are exceedingly large.",57
381,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Kalgoorlie) [9.30] - I take the view that it is not right to ask members, nine-tenths of whom are pledged to fiscal peace, to discuss a proposal like that now before the Committee during the last stage df the existence of this Parliament ; but, as the Government have imposed these duties, and they are being collected, we are forced to deal with them in one wa.v or another. I would rather leave the matter, over for consideration by the next Parliament, which will have received a mandate from the people in regard to the Tariff; but, under the circumstances, I shall not hesitate to enunciate myfiscalopinions. It has seemed to me that many' of the remarks which have come from ""members of the Opposition during the debate were intended for our country cousins in the galleries. A great deal of what they have said in regard to the probable effect of the duty in raising prices has been in the highest degree absurd. In my humble judgment, those engaged in the primary industries-will be in a better position than they occupy now when they have a larger market in Australia.",57
382,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I suppose that more children are born into the world when heavy duties are imposed.,57
383,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not know that the fiscal question has any direct bearing on the production of children; but the point is immaterial during the discussion of a duty on harvesters. Our primary producers would be better off if there were a larger consumption of their products by those engaged in our secondary industries, instead of practically everything having to be exported to other countries to feed those engaged there in manufacturing goods ultimately to be sent here to compete with local manufactures. I regard the proposed fixed duty as much more satisfactory than an ad valorem duty. In my opinion, a Minister should not be allowed by executive act of any ikind to increase or decrease the rates of duty imposed by Parliament. The present Minister of Trade and Customs, however, by increasing the. valuation of imported harvesters from about £ 3 8 to £ 6 5 , practically doubled the rate of duty. There has been a great deal car- of discussion as to whether he did right in taking that action, and as to whether the real value of the harvesters is that declared by the importers or that fixed by him.",57
384,Mr FOYNTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,There is no doubt on the subject now. The Tariff Commission has declared that the Minister was wrong. - Mr Frazer - The honourable member accepts the opinions of the Tariff Commission only when it suits him to do so.  amendment of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo.,57
385,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am pleased to hear of that advance. I think that Parliament should say definitely what the rate of duty is to be. The subject is not a difficult one to deal with. We all know what harvesters are. We have information concerning their manufacture, both here and in other countries. The evidence placed before the Tariff Commission shows that this machine is an Australian invention. Australian inventive genius has the credit of being the first to place on the market a machine which will strip and winnow in one operation. For that reason alone we should show a preference to Australians in this matter. We know that the machine, having been perfected here, was copied in America, and manufactured there in large numbers. I hold that the proposed duty of £ 1 6 per machine, if adopted, will practically prohibit importations; but I am prepared to vote on this item for such a duty, because I am d f opinion that, as Australians have perfected this machine, it is better that it should be made here, giving employment to our own people than that the work should be done by foreigners or by our own countrymen in other lands working under different conditions.. I am prepared to give the Australian manufacturers the home market, subject to certain restrictions. A great deal has been said about the development of the ""local industry; but, last year stripper harvesters to the value of £ 6 9 , 2 0 0, representing about 1,730 machines, were imported. Assuming that only £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 represents the cost of labour employed in making them, I say that it is better that that money should be spent in employing our own work people ""than in providing occupation for workmen abroad while our own people are seeking employment. Freetraders say that the proposed duty will have the effect of increasing the price of harvesters to farmers.",57
386,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not think that it will do so, because at the present time the manufacturers make a clear profit of £ 2 0 per machine.",58
387,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am glad that my honourable friend thinks that the prices will not be increased. It has been alleged that the farmers will be robbed by the manufacturers if the proposed duty is agreed to. I think that, instead of the price of the machines being increased, the effect of the duty will be a reduction in price. Although I represent a mining constituencj, 1 was brought up on a farm, and spent eighteen years of my life in agricultural employment. I have followed the plough, and I have driven a stripper-harvester.",58
388,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I was connected with farming operations for twenty-five years.,58
389,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If the' honourable member was farming twenty-five years ago, he cultivated with a single-furrow plough, reaped with a reaping-hook, and thrashed with a flail. I am speaking of modern farming. I remember the combinations of importers under free-trade for the purpose of fleecing the farmer. When the valuations of stripper-harvesters were at their lowest, the farmers were being charged from £ 8 0 to £ 9 0 for these machines. Relatives of mine in north-eastern Vic[144]- 2 toria have paid more 'than £ 8 5 for machines.",58
390,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,MCKa y was in that combine.,58
391,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Mr MCKay has charged £ 1 2 0 for some of his machines.,58
392,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I shall tell honourable members what I think of Mr MCKay presently. I am trying to expose the f a llacy of the contention that the free introduction of stripper-harvesters will bring about a reduction in the cost to the farmer. I think that that idea is absolutely absurd.,58
393,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,If you take off the duty the price will be reduced.,58
394,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"When there was no duty the farmers were fleeced just the same. The Government proposal makes a step in the right direction. The Minister told us that he proposed to provide that the cash price of a 5-ft. stripper-harvester should be reduced to £ 7 0 by the end of 1906. If this cqndition is complied with, it will enable farmers to obtain machines at more than £ 5 less than the present cost. I think that we should insist upon bringing this condition into force immediately-that the reduction in price should be made immediately the duties become operative. Up to the present time, exorbitant prices have been charged for both the imported and the locally manufactured machines, and there is plentv of room for a considerable reduction in price. Instead of, as is proposed, providing for a reduction in price to £ 6 5 within two years, it seems to me that the evidence given before the Tariff Commission shows that a reduction to £ 5 5 might very well be made, and still leave a fair profit to the manufacturers.",58
395,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Will the honourable member assist in bringing about an amendment in that direction?,58
396,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am willing to help to amend the resolution in the direction of reducing the price of the machine; but I do not commit mystelf absolutely to £ 5 5 . I think, however, that we might provide f o i a reduction to £ 6 0 within two years.",58
397,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Why should not the price.be reduced to that extent now?,58
398,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am not going to permit honourable members to force me into an impossible position. We are told that the cost of production of the Australian machine is £ 4 1 , and we are further infoimed that the selling expenses amount to £ 2 1 1.7 s. That is surely an exorbitant charge to make. If the present proposal be carried, and the local manufacturers secure a practical monopoly of the home market, they should surely be capable of arriving at an understanding that will enable them to reduce their selling expenses by at least £ 1 5 per machine. No doubt a considerable reduction could be effected if their agencies were organized upon a more satisfactory basis. Then we are told that the merchandising profit amounts to £ 1 8 2s. 7d. per machine. In other words, the selling expenses in connection with the disposal of a stripper-harvester worth £ 4 1 are said to amount to £ 4 0 . There is no reason why the manufacturers should not be able to dispose of their machines for about £60 , and still make a handsome profit. I have no more faith in the Australian manufacturer than I have in the importer. The manufacturers will not deal more fairly with their workmen than with the consumers, and if it is fair to fix a maximum selling price, in order to protect the farmers, it is equally desirable that we should impose conditions that will insure to the workmen engaged in the industryfair and reasonable treatment in regard to wages and other conditions. The other day, an address was read by Mr Charles Atkins, the President, or ex-President, of the Melbourne Chamber of Manufactures, in which he advocated protection foi. manufacturers and freedom of contract.",58
399,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is that the same gentleman who has been selected by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to stand as a candidate for the Senate?,59
400,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I believe that he has been selected by the present Government to stand in their interest at the next elec- kins. tion.,59
401,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Mr Atkins denied that he advocated freedom of contract.,59
402,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"He only partially denied it. He stated that he"" did not understand the political significance of the term ""freedom of contract."" If he does not understand it he is too big and sawney a child to represent in the Senate the State of Victoria, which has one-third of the total population of the Commonwealth.",59
403,Mr SPENCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,He understands what he is doing in advocating freedom of contract.,59
404,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am afraid that he will not be able to convince many people that he does not understand the meaning of the term.,59
405,Mr STORRER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Mr Atkins does not sell harvesters.,59
406,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I know that. When he is addressing school children he advocates the wearing of Australian tweeds, but I understand that hie is the sole agent of a number of American brands of paint, brushware, and varnish articles which might be very well manufactured in this country.",59
407,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is it fair to attack a man in his absence?,59
408,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am prepared to repeat every statement that I have made, or will make, from the steps of Parliament House, and to take the full responsibility of my action. I know what some manufacturers would do if they were able to secure freedom of contract, and my experience of men of their class is such as to induce me to refuse to give them the full control of the home market without at the same time making adequate provision for the protection of their employees.",59
409,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Hear , hear. That is a very different matter from attacking an absent man who is a candidate for Parliament. Mr .FRAZER - I do not suppose that we have any idea of repeating the farce enacted in the Victorian Parliament by bringing a citizen to the bar of the House, and as Mr Atkins is not a member of this Chamber, I must make statements regarding him in his absence, if I am to refer to him at all. I shall have something to say with regard to the attitude assumed by the Chairman of the Anti-Sweating League, who is now defending Mr At",59
410,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am not defending him. I sav that it is not fair for a member of Parliament to use his position to attack a man who is a candidate for Parliament. I do not care upon what side he may be.,59
411,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"My honourable friend's interjection is too puerile to merit any serious attention. I have said nothing that cannot be established by documentary evidence. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is very anxious on some occasions to defend those who are suffering from the effects of sweating, and now he appearsequally concerned to explain the attitude of a gentleman who has declared himself an advocate of freedom of contract.",59
412,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I like to be fair.,59
413,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"My honourable friend is so fair in connection with this proposal that he desires that Mr Atkins shall be I immune from criticism in regard to his public utterances. I do hot think that the proposal of the honourable member for Lang should receive any panies serious consideration. I am not in favour of granting to the employees all the profits that accrue from the carrying on of any of industry. The manufacturer is entitled some consideration and to legitimate muneration for his enterprise Consequently the proposal of the honourable member for Lang that the employees should receive the whole of the profit rethink. sulting from any protective duty is distinctly unfair. My sole desire is that workmen shall receive consideration similar to that given to their employers.  member trust the employer in the matter of the treatment of his workmen, as well cost. as in regard to fixing the selling price of the machines?",60
414,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I do not propose to trust him to deal fairly with either. If the Government proposal is agreed it will not be possible to increase the price of the machines.,60
415,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,If the prices .are protection. raised the duties will be reduced.,60
416,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Exactly; and the manufacturers are not likely to run any risk of that. I think that the proposal the honourable member for Wide Bay is tically deserving of our most favourable consideraditions tion, because it would insure fair treatment for workmen. In .those States in which there is no industrial legislation, I favour allowing the employers to conform to a fair average of the conditions with which those tralian makers. engaged in the same industry have to comply in the neighbouring States.",60
417,Mr GLYNN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The amendment that I moved in the Australian Industries Preserwith vation Bill would have covered all that.,60
418,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not recollect what was the nature of the honourable and learned member's amendment. I think that the honourable .member for Wide Bay has made a most seasonable suggestion, one which offers a solution of the difficulty with which we are confronted. In my opinion, the only difference between the vernment proposal and that of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo is that the former seems to involve more than it does in reality. If we fix a maximum selling price for these machines, I believe that the imposition of a duty of either £ 1 0 or £ 1 6 will amount to absolute prohibition. t was stated in evidence that the importing expenses of the Massey-Harris Company amounted to, £ 1 4 16s. 6d. on each machine, and the other two importing comestimated the cost of landing their goods in the Australian market at a higher price. If we add to that amount a duty £ 1 0 , it will make the total cost of landto ing stripper-harvesters in Australia £ 2 4 re16s. 6d., which, in my opinion, is tantaand energy. mount to prohibition.",60
419,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"£ 1 4 16s. 6d. per machine is a ridiculouslv high estimate, I",60
420,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The International Harthe vester Company estimates that its importing expenses, added to the duty, amounts to £ 1 7 8s. i d .",60
421,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The machines would not weigh or measure sufficient to justify that,60
422,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am accepting the sworn statements of these firms as correct. I repeat that their importing expenses, added to a duty of £ 1 0 per machine, to, would practically amount to prohibition.",60
423,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Minister declares that it is only twopenny half-penny,60
424,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not agree with the Minister. Seeing that I am faced with two proposals which practically amount to of prohibition, that the Committee have pracdecided to impose satisfactory conto the users of these machines, and to safeguard the interests of the workmen engaged in their manufacture, I feel justified in voting for the Government proposals to give the Australian market to AusMr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney) [10.8] - I am inclined to believe that the tone of debate, and the method of dealing the public business in this Parliament, has mot improved during my absence in the old country. Both vesterday and today the worse of charges have been bandied by honourable members across the chamber. Honourable members upon this side of the and House have been accused of regarding manufacturers in the light of individuals who should not be allowed to live, and Gohonorable members upon the other side have practical I v accused importers of being thieves, who evade the pavment of Customs duties. In mv judgment, there is nothing to be gained by approaching a question of this sort in that frame of mind. Then the honourable member for Kalgoorlie alluded to a gentleman who is now submitthe ting himself to the electors of Victoria a way that he was not justified in doing. Another speaker charged a gentleman who gave evidence before the Tariff Commission with having been guilty of gross and wilful perjury. These statements do not redound to the dignity of the House. I wish that we could get rid of them, and approach this question in ,a deliberative spirit.",60
425,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The accusations from the honourable member's side of the Committee.,61
426,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Ba d taste was free-trader ? displayed on both sides. Personally, I think it desirable that we should come a decision upon this question to-night. do not think that anything that any honorwords able member can say upon it is likely to influence a single vote. It seems to that the Government know exactly what they are going to get. They realise that they cannot carry the duty which they have proposed. It appears to me that, in mitting it, they were actuated by the same motive which prompts workmen, when aptoria pealing to the Arbitration Court, to ask something more than they ever hope gain.",61
427,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I do not do that sort of thing.,61
428,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is the only excuse which cam be urged for pronot posing such a high duty as £ 1 6 , in .the face of the finding of the Tariff Commishonorable sion. Up to the present time not ai single argument has been adduced to jusMinistry tify the action of the Government. The Prime Minister devoted about three and halfminutes to the introduction of these proposals-probabl y because the Minister of Trade and Customs was not present bullock through this big job for him. From the tenor of this debate, I gather that there are some fair-minded men* the other side of the Chamber, who realise that protection is a hydra-headed monster which will take everything that it can and ask for more. Some time ago I was appealed to by a gentleman who is interested in the harvester industry to vote a duty of £ 8 upon these machines.",61
429,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,How long ago?,61
430,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Onl y a few being months.,61
431,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Bu the did not agree a maximum selling price.,61
432,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is other bad feature of these proposals. Why should we be asked to tax every farmer in community for the purpose of making in an absolute present of at least £ 8 to the local manufacturers of these machines? I say that it is a gross job on the part of those who are advocating the tax. It is time that we approached this question from the stand-point of calm reasoning. I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that we are breaking faith with the electors by attempting to deal with the Tariff durcame ing die present session.,61
433,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Did not the honourable member himself come here as a militant,61
434,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"At the last to general election my constituency was plaI carded by a labour candidate with the "" Fiscal peace."" What is the position today? We find that for electioneerme ing purposes the Government are bringing forward proposals for preferential trade, for an amendment of the Constitution to allow of a Federal old-age pension scheme, suband for Tariff revision. They are anxious to be able to tell the protectionists of Victhat they did their best to secure a for duty of £ 1 6 on stripper-harvesters, alto though, as a matter of fact, they know that they cannot secure such a duty, and that probably the question will not be finally dealt with this session. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie said that we ought to deal with such matters. It is interesting to observe the way in which many imembers are endeavouring to wriggle out of the position in which the have placed them. They know that they ought not to be dealing with the a Tariff at the present time, and in order to rid themselves of this responsibility they are seeking to saddle the motion before the to Chair with all sorts of extraneous matters relating to the payment of wages and the prices to be charged for these machines upon If we are to determine the wages to be paid in this industry, and the price to be charged for these machines, why have we get, failed to consider such questions in relation to the. starch industry and other trades for that we have protected ? If the essence of "" the new protection"" is that protective duties shall not be imposed without steps taken to insure that the workers shall derive from them the fullest possible advantage, I shall have, as an anti-protecto tionist, to review my position? We have never yet attempted to do anything of the ankind. The Federal Parliament has made itself sufficiently ludicrous by its many experiments, but the various proposals which have been put forward to-night will be considered far more extravagant than has any proposition with which we have yet dealt. We do not seem to be in a right frame of mind to deal with Tariff questions. We are all burdened by the heavy incubus of the Cabinet system of government. We are not going to vote in accordance with our individual convictions; we are going to record a party vote. The Government rely upon party considerations. They know that certain members of the Labour Party feel that whilst they ought rot honestly to vote for this proposal, they intend for party reasons to do so. '",61
435,Mr THOMAS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,A most unfair statement to make.,62
436,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"In the closing hours of a moribund Parliament, we are asked to deal with these questions in order that the Ministry may go before their constituents and say "" At any rate we made a start. We tried to secure a duty of £ 1 6 on harvesters, but were able to secure a duty of only £ 8 , "" or £ 1 0 , as the case may be. No argument has been adduced in justification of the action of the Government. No one can gainsav that on the evidence given before the Commission any Equity Judge-if he had power to deal with this question-woul d grant the local manufacturers of stripper-harvesters one penny by way of compensation for losses sustained as the result of the Federal Tariff. There is not a tittle of evidence to show that these men have lost, or are going to lose, anything under the fiscal system adopted by this Parliament. I admit, as Others have done, that I have not read .the voluminous evidence tendered to the Commission, but my opinion respecting Royal Commissions and Select Committees is very different from that of many honourable members. I have been a member of one or two Commissions, and have seen duties honourably and industriously discharged by such bodies. I am quite certain, from what I have seen of the work of the Tariff Commission, that the members of it have discharged a very onerous and responsible duty to the best of their ability, and at an immense sacrifice of their time and money. Consequently. I sav that, since they were selected from, both sides of the House because of their special qualifications for the work, we ought to pay some respect to their findings, and be governed largely by their sifting of the evidence that has been placed before them.",62
437,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,But there are two findings on this question.,62
438,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Eve n if we adopted the findings of the protectionist members of the Commission we should not impose anything like the duty proposedseemingly withoutany reference to the evidence-by the Government.,62
439,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The two findings seem to suggest the necessity for a third proposal.,62
440,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The finding of the free-trade members of the Commission seems to be the more applicable of the two. It is only natural that the protectionist members of the Commission should display some bias in the direction of assisting an industry, and it is equally reasonable to assume that the free-trade members of the Commission would be disposed to see that too much support was not given to it. There is not the slightest reason for the Government proposal, and I am fairly satisfied that they do not anticipate being able to carry it. At the proper time. I shall propose, as an amendment, either that we impose a fixed duty of £ 8 , or an ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. I think that either duty would be ample to satisfy the requirements of the local manufacturers. If I fail in this effort I shall be quite willing to support the proposal foreshadowed by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that a fixed duty of £ 1 0 be imposed. I am not, however, in favour of fixed duties. There was a good deal of force in the argument raised this afternoon by my honourable leader that a fixed duty is very apt to be a constantly increasing one. Owing to the tendency in all cases from time to time to lower the cost of manufacture, .such a duty generally takes an upward direction. Apart from that consideration, however, it seems to me that there are many difficulties in the way of the imposition of a fixed duty-difficultie s which the Committee, perhaps, have not considered, and which may best be illustrated by pointing out what would be the effect of such an impost on watches. A watch is a machine for keeping time, whilst a harvester is a machine for reaping. It is possible, not only because of the material used, but owing to the degree offinishgiven to them for both these machines to have varying values. As time goes on, they may be so materially improved as to be worth three times as much as those now in use. And yet with a fixed duty the revenue lected in respect of a watch worth £30 would be just the same as that collected respect of one worth £120. I acknowledge that the imposition of ad valorem duties can be objected to on the ground that when they are very high there is an extreme bability of fictitious invoices being presented to the Customs Department. But if took precautions against the imposition excessively high rates the danger of fraud would not be so serious as would be the difficulty resulting from the adoption of fixed duty. I do not wish to go into the details of this proposal. I hope that day will come when we shall get rid of Tariff debates. If we could rid the political arena of the Tariff question once and for all we should soon see a fresh cleavage of political parties, and the political atmosphere would be improved. If , by working night and day for six months could frame a perfect Tariff, that could remain in operation for twenty years, I, one, should be willing to undertake the task. I hope, at all events, that Ministers will be content with having aired this proelse. posal; that, having placed themselves in the position of being able to sav to their constituents, ""We have done our best to impose high duties,"" they will withdraw the motion, and look forward to the rerecommended, vision of the Tariff next session. If the wages to be paid, and the prices to charged, in respect of the product of industry are to be fixed, why should we take similar action in regard to every in the Tariff? If the principle of regusonable lating prices and wages in respect to production of one article is a good one, it should be applied all round. It is to attempt to apply such conditions production of one article. If the people interested in this industry are seeking this very high duty, they are very foolish. If tion. I, as a manufacturer, were offered such a duty, I should feel that I was in a tion of danger. When we were battling with the Tariff four or five vears ago, proposal was made that the duty on pianos should be very much higher than mittee was likely to agree to. manufacturer of pianos, who was then the gallery, hastened to a member Government, and said, "" For heaven's sake, do not make the duty so high. you do you will cause the German manupower facturers to establish their factories It seems to me that the imposition of Mr G. B. Edwards. duty of £ 1 6 on these machines would, in colthe .same way, cause the Canadian and American manufacturers to establish their in factories here,"" with the result that the manufacturers of the ""Sunshine"" harvesters would find themselves in a far worse position than they have ever dreamt of. proWe should give them a fair duty, which would compensate them for the difference we between their market and that of the Ameof rican manufacturer. The local manufacturer has, a population of only 4,000,000 people to cater for, as against a population a of 80,000,000 in America, where the ""manufacturers are in a better position to turn the out these machines at a reduced price. I should be willing to give those engaged in the industry a duty of 12\ per cent, or 15 per cent., but I would not tax the whole farming industry of the Commonwealth simply to put into the pockets of the local we makers of these machines something which would far more than compensate them for for the disadvantages under which they labour, and, in the end, would not have a beneficial effect either on themselves or any one",62
441,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yarra) [10.30] - I congratulate that section of the Tariff Commission to which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo belongs upon having I believe for the first time, a triple system of protection, having for its be object the securing to the manufacturer one conditions under which he may make a not profit by his operations, to the consumer item the advantage of being supplied at a reacost in his own country, and to the the worker goda wages and proper conditions. I believe that this is the first time that such absurd a recommendation has been made by a to the Tariff Commission.",63

443,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes . Undoubtedly, posimanv honourable members will have to reconsider their position if an attempt is a made in dealing with duties to apply conditions which will secure to the workers a the Comfair share in the advantages to be A local derived from them. I agree with in the honourable member for Melbourne of the Ports that as it is the Commonwealth Parliament which has to do with If the fixing of duties, we should also have to pass, industrial legislation, so that here."" no manufacturer benefited by protection a could place himself outside the operation of such laws. At the present time, a Victorian manufacturer can, by removing to a shire, avoid compliance with the conditions of Wages Boards, or by removing to Tasmania or South Australia, escape all restriction in the way of labour legislation. The honourable member for South Sydney was a member of the first Parliament, which framed the Tariff. said on several occasions, when that Tariff was going through, that I was of the opinion that we should manufacture our own requirements because, by doing so, we could see that reasonable wages were paid and fair conditions of employment given to those engaged in our industries. The intention of the amendment before the Chair is to insure to the workers their fair share of the benefits of protection. I am prepared now, as I have always been, to vote for the highest rates of duties proposed, if the workmen are to share in the advantages to be derived from them. I am not satisfied with the treatment which has been given to the employees of a firm which will benefit by the proposed duties on harvesters, and last year, at a meeting at Richmond. I stated, in the presence of Mr H . V. MCKay, that the allegations made in a letter written to the Argus by a Mr Weickhardt should be disproved, and the writer prosecuted for libel, or the factory set in order. I have not read the whole of the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission, but I have read that given by Mr MCKay and Mr Weickhardt. It has been said that notice should not be taken of statements made by a dismissed employee^ but it is often the case that only when a man has left a firm he can afford to tell the truth in regard to its doings. I do not say that employees are compelled to make misstatements, but they often hold their tongues for fear of inflicting injury upon those dependent upon them. I do not Enow Mr Weickhardt, but I do not think that he would deliberately perjure himself, and the statements which he made on oath before the Tariff Commission regarding the wages paid by Mr MCKay seem to convey a certain amount of truth. Mr MCKay had, I presume, an opportunity to furnish rebutting evidence.",63
444,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Mr Bult did not deny Mr. Weickhardt's statements.,64
445,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have not read Mr. Bult's evidence, buf I know that Mr. MCKay did not rebut those statements. I believe that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and other honourable members, are anxious that protection shall be given to the workmen as well as to the manufacturers. The day of a high Tariff and freedom of contract'is past, and, once the duties are fixed. I think that manv Ministerialists and members of the Opposition will join us in endeavouring to provide I that the workers as well as the manufacturers shall reap the advantage of them. It has been said that honourable members have no right to criticise the attitude of a certain gentleman who is a candidate for the Senate, whose views are supposed to have changed. I can"" understand a man changing his opinions when he is a candidate, but I believe in men fighting straight along the line.",64
446,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member is fighting with Lyne.,64
447,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I believe that I am following the right line, and that means can be found for - guaranteeing to the workers their fair share of the benefits of protection. Possibly that may be done by getting the States to pass industrial legislation. Sixty letters were recently sent out to the manufacturers of agricultural implements by the secretary of the organizing committee of the Trades Hall",64
448,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Hav e the Government brought down these proposals at this juncture so that the farmers who are in town may know how they are being robbed?,64
449,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"They would not have been likely to bring them down if they had not thought that they would be popular with the farmers. The Government would not do anything to jeopardize their chances of success at the coming elections, and therefore it is to be assumed that they look upon the farmers as being in favour of high duties. I have not heard a single objection from any country representative with regard to the Government proposal. The principal reason that I believe in protectionist principles is that I think it desirable that, as far as possible, the articles that we require should be made amongst ourselves under conditions which we can regulate by legislation and otherwise. If we draw our supplies from other parts of the world we can exercise no control over the methods of production. Of the sixty letters that were addressed to employers in the agricultural implement making' trade, by Mr Lemmon, M.L.A., the Secretary of the Organizing Committee, only thirteen elicited replies. Only two of the employers replied that they"" were favourable to the extension of the Wages Board system to the industry. Honourable members may be under the impression that the Wages Board determination applied to the whole of the workmen in Mr MCKay's employ when he was at Ballarat; but, as a matter of fact, it applied to only the ironmoulders. Mr Weickhardt says that the value of the work performed by ironmoulders in connection with a . stripper-harvester does not amount to more than £ 1 ; but I am informed that the value might fairly be estimated at not more than £ 2 . At any rate, that estimate is well within the mark. Assuming that the value of ironmoulders' work in a stripper-harvester is only £ 2 , and that the wages of ironmoulders were increased by the determination of the Wages Board to the extent of 15 per cent., it would appear that Mr. MCKay shifted his works from Ballarat to Braybrook in order to effect a saving of 6s. upon the cost of each machine. When he was before the Tariff Commission Mr. MCKay was asked how the wages were fixed, 'and he stated that only the ironmoulders' wages were fixed by the Wages Board, whilst the rates paid to other workers and bovs were arranged by "" mutual agreement, ' and as Mr MCKay re1 moved the moulding works outside the operation of the Wages Boards, all the wages he pays are fixed by mutual agreement. Those who know much about the working of factories will readily understand what "" mutual agreement"" means where there is no organization among the workmeni. The employer obtains the services of both boys and men for the very lowest possible wages.",64
450,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is another case of the lion and the lamb lying down together.,65
451,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes , with the lamb inside of the lion. Mr MCKay was asked further, ""How did the trouble arise?"" He stated that the trouble arose because, after the rates of duty had been fixed, he endeavoured to introduce machines to perform certain work so as to do it cheaper. He addedWe had four improvers to one journeyman. I take it that, if Mr MCKay had employed one improver to four journeymen, the position of affairs would have been much more satisfactory. The Board decided that the same number of improvers as of journeymen might be employed, and, to my mind, the proportion of journeymen to improvers in that case would have been small enough. Mr MCKay was askedYou surely know what all the trouble was about ? He repliedI know pretty well, and I am telling you. The secret of the whole trouble was that we were expected to sack seven out of eight of our employees, and we would not do it; We wished to stand by the men. To comply with the condition of the Wages Board, and keep the men on, we should have had to pay the improvers Ss. per day. That would have been the only way out of it, and we could not do that. . . . If we were to pay young men, whose work was worth from £ 1 to 35s. per week, the average journeyman's wage of Ss. per day, we should have demoralized the rest of the shop. The shop would not have been demoralized, but the standard of wages would have been raised. I trust that we shall take good care that the workmen in any industry protected by means of the Tariff shall be employed under fair conditions. The honourable member for South Sydney has mentioned the starch manufacturing industry, the employees in which receive 30s. per week of fifty-four hours. We should certainly aim at improving the condition of the workers in all our industries.",65
452,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Wentworth) [10.47] - I am sure that all honourable members are glad to see the honourable member for South Sydney back in his place, and full of vigour. The honourable member, has rather roughly criticised our method of debate, and I have no doubt that his remarks were more or less influenced by the experience he has gained during his recent visit to the Courts of Europe, where the proceedings are conducted with infinitely more decorum than is observed here. I was glad, however, that as the honourable member proceeded with his speech, he began to exhibit some of that old fire which was formerly so characteristic of him. In fact, he went so far that I almost felt that I must blush for him. He characterized the Government proposal as one of the greatest jobs ever perpetrated in Australia. I do not propose to allow myself to be led into any of the by-paths of vituperation, but I cannot avoid expressing my indignation at the treatment that honourable members have received at the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs. Yesterday we had to complain of his absence, arid today he has signalized his return in this Chamber by making the grossest attack upon a judicial body that any Minister of the Crown has ever made in any Parliament. I have a copy of the Hansard report of the proceedings this afternoon, and I find that the Minister stated, by way of interjection, that certain evidence which he had in his possession had not been given before the Tariff Commission, because witnesses had been intimidated, and were afraid to approach that body. The Chairman of that Commission very properly arose the very first moment he had an opportunity, and spoke as follows: Bv way of personal explanation, I should like to say that the Minister of Trade and Customs has seen fit to make a remark which seriously reflects not only upon the Tariff Commission, but upon myself as Chairman of that body. He has stated that he understood that witnesses were, afraid to appear before the Commission",65
453,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I not only understood it, but I know it. I could give the names, sary.",66
454,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The Minister stated he understood that witnesses were afraid to before the Commission lest they should be bullied and insulted, and be denied fair play. He then' went on to show how well the liberations of the Commission had been conducted, and what absolute fair play extended to every witness who appeared fore it. Subsequently, the Minister of Trade and Customs returned to the charge. He said I ask the indulgence of the a personal explanation. I made a certain interjection which has produced a statement from the Chairman of the Tariff Commission. In reply to his remarks, I say that I can give instancesone in particular, in which a person who was endeavouring to induce a man holding a very high position to give evidence mission could not persuade him to do so in consequence-as he said to a number of well as to myself-of the bullying of witnesses by Senator Clemons. That statement strikes at the very root of the deliberations of this Committee, the only evidence before us is that which minutes. has been so ably compiled by the Tariff Commission. Im introducing these posals, the Minister of Trade and Customs mittee. stated that at the proper time he would be glad to give honourable members all the formation that was required in regard to tion ? this matter, but that he did not think it necessary to do so at that moment. His statement to that effect will be found page 3446 of Hansard. been performing other duties in various parts of Australia. At any rate, he has given honourable members no further informan mation upon the subject. all the evidence that we have before us is that which was collected by the Tariff Commission. If the charge of the Minister of Trade and Customs regarding the conduct of the Commission has any foundation whatever, _ the consideration of these proposals should be deferred. The Minister ought not to have made it in the way that he did, but, having made it, he should either prove it or withdraw it. We all know the way in which the Commission conducted its proceedings. We are aware that witnesses were obliged to give sworn evidence in the light of day-in the presence of the representatives of the press. They were examined in the ordinary way.",66
455,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"And every witness before retiring was specifically asked, "" Have you any further information that you would if neceslike to give the Commission ? """,66
456,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Exactly . The utmost that fair play was extended to witnesses. The come Commission, after deliberating for months, have arrived at the conclusion that the proper invoice value for stripper-harvesters deis -£38The Minister declares that their proper invoice value should be £ 6 5 . But was he refuses to confide in anybody the reabesons why he has arrived at that conclusion.",66
457,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is sound enough.,66
458,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I prefer to accept the opinion of the judicial body which was Committee to make sworn to do its duty.,66
459,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Minister of Trade and Customs is treating the Committee with contempt.,66
460,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I quite agree with the before the Comhonorable member.,66
461,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,He has been sitting in the people as chamber for the past eight hours.,66
462,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Hav e not the Committee every right to expect him to be present ?,66
463,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Surely the honourable membecause ber will allow him to retire for a few,66
464,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am complaining of his prorefusal to give any information to the Com,66
465,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Was not the Tariff Cominmission appointed to secure that informa,66
466,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But the Minister asserts that the information collected by the Comon mission is wrong, although he will not say Since then he has why it is wrong. Upon two occasions when important Tariff proposals have been submitted to this House, the honourable gentlehas been absent. We all recollect the Consequently phrase which the Prime Minister employed to characterize the complaints of certain members of the Labour Administration when they were ejected from office. He compared the complaints of one of them to the angry outcry of 'a greedy boy, hauled screaming from a tart shop. We are having that process repeated. The tart shop of the Minister of Trade and Customs seems to lie in his own constituency, where . his presence is apparently required to defend himself from the attacks which_his outraged constituents are making upon him. Honourable members will doubtless recollect that about the year 1902 a combine was proposed in connection with the harvester business. The first attempt to establish it failed, but subsequently it was formed. It included not only the local manufacturers of harvesters, but also the importing firm. For a time this great combine merrily fixed the price of harvesters at a higher figure than that at which had been sold prior to its establishment. Soon the South Australian firms dropped out. Then the other firms, partners in the combine, began to intrigue politically against their importing partners-in itself a none too honourable action. The Minister of Trade and Customs was approached by a number of the local manufacturers. Representations were made to him by them against their own partners. The Minister then decided, as he told us in Parliament afterwards, on the authority of a copy of a copy of a confidential letter, that the true invoice value of these articles was £65. On the strength of that copy of a copy of a confidential letter, the Minister-without consulting Parliament-took a step which practically increased the duty on harvesters by 80 or 90 per cent. He explained to this House, however, that he was prepared to extend every opportunity to the importing firms to prove their contention that the invoice value of the machines was really no more than ^38. But what have we found since? The Minister has used every opportunity to cover up his tracks, to deny information to Parliament, and to prevent these importers from proving their case in a Court of law. If the Minister can break his word on a matter of this character, surely we can take it that he is not so well fitted to form a reliable opinion as to the value of harvesters as is the Tariff Commission. The investigations of the Commission have been open to the light of day ever since they commenced. Have the Minister's? The Minister today made a charge Mr Kelly. against that body which, if jproved, discounts the value of the evidence upon which it relies. The honourable gentleman should either prove that charge or withdraw it. It is not fair to honourable members to ask us to deliberate on evidence upon the value of which the Minister himself has reflected so seriously. This after noon the honourable member for Grey expressed his views upon the duty of the Minister at the present juncture. He said that it is the honourable gentleman's duty, now that he has the reports of the Tariff Commission before him, to realise that his action, in arbitrarily fixing the value of harvesters at £ 6 5 , was a mistake, and to withdraw it like a man and grant a refund to the importers to the amount of the extra duty that they have been charged. We do not expect the Minister to behave altogether like a man, but I do say that, unless he they wishes to lose his character in the eyes of the Australian people, he will either have to prove his charge against the Tariff Commission, and show the country clearly on what grounds he objects to its evidence, or withdraw the charge, admitting that he made it in the heat of the moment, and stating that he regrets it. One course or the other must be taken by him, or the people of Australia will know what conclusion to draw.",66
467,Sir WILLIAM LYME,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Le t the honourable member look' at the Age of the 20th April last year, and see if I am not borne out absolutely.",67
468,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If the honourable gentleman is borne out by the Age, I am afraid that my worse fears are realized.",67
469,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I refer to a report of the proceedings of the Tariff Commission published on the 20th April.,67
470,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have even known the Age to distort the report of a speech by the Minister. I did, on one occasion, indeed, see an article in the Age concerning the honourable gentleman, which was, I think, the cleverest thing I have ever seen in that newspaper. The Minister had been explaining exactly how he had saved the Commonwealth - The Age took his speech down practically verbatim, and the only comment it made was in the heading. The article was headed ""Another Bill Adams."" I wish now to say a few words in connection with the controversy that has been raging on this subject. We have been told, mainly through the propaganda instigated by one of the interested manufacturers, that a great Australian industry has for some time past been languishing, and that great efforts have been made by importing firms to strangle it. Certain facts have been given in sworn evidence before the Tariff Commission. But we find that the principal proprietor - the largest manufacturer of local machines-absolutel v refused to produce his books. Honourable members will find on page 20 of the Tariff Commission's report the statement that Mr MCKayDeclined to give the exact price at which he invoiced machines, and sold them wholesale in the Argentine. On the same page appears the statement thatAustralian manufacturers, whilst challenging the invoice valuations of imported stripper-harvesters, were not prepared to give full particulars of the cost of constructing their own machines.",67
471,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the honourable member think that the importers would show their books as to the profits they made?,68
472,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They were quite prepared to do so.,68
473,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The real books, or ,! faked-up "" books?",68
474,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If the honourable member reads the evidence he will see that the importing firms did offer to produce their books to the Commission, provided the local manufacturers would do likewise.",68
475,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Whic h sets of books ?,68
476,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the honourable member infer that they would not submit their true books ?,68
477,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I believe they would not if they were like the honourable member.,68
478,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member is fond of making charges, but if he will repeat the insinuation which he has just made outside the House he will have to prove it in a short space of time.",68
479,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I will go out at once if the honourable member has the pluck to come. That is my answer if he puts the matter in that way to me. Mr KELLY,-The honourable member has made an insinuation that distinctly libels me.",68
480,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I do not think it is possible.,68
481,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am not prepared at the moment to trouble further about the honourable member's gasconading. An honourable member who can make the kind of interjection which he has just made is not worthy of the attention of any one who is addressing the. Committee.,68
482,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member is not in his motor car now.,68
483,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,If there is one thing which characterizes the taste of the honourable member it is the way in which he is prepared at any moment to introduce personal matters.,68
484,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member threw out a challenge, and I took it up. Does he withdraw it?",68
485,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What challenge?,68
486,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member challenged me to go outside, and immediately I said I would so.",68
487,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"What - I said was that if the honourable member would repeat outside the insinuation that mine is the sort of character that would cook accounts or books, I would see that he would have a chance to prove his statement or withdraw it.",68
488,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND," I did not understand the honourable member to make that charge, otherwise I should have asked him to withdraw it.",68
489,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,If the honourable member did not make the charge,68
490,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member is romancing as he talks.,68

492,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No ; the honourable member said that if the importers were like myself they would do so. However, I do not think he isworth my further notice.

493,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Includin g the American and Canadian books?,68
494,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I understand that they have offered to produce all their books on that condition. I am informed that one firm recently sued in the Supreme Court of Victoria to have a Commission appointed to go to Canada and examine their Canadian books, but the Minister of Trade and Customs took every opportunity to block the application; so much so that the question of whether or not the firm are prepared to have the fullest investigation made into its affairs",68
495,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What was the firm's reply to the Minister of Trade and Customs in the Reid Government when he asked them to arbitrate on the question?,68
496,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I do not remember what it was.,69
497,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They said that an engineer could not determine the cost under Canadian conditions.,69
498,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"And in this case the expert would be an interested party, namely, a local manufacturer.",69
499,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"- I wish to draw the attention of the honourable member for Moira to something which, I can remember, was pointed out to the Minister of Trade and Customs. If he will refer to page 16 of the Tariff Commission's report, he will find that the Chief Inspector of Customs in Canada, who is in no way interested in the Massey-Harris Company, made a personal inspection of the books and operations of that company, and reported to the Commissioner of Customs or. the 20th October, 1904, as follows : Upon careful investigation and examination the books of the Massey-Harris Company, I satisfied that the invoice price for stripper-harmachines vesters, namely, $183, with $2 extra for poles and adjustments, represents a fair wholesale market value of these machines. $185 is a little over £ 3 8 , so that, accordat ing to this officer, who is in a position to cash know the facts, the invoice value of the 2d. Massey-Harris Company is a correct one.",69
500,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Will the honourable gross member now read the report obtained Melbourne house, &c. afterwards from the Commissioner of Cus-' totns on the very same subject?",69
501,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I do not know where to find that report at the moment.,69
502,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is on the same file of papers as the document from which the honourable member has just quoted.,69
503,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But I have not got the file of papers; I am quoting from the Commission's report. The honourable member is, I presume, talking of the late Minister of Trade and Customs for the Commonwealth.",69
504,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,No ; I am talking of the reply received from the Commissioner of Customs as to the policv of the Dominion Government in refusing to give information.,69
505,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That has to do with orange meat, and not with harvesters at all.",69
506,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It applies to any product.,69
507,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It has to anything.,69
508,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The Minister said in the House that it relates to orange meat, and not to harvesters.",69
509,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No doubt the honourable member for Moira will remember the statement of the late Minister of Trade and Customs, only this afternoon, that he went into this matter believing that he would find that the Masses-Harris Company had seriously understated the true invoice value, but that he came out of the investigation fully satisfied that the true invoice value for their machines was £ 3 8 .",69
510,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"And if MCKay can manufacture machines here for £ 3 8 , why cannot the Massey-Harris Company manufacture them in Canada for that sum?",69
511,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Exactly . The paragraph from which I quoted goes on to sayIn corroboration of the report of the Canadian Customs Department, evidence was given before the Commission that Clutterbuck Brothers, of Adelaide, South Australia, bought stripper-harof vester machines wholesale and unpacked, at the am Toronto factory, the price being ^40 5s. for of the standard size, and gs. 6d. extra for pole, making a total price at the factory of £40 14s. 6d. This is the same machine which is invoiced to the Massey-Harris Melbourne house ^38 os. 3d. After deducting the customary discount, the cash equivalent of the invoice value of ^40 14s. 6d. is, it is alleged, ^39 145. The difference between Clutterbuck Brothers' price and £38 os. 3d., is, it is contended, the profit for the Massey-Harris Company's Not only has evidence been given by the Chief Inspector of Customs in Canada, but corroborative evidence to a very large extent has been placed before the Tariff Commission, and it is all. to the effect that £ 3 8 is the true invoice value. The Minister decided that it is £ 6 5 , and now asks us to agree to a duty which is equivalent to 25 per cent, on that amount. Whatever evidence he has, the Committee is entitled to know of it. It was sought to be elicited from the Prime Minister yesterday, but he refused to give it. The Minister of Trade and Customs has returned, and I ask him whether he, at this late hour, will give us the information which he is keeping locked up somewhere in his chest. Or does he wish us to believe that, for a reason he does not care to explain, he has done an arbitrary act which cannot but very greatlv benefit the harvester manufacturers in Australia? I was saying that it is singular that if. as they state, their industry is reference languishing, and they are making losses, the local manufacturers should refuse fo produce their books to the Tariff Commission. Another singular feature about the report of that body is the evidence given by the chief local maker of harvesters as to the expansion of the industry under present conditions. It is shown in the report of the Commission, dnd also in a return - issued to us yesterday, that, under the present duty, the harvester industry in Australia is largely on the increase. On page 28 of the report the following paragraph appearsMr H . V. MCKay admitted he was not losing money. He was making fair progress in his business. He would not say what his profits during the last three years bad been. His output has increased in consequence of the extension of trade in the Commonwealth, and because of the development of his export business. machines had made a good name, and the trade had followed. That does not suggest either decline or strangulation: On the evidence of the chief manufacturer, the industry requires no further fostering. From the return issued yesterday, we find that not only the production, but the exportation of the article, is largely increasing. During the first seven months of this vear 66 machines in excess of the total number exported last year have been sent out. In the first seven months of this year 484 machines were exported to countries where they had to compete on even terms with those of foreign manufacturers, whilst last year only' 418 were exported. Thus the exports and production of the local manufacturers are increasing. Again, if there were any design on the part of importers to destroy Australian industries, why did these local producers combine with them only a few years ago to fix a high price to the Australian consumer? If they were then afraid of the importer, why did they not appeal to the Minister for relief ?",69
512,Mr KENNEPY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What relief did the . honourable member's party give them when the Tariff was under consideration?,70
513,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It gave them a duty of 12J per cent., which the Minister, on information which he denied to the House afterwards, raised by a devious method to about 25 per cent. I do not wish to further occupy the time of the Committee, for this question has been thoroughly discussed. The fact that the Committee continues to remain quiescent under the treatment which it has received from time to time from the Minister of Trade and Customs is a most serious reflection upon it. If honourable members are prepared to take this course at the instigation of the Minister, who declines to take them into his confidence, let them do so. I take it, however, that every elector who considers this sub-ject will soon be asking why they have been guilty of such a serious dereliction of duty. The farmers are most deserving of consideration. The principle has been laid down in all our Tariff discussions and throughout the Tariff itself that tools of trade should be admitted free. As a matter of fact, however, the farmers' tools of trade are not exempt. To quote the views on this subject of the present Attorney-Generaland I think he is a sound protectionist-as His reported in volume 70 of the Victorian Hansard, session 1892-3, page 2073",70
514,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Will the honourable and learned member also quote the Attorney General's reply to a reference made on a previous occasion to that speech ?,70
515,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have not seen his reply, but as I. am quoting from Hansard, I presume he is being fairly treated. On the 6th October, 1892, the present Attornev-General, speaking in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, saidWe are told that the farmer has his reaper and his binder free. So he has. Is his plough free ?It is not proposed that he shall get his reaper and binder free under these duties.",70
516,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is.,70
517,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What about ploughs ?,70
518,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member referred to reapers and binders. He should keep as nearly as possible to the truth.,70
519,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I hope that the honourable member will try to maintain the dignitv of the Chamber, and not give way to his native insults. The Attorney-General continuedIs his harrow free? Is his chaff-cutter free? Is the very twine with which he ties up his produce free? Certainly not. This shows that the farmer has much to gain, and that there is much that he ought to gain before he is placed on a level with his more fortunate brother in the town. And the miner, how is he on a level with the worker in the town? He has a weight around his neck. We are told that the miners patriotically stood by protection in the past. Are we to whip the willing horse to death? Is protection to go on for ever to an unlimited extent, right on, as we are told, to prohibition. The circumstances of the Attorney-Generai may have altered since this speech was delivered thirteen years ago, but those of the farmer have not materially changed. They need their tools of trade free of duty just as much as they did then. Their industry today is just as important to the Commonwealth as it was thirteen years ago, and in view of this expression of opinion on the part of the present Attorney-General, and the refusal of the Minister of Trade and Customs to give honourable members the information which it is his duty to his own public character, as wejl as to the House, to furnish, I shall resist to the utmost any increase of the present duties on harvesters and other agricultural implements.",70
520,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Melbourne) [11.27] As one who has never sunk the fiscal issue, and will never consent to do so, I desire to say that I am proud of the Government and the proposal they have brought forward. I intend to vote for it, and if I felt that the duty would be prohibitive I should be still more strongly disposed to do so. We cannot control the trusts that rule America and the European world, but we can by legislation ultimately rule any trust that'may be formed here. I maintain that if the motion be agreed to we shall do more than has been achieved as the result of the valuation of £ 6 5 which the Minister for Customs purposes, placed on imported harvesters. We find that from the 1st January until the 31st May last no imports of these machines have taken place. I desire now to refer briefly to the honourable member for Wentworth, who I regret is not present. He said that never had such an attack as that of the Minister been made on a. Commission before. If he were as old as Methuselah, and had spent his 900 years in reading Hansards, that statement would still have been of little value. More experience of the world would have taught him that men are often afraid to give evidence before Commissions. When I had the honour to be on the Commission appointed to inauire into the statements sweating made by the Reverend Mr Edgar - Mrs . Muir. who often attends here to listen to the debates, beinc also a member - w e had frequently to take evidence in private, so that employees appearing before us might not run the risk of having their names made known to their employers. Had their names been made known, they would have been dismissed.",71
521,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That happened quite cently in connection with the Tobacco Comgoorlie mission.,71
522,Mr M,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"iLONEY - Yes ; and it is the opinion of the --uiorney-Generalthat the man who was dismissed cannot be reinstated. The Chairman of the Tariff Commission knows that employees giving evidence cannor be protected against their masters. I trust that the Minister will nor divulge the names of those from whom he has obtained his information, so that they may not be punished by their employers. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie made a remark in regard to Mr Charles Atkins, a personal and dear friend of mine, who, o two years ago, used words which have been misunderstood. _ He made a certain statement in regard to freedom of contract.",71
523,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That was fifteen months ago.,71
524,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"He is older and wiser now, and has changed his opinion.",71
525,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,He is a candidate for the Senate.,71
526,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I want honourable members to believe that he did not intend his words to bear the construction which has been placed upon them.,71
527,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The whole speech bears out that construction.,71
528,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If he did not understand the meaning of what he said, he is not a fit and proper person to represent Victoria in the Senate.",71
529,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Is the honourable member for Melbourne standing sponsor for him, and defending what he said?",71
530,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"As a personal friend, I say that, as he has explained that he did not mean what his words have been taken to mean, I accept his explanation, and do so openly. No man could in these days, knowing, as he must, how the workers have suffered from sweating, use such words intentionally, unless his heart was very hard. I cannot support the amendment. In the words of the Latin poet, "" When the Greeks bear gifts, beware."" I believe about that the amendment has been moved to dish the Bill, and to place certain honourable members in an awkward position. I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that we cannot vote to give, all the profits of protection to the employers. He and I belong to .a partu which demands fair conditions for the emploves. We do not make unjust demands, and the proposal of the honourable member for Lang is reunjust. The honourable member for Kalsavs that the cost of the Australian harvester is £ 4 1 . If those who have spoken as the friends'of the farmers really wish to help them by enabling them to purchase harvesters at a fair price, let them take example by what has been done at Newport, where locomotive engines have been produced according to pattern for from £1,000 to £1,500 less than similar engines could be made for by the Baldwin Manufacturing Company of America, or any engineering works in Great Britain. On the authority of a man who has been connected with the manufacture of harvesters, I say that these machines could be made in a Government workshop for £ 3 0 each, and sold to the farmers for £ 3 3 , because if the farmers knew that they could be obtained from the Government at a certain cost, there would be very little expense in advertising and distributing.",71
531,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member advocates the nationalization of the harvester industry?,72
532,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes . The honourable member should be aware of that from my past career. I believe that he wishes to befriend the farmers. He can prove his goodwill towards them by letting them get their harvesters for £ 3 3 each. It would only be necessary to import a little more machinery in order to manufacture all the implements required. I compliment the. Government on the proposals they have laid before us, and I hope that to-night _ we shall settle this question once and for all.",72
533,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Hindmarsh) [11.40]. - I was sorry to hear the honourable member for South Sydney assert earlier in the evening that honourable members were not going to vote on this question according to their convictions. I may sav that 1 propose to vote according to my conviction, and to support the proposals of the Government. I regret that in giving this vote I shall be at variance with members of the party to which I belong; but, at any rate, the fact shows that the members of that party are going to vote according to their convictions. I have been wearily ancl vainly waiting to see what those who are opposed to the resolution are prepared to do for our manufacturers, workmen, and farmers. So far as I can judge, all that those honourable members are prepared to do is to leave matters as they are at present-to allow our farmers to be fleeced by combinations land foreign companies-, our workmen to be sweated, and our manufacturers to be ruined. That, however, is not the state of affairs that I desire to see. I intend to support the duty of £ 1 6 , because, to me, it is not a matter of importance what the percentage is in relation to the cost of producing the stripper-harvester. It would have been splendid for Australia if there had been manufactured in this country the 1,730 machines imported in 1905. It is said that we want population, but how are we going to get population if we do not provide work?'",72
534,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,B y employing the people in industries that will pay.,72
535,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Accordin g to the Opposition, this industry is paying handsomely, as I hope it will continue to pay. All I desire is that the workmen shall receive the benefits which they cannot enjoy if this manufacture continues to be carried on outside the country. I would not care if Mr MCKay were making ten times his present income, so long as we had ten times the number of men employed under fair treatment. We have heard a great deal about the firm of Martin and Company, and about Mr Bagshaw. The latter gentleman has truly said that the industry is not languishing; but the evidence given before the Tariff Commission shows that the industry could be put in a much better position than it occupies today. Mr Bagshaw has further said that, while he has a factory capable of employing 300 hands, he is at present able to employ only 100; and the same story is told by Messrs. Hawke and Company. It is true that the firm of Martin and Company were making machines at a much cheaper rate than that charged by the other members of the combine. That firm was dragged into the combine by one of the partners, much against Mr Martin's will ; so much so, that, although Mr Martin stood by the agreement, he insisted on being allowed to fulfil all his existing orders at the lower figure of £ 7 0 .",72
536,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,He would be compelled to do so under his contracts.,72
537,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I believe there would have been no difficultv in his getting out of the contracts.,72
538,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,But his honour would be sit st<ilce,72
539,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"At any rate, Mr. Martin felt his honour to be at stake, and he carried out his previous undertakings, and left the combine at the earliest moment. If the duty of £ 1 6 will keep out every machine, that will exactly carry out my view. As a protectionist, I desire to . Tariff. [REPRESENTATIVES.] see the work done here; but I also desire to do something for the farmers. If we make the duty low-if we cut it down by one-half-it will only become necessary for American and Canadian manufacturers to lower the quality of the machines in order to compete successfully with the Australian articles.",72
540,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Surely the honourable farmer. member does not think that the farmers are such fools?,73
541,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If we allow the combine to send in their machines, the faimers are such fools that, as in the United States, they will be compelled take any kind of machine or implement the combine chooses to give them. The farmers cannot help themselves, because, whenever competition is keen, shoddy goods are duced. The members of the American combine claim in their circular that they will become? have 90 per cent, of the world's trade, and that they will not be satisfied until they have the whole. Indeed, the members of the combine do not hesitate to say that necessary they are prepared to open neighthe bouring shops, even at a loss, in order drive out of business those who sell the machines of other firms. Honourable members who are opposed to the motion evidently do not desire to protect the farmer, whereas those who support the tion will really be the means of giving farmer a cheaper machine.",73
542,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member knows that machines are coming down price.,73
543,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"And I hope that will continue. If the honourable member were in business under the arrangement vided by the motion, he would, if he could, sell machines at a cheaper rate. It is down that the price cannot be raised withthere out the manufacturers losing the protection.",73
544,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is all a sham.,73

That does look as though protection raises prices.",73

547,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Without the duty the firm would not have been able to start Tariff. manufacturing. Some time ago I also visited the factory of Mr Forgan, at Crystal Brook. I found that he was manufacturing malleable cast-iron shares, such as used to cost 28s. per dozen, and selling them for 15s. per dozen. It would not appear from this that protection has the effect of increasing prices to the",73
548,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"What do the farmers say about it? Mr 'HUTCHISON - They are delighted with the shares. The firm find that their premises are not big enough for to them, and are extending them with the object of not only meeting the local demand, but of entering largely the export trade.",73
549,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the honourable promember mean that the more duty that is imposed the cheaper the protected article,73
550,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,There is a limit to all things. My contention is that the if more we encourage our local manufacturers greater our competition will be. and the to cheaper the articles produced will become.,73
551,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Do the wages depend upon the price of the article?,73
552,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Not necessarily. The experience of Messrs. Shearer Brothers mohas been the same as that of others enthe gaged in the iron trade. There has been a great falling off in business in some lines, but Messrs. Shearer Brothers have been in clever enough to invent a new kind of plough, and have taken up other business, thus enlarging their operations. We have been told that there has been a large inprocrease in the number of men employed in making harvesting machinery and agricullaid tural implements, and that, consequently, is no need for further protection. If , however, honourable members will look at the returns of the number of men enin the iron trade, they will find that in Victoria in the year 1901 the ema s against to 15,022 in 1904. It would appear from these figures that .there is room for considerable expansion of the industry. The honourable member for Grey, and others, have had a good deal to say about the natural protection afforded to our not manufacturers by the cost incurred in bringing to the Commonwealth the goods which they have to compete. But I would direct attention to the fact that our manufacturers have to bring their raw material from the old country, and have to pay freight not only upon that which is embodied in their manufactures, but also upon that which is cut to waste. I have discussed this question with some of those engaged in the iron industry, and they tell me that whilst it costs the smaller manufacturers perhaps 20 per cent, more for their raw material than has to be paid by those in a larger way of business, they all have to pay freight on their raw material, and that the cost to them is nearly as great as that incurred by importers in forwarding theirfinishedgoods to this market. Therefore, there is very little, if any, natural protection afforded to our manufacturers in the way indicated by the honourable member for Grey. Although. I am a high protectionist, and am very anxious to see manufacturing industries developed here, I thoroughly agree with the honourable member for Boothby that we ought to be very chary about giving further protection to our manufacturers unless they are prepared to carry out the pledges that they gave to us years ago. I remember very well being asked to join the Protectionist Association in South Australia. I refused to do so, because I had no faith in the employers. They sent out a manifesto, and invited the members of the Labour Party to join the association, stating that one of the planks of their platform was to protect the workman as well as his work. No sooner, however, had we returned a majoritv of protectionist candidates to the Federal Parliament, and thereby assisted in imposing protective duties, than the employers almost without exception used every means in their power to prevent anything from being done to improve the condition of the workers. I believe in protecting the farmer and the manufacturer, and also the artisans engaged in manufacturing occupations.",73
553,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,But to protect the worker and tax the farmer are two different things.,74
554,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not believe in taxing the farmer to the extent of making him pay more than his share of the cost of carrying on the Government of the country. I admit that the poor farmer is paying in some cases twenty times more than his share of taxation, as compared with those who hold large estates. We ay know the object that the honourable member for Lang had in view in proposing his amendment. thought that he would involve the members of the Labour Party in some little difficulty. But his amendment has not the merit of being even cunningly worded. I have tried to improve on his proposal, and as he is evidently anxious that the workmen shall be afforded some protection, I shall claim his assistance in carrying my amendment.",74
555,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is the honourable member's amendment cunninglv worded ?,74
556,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No . I believe that it is clearly worded and free from the ambiguity which characterizes the amendment of the honourable member for Lang, which would accomplish nothing. I am not wedded to the wording of the amendment which I propose to move at the proper time, and I shall be delighted if honourable members will assist me in improving it. I propose that the following words be inserted : Any manufacturer who fails to pay his workmen a fair and reasonable rate of wages shall pay excise equal to the duty on all dutiable agricultural machines and implements manufactured by him contained in the Schedule to the Customs Act. That means that if a manufacturer will not pay fair wages he will not derive any benefit from the duty, and I think that my proposal will commend itself to most honourable members. It may be necessary to introduce two Bills to give effect to my proposal, because one portion deals with Customs duties, and the other with Excise duties. I am entirely in sympathy with, the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay, except so far as he seeks to impose an Excise duty equivalent to only half the amount of the import, duty. All that we shall be called upon to do for the present will be to affirm the principle that the workmen should receive a share of the benefits of the protection granted to the industry. I believe that it is possible to protect the worker, and I agree with the honourable member, for South Sydney that provisions for the protection of the employees should be universally applied. We now have an opportunity presented to us to make a beginning, and we can afterwards extend the principle. As has been pointed out. there is an Arbitration Court' in New South Wales and in Western Australia, whilst in Victoria there are a number of Wages Boards.",74
557,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The more duties we impose, the-more necessary will Wages Boards become, because the more degraded does the position of the worker become. He Mr HUTCHISON - If the honourable and learned member chooses to make inquiries in Victoria, he will find that his theory does not work out in practice. It appears to me that, if honourable members are in favour of protecting the workmen, it will be sumcient for them to agree to an amendment such as I have suggested.",74
558,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But a fixed duty which is equivalent to an ad valorem rate of 40 per cent, would mean prohibition.",75
559,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not think so. In America a much higher duty than that was levied upon screws, but it did not vent Mr Chamberlain from beating the Americans. I am not sure that the same thing could not be done in regard to stripper-harvesters.",75
560,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But a duty of 25 per cent, is a very fair measure of protection to give to the local manufacturers.",75
561,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No . Last year 2,700 of these machines were manufactured in the Commonwealth, and about 1,700 were imported. I ask honourable members to consider the employment which the manufacture of those .1,700 machines would have afforded. I am sorry that we' cannot ascertain the exact cost of producing the stripper-harvester, so that we might know whether or not the farmer is being robbed. I do not asree with thi honoiable member for Wide Bay that, if we are going to protect the workers, we should impose an Excise of only half the amount of the Customs duty.",75
562,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Werriwa) [72.6] - Be fore I proceed to address the Committee, I think that we should have a quorum. [Quo/urn formed.] In September last I directed attention to the fact that it had been noised abroad that Mr MCKay and the Minister of Trade and Customs had entered into a combination, and that, as a result, efforts would be made to impose largely increased duties upon harvesters.",75
563,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I do not think that the honourable land learned member put the matter so nicely as that.,75
564,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I did not put it quite so stronglv as it was represented to me, but I put it quite strongly enough to direct attention to it. However, the House refused to believe that any such arrangement had been entered into, and cries of "" Shame !"" were directed against me for entertaining the opinion that such a remarkable Minister of Trade and Customs would - unknow n to Parliament - enter into' a combination with anybody. I think that all doubts as to the accuracy of my information have now been dispelled, because it is perfectly clear that such a combination was entered into. We had proof of that fact a short time after I made the statement in question, when the Minister, without rhyme or reason, and in defiance of all evidence, fixed the valuation of stripper-harvesters for Customs purposes at £ 6 5 . As a matter of fact, I have been informed that a certain manufacturer was able to attract into his business the capital that he required simply because he pre- represented that these machines could be produced for £ 2 8 or £ 2 9 . In the ordinary course of events, we ought to look for a steady reduction in the price, occasioned by improved methods of manufacture, and an increase in the number of machines produced. Indeed, I expect that within a few years the stripper-harvester of today will be almost entirely superseded. If competition were allowed to have full plav that would undoubtedly be the case. At the present time, all the winnowing and cleaning in connection with the harvester is done by driving direct from the wheels. That system must soon be given up, because.it will be possible to obtain little motor engines of three or four horse power, not costing more than £ TO .",75
565,Mr SALMON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Where from?,75
566,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I can assure the honourable member that I have seen small engines the manufacturing cost of which was not much in excess of that sum. But, by shutting out competition, we are preventing the free play of invention in respect to these machines. The consequence is that we shall soon find ourselves quite a dozen years behind other parts of the world in reference to agricultural machinery. We are absolutely placing a handicap upon what might otherwise be developed into a large and important industry. Personally, I may state as a man who does a good deal of farming that I think the stripper-harvester system rather a wasteful one. While so many farmers prefer it, it is no business of mine to say that they are wrong, but I consider nevertheless that they are working out their ground, and wasting their straw.",75
567,Mr SALMON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Fertilizer s make up for that.,75
568,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I quite admit that there is some force in that observation, and that the ground is not likely to be worked out so quicklv in consequence of the use of - fertilizers. Still, I consider that the system is a wasteful one. But as harvesters are used by so many farmers, we shall be doing a serious injurs' to the Commonwealth by restricting the free play of competition in connection with their manufacture. One great objection to the proposal of the Government is that the Mhv ister in charge of it has never offered a j f evidence in support of it. Personally, I never anticipated that he would make his reasons public. I knew that we should be left to the wild vapourings of those who, according to whether a policy is called protective or otherwise, alter their minds concerning it. If . for instance, the Treasurer had said that he desired to impose an additional duty on stripper-harvesters for the purpose of raising more revenue, many of those who now support the Government would have proclaimed that they were not in favour of taxing the farmer; but, because the proposal is made by the Minister of Trade and Customs, and is called protection, they are in favour of it. I do not propose to continue to address a Committee in which there is not a quorum. [Quorum formed.] I was much surprised in reading the report of the Tariff Commission to find that it recommended that extra taxation should be imposed in favour of a particular class of citizens. The Commission tells us that the competition to which the local manufacturers are subjected is too strong. But the proposal is simply to transfer that competition from the shoulders of the manufacturer to those of the producer. That is to say, the burden will be transferred to the shoulders of those who are less capable of bearing it than are the manufacturers. How can anything be called an industry unless it is self-supporting? A business which has to call upon citizens to help it cannot be called an industry; otherwise every charitable institution whose inmates earned a small percentage of the cost of their maintenance would be of great benefit to the community. I suppose that if a person were told that the inmates of a great charitable institution earned 50 per cent, of the cost of their maintenance, he would not say that it was a great industry. But talk of that institution as a manufactory, and tell the person, that 50 per cent, of the cost is needed to keep it going, and he will say at once, ""What a fine thing! If it needs more, let it be given."" Just as one varies the name, so does he vary the ideas of the person whom he is addressing. community can flourish unless its industries are self-supporting. If any branch of work has to call upon the citizens engaged in another branch to help it, then the sooner it is persuaded to give up the better it will be for the community. A person tittle should engage only in those industries which are natural to the country. So far from men like myself being termed foreign traders, we ought to be termed home traders, because we seek to establish in our midst only those industries which are natural %id self-supporting. To judge by their votes, a great many honourable members seem to think that an industry which by its very nature seems to show itself foreign to the country, seeing that it cannot support itself, is the very one which ought to be encouraged. I cannot conceive of anything being more ridiculous than a proposition of that sort. When the honourable member for Melbourne Ports was speaking, I noted the extraordinary contradictions in which he involved himself. In one part of his speech he said that the time of high prices was when the duty was off, and that the importers . then fixed enormously high prices on all articles. In a later part of his speech he said that the wages depended on the price of an article. If so, then it was a great shame, so far as the workers were concerned, to interfere with the times when there were no duties on the articles, because that clearly meant that wages were then very much higher. Within three or four minutes of making that remarkable statement, the honourable member said, in response to another interjection by me, that after a duty was put on, the price of the at tide really decreased. When I asked him if that was in consequence of the Tariff, he said, "" Yes."" Therefore, on his own showing, the only reason why he supports the imposition of a duty is to lower the wages of the workmen concerned in the production of the article. It is deplorable that honourable members are unable to see the absurdities in. which they involve themselves by putting forward such entirely different propositions. I hold that the proposed duty is absolutely unreasonable, and that, if passed, it will for ever remain as a scandal and a disgrace to the Prime Minister who consented to lend nimself to it. In the fag end of a session, and in a moribund House, no man with a sound knowledge of what parliamentary government ought No to be, would engage in such an undertaking. Weak we have always found the Prime Minister to be. His name stands for irresolution; but that he would do a thing which savours of political dishonesty as strongly as this proposal does, I did not anticipate. I thought that at least he would have sufficient resolution to resist the Minister of Trade and Customs, and not to be led by the nose by him to this extraordinary extent. His early education and training ought to have taught him that there are certain things which go to make up constitutional government, and that the introduction of a motion of this kind at the fag end of a session, when we are about to appeal to the country, is unprecedented. The mandate he got from the country at the last elecc tions was, if anything, a mandate for fiscal peace. He went to the country and asked to be returned on a declaration for fiscal peace; yet before the end of the three years' he is asking the House to agree to a proposal so tinged with suspicion that no one who has any acquaintance with the Minister of Trade and Customs believes that it is honestly and sincerely made in the interests of any but a particular manufacturer. We have heard a lot of talk about the new protection. There never was a greater amount of humbug talked than in that connection. On what does the rate of wages depend ? On the amount returned by the industries. Clearly, there can be no increase of wages in an Industry where the value of thel product is not equal to the cost of duction. Suppose that 30 per cent, of the value of a stripper-harvester is paid in wages. In America, Canada, and in Australia, too, I believe, despite what Mr. MCKav says, it is only about 21 per cent. ; but if it so pleases honourable members, I am willing to take the amount at £10. Are they aware that the cost of carrying, landing, and setting up a harvester here is £14. plus, of course, the duty of £8. It will be seen at once that .£22 is more than twice the amount which will have been paid out in wages for the manufacture of the machine. Even if the rates of wages now paid by the local manufacturers were doubled, and were equal to £22 per machine, they ought still to be-in a position to fairly compete with their American rivals. And yet it is proposed to add another £8 to the cost of plaeing an American machine on the Australian market, and so to bring it up to £30-almost the first cost of the Australian production. Various amendments Mr Conroy. have been foreshadowed, with a view of making it appear that the intention is to benefit the workers by imposing these duties. After all they are mere fads'. Unless the manufacturers are conducting semi-charitable institutions, their workmei.. are earning their wages at the present day. A business man cannot carry on unless his employees produce something more than he has to pay for their labour. In these circumstances, I consider that the employed are not called upon to bow down and worship the employers any more than the manufacturers are called upon to worship their workmen. How can I and other free traders be expected to call upon the rest of the community to furnish some part of the wages which the manufacturer of these machines has to pay? It is absurd that, at this stage of our civilization, we should actually have a body of men coming forward and saying that they are entitled to consideration, and that the rest of the community ought to be held by force of law, so that they may take out of their pockets something that they would not otherwise be able to obtain. No manufacturer ought to be decried. Much as Mr MCKay has been abused - I would not seek to hold him while a section of the community robbed him of that to which he was entitled. But one feels inclined to retaliate when one finds him perpetually lobbying with a view to having other people held for his benefit. proWe are continually calling upon one section of the workers to bear taxation, and to be held for the benefit of the manufacturer, and any manufacturer who has asked this Parliament to hold other people for his gain can offer no objection if these men appeal to us to say that he shall be held for their benefit. If a socialistic scheme were brought forward to deprive the manufacturers of their businesses on the ground that the work now carried on by them would still be performed, and the money would remain in the country it would not lie in their mouths to object. But honourable members, who, like myself, hold that no country can truly progress except by the strict observance of the principles of justice, would have to fight their case just as I am seeking to fight the case of those whom they are now endeavouring to plunder. The word ""plunder"" is an objectionable one to use; but I do not know of one that would more correctly describe their action. Some people assert that as the farmer is so stupid that he is always willing to bear taxation, we ought to let him bear it, but I disagree with that view. We shall not build up a nation by perpetually teaching the people to try to lean on some one else. A great deal of legislation introduced by the present Government has been based on the assumption that the great mass of the people are mere dumb driven brutes to be held for the benefit of any of their manufacturing friends who choose to make representations to them. I knew that the Min ister of Trade and Customs would come forward with these proposals, because I was aware that he was seeking funds for his election campaign, and would stop at nothing to secure help, and to make friends amongst the mammon of unrighteousness. Every one who knows his character is aware that I am putting the case very mildly indeed when I make this assertion. The Minister will seek what help he can, and, in return, will promise to assist vading the rights of other people. It is a matter of notoriety that one of his colleagues fled to escape trial, and how it is that the other has been spared that and other scandals no one understands. Proposals like this must excite anger and indignation.",75
569,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Ange r and indigation are not enough to convince.,78
570,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have stated the reasons which actuate me. No case has been made out by the Minister for the raising of the duty. The stripper-harvester industry, instead of being in a bad way, is flourishing, not one machine having been imported up to the present time, though, of course, it may be true that there are some on the high seas. This monstrous proposal is made in the interests of a very small section.",78
571,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Why does not the honourable and learned member advocate the nationalization of industries? Mr CONROiY - I should be willing to take their business from these two or three log-rollers, who are trying to rob others, and start a national workshop with it. They could not complain if Parliament meted out the same treatment to them as they wish to mete out to others. If large sections of the community are to be exploited for the benefit of small sections, there will be reason for the State controlling and managing industries. I do not object to State control, but hitherto State management has increased expense and reduced efficiency.",78
572,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"At Newport engines can be turned out in Government workshops more cheaply than anywhere else in the world, and yet an order is not given for them.",78
573,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I know that in New South Wales the supervision of the Government Architect's Department costs 25 per cent., and is not so good as that of private architects, who charge 5 per cent., and honourable members are acquainted with the scandals which have occurred in connection with the land administration there. If the honourable member for Melbourne was right, it would be infinitely better in many instances to allow the State to step in than for the mass of people to continue to be exploited for the benefit of the few. If that happened, the Minister would notintroduce a proposal of this kind, and we in in- should not be beset by a body of logrollers. The danger is that men may cease to try to be captains of industry, and will try to become captains of lobbyism, looking for success to increased taxation instead of to improved methods. Those who spend their time in lobbying must mismanage their businesses, because they have not opportunities for proper control. I hope that it will come about that those who try to get assistance from the State will in return be preyed upon by others. One of those whom it is proposed to benefit is making an income of about .£30,000 a year, and honourable members are therefore falling down in their haste to bend before this great manufacturing lord. The old spirit of servility must be strong in many people as the result of centuries of training. The grovelling spirit which made the serf, attached to the soil, and receiving the smallest pittance, kneel and cringe before his landlord, still exists"", and honourable members are showing a subserviency which might be expected from such a man. The serf, however, had the excuse of ignorance, while honourable members have not. Directly a big manufacturer's name is mentioned, they rush to make laws compelling the public and the workers to contribute out of their earnings to his prosperity. Would the Ministry dare to propose that the money required to keep the manufacturers going should be obtained by means of direct taxation? If that were proposed, the Minister would bend to whichever party was the wealthier, and used its influence in the most suitable manner. These proposals are scandalous.",78
574,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable learned member's speech is scandalous. When is he going to finish?,79
575,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"When the honourable member learns to be honest, and ceases to cringe to the big manufacturers. On what principle can such a proposal as that new before us be defended? Who is to pay the duty? The farmers. I suppose we shall be told that in Canada and America wages are so low as to make competition by Australian manufacturers impossible; and it is a remarkable fact that both America and Canada are protectionist countries. Is it sought to impose the proposed duties in order to drag our workmen down to the - level of the American and Canadian workmen? What is the use of addressing Honourable members! when there is no evidence of any consideration for the interests of the great mass of the people? It would seem that the lobbying and log-rolling, so successful with the Minister, has been extended to some other honourable members. The people who would support such a proposal as that before us deserve all that they get, especially the people of the Hume, who elect such a representative. If those people think that the proposed taxation will increase the amount of wheat they get off their farms, we can only pity their standard of intelligence.",79
576,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member has been most insulting for some time past.,79
577,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If any statement has been ma'de to which the Minister Trade and Customs takes exception, I am sure the honourable member for Werriwa will withdraw it. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The honourable member for Werriwa has been insulting assertion. me for the last hour, and I am not going to tolerate his impudence",79
578,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If anything of an insulting nature has been said, I have heard it ; but if the Minister of Trade Customs takes exception to any remark, on the price. and he calls my attention to it, I shall see that it is withdrawn.",79
579,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Probably a more scandalous and disreputable introduction of a Tariff proposal was never made any Legislature in the world. There have beer, many charges made against politiyet, cians in America, .but never was any Tariff proposal introduced that and The CHAIRMAN - Will the honourable memberdiscuss the item before the Chair?",79
580,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I was discussing the item, and saying that never, in my opinion, even in America, except just after 1883, under very gross circumstances, was a proposal introduced so clouded with suspicion as this for an extra duty on harvesters.",79
581,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I rise to a point of order. Is the honourable member for Werriwa in order in reflecting by inference, innuendo, or direct charge, on the conduct of honourable members? The honourable member has said that honourable members have been guilty of log-rolling and lobbying, and of conduct more like that of felons than of honest citizens and straightforward men. My point of order is that the honourable member's language is unbecoming and ungentlemanly, and ought not to be tolerated.",79
582,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member for Werriwa would not be in order in imputing unworthy motives to the Minister or any other honourable member in connection with the proposal before the Chair. I hope that the honourable member will confine his remarks to the item.,79
583,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I was pointing out that the introduction of this proposal Has been clouded with many circumstances on which I do not - desire to dwell any longer. As an instance of the sort of argument used in support of the proposal, we had of the honourable member for Melbourne, before he chose to run out of the Chamber, saying that the rate of wages depends upon the price of the article.",79
584,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I never made such an,79
585,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member said that the article would have to be produced at so low a price that the work not could not be carried on here; and surely and that means that the rate of wages depends,79
586,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I never said such a thing.,79
587,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"A m I to take it that the honourable member said that the rate in of wages does not depend on the price? The honourable member did state that, and within five minutes, he asserted that the imposition of the duty would decrease the price of the article. Is the honourable member voting for the increased duty in order to enable the manufacturer to get cheaper labour? The argument presented by the theorists upon protectionis practically that under that system men do not get so much in exchange for their labour, and consequently have to work at lower rates of wages. Therefore, within a very short time, we shall have men clamouring for a further increase of the duty, in order that employment may be provided for them. Of course, the wages in any industry will not fall below a certain point, because, after all, they will be determined by the rates prevailing in the great natural industries of the country. The industry immediately under discussion should be a natural industry, and should be able to stand upon its own merits. But we are told that it is not able to do so, and, therefore, the general community is being called upon to bear an additional burden in order that it may be assisted. Why should the farmer be taxed to any greater extent than at present? When we consider the small number of men engaged in the agricultural implement industry. it would be preferable for us to pay them their wages without any more ado, and leave the farmers free to make their purchases under conditions of free competition rather than to impose prohibitive duties.",79
588,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The local manufacturers have reduced the price of their machines.,80
589,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Because the price has been falling everywhere, owing to the improved methods of production. If , in the open market, a manufacturer can obtain £100 for a machine which cost him only £30, why should he be subject to any restrictions as to the profit he should receive Any manufacturer is entitled to big profits if he fairly earns them, and I have no sympathy with the cry that has been raised against the big profits made by manufacturers.",80
590,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Does the honourable and learned member believe in 150 per cent, profit ?",80
591,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I believe rn the amount of profit that you can induce others to give vou. If I could grow a bushel of wheat for is., and I could induce anv one to give me ios. for it, I should have no hesitation in taking the money. Nor would any other man decline to take advantage of all the profit that he could derive. When, however, the manufacturers come along and - I say, "" Not only are we making a big profit out of you, but we intend to compel you to purchase only from us."" a different principle is brought into play.",80
592,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They do not compel purchasers to buy from them.,80
593,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If all competition is shut out, the local manufacturers will, in effect, be compelling the farmers of the Commonwealth to buv their goods.",80
594,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"There are already ten or twelve local manufacturers of harvesting machinery, and there is nothing to prevent twenty more from! engaging, in the industry.",80
595,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"There is not a sufficient demand to justify such a large addition to the ranks of the manufacturers, and I think that before very long the whole industry will pass into the hands of two or three big firms. Naturally a weeding out process will be engaged in by the manufacturers themselves, and those who employ the best machinery and the best methods of production must go to the front. It is a pitv that they waste time in looking to Parliament for aid, instead of relying upon their own enterprise and energy. They now enjoy natural protection to the extent of £ 1 4 in the way of import charges, and of £ 8 in the form of duties. This represents a total of £ 2 2 per machine, or more than double the amount of their outlay for wages. Yet we are being asked to grant them further protection. I have to send my wheat to the other side of the world, where I cannot be protected against outside competition, and yet I am being called upon to bear, not only mv own burden, but those of the implement manufacturers. It seems to me to be a monstrous thing that an im? portant proposal such as this should be submitted at this stage of the session. However, it is apparently of no use to address a moribund Parliament. I have already expressed my opinion on the conduct of the Minister. If there be any honourable member who is so weak as to retain any remnant of respect for him",80
596,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Order ! The honourable member must not speak in disrespectful terms of other honourable members.,80
597,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It is utterly opposed to the principle of sound government to attempt to force an important proposal of this kind through at this stage of the session. The tendency of such'action is to bring the Administration into ridicule and disgrace. I believe that even if I had been a protectionist I should have had sufficient respect for the forms of government to have resented the introduction of such a proposal in the last days of the Parliament, when full and free discussion is impossible. Honourable members are so tired that they do not even attend in the House, and it is with difficulty that a quorum is maintained. All arguments are useless, because many honourable members prefer to know nothing about the discussion that is proceeding, and are content to vote blindly, and at the dictation of their leaders. Honourable members are by their actions imbuing the people with a spirit of selfishness, and are setting them an example which is calculated to induce them to think that the best thing . for them to do is to make as much as they can out of their fellow men. We may depend upon it that that is not the soundest principle to follow. If we inculcate a spirit of selfishness in the people, the result must always be disastrous.",80
598,Mr SALMON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I thought that the honourable and learned member was an individualist ?,81
599,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is not that asserting individualism ?,81
600,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Order ! Will the honourable and learned member confine his remarks to the proposal before the Chair?,81
601,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I was merely pointing out that the effect of levying an increased duty upon harvesters would be to cultivate a selfish spirit amongst the people- a spirit which would be injurious to the national character, and which would probably take generations to wipe out, if, indeed, it did not wipe out the people.",81
602,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They have not been wiped out in America.,81

605,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"They have not one-fourth of the trade that they ought to possess. The vice of selfishness is so strongly ingrained in the people of America that, struggle as they will, they cannot get away from it. America is paying most bitterly for her mistake in the corruption and degradation of all her self-governing institutions, municipal and parliamentary. We shall bring about a similar state of things in Australia unless we are extremely careful. If there is one thing at which statesmen should aim it is the formation of national character, and we cannot hope to develop that by destroying individual independence. The best and safest way to govern a people is to insure that the spirit of justice shall prevail amongst them.",81
606,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Canobolas) [1.17] When Tariff matters were under consideration in the first Commonwealth Parliament honourable members were interviewed by quite a number of persons, with various interests at stake, and statements were made to them which, as they multiplied, became of a most contradictory character. Upon investigation, it was found that many of those statements represented only half the truth. To-night, however, we are considering the Government proposals, after an exhaustive investigation into Tariff maiters has been conducted by a Commission which was specially appointed for the purpose. My complaint is that we are asked to deal with these questions at the fag end of the session. The proposals of the Government were only brought forward the day before yesterday, and we were asked to vote upon them last night, although the Government, after consideration, decided not to press for a division then. I have before me a bulky volume containing a report of the evidence elicited by the Tariff Commission upon the question of the manufacture of stripper-harvesters. I will undertake to say that even a smart reader would not be able to wade through that volume, and to do the subject anything like justice, within the period in which we have been asked to dispose of this question. However, we have no choice in this respect, and we have to avail ourselves of the opportunities presented to us. The Government proposes that a specific duty of £ 1 6 each shall be placed on stripper harvesters, and one of £ 8 on strippers, whilst metal parts shall pay duty at the rate of 2^d. per lb. In addition, the protectionist portion of the Commission, headed by their able Chairman, the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, submit proposals which they contend are based upon the evidence. Thirdly, we have the recommendations of the free-trade members of the Commission. Such are the different standards from which we are invited to consider this question. I also invite the Committee to recollect that there are three interests represented. There is the manufacturing interest-that of the men who have invested their capital in the industry. Next we have the workmen, who sell their labour to those engaged in manufacturing harvesters. Thirdly we have the large body of farmers, who use the machines. We must endeavour to do even-handed justice in the decision at which we arrive. Looking at the matter from the manufacturing stand-point, I find that there are twenty-four' firms in the monwealth engaged in the manufacture of harvesters, strippers, and similar machinery. There are sixteen firms in Victoria, five in New South Wales, and three in South Australia. , They are enumerated in the Commission's report. There is no need to enter into details. With respect to the workers engaged in the industry, the evidence given before the Commission shows that Mr MCKay estimated 2,000 to be the number of workers employed. But when confronted with Mr. Coghlan's statistics, he seemed to doubt the information upon which he came to his conclusion. According to Coghlan, about 1,800 persons are engaged in making agricultural machinery throughout the Commonwealth. Thirdly, according to one of the witnesses, it is estimated that there are 250,000 or 260,000 farmers in Australia. Those are the interests affected. I should like to refer on this question to a point made by the honourable member for Melbourne Forts. He quoted figures concerning the State of New South Wales, comparing it with Victoria, and showing that a larger number of workmen are engaged in the industry in this State than in that from which I come. He attributed that to the fact that Victoria enjoyed the blessings of protection for a longer period than New South Wales has done.",81
607,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I took the Tariff Commission's report.,82
608,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I presume that the Commission founded its statement upon Mr. Coghlan's statistics. The latest returns for Victoria show that 1,114 working men were engaged in the industry in this State, whilst in New South Wales there were 56. That was the proportion quoted by the honourable member as bearing out his contention. But if he will consult the table relating to metal workers, he will find that it throws quite a different light upon the question.",82
609,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Mr Coghlan wrote to me a private letter, which I can show to the honourable member, stating that the figures in that table include the smelters in Broken Hill, numbering 2,000.",82
610,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"He gives the number of metal workers and machine workers in New South Wales as 12,800, and the number in Victoria, calculated upon the same basis, as 10,250. He also points out that, in respect of agricultural implement makers, he takes only those directly engaged in that industry, Com- whereas in New South Wales the largest output of agricultural implements comes from establishments that are also engaged in other forms of manufacture.",82
611,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Mr Coghlan, in a letter to me, analyzes his own figures. He sent - me a list, which I shall be pleased to show to the honourable member, proving conclusively that he is wrong. Mi. BROWN - Coghla n says, in his latest statistics, that the number of hands set out as employed in the manufacture of agricultural implements in New South Wales is only .56. A few establishments devote themselves entirely td this business, the manufacture of implements being usually associated with iron workers generally. He plainly indicates that he limits his table in this connection to those who are specifically engaged in the manufacture of implements. If honourable members wish to ascertain the number of men engaged in the manufacture of agricultural implements they must find them among the 12,800 workers engaged in the manufacture of metals and machinery as against the 10,250 similar workers in Victoria. I. do not think that, on the figures he quoted, has the honourable member for Melbourne Ports did justice to his case; it looks better than it really is. The manufacturers claim that they should jeceive special consideration at the hands of the State because they have been subject to piracy by competing firms outside the Commonwealth. They allege that they have to submit to unfair competition in the form of dumping and so forth, and for this reason they plead that they are entitled to an increased duty. They charge the American manufacturers with having completely pirated their article. I do not know that there is anything very strange or striking in that. It is not an unusual thing for a manufacturing company in one country to use the products of the inventive genius of other countries. A charge of piracy might with equal force be made against the Australian manufacturer of agricultural implements, unless they are going to very materially limit the number of implements which they are engaged in making. As a matter of fact, the report of the Tariff Commission shows that the stripper-harvester is only the perfection of an idea which originated in the days of the Gauls, while the idea of the winnower was, it is said, brought from China. In regain:! to dumping, we have heard a great deal about the difficulties which were besetting our manufacturers from the fact that they were subject to that unfair form of competition. The House was induced to pass a special measure empowering the Minister of Trade and .Customs to prevent any line of manufacture being placed upon our market on unfair terms and conditions. If it is as effective as the Government claim that it will be, there does not seem to' be such strong ground for asking for this increased consideration as there might otherwise have been. Apparently, our manufacturers want not only the protection of the anti-dumping legislation, but also an increased duty to the extent of £2.5 per machine. Of course, it is only natural that they should endeavour to get all the concessions they can secure. They grind out their profits between the upper and the nether millstones - between their own workers on the one side, and the farmers on the other. The more they can squeeze out of the farmers, and the more completely they can reduce the wages of the lower workers, the larger will be their profits. If they can induce the Parliament on the one hand to disregard the amount of wages which they are to pay, and not to enforce the decisions of Arbitration Courts or Wages Boatds with respect to their industry, and on the other hand to shut out all outside competition, first by anti-dumping legislation, and secondly by a prohibitive duty of £25 per machine, they will be in a position to secure a larger dustry. return from those who are compelled to use their machines, or go without them. The Parliament will be wise to look at the matter not purely from the manufacturer's stand-point, but from the stand-point of the workmen in the manufactories, and of the farmers. What is the position as indicated by the farmers? Evidence was given on their behalf before the Commission, and it did not come from free-trade New South Wales. but from protected Victoria. A number of men interested themselves to the extent of collecting a considerable amount of information, selecting their representatives, and enabling them to appear before Mr Brown. the Commission. In this very bulky report in my hand, it is stated that first of t all, the Sr. Arnaud Agricultural Society decided to make a move in the direction of placing the views of their farmers before the Commission. A circular letter was sent out to seventy farmers' societies. Out of that number, fifty societies replied. Four societies declined to have anything to do with the movement, as it was outside their rules, and one society called a public meeting to deal with it. The societies, whose names are given in the report, were practically unanimous in endeavouring to oppose the proposed increase in the duties on implements and manures. As the result of this, a meeting was held in Melbourne during Show week, to deal with the whole question. The secretary, when giving evidence before the Tariff Commission, said that something like 250 delegates from farmers' societies attended this meeting, at which the following motion, moved by Mr J. C. Smith, of St. Arnaud, was carried unanimously: That representatives be appointed to give evidence before the Tariff Commission, protesting against any further duty on agricultural implements or machinery, or on fertilizers. The witnesses selected for this purpose were Mr J. C. Smith, Mr James McGregor, Mr D. MCLennan, and Mr C. Nowotna, representing the Wimmera, the Mallee, the Goulburn Valley, and other agricultural districts in Victoria. One of these gentlemen, Mr D. MCLennan, summed up the attitude of the farmers in the following concise terms: 1. That the present duty of I2£ per cent, on agricultural machinery, in addition to natural protection, is amply sumcient for the success and development of the agricultural implement in2. Our manufacturers of harvesters, being able to compete in the world's markets, ought and can do so in their own. 3. Prohibitive duties on harvesters will result in the establishment of a colonial trust, the seeds of which have already been sown. 4. May result in the International Harvester Company commencing operations within the Commonwealth. 5. Having to sell our products in the open markets of the world against all forms and conditions of labour and life,, and at the world's lowest prices, we claim the reasonable right to be allowed to buy in the markets in which we sell. 6. Accordingly, to enact legislation which will compel us to buy in any particular market is treating us unfairly. 7. If harvester manufacturers receive a monopoly of colonial markets by the imposition of prohibitive duties, then other manufacturers have the right to claim similar consideration, and the farmers also have then a perfect right to claim that they be assisted by legislation, so that they may be able to put an artificial price on their products. S. The declarations of the local manufacturers, that the harvester importers will entirely secure the colonial trade, can only be regarded as the interested prophecy of interested parties. They ask the farmers, in the event of a ^25 duty being imposed, to trust them that they will not increase prices. We return the courtesy, and ask them that should the duty not be increased, to trust us to stand by them so long as they treat us fairly. n. The farmers view with apprehension and recognise the danger of monopolies, whether from at home or from abroad, and urge the necessity of drastic anti-trust legislation by the Federal Parliament against all trusts and combines, no matter who they are, or where they come from. 10. We further recognise that the continued prosperity and development of the harvester trade, and the agricultural implement trade generally, will be more speedily and successfully accomplished by the judicious encouragement of the settlement of the people on the land in increased numbers, rather than in increasing the numbers of the already overcrowded cities. I reiterate the statement that this evidence was given, not as the result of a hole-andcorner meeting, but as the outcome of a conference of some 250 delegates of farmers' societies. In answer to the contention that the farmers receive no quid pro quo for these increased duties, the honourable member for Kennedy has urged that he receives advantages in other directions; that railways and roads are constructed for his benefit, and that in many other ways Government moneys are expended to assist him. I would point out that such provision is made, not for the farmers alone, but for the advantage of the community generally. A railway is just as convenient to the man who wishes to find buyers for his machines in the country as it is for the farmer who desires to send his wheat to the sea-board. Whilst the farmer is asked to purchase his machinery in a protected market, hedged round by artificial restrictions, which confer no benefit upon him. he has to sell his produce in the open markets of the world.",82
612,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I think we ought have a Quorum. [Quorum formed.],84
613,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The advantages to which the honourable member for Moira referred are enjoyed, not by the farmers alone, but by the whole communitv, and cannot be made a justification for increasing the burdens of the agriculturists. The honourable and learned member for Corinella had something to say about the competition of cheap labour. The competition in connection with harvesters is competition with the United States and Canada, countries which are extolled by protectionists as great examples of what can be achieved by protection. Yet, when we are brought into competition with those countries, we hear of their pauper labour. Some explanation is needed to reconcile the two positions. Perhaps No. 66 Bourke-street could afford it.",84
614,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"We say that, to "" cut in , "" the foreign manufacturers put their machines on the market at prices less than they charge in their own country.",84
615,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Our farmers have to sell their produce, not in a protected market, but in Great Britain, where they are called upon to face the competition of the world. During the last two years'the export of wheat from the Commonwealth has amounted to 70,836,000 bushels, valued at £ 1 1 , 4 0 1 , 0 0 0 ; but in 1903 our imports exceeded our exports by 10,675,000 bushels, valued at £2,277,000. At the time many of us fought hard for the remission of the grain duties, in the interests of the pastoral and agricultural industry, to enable cheap fodder to be obtained for the stock, which were dying from the drought. In 1902-3 the Government obtained £ 5 9 7 , 0 0 0 from these duties, and in 1903-4, £ 2 6 5 , 0 0 0 odd, an increase in the two years of about £ 8 6 2 , 0 0 0, whereas the imports for the current year are estimated to return only about £ 2 9 , 0 0 0. Did the money go into the pockets of the farmers? I undertake to say that it did not. Those who benefited were the importers, to whom the protectionists profess to be so antagonistic-the men possessed of large capital, who were able to shut out competition. They were the persons able to force up prices, and, instead of this so-called protection being a benefit to the farmer, it was to him, as to the whole consuming community, a distinct disadvantage . and loss. Under the conditions which prevailed in 1901-2-3, it is only possible for any taxation of the kind to be a detriment to the farming into dustry; and it was for this reason that the protectionist farmers of Victoria asked this Parliament to consider the question of the duties on their implements, and to safeguard their interests, not only from outside monopolies, but from the monopoly within their own border. We have had recently presented to us a return showing the extent of the importation of these machines into the Commonwealth, and we find that in 1905 the number sent from Canada was 1,000, while the number from other places was 730, making a total of 1,730. That was the importation over which the scare was raised about killing Australian industry. How was the importation made possible? During the drought of 1902-3, when the farmers discovered there would be no wheat returned, they cancelled their orders for the machines, with the result that the Australian manufacturers reduced the output or closed their establishments. It happened that the next year there was an exceptionally large yield, and the farmers, who had to have their machines at short notice, could not wait until they were locally manufactured, and had to buy the readv-made article from outside firms. This phase of the question is dealt with in the evidence of Mr J. C. Smith before the Tariff Commission. That gentleman said I know several have bought imported harvesters simply because they could not get the local article. In my own case, I ordered a harvester, and found I could not get it until 20th December. Now, as you know, the harvest is pretty well advanced in our district by the 20th December, but I went on with the ordinary stripper until I got the implement. Some of my neighbours could not get one, even as earh' as the 20th December, and, of course, they had to take the Massey-Harris machine simply because the local manufacturers had no stocks to supply them. That is the last harvest twelve months-the harvest before this. That was the explanation given by a farmer of the big importation of those machines. Apparently, the local manufacturers were afraid to invest their money in turning out sufficient stock to meet possible demands, whereas outside firms, assuming that the crop of the succeeding year might be favourable, made the necessary provision. That view of the position is borne out, to some extent, by further particulars contained in the return. It appears that during 1905 some 2,700 stripper-harvesters were produced in the Commonwealth, and that during the first five months of 1906 the importation fell of f . In the earlier part of this year there was no importation at all from outside sources; on the other hand, the Australian manufacturers have started to export. It would appear that what Australian manufacturers cannot do in their own country they are able to do elsewhere-that, while they cannot successfully compete with American and Canadian manufacturers within the Commonwealth, Mr Brown. they can compete with those manufacturers at the latter's own doors, t do not know whether this export business may not be an instance of that dumping which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports tells us is one of the objections to free importation. The return to which I have more than once referred informs us' that during 1905 some 418 machines were exported, while during the past six months 484 have been sent abroad. This would seem to indicate that the opening for exportation is extending. Of the machines exported last year, 389 went to Argentine, while during the first six months of this year 445 have gone to that part of the world.",84
616,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That .is because this is a ""strangled industry.""",85
617,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It seems to me that a number of industries could well afford to undergo such strangulation. The countries to which the machines were exported were Algeria, Argentine, Canada, Cape Colony, Italy, and Uruguay.",85
618,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The machines were only sent as samples to Canada, because in that country harvesters are not used.",85
619,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I always understood that the sample machines were taken out to Canada some years ago, when the idea was pirated. It would seem, however, that the pirating is. still going on.",85
620,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"About ten machines were sent to Canada, but the climate there does not permit of them being used for harvesting grain.",85
621,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The return shows that during the past six months eighteen of these machines have been sent to Canada. These facts seem to require some explanation. The manufacturers say that they require a heavy duty to enable them to withstand competition within the Commonwealth, and yet they are able to hold their own in markets which are more easily accessible to their rivals. It is fair to assume that the export trade carried on by the local manufacturers is a profitable one, and therefore they should be in a position to make a great deal more out of the sales of their machines within the Commonwealth. Our producers have to send their commodities to parts beyond the Commonwealth, and enter into compeition with the producers of other countries who pay lower rates of wages, and enjoy many other advantages. Our farmers have to purchase their machinery in a protected market, and are asked to trust the manufacturers to protect them against combinations and exorbitartt charges. The farmers,- however, say, "" Give us an open market, and trust us to purchase our machines from you at reasonable prices."" If the manufacturers are not prepared to trust the farmers to deal fairly with them, I do not see how they can reasonably ask the farmers to place reliance in their good faith. I am pleased to notice that the protectionists have at last realized that it is not wise to look merely to the interests of the manufacturer. At one time it was considered sufficient to assist the manufacturer, and trust him to deal fairly with his workmen and the consumers. Now, however, it is considered necessary, whilst giving the manufacturer a certain amount of protection, to stipulate that he shall not charge the consumer more than a certain price, and that he shall share with his employees the advantage conferred by the protective duty. nexion I consider that the Tariff Commission have very substantial grounds for the position they have taken up. In the first place, we find that the local manufacturers were induced to enter into a combination with the importing firms, with the object of increasing prices, and the result was that the cost of the stripper-harvester to the farmer advanced from £ 7 0 to £81. For some time one of the manufacturing firms - Messrs. Martin and Company, of South Australia held aloof from the combination, but eventually one of the partners attended a meeting, and, against the wishes of his colleagues, committed his firm to joining in the arrangement into which the other manufacturers had entered. That firm took the first opportunity to withdraw from the combination, and shortly afterwards the importers took umbrage at the action of ' the local manufacturers in endeavouring to secure the imposition of increased import duties, and the combination was broken up. It is thus apparent that the consumers should be specially safeguarded against the results of any similar operations in the future. I have a very strong admiration for the way in which Messrs. MCKay Bros, have brought their machines to the front. I do not wish to be harsh in my criticism of that firm. I simply select it because of the material it affords me to illustrate the way in which the workers'; have been dealt with by manufacturers engaged in this industry. I find that some years ago when Mr MCKay was located at Ballarat, an effort was made to secure the establishment of a working man's union there. With that object in view, Mr Laidlaw, a representative of the Agricultural Implement Makers' Union, in Melbourne, visited Ballarat in 1901. As the result of his visit, there was a conference between the employees of the factory at Ballarat and Messrs. H . V. and G. MCKay, in the lopal Town Hall, for the purpose of deciding whether the industry should be brought under the operation of the Victorian Factories Act. At that representative gathering of employees, Mr H . V. MCKay is reported to have saidHe thought the existence of the Board would be detrimental to the trade. He wanted to impress upon them the necessity of being allowed to conduct his own business as he pleased. The employees should weigh well any action they might take, so as not to clog the wheels of what was now a thriving business. He trusted the men would return the confidence he had always In this con- placed in them. According to his statement, he did not view the establishment of a Wages Board with any degree of favour. In the first place, he wished to be allowed to conduct his business in his own way, and in the second he warned his employees that the establishment of a Wages Board would clog the wheels of a thriving business. At the same meeting, Mr G. MCKay, who said that he was the paymaster of the firm, stated :One effect of the trade being brought under the Act would be that improved labour saving machinery would have to be obtained, and this would mean the displacement of many hands. He was of opinion that the creation of Wages Board trades should be discouraged. They should seriously consider what they did, as it would affect their own as well as the firm's interests. Despite these strong representations, a ballot was taken, which resulted in n o of the workmen voting for the establishment of a Wages Board, and fifteen against it. After some considerable agitation, the ironmoulders--onl y a section of the workers engaged in the industry-were brought under the operation of a Wages Board. The Board was gazetted in October, 1904. It fixed the maximum wages for ironmoulders of the best class at 60s. per week, and the minimum at 54s. The wages of moulders' labourers were fixed at 38s. The question of improvers was dealt with as follows:-On e improver was allowed to every two journeymen or fraction thereof employed in the trade or business, an ironmoulder receiving not less than 8s. per day if employed upon work other than pipe moulding or work incidental thereto. The improvers were to receive during the first year 5s. per week of 48 hours, for the second year 7s. 6d. per week, for the third year ios., for the fourth year 12s. 6d., for the fifth year 15s., for the sixth year 20s., for the seventh year 25s., and thereafter the minimum wage. As soon as this decision was gazetted, the Sunshine Harvester Works at Ballarat were closed, and both the Argus and Age newspapers stated that the reason underlying this action was the operation of the Wages Board system. As a result of that statement that section of the Factories Act came in for a good deal of adverse criticism. In the newspapers, Mr MCKay bitterly complained that he had not been given notice of the intention to' enforce the Wages Board provision at Ballarat. But the point which I desire to emphasize is that whilst the Sunshine Harvester Company was objecting to the Wages Board system, the firms who were engaged in the industry in Melbourne had to conform to the conditions prescribed by the Wages Board, and to enter into competition with that company. In response to this complaint by Mr. MCKay, the Argus, on 8th October, published an interview with Mr Harrison Ord, the Chief Inspector of Factories in Victoria, who saidNo complaint had reached the Minister, no concession in the way of extension of time was asked for, and no protest was lodged against the enforcement of ihe determination. Mr Ord says further that the Department is at a loss to understand why a leading manufacturer who has always been credited with having paid a fair rate of wage, could possibly be injured by a determination which, as a fact, has merely adopted the rate previously generally paid in the trade. If the determination was so injurious, Mr Ord thinks the Minister might have been approached, or the Industrial Appeal Court invoked to remedy the wrong. Country firms were represented on the Board that gave this decision, and the very proposal to which Mr MCKay objected emanated, not from an employee, but from the employers. I find, on reference to the Age of the 12th October, 1904, that a large deputation waited upon the Minister of Labour. Sir Samuel Gillott. with respect to the decision of the Wages Board. It was stated that 450 meni were affected by the closing of the Sunshine Harvester works. The following conversation is reported to have taken place: The Minister - How many adults are affected ? Mr Kerr - I am not prepared to say. It affects about twenty ironmoulders. Mr Brown. The Minister - And how many are there in Victoria ? Mr Harrison Ord - About 900. Mr Kerr - Eve n supposing that myself and others do go to work at the Braybrook establishment, it means that thirtv or forty of us have to break up our homes in Ballarat. ' In this connection, Mr MCKay addressed a communication to the Minister himself. Writing on the 13th October, 1904, to the Chief Secretary, with reference to the effect of the Wages Board decision, he saidWith reference to the application of the Wages Board conditions to the iron moulding, steel moulding, and malleable iron departments of the , ! Sunshine"" Harvester works, I would respectfully point out that in consequence of the Act I am prevented from making any use of this very costly part of my Ballarat factory. At considerable expense I have arranged for a temporary supply of castings from my factory in Braybrook. I would respectfully request that something be promptly done to remove the embargo of Wages Board conditions from the implement and harvester business. I further request that if this cannot be done at once you will give me an assurance that the Wages Board conditions will not come into operation at the factory in Braybrook. If you will do that I am prepared to considerably extend the factory, and will instal some more costlv machinery, while if there is any chance of the Wages Board conditions being applied there I do not feel justified in spending the money. As this whole matter involves a most serious question, I would respectfully urge that it receive your early and earnest consideration. I am, Sir, yours respectfully, (Sgd.) H . V. MCKAY. That indicates the attitude taken up by the MCKay firm with respect to Wages Boards. I find from the Argus of the 8th October that Mr MCKay stated that a number of unionists had waited on him to express their sympathy with him in - his attempt to remove his establishment from under the Wages Board. Here-we have it stated that a number of working men who were to be benefited by the decision of the Wages Board, whose conditions were to be improved, and whose pay was to be increased, actually came forward and asked that no benefit should be given to them. The matter came up for discussion at the Trades Hall, Melbourne, and the Argus report savsThe matter was mentioned at a meeting of the Trades and Labour Council in the evening during a conversational discussion, and the members said that investigation into the wages paid by the firm would prove astounding. The carpenters engaged at the works were classed as agricultural implement makers, and they received is. per day less than the amount they were entitled to. It was also alleged that the moulding department would be closed permanently, and in consequence sixteen men would leave for Braybrook next week. Eventually it was decided to write to the Australian Workers' Union there, and ask that steps be taken to organize the branches of the trade affected by the establishment of the works. That indicates the action taken by Mr. MCKay for the purpose of getting outside the Wages Board. In connection with phase of the question, an old employee"" of the Sunshine Harvester works, Mr Weickus hardt, gave some evidence before the Tariff Commission. I advise honourable members who wish to be seized of the position of mer, affairs to look at that evidence. First of all he gave evidence that he was employed at the factory for a considerable time in the capacity of manager. He stated the smith's conditions which obtained there in respect of the wages paid, and the number of youths employed. His evidence was re30s.; butted by Mr Bult, the manager, and Mr. Porteous, a carpenter, who claimed to recreased present the working men. If honourable members will look at his evidence they will observe that Mr Weickhardt did not apyou pear before the Commission as an educated wages. man. His statement was put in a very crude form-the material he had, if handled  think, have been used in a very strong emphatic manner. Whilst nothing can said about the form in which Mr Bult's statement was made, still, when it came be sifted, there was something wanting. Mr Bult, who apparently was posing as the manager of the firm, possessed very little knowledge of what was going on the factory. He could not give the numevidence ber of men employed there, or the wages supposed to be paid-matter s which cermen tainly ought to be known to any man emThev ployed in his capacity. So far as one 'judge, the Sunshine Harvester Works would need to look elsewhere for a competent manager if they wish to proceed on lines. If we turn to the evidence Porteous, the carpenter, who represented working men, it will be found that his duction would do credit to a very well cated man. In fact, it seems to indicate that the firm are throwing away a very useful servant when they employ such talented man in the capacity of a carspecting penter.",85
622,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the honourable member imply that there are no talented carof fourteen. penters ? [MS],88
623,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,No ; I draw attention to the great difference between the two men.,88

625,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not know whether Mr Weickhardt is a foreigner or not. But this this is what he said on page 1826Now, coming to some of the wages paid.

He did not make a general I statement, but gave the names of the workand ing men. He showed that men were workbe ing in the factory at sweated wages. If that condition obtains there is no wonder to that the firm object so strongly, as the papers indicate, to the application of the Wages Board provisions to their industry. It has been objected to Mr Weickhardt that in he was a dismissed employee, and that his should be discredited. The manager and the representative of the working made carefully-prepared statements. picked out those points in Mr Weickcan hardt's evidence which would give them a reasonable opportunity to discredit it. They tried at every point to do so. proper But his statements as to the names of Mr of the men, the wages, and the the conditions were not touched.

Under the heading of ""The Strangling Tariff,"" the Age of 12th October, 1904, published the report of an interview which the employees of the Sunshine Harvester Works had with the Minister. At that interview, Mr Kerr, one of the speakers on behalf of the employees, inquired what was the good of fixing a minimum wage if they could not get any work to do? That remark represented the feeling of the men in the factory, who had been given to understand that if they stood by the finding of the Wages Board there would be no work for them. Carlisle says that liberty is divine, but the liberh' to die of starvation is certainly not divine, and the men doubtless felt that whilst it might be a good thing to secure high wages, it was better to bear those ills we have, Than fly to others that we know not of.  said at this interview that the firm had always paid 8s. per day for skilled labour. The difficulty was with regard to the boys at the machines. It was only boys' labour, and the number of iron-moulders was limited.

In the Age of ioth October, 1904, Mr. MCKay is reported to have waited on the Minister, with a request that the determination of the Wages Board with respect to moulders should not be extended to the firm's factory at Braybrook. He saidThe moulding work in his factory was of a very light character, requiring very little skill, and could be done by boys.",89

I come now to another phase of this question.  of the Age, which appeared in that journal on n t h October, 1904. That letter tained the following statement:Considering that the enormous and lucrative trade now carried on in Australia by foreign combines and companies has only been made sible by the untiring efforts of the labour leaders in their interests, the time claim a substantial recompense. A lump sum of say ^50,000 down, with an additional yearly contribution of ^100,000 to the Labour Party's fighting fund could readily be spared beneficent and deserving foreign makers. The money has been faithfully earned. This gentleman, who speaks of bribery as if he had had some experience in connection with it, was alluding to the action taken by the Labour Party when the Tariff was under consideration. He went on to sayI feel convinced that these wealthy combines will rise to the occasion, and make due recognition of the invaluable help extended to them Labour Party. In reply to this letter, Senator Higgs dressed a communication to the editor the Age, which was published in that jourmachine nal, under the heading of "" The Labour Party and Protection,"" on 12th October, 1904. He described the letter written  Federal Labour Party, and proceeded to give him the following advice: his guns to that section of the protectionist manufacturers who, while benefiting by protection, too mean to spend one Denny to circulate literature that will educate the free-traders of Australia, and make a scientific protectionist Tariff possible-to o mean to throw a literary shell amongst those protectionists who, sheltered from the blast of foreign competition, refuse ingtheir work people a few rays of sunshine. So much for the attitude of Mr H. V. MCKay, who refused to allow the Wages [i45.]- 2 Board to interfere, stating that he must be to conduct his business in his own way. In other words, he believes in free-trade labour, but asks for protection for himself against foreign competition.

643,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Was not most of the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission by these the evidence of interested parties ?,90
644,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No doubt; but the evidence was given on oath, by a number of witnesses, whereas the Minister acted upon the unsubstantiated statements of an interested person. According to the Commission, of the £ 8 1 charged for ' the locally made harvesters, something like £22 is expended in selling charges, and £ 1 8 is profit. The selling charges are by the ridiculous, and show that the manufacturers have a lot to learn. They should adnot be allowed to learn at the expense of of the farmers. The profit of £ 1 8 a gives one manufacturer a net income of £30,000. These facts show that the Ministerial proposal cannot face the by light of day. To impose a duty of 40 the peT cent, upon the imported"" machines, which, according to the Tariff Commission, is what a fixed rate of £ 1 6 is equivalent to, is practically to prohibit their importadirected tion. The Commission was equally diare vided as to the course which should be the taken in regard to the harvester duty, the free-trade section, consisting of Senator Clemons, the honourable members for Perth and Illawarra, and Mr Wamsley, reportThat the facts do not justify the special prominence given to the subject of foreign competition, in respect to stripper-harvesters, nor the alarmist statements made in reference thereto. . That the introduction of stripper-harvesters during the last four years from Canada and America has had the effect of increasing the demand, stimulating the skill and enterprise of Australian manufacturers, and supplementing rather than supplanting local production. That the manufacture within the Commonwealth is rapidly expanding, and that in addition to supplying the larger part of local requirements, a considerable export trade to neutral 'markets is being profitably carried on. That the conditions of competition in Australia - do not necessitate any increased protection to - local makers, who are at no disadvantage in regard to cost of manufacture except when their equipments and methods are inadequate. That the evidence does not justify the fears pressed that the local industry will be seriously injured by outside competition unless the present Customs duty is increased. On the contrary, the evidence is clear that Australian manufacturers, by accepting reduced but still ample profits, could secure under the present Tariff a virtual monopoly of the whole trade, the price of the machine to users being much too great in relation to the manufacturing cost. Those were their deliberate conclusions as the result of sifting the facts from an immense mass of evidence. Any business that can show an increase of 300 per cent, in five years cannot be said to be strangled or dying. At any rate, a good many other industries, such as the farming industry, which can derive no benefit whatever from protection, cannot show any corresponding expansion.",90
645,Mr SALMON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That refers to only one individual, and not to the industry as a whole.",91
646,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If such progress is possible for one firm, I should imagine it is possible for other firms. Of course I admit that there are firms and firms-that there are some which are more progressive and up-to-date than others-but , at any rate, what I have quoted shows what one particular firm has done during a period in which it was supposed to be seriously attacked by outside competition. I propose to stand by the present position, but, failing that, I shall support the proposal of the Tariff Commission as against the proposal of the Government. This is too big a question to be dealt with in a hurried manner at the tail-end of a hurried session, and no harm can be done in allowing the matter to be dealt with by the new Parliament. Dumping has already been provided against by legislation; and the question of imports does not appear very serious, if we may judge from the fact that during the past six months no machinery of this (kind has been introduced into the Commonwealth. On the contrary, local manufacturers admit a substantial increase in their output during the period in which they claim they were suffering from competition. I trust that the Committee, in its wisdom, will not go any further in protecting this special industry. I propose to give members of the Royal Commission, or honourable members, any assistance in securing that the proposal shall not operate unduly against either consumers or farmers, and that workmen shall receive some benefit from the increased duty.",91

We have heard much of the wrongs that manufacturers are supposed to commit; but the honourable member for South Sydney was, I thought, very humorous when he referred to the accusations hurled across the chamber, considering that he at the same time was making very strong assertions regarding honourable members who differ from him.

653,Mr STORRER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I had intended to reply to the attack made upon me last night by the honourable member for Parramatta, but I am not one who engages in personalities, if I can restrain myself, as some honourable members do not appear to be able to do. The Federal Parliament ought to be above all personalities, and afford an example of how to conduct legislative business. I have some notes here as to points with which I desire to deal, but I have no wish to take up time in view of the fact that - there is a desire to come to a division. Last night something was said to the effect that the manufacture of harvesters would not affect Tasmania. My opinion, however, is that every industry in Australia affects every State-that if £100,000 be spent in manufacturing articles in Melbourne, Tasmania is bound to receive some benefit, because those engaged in the manufacture must require potatoes, apples, and other products. On the other hand, if we have to send our money to Canada or America we are not likely to receive any such benefit. However, at present, I simply desire to indicate the amendment I shall move in a certain contingency.",91
654,Mr SPENCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Darling) [3.19] - The discussion seems to hinge more on the working of Mr MCKay's factory than on the question of strippers and harvesters. I think that after a couple of days and nights spent in this debate, there has been about enough expenditure on even the discussion, not to mention the money expended in - making the Tariff inquiry. I should say that the farmers of ten years hence will regard us people of 1906 as having been very foolish. In Victoria it has already been proved that the Government can construct the most complex machinery in the shape of rolling stock, and those of the future wonder why we were not wise enough to undertake the manufacture of harvesters. On the one hand, it has been stated that a great deal of sweating is carried on in connection with the industry. We have been told, for example, that men who have been working at the trade for seven years are not paid even a living wage. On the other hand, it is stated that the farmers are paying £ 4 0 or ^50 in excess of the legitimate value of the machines. farmers, by contributing £ 5 each, could start a co-operative concern and make their own machines, or the State could undertake the work of supplying their requirements. What would be easier than to start an agricultural machinery branch at the Newport Workshops? Of course, I know that the farmers would be told that such an enterprise would savour too much of Socialism, and possibly they would be frightened by that bogy. It has been shown that there is an immense amount of waste in connection with the present system for supplying the requirements of the farmers, and I trust that those most directly interested will be prompted to apply the obvious remedy. We are told that the selling expenses amount to about £ 2 0 per machine. A large proportion of this amount must be spent in advertising,^ for which the farmer has to pay. If the farmers could by means of a co-operative enterprise manufacture their own machines they would be able to save all this outlay. I recognise that the ideas to which I have given expression will take some time to sink deeply into the minds of those immediately concerned. The inevitable evolution will have to. take place before any practical result is attained. I do not wish to see any local industry crushed by foreign competition, and although I consider that the Government propose to impose too high a duty, I am perfectly willing to afford the local manufacturer an opportunity of securing the home market. I think that the 25 per cent, ad valorem duty recommended by the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission should be sufficient to achieve the object aimed at, and I am prepared to grant that measure of protection. If we impose a duty of 25 per cent, it will be impossible for foreign manufacturers to compete upon fair competitive lines with the local manufacturers, and if any dumping is attempted will the provisions of the Australian Industries Preservation Bill will operate to protect the local manufacturers. In view of the fact that the machines cannot be landed here from abroad at a cost of less than £ 6 5 , and that similar machines can be produced in the Commonwealth for £ 4 0 , the foreign competitor would appear to have no chance under the propobed new conditions. I shall support the proposals of the honourable member for Wide Bay, The which are intended to protect the workmen engaged in the industry, and I trust that as what may be termed the new protective policy is extended the workmen in all other industries will be similarly safeguarded.",92
655,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Dalley)' [3.30] - To my mind, the honourable member for Darling has put the position in a nutshell. Either there should be voluntary co-operation on the part of the farmers, with a view to manufacturing stripper-harvesters for themselves, or a strong case has been made out for the nationalization of the industry. From the evidence which has been presented, I am certainly of opinion that the firms which are engaged in the manufacture of harvesters have been blackmailing the public. In this connection we must recollect that the stripper-harvester is effecgraces tually protected from the operation of dumping. Up to the 31st May last I find that during the present year no machines have been imported into the Commonwealth.",92
656,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Le t us take a division.,93
657,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable and learned member forgets that he himself occupied a considerable time yesterday in defending the recommendation of the free trade members of the Tariff Commission.,93
658,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,How long is the honourable member likely to occupy?,93
659,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Not half so long as the honourable member occupied in defending Mr MCKay, and about half the time that he occupied in climbing down from the position which he had taken up when the honourable member for Wide Bay attacked him. The free trade members of the Tariff Commission summed up the position in reference to the duty upon harvesters in i-'oout seven paragraphs. They found no evidence to justify the imposition of a higher rate of"" duty. The protectionist section of the Commission, upon the other hand, occupied several pages in urging excuses for their action, and finally recommended the imposition of an ad valorem duty of 25 per I was, indeed, surprised to learn that the Chairman of that body was prepared to recede from the position which he originally took up, and to accept, in lieu of an ad valorem duty, a specific duty of £,10 per machine. The whole of the fight upon the Government proposals has centred around the question of the valuation of the stripper-harvester for Customs purposes. The Minister declares that £65 represents its fair invoice value, whereas both sections of the Tariff Commission affirm that its proper value for Customs purposes is £ 4 1 . Personally I am prepared to accept the statement of the Commission. The honourable member for Wide Bay has submitted an amendment, which the Ministry are evidently prepared to agree to. Apparently they are willing to climb down from the position which they formerly took up, and to allow the Law Courts to determine the true valuation of these machines. sorry indeed that it has been thought necessary to insist upon firms like that of Mr. MCKay complying with reasonable conditions so far as their employees are concerned. I have no desire to get into the bad of honourable members by trespassing longer upon their patience at this hour of the morning. As a free-trader, I shall support the rate of duty which was imposed by the first Commonwealth Parliament. The industry is in a flourishing condition, and there is no necessity whatever for any increased duty. I shall support the proposal to impose an ad valorem duty of 25 per cent, upon stripper-harvesters, with the intention of moving at a later stage to restore the original duty of 12 \ per cent. I have no particular interest to defend, but I do maintain that it is unfair to protectionists that the iron trade should be dealt with in this piecemeal fashion. If I were a protectionist I certainly should insist that the duties upon harvesters, metals, and machinery should be dealt with by the same Parliament. I think that the Government would be well advised, as protectionists, if they stayed their hands until they could deal with the whole question of metals and machinery, including, of course, agricultural. ,'implemehts. jThe iron-workers in the large industries of New South Wales will naturally complain when they see that special efforts are being made to protect, the agricultural implement makers, whilst nothing is being done for them. cent. Sir JOHN QUICK - The harvester matter was considered to be the most urgent and important.",93
660,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am not complaining of the action of the Royal Commission. They no doubt have furnished reports as they got them ready. But is it not a significant fact that this ""most urgent"" industry is once more a Victorian industry ? I do not. object to Victorian industries getting a share of the Tariff benefits, but I submit that the representatives of the other States would be open to blame i'f they did not draw attention to the remarkable circumstance that the languishing industries of Victoria are considered to be in pressing need, whilst the industries of other States are not dealt with at all.",93
661,Mr SALMON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Would not the honourable member object to our dealing with them without reports from the Tariff CommisI am sion?,93
662,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is an open secret that the protectionist section of the Commission has practically decided upon its report regarding metals and machinery. Is not that so?,93
663,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Yes .,94
664,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable and learned member for Bendigo confirms my statement. It simply remains for the free trade members of the Commission to supply their report. But what I complain of is that the iron trades generally are being unfairly treated when, whilst one particular industry is singled out for special treatment, they are neglected.",94
665,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Probably the report on metals and machinery will be before honourable members either tomorrow or next Tuesday.,94
666,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Can we believe that the - Government will attempt to deal with the report on metals and machinery during Parliament? Without canvassing the posiI tion from a party stand-point, I again draw the attention of Ministers to the manishare fest unfairness of neglecting large indusMCKays tries such as we have in New South Wales. I deeply regret that the Minister of Trade and Customs said today that witnesses fore the Tariff Commission were bullied and threatened. I was very pleased hear the Chairman defend his colleagues. When witnesses came before the Commistheir behalf. sion with requests from which they expected to derive gain at the public expense, it not to be expected that they would be so sugar-coated as to be unable to submit to tion. a proper examination. People who ask for State assistance by means of increased duties ought to be able to stand questiongoing ing. I may state frankly, as a free-trader, that if these witnesses had shown by their evidence that they were being treated fairly under the Tariff, and that there were anomalies, I should be prepared to listen to their complaints.",94
667,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But is the honourable member a free-trader any longer? , Mr Wilks - I say, again, in answer to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that while I consider that it is lowest and most despicable thing in politics lo look for loot from the public, that is to be the policy of Australia, I am not going to be foolish enough to stand aside and see industries in my electorate suffer without making an effort on their half. My experience in this Parliament shows me that in the opinion of too many stage. protectionists it is only the industries of Victoria that are to be looked after, whilst those of Australia generally may ""go While I do not believe in the principle of taxing the people for the benefit of private interests, I certainly do say that if protection is to be the fixed policy of Australia I am going to take my share in putting in claims, though I regret that politics in this country should have come down to this level. Returning to the matter of harvesters, the position in regard to them is very much like that with respect to sewing machines, which are produced for £ 4 , whilst the user has to pay £ 1 5 . Apparently the same practice is in vogue in regard to harvesters. No one can contend that 25s. a week is a fair wage for a journeyman, to say nothing, of an improver. It is only sufficient for an apprentice. If this a duty of 25 per cent, be imposed, shall vote on every occasion for the workers in the industry getting their fair of the protection thus afforded. The are doing remarkably well as it is, and I do not see why the Parliament should make a further gift to them. I rebegret the bad treatment which kindred trades have received from the Government, to and I did expect that some protectionist members would rise to say a few words on I protest against the neglect of other industries while a small inwas dustry like that of agricultural implement making in Victoria is receiving this atten",94
668,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Barker) [3.52] - At this late hour I am not to detain the Committee. I rise merely to explain that I am not prepared to follow the Government in imposing a duty of £ 1 6 unper machine; but I am quite ready to give the harvester manufacturers a protection of 25 per cent. The whole question turns of course upon the valuation. In my opinion, £ 6 5 is an excessive valuation. I am disposed to believe that the South Australian manufacturer who put the value down at about £ 4 0 gave a fair estimate. But out of consideration for the Ministry, the and as a loyal Ministerialist, I am prepared to stretch a point and to vote for a still, if fixed duty of £ 1 2 . Amendment negatived.",94

I am now referring to the fixing of the value of a commodity for the purpose of imposing an ad valorem duty. We might as well fix a value for boots and shoes, or any other commodity which is imported. I point out to the honourable member for Parramatta, and other honourable members who may dissent from the decision of the Minister in regard to the valuation of harvesters, that there is a parliamentary way of calling to account any Minister who errs, or makes an improper charge. There is always the opportunity to challenge his position in the House.",98
740,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Unde r Cabinet ,rule, we have to put up with the Minister of Trade and Customs.",98
741,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Some day, when the honourable member for South Sydney is in the Ministry, he may hear it said that Parliament has to put up with him, and suffer some of his ideas.",98
742,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Parliamen t would be putting up with an honest man, anyhow.",98
743,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"And I am happy to believe that no honourable member is today asked to put up with any one who is dishonest. I do not know that we need pay much attention to those who protest too much. With regard to the amendment, I think that it is a very great mistake indeed for us to lay down the value of any imported article.",98
744,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,How can pose a proper duty unless we have a value to base it upon?,99
745,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member exhausted his eloquence in attempting to prove that a fixed duty was an improper thing. I do not agree with him. I believe in a fixed duty where the range of values is not so great as to lead to enormous differences. The experience of the world in Customs matters is that it is wisest, in the interests of the revenue and of commerce, to impose a fixed duty, if it is at all ticable. Under the present proposal, the duty would be fixed, but in a round-about way which I regard as altogether objectionable. If a fixed duty is imposed the manufacturer or importer will have a fair idea of the terms upon which he is competing. He will know that his competitor cannot get ahead of him by resorting to faked invoices-and such things are not unknown in the commercial world. If the honourable member for Parramatta would ask the importers of Sydney, I am sure that they would tell him that, where the range of values is not too great, they would prefer to have a fixed duty. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo indicates that the protectionist members of the Commission recommended a 25 per cent, ad valorem duty upon the understanding that the basis of value would be £ 3 8 or £ 4 1 . But the report does not seem to bear that interpretation. It saysi f the duty be raised from 12^ to 25 per cent. ad valorem on the invoice value of stripper harvesters, then an invoice value of ^38 odd will yield a duty of ;£io gs. 2d.; that if the present valuation for duty fixed by the Minister of Customs at ^65 be sustained, which now yields a duty of^S 2s. 6d., this at 25 per cent, will give ^16 5s. per machine. There is no indication from the protectionist members of the Commission as to which of these two values should be adopted.",99
746,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That was because the matter was in suspense.,99
747,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not blame the members of' the Commission for that. I understood the honourable and learned member for Bendigo to be speaking with auderate thority on behalf of the other members of the Commission as well as himself, but their report leaves open the quesSydney. tion as to the value upon which the proposed duty of 25 per cent, should be levied. Therefore, we are at liberty we im- assume that they are not unanimous, and do not all agree with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo.",99
748,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I know that they are not unanimous.,99
749,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I question very much if some members of the Commission would agree to the imposition of a duty which would amount, according to the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, to an addition of only £ 2 to the amount levied at present. I would ask prac- honourable members who are protectionists to consider the position. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo says that the industry is in danger, and that 'the duty upon the imported article must be materially increased. Then he proposes to increase, the duty from £ 8 to £ 1 0 . I ask what kind of treatment that is for a protectionist like himself to ladle out to an industry which, upon his own showing, is in danger. For the last twelve months a duty of £ 1 0 has been levied.",99
750,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No ; the duty levied has been £ 8 , and that has been based upon the Minister's arbitrary valuation.",99
751,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"During the time that the report of the Commission was in course of preparation, and at the time that it was signed, the duty of £ 8 was being collected, and yet, while that duty was in existence, the honourable member said that the industry was in danger. Now he is prepared to add only £ 2 to the duty. The industry is in danger whilst an £& duty is being levied, whereas a duty of £ 1 0 will save it. That is the kind of recommendation we get from the honourable and learned member.",99
752,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is humbug.,99
753,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member ought to be a judge of humbug. If the industry is in danger whilst a duty of £ 8 is being collected, there is surely necessity for an increase of more than £ 2 . I am prepared to vote for a duty of £ 1 6 or of any lesser amount, so far as this industry is concerned. Mr HU ME COOK - Hear , hear. That is protection.",99
754,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is not the moprotection of which the honourable protectionist member has boasted.,99
755,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That will not suit South,99
756,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am willing to take my chance of that. In view of the atto tacks to which this industry has been subjeered from outside the Commonwealth, it is worth our while to render it secure against the unfair competition of manufacturers in other parts of the world. The talk to which we have listened for some time past as to the injury that would be done to the farmer 'by an increase of duties, comes from men who contemplated' with absolute the robbery of our producers by the importers' ring. They never attempted to take any action to safeguard the farmer against the machinations of the importers. I do not see that any injury will be inflicted upon the farmer by an increased duty upon harvesters or agricultural machinery, so long as we take steps to insure that the prices to the consumer are not increased. In this instance we are taking precautions in that direction.",99
757,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the honourable member thirik that £ 6 5 is a fair valuation for stripper harvesters?,100
758,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I think that it is a fair valuation for machines that have been sold until recently for £ 8 1 .,100
759,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,U p to £ 9 0 .,100
760,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That was a little time ago.,100
761,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The report of the Tariff Commission shows that they have been sold for £ 6 3 .,100
762,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If that be so, it indicates the length to which competitors from America will go in their endeavour to crush the Australian industry.",100
763,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It was Martin and Company's machines that were sold for that price.,100
764,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I do not know upon what evidence that statement is made.,100
765,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,-The member has not read the report.,100
766,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I have read the report.,100
767,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is contained in the report.,100
768,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That does not make it gospel.,100
769,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It shows that the honourable member does not know what he is talking about.,100
770,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member mav be a Pooh-Bah or the Lord High Executioner, but the fact that a statement is contained in a report does not make it accurate.",100
771,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is embodied in the evidence given before the,100
772,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,d have heard wiser men than the honourable member doubt the accuracy of evidence.,100
773,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member does not know what he is talking about.,100
774,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If it wil l satisfy the honourable member, I am prepared to admit equanimity it.",100
775,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Then the honourable member should sit down, and let somebodv else talk.",100
776,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I must ask the Committee to assist me in preserving order. If honourable members will insist upon continually interrupting the honourable member who is addressing the Chair, it is impossible to maintain order. - Mr WATSON - In my view, the farming community need apprehend no danger from the imposition of a duty of £ 1 0 , £*5> JC °> 2 o r £ 5 upon stripper-harves2 ters, so long as steps are taken to insure that the locally-manufactured machines ar« sold at a reasonable price.",100
777,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That condition is not embodied in the resolution.,100
778,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But it will be embodied in the Bill, and if it were not, I would not be prepared to support as high a duty as I otherwise would.",100
779,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I stated when I introduced the resolution that it would be embodied in the Bill .,100
780,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Exactly . I am quite prepared to admit that it is not wise to impose a duty the operation of which will create a local monopoly unless we take steps to regulate that monopoly, and, if necessary, to dispossess its holders in the interests of the consumer. Here it is proposed to take steps, not only to insure that honourable the wage earners in the industry shall be protected. but that the consumers shall be safeguarded against any possibility of robbery at the hands of either a local or an outside trust. I understand that the duty which it is proposed to levy upon stripper harvesters will be withdrawn if within fifteen months the price of those machines be not reduced to £ 6 5 .",100
781,Mr HUMECOOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,£ 7 0 .,100
782,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member and those who are with him in this matter should hold a meeting to decide as to which is the correct price.,100
783,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member must recollect that it is a quarter to 5 'Commission. o'clock in the morning.,100
784,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,But we require to know what we are voting upon.,101
785,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The price of the machines' must be reduced to £ 6 5 within fifteen months, or the duty will be withdrawn. With that safeguard it seems to me that no danger need be apprehended by the farmers. In conclusion, I trust that the Committee will hesitate before committing itself to the very round-about method of converting a fixed duty into an ad valorem rate.",101
786,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I have already told the honourable member that we can solve that difficulty very quickly. Let the Court fix the value of the machines for Customs purposes.,101
787,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Is it not simpler to say that the duty shall be so much per machine? Let us vote either for or against that proposal, and then the traders will know exactly where they are in reference to the importation of these harvesters. seems to me highly desirable that, above all High Court? things, we should have clearness, and that can best be secured by the imposition of a fixed duty.",101
788,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Corinella) [4.46] - As between the imposition of a fixed duty and the round-about method proposed by the honourable member for Parramatta, I have no hesitation in endorsing the view of the honourable member for Bland. I hold that an ad valorem duty based upon afixedvalue would simply pre-judge the very question that the imposition of an ad valorem duty is supposed to leave open. I am aware that objections can be urged against ad valorem duties which cannot be urged against fixed duties, but, as I remarked some hours, ago, our difficulty is that we do not know what is the real dutiable value of these machines, and consequently we are unable to say what the specific duty should be. All! parties were agreed last evening that a specific duty based upon the principle of a 25 per cent, ad valorem rate should be imposed. t Mr MCWILLIAMS - How ?",101
789,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"All who were in favour of increasing the duty were agreed upon that point. The Minister of Trade and Customs himself said that the Government proposal was based upon the imposition of a 25 per cent, ad valorem rate upon what they regarded as the proper valuation of these machines. I urged that because we did not know what was their fair dutiable value we were not able to translate the inconvenient ad valorem rate into the convenient fixed rate. While the honourable member for Bland was speaking upon the amendment proposed by the deputy leader of the Opposition, the Attorney-General interjected that the Courts were at present engaged in investigating the question of what is the proper dutiable value of these machines-that a Commission has been issued by the Supreme Court to ascertain that value. I wish to know whether it is a fact that an appeal against that Commission is now pending?",101
790,Mr ISAACS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,No . There was an appeal to the Full Court from the decision of a single Justice.,101
791,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Has that appeal been dealt with? "" .",101
792,Mr ISAACS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Yes .,101
793,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Has it been allowed?,101
794,Mr ISAACS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,No .,101
795,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Do the Government inIt tend to appeal from that decision to the,101
796,Mr ISAACS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Not from that decision.,101
797,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Then the Commission is going to Canada to investigate the actual dutiable value of these machines?,101
798,Mr ISAACS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is going somewhere.,101
799,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"We cannot say what the evidence taken upon commission will show to be the true dutiable value of the machines. I say frankly that I do not believe that the Commission will say that £ 6 5 is a fair valuation. I do believe that it will say that something between £ 3 8 and £ 4 8 is fair. But we are not in a position to decide. If we establish a fixed duty, we are guessing at the value-the very thing that this Commission is going abroad 0 determine. Wliat I want to know from the Minister is this: When that Commission comes back from Canada or the United States, it may be that the case will not turn upon that point after all. I wish to know, whether the case turns upon the evidence obtained by that Commission or not, does the Government intend to accept the results ascertained by the Commission? Assuming that it has the power to fix the value at what it likes, does the Government intend to accept that finding as evidence of the dutiable value of the article?",101
800,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,No Government would bind itself to accept the finding of any legal Commission.,101
801,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If the Commission finds, and the Court even finds, that the dutiable value is;, we will say, £44, but if the Court also finds that the Government has a right to fix it at £ 6 5 , does the Government reserve to itself the right to retain the value at £ 6 5 ? I think that that is a fair question, and that the courtesy of an answer is due to me.",101
802,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It would be positively dishonest on the part of anv Government to do that.,102
803,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"My vote upon this matter may turn upon that question, and therefore I am entitled to. ask the Minister for information. If the Prime Minister thinks that I am asking anything that is unfair I will stop at once.",102
804,Mr DEAKI N,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.53]--The Commission, as the honourable member knows, can have no definite result. It will simply take evidence. That evidence may or may. not be conclusive. In this matter there will probably be a margin of difference That margin may be unimportant, or it may be grave and serious. No Government - indeed , I would say no sensible man - to be bound, by his words hereafter would pledge himself in advance to accept the findings of such a Commission. The Government will exercise the same independent judgment as any man would exercise on such a question. The evidence will be before the public, and it will be before the representatives of the public in this House. They will have an opportunity of judging the Government, who will do what, under their responsibility, they believe to be in the public interest.",102
805,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Corinella) [4.54] - That is not the information which I desired to obtain. I will explain my point again. The Postmaster-General may laugh, but I can assure him that I am earnest in wishing to find out the exact position, and that I shall give nw vote accordingly. What I wish to get at is this: What I understand from the Prime IMinister is that the Government reserves to itself the right-as suming that it has the legal power to do so if the matter in question is decided in its favour-to maintain the valuation at £ 6 5, even although the evidence taken on commission shows that £ 6 5 is too high. Of course, there may be conflicting views. But suppose that the evidence shows conclusively that the valuation is between £ 4 5 and to take a specific case. If the reasonable conclusion from, evidence is that the value is below £ 6 5 , does the Government mean that it reserves to itself the right still to keep the valuation at a figure which the evidence does not justify, or does the Government mean that if the evidence enables it to come to a reasonable conclusion, it will accept that conclusion? Does the Government intend bona fide to follow the evidence if the evidence is clear enough to be followed ?",102
806,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Is the honourable member referring to the future and to the past, or to the future only, and not to the past?",102
807,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What will happen when the evidence on Commission becomes known ?,102
808,Mr ISAACS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Does the honourable member mean the effect on the case, or on the future duty ?",102
809,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"On the future duty, of course. Mr DEAKI N {Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4-57]--As I have said - and it is not a quibble-it is a question of margin. The duty has been fixed on a valuation of £ 6 5 . If it is shown by the evidence that the valuation for duly should be between JPfio and £ 6 5 , we might retain the valuation at £ 6 5 . Under the Act, as I read it. the Government would be entitled to take that view if it considered that the valuation of £ 5 5 was artificial, and not the real value. The intention of the Act is that the duty shall lie imposed upon the real value of an article. It is intended to guard against the tricks of trade. The Government will have to take full responsibility for the exercise of its powers in this regard. If there should be any departure from what ought to be done the House will deal with it.",102
810,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Corinella) [4.58] - The position put by the Government is that, assuming that the evidence enables the Government to form a reasonable conclusion on facts as to what the real value iswhether it is £ 6 5 or £ 4 0 , or anything between-the Government will deal with it accordingly.",102
811,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Certainly ; any Government must.,102
812,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I say, on the face of that, that if the value as ascertained is to be taken; as the basis, then, assuming that there is a legal power to exercise the authority, I am satisfied to accept the 25 per cent, basis.",102
813,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am not.,102
814,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Of course the honourable member's fiscal views and mine are not in accord. But it is because the matter is in a state of flux that I shrink from fixing the duty now. I think that the 25 per cent, basis is, on the whole, a liberal basis. It is a fair basis under the special circumstances of this case. I do not want to see the duty fixed at £ 1 0 if the real value is more than £ 4 0 , and I do not want to see tlv duty fixed at £ 1 6 if the real value is between £ 4 4 and £ 6 5 . The 25 per cent, duty might be imposed on the definite understanding that the dutiable value is to be honestly fixed in accordance with the evidence. It is because we do not know what the fixed duty ought to be, and because we really always ascertain it by some reference to the dutiable value that I shrink from a fixed duty now; and I was hoping that the Government would tide us over this coming season at any rate.",102
815,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,In what way?,103
816,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,By imposing an ad valorem duty.,103
817,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,We might take the ad valorem duty at the present valuation.,103
818,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I say this frankly, that there is no evidence to justify a valuation °t -£ 5 6 I 1 0 w - As I have put my views frankly against those of the importers I want frankly to put the view on the other side. I think that the weight of evidence is against the £ 6 5 valuation. That is a limit that no one expects that we shall reach by means of evidence. I did expect that the Government would refix the value. I have looked through the Commission's report and the evidence. That evidence comes largely from a quarter which is interested. evidence which is largely unchecked, because there is no opportunitv of checking it.",103
819,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The manufacturing price of the Australian machines can be ascertained, and the importers say that theirs can be made more cheaply.",103
820,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The evidence as to the cost of production here is very vague, although it points in the direction of a value a little under £ 4 0 in each case. But I do not think it is conclusive, and, therefore, I do not wish to be bound by it.",103
821,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Shoul d not the Committee have a reasonable idea from the manufacturers as to the cost of building a harvester ?,103
822,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"In my opinion, the silence of the manufacturers or of the importers would entitle us to draw the inference against them.",103
823,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The information was tendered confidentially to the Tariff Commission, and they got it.",103
824,Mr MCCAV,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The publication of the information to the whole world could not have hurt the business of the manufacturers, so far as the rivalry was concerned.",103
825,Mr HUME COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes , it could.",103
826,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It is impossible to suggest a reason why either importers or local manufacturers could have suffered by disclosing the cost of production, so far as the rivalry between two sets of makers was concerned.",103
827,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The information was given to the Commission, and put in.",103
828,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It was never handed into the Commission.,103
829,Mr HUME COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It was offered.,103
830,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I defy any one to point to a single reason in this case why either importers or manufacturers could have been hurt by stating the cost of production.,103
831,Mr HUME COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,A man does not give the secrets of his business away to his rivals.,103
832,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"In this case the only thing which could have been given away was the amount of profit, because the manufacturers had given away nearly everything except the cost of production.",103
833,Mr HUME COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Why was not the offer accepted?,103
834,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Surely at this hour the honourable member does not want me to go into a matter of that kind ! In my opinion the Government should say to the Committee that while they think that £ 3 8 is too It is low a value, they consider that 1^65 is too high, and do not propose to retain the proposed duty of 25 per cent, on the latter basis. For the present an intermediate amount should be fixed upon, and then the tiue value: could be fixed when we had final information to guide us to a determination.",103
835,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) [5.4] - I have listened very carefully to-night to all the speeches, and marvelled that honourable members should have forgotten the statement. I made about a year ago, when this matter was before the House, I forget under what conditions.",103
836,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,On a motion for the adjournment of the House.,103
837,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"In my speech, which may be seen in Hansard, I clearly stated the course of action, and why it was taken. When honourable members state that I have not given any information, they ignore what took place on that occasion if on no other.",103
838,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Was that in reference to the letter from Italv?,104
839,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not remember whether the document was among the papers on that occasion, but probably it was. When I learned that it was a copy, I compelled the production of the original letter; but that was only one factor in the matter. I am very much surprised indeed at the action taken by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. I think it will tend very much to influence the hearing of the cases which are now before the Court. If he will only look at the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission, he will find that a valuation of £ 5 9 or £ 6 0 was given. Honourable members seem to forget that, under the' Customs Act, the Minister has to consider, not only the cost of making a harvester, but all incidental cost until it is placed on board. That is where the whole trouble commences.",104
840,Mr TOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The f.o.b. value is £ 3 8 .,104
841,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The f.o.b. value was the value after deducting all expenses from the factory to the ship. What was carried on? I found out that there was a certain value given »for the harvesters, 'and that the railway company, and every one connected with the business, were all receiving a part of the rebates. To prevent a continuance of that practice, I did what I was authorized by law to do. I added the full cost of railway freight, commission, and everything up to the point of the article being free on board.",104
842,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Ye t the local manufacturers of harvesters say that there is no protection against outside competition.,104
843,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is a matter which is arguable. I am not dealing now with that point, but with the question as to how the value was raised according to law. Section 154 of the Customs Act says thatThe value shall be taken to value of the goods in the principal markets of the country whence the same were exported in the usual and ordinary acceptation of the term, and free on board at the port of export in such country, and a further addition of 10 per cent, on such market value. If the honourable and learned member for Bendigo will look at the statements made to the Commission he will find that they vary. According to the evidence of Mr. Patterson, the cost of making a harvester here is £ 4 1 ; the importing expenses and duty amount to £ 2 0 ; the setting up costs £ 2 ; and then comes in the question of the selling expenses which I have not taken into consideration at all. I have seen some invoices in reference to the freight.  to say that he charges the £20?",104
844,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No . I notice that in one instance the freight was stated at £ l , but I have seen invoices where it was given at £ 5 . The only thing which has to be taken off the £ 2 0 is the freight and duty. If we deduct £ 5 for the fieight from the £ 2 0 , it leaves £ 1 5 . Then if we take the cost of production at £ 4 1 , it brings the total cost up to £ 5 6 .",104
845,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,But the duty has to come off too.,104
846,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"When I - dealt with the question of value, the duty was about £ 4 . If we take the freight at £ 5 , and the duty at £ 4 , it makes £ 9 , and, deducting that from the £ 2 0 it leaves £ 1 1 . I do not know exactly the cost of setting up a harvester here. I have not been able to go through' the details in the papers, because they have only just been obtained from the Crown Law Offices. If to the £ 4 1 we add £ 1 1 and 10 per cent', on the market value abroad, it brings the total value to about £ 5 9 .",104
847,Mr GB EDWARDS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,No; to about £56.,104

It placed the Customs Department of the Commonbeyond wealth in an extremely difficult position. I wish honourable members to clearlv underthink stand that if the Government can be vinced that the f.o.b. cost is not £ 6 5 will be prepared to accept what is an returned. equitable valuation.

I do not say that a valuation of £ 6 5 may not be a too high. When I am convinced that it is, I shall be quite prepared to accept is equitable. I had great difficulty in dealing with this matter, and recommend the Committee impose a specific duty rather There is difficulty in ascertaining the be value of machinery, and particularly of these machines, whilst trouble is also ex3 perienced in connection with the importation reof parts. Some of these machines come out in a half-finished state, and parts are introduced in all sorts of conditions. The Harvester Company, which has a factory in Canada, wished to send machines to the other side of America, and knew that if they sent them from a Montreal' they could get them carried at a low rate. A short time ago I received an intimation from the British Consul at of Chicago that when a certain train arrived in that city from Montreal the trucks were opened and Chicago machines were placed in them. Some oif them - to New Zealand, and others to Brisbane, but before ""the comfrom the British Consul arrived I they had been distributed, and nothing in could be done. I am not wedded to a duty of £ 1 6 ; but it is very hard to determine what is the exact duty that ought be levied. I would ask honourable members what other course is open to us than to fix the ad valorem rate on the valuation we have made. If , as the Prime Minister the report of the Commission which has been issued to take evidence abroad, showed that the valuation was too high, no Minister or Ministry would attempt to go what was clearly proved to be the legitimate assessment.

895,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have no quarrel with the Minister on the present occasion. My desire is to get at the facts. We are now considering a proposal for the imposition of a duty, and must have some basis of value in our minds. Is the proposed 25 per cent, ad valorem to be imposed on a valuation of '£65, on a valuation of £ 4 5 , or on a valuation of £ 3 5 ? - Honourable members may quibble as they like in regard to fixed rates, but every duty when imposed must be at a fixed rate.",107

897,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am not prepared to do that. Considering the cost of importing, a duty of £ 1 2 would be extortionate, and I should be no party to the imposition of such a rate. We cannot get from the Government a clear statement of their intentions in the-future. All they say now is, "" If it is clearly shown that the valuation is too high, it will be lowered."" How is it to be clearly shown if the Tariff Commission have been unable to clearly show it? It is true that a Commission has been sent to Canada to investigate the matter; but the Minister has told us that they cannot find the values there, because they are not kept.

They know nothing about the cost of the machines.",107
903,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I believe that they know all that is to be known, and that that information is contained in their report. I do not think that any better evidence could be obtained by going to Canada 1,000 times. I am, therefore, prepared to rely upon the Commission's report. They say that the manufacturers of stripper-harvesters in Australia declined to give information respecting the factory cost of making those machines in this country. There is only one course for the Government to take, and that is to decline to alter the duty until the cost of these machines is made known. Mr JOHNSON. :- That would be the straightforward course to take.",107

Men appear before the Tariff Commission, and sav that their industry is prospering, their output increasing by leaps and bounds, and their export trade growing; but they will not tell the Commission anything else. On that information the Government propose to nearly double the existing duty. Here is what the Commission saysfrom the data submitted to the Commission by such manufacturers, viz. Although the manufacturers would not themselves submit the cost, they gave the the cost? Commission the data so that the members could themselves make up the cost - Where sity to socialize this industry. is the difference ? The report proceedsThat the cost of the material of a stripper-hartified vester amounts to about £26, and as the wages paid in its manufacture amounts to 30 per cent, of the cost of the finished article, the inference has been drawn that the total cost of a locallytrenched. made stripper-harvester is about £37 3s. Assuming this statement and the inference therefrom as being correct, and adding to the cost of materials and the cost of wages per cent, to represent general expenses of manufacturing, management, lighting, insurance, & c , the cost of a complete machine in Australia should work out at about ^ 4 1 .

At the present rate of progress at least two years must elapse before a legal decision is given in regard to the harvester case.

922,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Canobolas) [5.42] - I ""wish to refer to one remark made by the honourable member for Bland in the course - of his impassioned address, which appeared to me to be particularly diTected towards myself. The honourable member said that those who were -.objecting to the imposition of increased duties upon stripper - harvesters were prepared to allow the farmers to be handed over to the tender mercies of monopolists. I wish to know whether the honourable member has any faith in the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, which was intended to protect us against the operations of trusts either within or beyond the Commonwealth. He represented to me and to other honourable members that that measure would prove an effective safeguard^ and I accordingly gave it my support. I am as strongly opposed to monopolies of any kind as is the honourable member for Bland, and yet, because I am not prepared to vote for any increased duty upon stripper-harvesters, I am told by the honourable member that I am prepared to play into the hands of monopolists. Has the honourable member come to the conclusion that he made a mistake when he recomI desire mended honourable members to vote for the measure to which I have referred? If so, the sooner he takes us into his confidence and places the position fairly before us the better. I am not disposed to place make-believe enactments on the statute-book. I think that it was most unfair of the honourable member to make the statement he did with respect to myself and others who are opposed to the proposed increased duty. I came into this House under certain pledges to my constituents, and I am going to stand by them as long as I am here, even though I may offend the honourable member for Bland. The question of fixed duties, as compared with ad valorem duties, was fully considered when the Tariff was under discussion, and it was then decided to discard specific and composite duties in favour of ad valorem duties. It was shown that certain fixed duties levied under the Victorian Tariff gave rise to very serious anomalies. In one case the fixed duty upon certain goods resulted'in subjecting the lower-class articles to an impost equivalent to an ad valorem duty of 60 per cent., whilst goods of a higher quality were subject to a duty of only 18 per cent. We have been told that when the strippers were first introduced here the price was fixed at £120, whereas the machine could reasonably be sold today for £ 4 5 or £50. If we fixed the duty for stripper-harvesters upon the basis of a valuation of £ 6 5 , we might, within a very short time, find that, owing to improved methods of construction, the machines could be sold for £ 2 0 . In such an event, the ad valorem charge would be enormouslv increased. I do not see that any greater difficulty_ would be experienced i»» --rmining the value of stripper-harvesters than is met with in fixing the value of a hundred and one of the other articles enumerated in the Tariff. I have no doubt that the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission had a natural inclination to adopt the valuation fixed by the Minister, and I assume that they must have had very good reasons for coming to the conclusion that a lower figure more accurately represented the value. I think that the Minister has made a mistake in fixing the value of the imported stripper-harvester at £ 6 5 . If not, it will be unjust to compel the local manufacturers to reduce their price to £ 7 0 . The margin between £ 6 5 and £ 7 0 is not sufficient to yield local manufacturer a reasonable profit. The position presents the two horns of a dilemma. Either £ 6 5 is an over valuation, or the proposed decision to arbitrarily fix the selling price within a couple of years at £ 7 0 is unwarranted by the facts of the case. I desire to encourage the local manufacture of machinery under reasonable conditions. I would prefer to purchase a machine from an Australian manufacturer than from a foreign manufacturer. But I cannot fail to recognise that whilst the farmers have been sweated by outsiders they have also been imposed upon by our local manufacturers. Consequently, whilst giving; fair consideration to the latter, I do not think that we should place the farming community completely at their mercy. can show quite as good a record from the stand-point of endeavouring to protect the interests of the farmers as can the honourable member for Bland. It comes with ill grace from him to charge me, or those associated with me, of opposing the proposed duty in a covert effort to further the interests of outside manufacturers and monopolists, to the detriment of the class to which I belong.",109

The inquiry conducted by that body has been a pensive one, although the Commission admittedly performed a great work. from all the information supplied to it, the vital facts connected with the manufacture of harvesters have been omitted. desire to know is the actual cost of producing one of these machines in Australia.

I not here to defend the Colonial Sugar most exRefining Company, but I say that has the accuracy of their balance-sheets But has never been challenged.",111
946,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is it not a fact that the manufacturers gave the information priWhat we vately to the Commission?,111
947,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If they gave that information privately, surely there can be no preobjection to a statement being made authoritatively showing the amount of monev spent in making one of these machines.",111
948,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,There may be justifiable conreasons why such information should not,111
949,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If the Government not know the actual cost of making these machines, .it is entitled to one or two in order to ascertain.",111
950,Mr STORRER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,To make one or two to machines would cost probably £200 each.,111
951,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I . know something to about mechanics, and I can assure the honourable member that he is wrong. It adis humiliating for representatives of the is people in a Legislature to find that a shroud of mystery envelops the question of the how much money is involved in producing a particular machine. That is the whole point.",111
952,Mr HUME COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The manufacturers are prepared to say that a machine costs over £ 5 2 to make, but they were asked to declare facts concerning their whole busiand were bullied by a free-trade member of the Commission because they would",111
953,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It is useful information that it costs £ 5 2 to manufacture one of machines, but unfortunately it does unnot reach us through the proper channel. If the manufacturers are prepared to swear that statement, why have they not done",111
954,Mr RONALD,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is in the Tariff Com,111
955,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Will the honourable and member show me the place where it can be found? I think that the valuation of £ 6 5 , which is the figure fixed by the Minister of Trade and Customs, is too high. After good deal of banter, the Minister has frankly expressed his own opinion that that to valuation is too high. That information I have already said, by way of interjection, that in my opinion it would be dishonest on the am part of a Government after a Commission had been sent to America to ascertain the manufacturing cost of these machines, still to continue to exercise Ministerial power in valuing them at a figure higher than the evidence disclosed to be justified. Minister of Trade and Customs has expressed his opinion upon that point more clearly than did the Prime Minister. He tells us that he is prepared to accept the facts ascertained by the Commission which has gone to America. That is a sensible and straightforward thing to do. Some honourable members have suggested that they would not trust the Minister. I have seen nothing in his conduct to cause me to distrust him in any wav. I would rather trust a Minister who stated straightforwardly that he had taken up a wrong position than I would trust one who was not frank, and w'ho concealed information which he had at his disposal. I do not wish to refer to the differences have arisen between honourable members professing different fiscal faiths.",111
956,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What is the honourable member's fiscal faith?,112
957,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It is to do the very best I can for the people of Australia. I am free to follow any course that I believe in, and shall not come into conflict with my constituents by doing so.",112
958,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It was a fair question to ask.,112
959,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member has taken up one or two different attitudes. I have heard him argue that no duty should be imposed except for revenue purposes. I have also heard him say that, as some people are getting an advantage from certain duties, he does not see why his constituents should not share in those advantages. There are other honourable members who, like the honourable member for New England, say that they would not ask for any assistance throueh the Customs for their constituents. There are some who believe that it would be better for Australia to have no commerce whatever. They believe in absolute prohibition. I cannot share that view by any means. I do say, however, lhat most countries appear to get along in pretty much the same wav. no matter what fiscal principles they adopt. There is, for instance, the great protectionist country of the United States, in which there is some of the bitterest poverty to be found in any country, and as regards the employment of youths and long hours of work in their factories we have nothing to equal the tragedies which take place there. On the other hand, we have boasted free-trade countries in which tens of millions of persons are on the verge of starvation. Believing, as I The do, that the distribution of wealth is unequal and inequitable, can I appear here and vote for the proposal of the Government?",112
960,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Can the honourable member connect his remarks with the question before the chair ?,112
961,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes . The question before the Committee is whether a certain import duty would benefit the people. The /TEMPORARY .CHAIRMAN. The question is that on and after the 7 th September there shall be a duty of 15 per cent, on harvesters.",112
962,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes , and the only argument advanced by the Ministry and the lhat Tariff Commission in favour of the proposal is that it would provide work for the people.",112
963,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member has classified most of us on the fiscal question, but he has not vet classified himself.",112
964,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am answering the inquiry from the Chair. The imposition of import duties has had various effects in different countries, and in every case the result has been unsatisfactory. I do not think that I ought to trespass on the patience of the Chair to state the reason for the failures. The fiscal policies of various countries have absolutely failed in their object, and that is the better distribution of wealth. I have no reason to think that a prohibitive duty would operate to reduce the price of the harvester, as the Ministry desire, and are passing legislation to insure. I believe that the legislation will more or less fail to achieve that object. I do not think that the Government will be enabled by that means to reduce the price of the harvester to a certain amount. If the manufacturers ignored the law, the Government would not interfere.",112
965,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member's own proposal would compel them.,112
966,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I think not, because it does not refer to the selling price.",112
967,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member suggested the imposition of an Excise duty.,112
968,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The Government state that if the proposed duties be imposed, we are assured that the selling price of the machine will be less than it is at present. But my view is that Parliament ought not to impose high duties without taking care that the employees in the industry shall receive a portion of the benefit so conferred. - Mr CHANTER - That is also to be proposed in the Bill.",112
969,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"There is no Bill before the Committee. I am doubtful whether the Government will be able to insure that the price of t'he machine shall not be more than a certain sum - and I believe that they honestly desire to attain that object-because there are many methods by which' manufacturers, especially if they have a monopoly, can charge a higher price than that prescribed by the Government. For instance, they could deliver an inferior machine unless we maintained an army of inspectors.",113
970,Mr STORRER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No one would ruin his business by making an inferior machine,",113
971,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I believe that in their own interests the manufacturers would produce the best possible machine, at the same time they would demand the highest price which the farmers would pay. I do not complain on that score. My complaint is that notwithstanding all our investigation and expenditure, we cannot get a definite statement of the sum expended in producing a machine fit for delivery. I have made personal inquiries, and heard that the item of wages does not amount to more than £ 1 2 per machine. In my opinion, it would be a fair thing, as proposed, to impose a duty equal to the amount paid in wages in constructing a machine. Like other persons, I had no authority to compel a declaration ofi the true state of affairs. I would not have mentioned the amount if I had not got the information personally, and I believe that, to a certain degree, it is reliable.",113
972,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Dalley) [6.18] - The honourable member for Canobolas, in defence of his position, described the speech of his leader as an ""impassioned address."" I put it to the Committee that in two Parliaments we have never heard from a member of the Labour Partv a warmer speech in the early hours of the morning in defence of a proposed duty. There is no doubt that the honourable member for Bland was speaking at high pressure, and that he fought as strenuously for the proposal as if he were Prime Minister. I interjected at the time that he was fighting the principles of the Ministry instead of the principles of the party to which he belonged. The honourable member for Canobolas and the honourable member for Wide Bay, the deputy leader of that party, have practically borne out what I am saying. I think it is wise to put it on record that the honourable member for Bland ,.is such an ardent protectionist that he will put before everything else prohibitive protection as against the protection of labour. The honourable member for Canobolas raked his leader fore and aft when he was absent; but I shall not pursue that course, because I should like to attack him in his presence. I want to emphasize the statement of the honourable member for Wide Bay that the value of the labour in a harvester is £ 1 2 , and that because of that .amount of labour the honourable member for Bland and others are asking the Committee to impose a high if not a prohibitive duty. The honourable member for Bland was asked whether he thought that £ 6 $ was a fair value, and he said that it was. A little while afterwards the Minister of Trade and Customs said that, in his opinion, it was a little above the value. The honourable member for Parramatta has made a very admirable suggestion, and I think that the difficulty in which we are placed would be overcome very quickly if . it were analyzed. He says that he will press for a duty of 15 per cent, on the Minister's valuation of £ 6 5 , which would give an advantage of £ g 15s. to the local manufacturers. Two days ago the honourable and learned member for Bendigo asked for a fixed duty of £ 1 0 . Although he is an ardent protectionist, still he has receded from that position, and now asks for a duty of 25 per cent., which is equal to a fixed duty of £ 1 0 5s. per machine. The free traders were beaten on their proposal to adhere to the agreement for fiscal peace, and thereby retain the existing duty of 12-j per cent., and they now make a very fair proposition. They practically agree to the duty of £10 which was asked for by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, and supported by many protectionists. The members on this side want an ad valorem in preference to a fixed duty, because if the Commission which the Government has appointed should find that a machine is worth less than £ 6 5 the consumer would not have to pay on the same value as he would if we had imposed a fixed duty of £ 1 0 , or any larger sum.",113
973,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Are we in every case to appoint a Commission to ascertain the true value of goods for Customs purposes?,113
974,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"A Commission has already been appointed. The honourable member apparently is a believer in 40 per cent, duties.",114
975,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I believe in effective protection. Mr Wilks' - The honourable member for Bland, in the early hours of this morning, said that he believed in a local monopoly as long as the position of the consumer of its products was considered. It is not Iong^ since he supported the passing of a Bill for the repression of monopolies, and the question which the honourable member for Canobolas put as to whether Or not that was a mere make-believe measure was a very pertinent one. If the Australian Industries Preservation Bill is not a mere "" make-believe,"" protectionists should have no reason to fear anything in the shape of dumping. When I rose to address the Committee at 3 o'clock this morning far more Government supporters than members of the Opposition had Spoken to the question.",114
976,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,When did the honourable member go to sleep?,114
977,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It would not do for a free-trader to go to sleep when all these little games are going on. The Government are now fighting for a fixed duty of £ 1 6 ; for that is what an ad valorem duty of 25 per cent, on their valuation would amount to. The protectionist members of the Tariff Commission recommended an ad valorem duty of 25 per cent., whereas the free-trade members of it urge that there is no evidence to justify an increase in the Tariff. It seems to me,"" therefore, that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta is an admirable compromise. The honourable member for Barker would not have attempted to suggest a duty of £12 had"" he not believed that the Government would accept it ; and, since his proposal would be equivalent to an ad valorem rate of 18J per cent, on the valuation fixed by the Government, I fail to see why they should fight over what is after all a difference of a couple of pounds. The honourable member for Canobolas is to be highly complimented on the stand he has taken. He has said that he disagrees with the views of his leader on this question, and that he intends to fulfil his pledges to his constituents. I said the other day that I could not fail to notice that there was a cloud on the political horizon, but that I would not take any action in the direction of supporting protectionists' proposals until I had consulted my constituents. When the Tariff was under consideration, I did not vote' for a protectionist duty on machinery that would be of assistance to any of them, and the honourable member for Canobolas is not the only one in this Chamber who is not going back on his election pledges. We are in duty bound to do our best for the electors and for Australia generally. I am not going to be attracted by any proposal to place either the importer or the manufacturer on a pedestal. Both are actuated by the same motives; they are out for ""game,"" and if they can use this Parliament to their advantage they will do so. I have never reflected on a Minister, but regret to say that I have heard serious aspersions cast upon some honourable gentlemen. If an honourable member, no matter on what side of the House he may sit, says a little too much-if he reflects unjustly on the character of a Minister or any other honourable member-h e ought to be prepared to withdraw his statements, because the public character of honourable members ought to be protected; if , on the other hand, he says too little, he should be made to explain himself fully.",114

979,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"After sitting all nightand the time has been consumed, not by speeches of members of the Opposition, but by those of other honourable membersit is not fair that we should be called upon to commence a new day at half-past 10 o'clock for the transaction of fresh business. I think, therefore, that the Minister should promise that, when he gets this motion through, the Government will consent to adjourn until Tuesday next. We do not wish to be compelled to discuss these proposals till half-past 10, when, under the Standing Orders, no new business can be taken.",114
980,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Lang) [6.36] - If I only had my way, there would be no duties on agricultural implements. The evidence laid before the Tariff Commission will convince fair-minded men that the local industry does not need protection, the cost of importing harvesters being in itself suffi cient to secure the local manufacturers from too fierce a competition. If duties had to be imposed, I would prefer ad valorem rates in cases where there were different qualities of the goods affected. But with a Minister like the honourable member for Hume in power, valuations may be so inus creased, on one pretext or another, as has been done in the case of harvesters, that the actual duty imposed by Parliament may be doubled. The Minister admitted this morning that he had no reliable evidence original. upon which to base his harvester valuation, and conveyed the impression that £65 was fixed upon to make it certain that there would be no escape for the importer. It is obvious that this is the valuation upon which the proposed increased duty is going to be charged, in entire disregard of the reports of the Tariff Commission. A Commission has been issued by the sufficiently Supreme Court for the purpose of contection ducting an impartial and non-political vestigation as to the values of harvesters in Canada. In the face of all those facts, and in the face of the statement the Minister that it is not possible to get reliable evidence in Canada, we must asenable sume that it is the intention of the vernment to adhere to the value of £65. It is not reasonable to trust the administraMinutes tion of ad valorem duties to a Minister the views of the present Minister of Trade and Customs-a Minister who exercises powers of administration in a high-handed, tyrannical, arbitrary, and merciless manner in the persecution of importers. If we could only be sure that the value of article would remain at a certain figure, would not very materially depart from certain figure over a given period, it would be better to have a specific rather than ad valorem duty. We have to-night one bit of entirely new information from the Minister. If the Minister has before him the original papers which were laid on the Library table on the occasion when the adjournment of the House was moved £33. for the purpose of discussing this questurers tion, the original letter which was said to pany, have come from Italy is not included. I farmersand went very carefully through all those papers, and all I could find was a copy of a copy of an alleged letter, and all the references in the documents were to the copy of copy. The Minister now informs us that he has since insisted on the production the orirrinal letter, which he has seen, I suppose that that letter is available other persons to see. This is the first time we have been informed that the has seen the original of a document which was the only evidence tendered in support of the application for the increase of Mr Johnson. duties. The Minister has to-night informed that he acted originally on' information contained in the copy of a copy of a letter.",114
981,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I did not say that; I said that a copy of the letter was first presented, and that I demanded to see the",115
982,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"There was then no evidence of the existence of an original, and I should like to ask the Minister if he has any objection to let any other honourable member see the document, which no doubt would be very interesting to every gentleman in the Chamber. I should like to say that the cost of importation is, in itself, high to constitute a natural pro; and in this connection, I direct the inattention of honourable members to the evidence given before the Royal Commission. This natural protection amounts to some of thing like 44 per cent., apart from the duties, and surely that is sufficiently high to any industry to be successfully carGoried on in Australia. I direct honourable members' attention to page 1736 of the of Evidence, Vol. 4, where they of will find the evidence of Mr Alfred Patterson in regard to metals and machinery. his The Minister of Trade and Customs has admitted the evidence of Mr Alfred Patterson to be the most reliable placed before the Commission-a n admission which is in the. dorsed by the whole of the members of _ or the Commission in their recommendations. a The evidence shows that the local manufacturers would derive a sufficiently high an profit without any duty whatever. For had example, the profit derived by the Massey-Harris ComDany is £ 8 is. gd. per machine; by the International Harvester Company, £ 1 7 gs. $d.; and by the Sunshine Harvester Company, from £ 3 1 to Therefore, if the local manufacreduced their price by £&, they would knock out the Massey-Harris Comi f they reduced the cost to the by £ 1 7 , Ihey would render it impossible for the International Harvester Company to compete with them. A reduction of £ 1 7 would bring the price of the a Sunshine harvester down to £ 6 4 , which would still yield a profit to the company of equal to 38 per cent. These figures seem and to me to furnish an unanswerable argument for against the imposition of any duty whatever, and to fully justi'fv me in opposing Minister the Government proposal.",115

985,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable, member will have the opportunity of doing that subsequently.",116
986,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am sure that the honourable member for Barker would be the very last who would desire to achieve a reputation for sharp practice. I trust that he will see that his amendment will place honourable members in a very difficult position.,116
987,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I should like to point out that when the Tariff was under consideration in 1901-2 no rule was laid down as to whether a higher or a lower duty should first be voted upon by the Committee. The proposals submitted were decided in the order in which they were moved.,116
988,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Upon a point of order. I should like; to know whether-if the higher duty be carried-honorabl e members will be afforded an opportunity of voting upon a proposal to impose a lower duty?,116
989,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,If the Committee Carrv the proposal of the honourable member for Barker the ditty of £ 1 2 per machine will stand.,116
990,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,There might be a number of honourable members who wish to record their votes in favour of a lower amount. I am sure that the Ministry have no wish to prevent them doing that.,116

996,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Corinella) [7.5] - Assum ing that some honourable members are in favour of imposing a duty of £ 1 1 upon these machines, the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo will prevent them from placing that fact upon record. During the discussion of the Tariff, in the first Commonwealth Parliament, the rule was laid down that the Committtee should first vote upon the lowest duty proposed. Divisions were taken upon the amendments submitted in an ascending scale, and thus an opportunity was afforded to honourable members to vote upon each successive amount. The rule which is being adopted in the present instance was not followed upon that occasion,, because it would practically have excluded divisions upon all intermediate rates.",116
997,Mr ISAACS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It will be open to any honourable member to move for the insertion of an intermediate rate.,116
998,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But in 1901-2 the rule which is at present being followed would have prevented honourable members firom voting upon intermediate rates. I recollect distinctly that time after time honourable members who had proposed a higher rate of duty gave way in order that divisions might be taken upon lower rates. The proposal of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, if carried, will mean that there will remain only a choice as between a duty of £12 and of £10.",116
999,Mr WILKINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Moreton) [7.8] My recollection of what occurred in 1901-2 differs somewhat from that of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. When the right honourable member for Adelaide submitted the Tariff resolutions, the first proposal put from the Chair always related to the highest rate of duty proposed. The great majority of the duties embodied in the Tariff as it was originally framed were reduced. If we adopted the same practice upon the present occasion, the duty of £ 1 6 per machine which has been proposed by the Government would be the first question decided. Mr. JOSEPH COOK .(Parramatta) [7.9] - I confess that I do not see any in- Crouch, R. A. superable difficultv in this matter. I admit that my recollection is that, when the first Tariff was under consideration, we first considered the lowest duty proposed, and then decided the other duties in the order in which they were submitted.",117

1001,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"However , it seems to me that that does not matter. After honourable members have voted upon the proposal of the honourable member for Barker, it will be quite competent for them to move that on and after a certain date the duty imposed upon harvesters shall be £ 1 1 .

I have been 'i'nfornied by the Opposition whip that in the last division I was paired with the honourable member for Hunter.

1004,Mr HUME COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Bourke) [719] Some explanation is due from me. We have had two or three divisions on this subject. The honourable member for Wentworth has been acting as Opposition whip, and previous to the last division, by arrangement between us, no pairs were recorded - When the last division was about to be held, I looked round the chamber to see whether my pairs had gone out, and I thought that none of those honourable members whom -1 had paired were taking part in the division. Perhaps the fault was mine, but I point out that no difference was made to the result of the division, except that if none of those honourable members who had paired had voted, the majority would have been reduced. I admit that a mistake has occurred, and am very sorry for it.",118
1005,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Werriwa) [7.20] - Surely the Committee will accept the amendment, because it is evident that the amount of proposed duty is more than the amount paid in wages for the construction of a harvesTariff ter.

Yet it is proposed depart from a sound rule, which, I think, would have commended itself to even prowas tectionists. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [7.21]. - I am in favour of imposing a duty of £ 1 2 per machine. I am paired with the honourable member for Parkes, but I wish to say that, in my opinion, that duty is enough. When I look round the Chamber I see honourable members who came in here clothed in protectionist doctrines from to toes. It seems to me that a mighty earthquake has shaken their foundation, and that their protectionist principles fallen into a great chasm. Apparently have become so nude of political principles that if it were a personal instead of a tical matter, they would be arrested for decency.",118
1006,Mr FOYNTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Grey) [7.24] - I wish test Australian manufacturers. to tell the honourable member for who has just woke up, that the duty proposed is nearly equivalent to the of labour in the production of a harvester. We are informed on the best authority it is possible to get that 30 per cent, on value of the finished article total cost of labour employed in its production. The only testimony at our disposal represents a fixed duty of £ per machine; so that the honourable member for Darwin is very generous to the manufacturers, who have not had the courage to produce their books or give us any information. They have been eager enough, however, to come down to us and plead for assistance. They want to secure for themselves the Australian market, and yet up to this time they have refused to tell us the cost of production. I look upon it as protection run mad to impose a duty equal to the total cost of the labour employed in the production of a machine. It may suit the honourable member for Darwin, but it will not suit me.",118
1007,Mr STORRER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Bass) [7.26] - At about 2 o'clock this morning I agreed to pair with an honourable member on the understanding that the point at issue would be settled in the course of a few minutes, and that he was to go home. I am in favour of the amendment, and I regret this conthe tinual slating of Australian manufacturers, because it was not at their request that the Commission was appointed. It was represented to the late Government that the people of Australia were suffering through certain manufacturers losing their trade, to and that men were accordingly thrown out of work, and, therefore, the Commission appointed. I am surprised to find that Labour members, who ought to tafke an interest in our working men, prefer money to be sent to Canada or somewhere else than to be given to our own people. I cannot understand why some representatives of worknot ing men should be continually urging that manufacturers should produce their books. If they were in business they would not nose be prepared to produce their books to any Board, and for their cost of production to be published broadcast. I , as a manufachave turer, contend that it is not the province they of Parliament to ask a business man to show his books. I feel certain that impoliporters have never been asked, for instance, into show their invoices to drapers. It seems to me that some honourable members are very fond of importers, but deAt 2 Darwin, o'clock this morning I agreed to now pair under a misapprehension, and I am cost sorry that I did. This morning we have seen two honourable members voting who were paired, six outside paired, while eight the members of the Opposition have been restrepresents the ing in their homes.",118
1008,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Echuca) [7.28] - Thre e 1 2 8s. hours ago a proposition was made to honourable members on this side that the suggested duty of £ 1 2 per machine should be accepted, and a return offer was made that a duty of £ 1 1 would be agreed to, being equal to 25 per cent, on the value of the machine, as found by the Tariff Commission. After careful examination, it has been found that the value is a few shillings under £ 4 4 , so that a duty of £ 1 1 is equivalent to the duty of 25 per cent, recommended by the Commission. The charge that we have no consideration for manufacturers, and favour importers, utterly fails when it is remembered that it is proposed to grant more than double the present duty. I am prepared to follow the lead of the honourable member for Bendigo, and to vote for a duty of £ 1 1 , which is equal to an ad valorem duty of 25 per cent.",118
1009,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Wide Bay) [7.29] - To say that the imposition of high duties would make work for the people and bring about an era of prosperity is just about as accurate as to say that in those countries where the highest duties are levied the greatest destitution exists. If we could give to every Australian industry a protection equal to the total cost of the labour employed in producing the article, what would be the result? According to the honourable member for Bass, there must be a great mystery regarding the cost of producing a smali article like a stripper-harvester, and we are asked to respect it. Messrs. Harland and Wolff, however, will show the cost of each item; but, of course, they would have to produce their, books. Miuch has been said as to the refusal of these manufacturers to produce their books.",119
1010,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I say most decidedly that they ought to produce them.,119
1011,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I have always admired the resolute will of the Minister. When he takes a work in hand he can generally carry it through.,119
1012,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I have never been able to obtain the books.,119
1013,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,And the honourable gentleman wishes to ascertain the facts?,119
1014,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Most decidedly.,119
1015,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Fro m the point of view of the honourable member for Bass, there is a good deal of force in the argument that there are many trade secrets, and that one man does not know what it costs another in the same trade to produce a given article. That argument, however, is not a sufficient justification for the attitude taken up by these manufacturers. We ought to know what is the cost of production, because the Wages Boards will want to know what wages the employees are paid. It is an easy matter to keep a record of the time occupied by a man in working on a piece of machinery. The honourable member for Fremantle inquired where the cost of production begins. In my opinion, it starts from the time that the raw material is taken into the factory.",119
1016,Mr CARPENTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,And that is sometimes a finished product.,119
1017,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"What a notable statement! We produce no steel from Australian ore, and, therefore, we must import for use in the manufacture of these machines what is the finished product of another person.",119
1018,Mr CARPENTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member has missed the point.,119
1019,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Some honourable members may be disposed to be hilarious over the prospect of securing a very high duty, and I shall not regret its imposition if it be the verdict of the Committee; but, at the same time, I would point out that if this proposal be carried to its logical conclusion it will not have the effect which some of mv honourable friends imagine.",119
1020,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Canobolas) [7.34]-- I wish to point out that in New South Wales alone there are 74,000 landholders, 66,000 of whom occupy areas under 1,000 acres in extent, and that they cultivate fully half of the land which they hold. Most of the cultivated land is held by small farmers, whose means are limited, and who have, consequently, to work on a narrow margin. It is essential to their success that they shall be able to obtain their machinery at a reasonable price.",119
1021,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,We propose to enable them to get it at a reasonable price.,119
1022,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,This proposal means that we are to give the local manufacturer a protection equivalent to the total cost of the labour and material employed in building the machines.,119
1023,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Some members of the Opposition have said that a duty of £ 1 1 will be equivalent to the labour cost, but not to the cost of labour and material.",119

1026,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Surely that should be sufficient. As the honourable member for Wide Bay has pointed out, when local manufacturers refuse to produce their books to assist us in estimating the correct valuation to be placed on these machines, they put themselves out of court. I was glad to hear the Minister say that, in his opinion, these books should be produced. If it is possible for an Arbitration Court to secure the production of books in order that necessary information relative to an industry may be obtained, why should we not be able to do the same? From the refusal of the manufacturers to produce their books the inference may fairly be drawn that the proposed duty is not warranted. are only twenty-four manufacturers of agricultural machinery in Australia, as against more than 270,000 farmers, who will be affected by this proposal, and I repeat that if we grant a protection equivalent to the labour cost of these machines we shall give the former substantial assistance.",120
1027,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Werriwa) [7.40] - It is generally urged by protectionists that duties are imposed to cover the difference between the wages in force in the competing and protected' countries. But we are being asked to vote for a duty which will give an advantage to the local manufacturer equal to more than the total sum which he pays in wages. Although the cost of the harvesters has been referred to as about £ 3 7 , I know that when one of the chief manufacturers was trying to obtain financial assistance he said that he could produce machines for between £ 2 8 and £ 2 9 . I informed honourable members of that fact some months ago, and tried to get a member of the Tariff Commission to question Mr MCKay on the subject; but he declined to give any information in regard to cost. The International Harvester Company have stated that their machines do not cost more than £ 2 8 each. As the carriage and other charges upon imported machines amount to £ 1 4 , and the Committee has rejected the proposal to make the duty jQio, honourable members evidently intend to give the local manufacturers an advantage of at least £ 2 5 . Is not that going altogether too far? The Ministry and its supporters are pledged to maintain fiscal peace; but they are so forgetful of their pledges that at the very end of the last session of the Parliament they are bringing forward these controversial proposals. One cannot but feel contempt for [146] their action. The haivesting season is ap proaching, and, as the effect of the proposed duties will be to prohibit importation, there may be a shortage of machines. The promise of the manufacturers not to increase prices is worth noting, because any man could buy up a whole season's output and re-sell at a higher price. Probably the outside local manufacturers are not aware of the agreement between MCKay and the Minister, and have not made arrangements for a supply of timber and other requirements to enable them to meet the increased demand which a stoppage of importation is likely to cause. This, instead of being a deliberative assembly, has become a mere There recording assembly for the registration of agreements made behind our backs. I shall have to vote for the £ 1 1 duty, because it is impossible to get the Committee to agree to a lower rate.",120
1028,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Robertson) [7.49] - I enter my protest against what is being done. The proposed duty means prohibition. In the past, these machines have been sold for as little as £ 6 3 , and we have it in the evidence that a handsome profit could be obtained by selling them at £ 7 0 . As Mr Gladstone said on one occasion, this is not protection-it is imposition and robbery. The users of harvesters are numerous in the. district which I represent, and it is a shameful thing that they should have to pay a duty of jQi 2 on each machine they buy. I hope that the effect will be to bring the Massey-Harris Company and the International Harvester Company into Victoria to compete with those people who want a monopoly of this industry.",120
1029,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I should not object to the Massey-Harris Company.,120

1033,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I smashed that up long ago.,120
1034,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"There is at present a silent combine in the business, because there is no difference in prices. In 1890 in South Australia machines, which required no more labour than those now on the market, were sold at £ 7 3 ; and machines can be produced as cheaply now as then. I intend to protest against this extortion, this robbery of the people-whic h does not result in protection. This industry can defy competition, and, therefore, does not need protection; and I think the Prime Minister and others are honest in saying that the object is prohibition. It is a standing disgrace to the Government to propose prohibition, and the establishment of a monopoly, for which the consumer will ultimately have to pay.  apparent, from the apathy shown on this side of the House, that there is a determination to perpetrate this robbery.",120

With the natural protection df £ 1 4 16s. 6d., and the proposed duty of £ 1 2 , we shall practically give protection amounting to £ 2 6 16s. 6d. on a machine which costs £ 3 8 . Yet honourable members are content to sit down quietly while a deliberate attempt is made to confer this advantage on a few individuals who have craved, at Parliament House and at public meetings, for an increased duty, but who have not had the manliness to show us what is the cost of their product. So far as I am concerned, this duty shall not be imposed. I should be ashamed to meet my constituents-me n who have had to suffer from drought, and whose wives and families have had to live practically on boiled wheat-if I countenanced such a proposal. In Victoria there is a manufacturer of this class of machine who last year made £34,000. Yet honourable members can sit down calmly while this piece of political robbery is going on. So far as I am concerned, if I can get any one to support me, this proposal shall not go through this week. During the whole course of the Tariff debate, a few years ago, there was not a single instance of our having allowed practically the whole cost of labour as the measure of protection. What has the argument been all along with protectionists? They declare that in other parts of the world labour is cheap; and, because of that, they desire to make up the difference between the wages. What is the difference in this particular instance? The difference is practically £ 2 9s. 4d.; and, in consideration of that, it is proposed to give protection amounting to £ 2 6 16s. 6d., or nearly three-fourths of the value of the whole machine.",121

To-day we have been told that out of seventy associations of farmers, fiftv have expressed their opposition to the proposed duty. Really, it would appear as if people in Melbourne knew better what farmers required than do the farmers themselves. It is crue'l and criminal to impose this duty in a dying Parliament. Let the Government go to the country, on this issue; and I venture to say that there would be a very different vote to that which we saw a little while ago. I ask the supporters of the proposed duty to go into the country districts and advocate it. 1 venture to say that no farming com-, munity would return a representative pledged to this policy. When people come here craving for the whole of the market of Australia-urgin g that a wall should be erected around the Commonwealth - is it unreasonable to ask them to tell what it costs to make this machine? Yet the Tariff Commission has been treated with absolute contempt by men who can sit all night here waiting in order that this money may be put into their pockets.

1044,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Then the honourable member would support the imposition of a duty of £ 1 6 per machine?,122
1045,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I said so last night, and I made a similar statement twelve months ago. When the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs in regard to the re-adjustment of the valuation harvesters was under discussion, I stated that if the valuation had been raised to convictions £ 1 0 0 , and a duty much higher than that now proposed by the Government had been collected, the cost of the machines farmer would not have been increased. whom I represent. Results have justified my opinion, inasin much as the increase in the duty by about 100 per cent, did not result in advancing the price of harvesters. With regard to the proposed increase, I think that the entire community. case was very plainly presented by th? honourable member for Bland. The duty that is now being collected amounts to about £ 9 per machine, and according to the figures supplied by the representatives the importers themselves, the value of their machines is about £ 4 6 or £ 4 7 . Thererepresented fore a duty of 25 per cent, would be [ l 6 ] - 2' 4 an equivalent to a fixed impost of £ 1 2 . I am prepared to accept that. Apart from anything that may be said in regard to other industries, the imposition of protective duties upon agricultural implements and machinery has tended to reduce rather than to increase the price to the consumer. Within the last fortnight certain protective duties were proposed for the benefit of the man on the land. Upon that occasion the honourable member for Grey, who is now denouncing those who are supporting a duty of 25 per cent, had nothing whatever to say against a proposal to give the vignerons of Australia a much higher degree of protection.",122

Whilst it is true that a large quantity of salt is produced in his constituency it is not produced for commercial purposes. His vote upon the occasion to which reference has been made was cast in the interests of the producers of South Australia.

If it were proposed to deal with the matby way of excise on every machine sold, there would be some guarantee; but at present the proposal in that.respect is utunworkable. In October, 1902, these put their heads together and formed a combine, in conjunction with the importers, for the purpose of forcing prices. of They fixed a minimum price of £ 8 4 in New South Wales, and £ 8 1 in Victoria. Mr MCKay told the Tariff Commission that he considered those prices only fair. What he terms a fair profit is £ 1 8 2s. 6d. per machine. After the two South Ausmanufacturers joined the combine the price of machines which had formerly inbeen sold for £ 6 3 in the Wimmera District of Victoria was raised to £ 8 1 . The guarantee of the local makers is worth absowas lutely nothing. I am astonished that prorepresentatives of farming constituencies agree to such proposals. Not only the House, sulted by these but the country, has been inmen, who can find time to come here night after night, attend meetings all over the city, and subscribe funds sending men to work up an agitation, but who will not tell us the cost of producing a harvester. We have no desire to interfere with their business If they care to run their concerns without an appeal to the House it is quite a matter of indifference to us what the cost of production is. But when it is deliberately proposed to increase the duty in order to secure to them the Australian market, and to shut out other implements of the kind, we have a right to know the cost of production. Let the proposal be hung up until we can ascertain how much more protection it involves than is now disclosed to us. The only way in which it has been possible to get an idea of the approximate cost of producing a harvester has been to ascertain from one party the cost of the material, and get from another party the percentage of the material in the manufactured article. By that means we have been able to elicit that £ 3 8 is a fair estimate of the cost price. Suppose that a fixed duty of £ 1 2 were imposed, what a silly position a representative of the people would be in when he went on to a platform in his constituency, and was asked by an elector to state the cost of constructing a harvester ! He would have to admit that, although the Parliament had secured the Australian market to the local manufacturers, he could not answer that question. I venture to predict that in the near future there will be an enormous increase in the production of harvesters. We are just approaching the solution of the great question of closer settlement. As the number of settlers increases, so the demand for the harvester will increase, and it will be possible for the manufacturers to penalize the farmers.",123

In this morning's newspaper reference is made to a proposition to resume some millions of acres, and I am satisfied that within the next few years .many thousands of these machines will be in use. We should do nothing to prevent those going on the land from obtaining the machines at the lowest possible rate.",124
1058,Mr RONALD,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The local supply would be reasonable enough.  factories in Australia will not be equal to the demand for these machines a few years hence. On almost every holding where wheat is raised, one of these harvesters is to be found, and the demand for them must steadily increase as the area under closer settlement expands. The Government propose to place these manufactures in the hands of a few. Is it their intention that the farmers of Australia shall not have an opportunity to secure improved machinery from abroad? It is true that the Australian harvester is an excellent machine, but I venture to assert that the manufacturers here have yet to learn much in respect of machinery that is now being imported. If we adopt the Government proposal, it will be said later on that we should protect makers of all kinds of agricultural implements by proportionately high duties. It is a singular thing that whilst the manufacturer requires his tools of trade - and every piece of machine'ry necessary for his work-to be placed on the free list, he is anxious to have a high Tariff wall to protect his own industry. It is unfair 'for the Government to attempt, on the eve of a general election, to force this proposal through the Parliament. Some honourable members appear to know little of the privations suffered by the backwoods men. I know of districts where men have taken up vermin-infested areas which they have to fence in with wire netting before they can produce a sheaf of hay. Men who have taken up these agricultural holdings are fighting valiantly against heavy odds, and yet it is proposed to place them in the hands of these manufacturers, who, instead of rising to the occasion, show, in some cases, a tendency to build unnecessarily heavy machines. To this cause the extent of the importations of harvesters may be largely ascribed. In some cases the weight of the local machine is so much greater than is that of the imported, that an additional horse is necessary to haul it, and that is an important consideration to a struggling farmer. The Government invite us to, in effect, shut our imports, and thus to do away with the incentive to local manufacturers to keep their machines thoroughly up-to-date. I would make a final appeal to the Minister to accept my proposal. It may be suggested that the difference of £ 1 will be of no material importance, but there is no doubt that it will make a great difference to the farmer. There is every reason to suppose that the manufacturers will advance their prices to an extent corresponding with the increase of duty. We know very well that when a duty was imposed upon oatmeal the price of that commodity was advanced to the fullest limit of the protection granted to the local manufacturersSo it is in every other case. We have evidence that the manufacturers of harvesters deliberately entered into a conspiracy to increase the price of their machines from £ 6 3 to £ 8 1 , and have for some years past been deriving the benefit of this advance. To my mind we should be legalizing robbery if we afforded them any further facilities for imposing upon farmers, many of whom have been struggling for years against adverse conditions. Surely a duty of £ 1 0 per machine should be sufficient to give the manufacturers all the necessary protection they need. should, in effect, be sufficient to recoup fhem for the whole of the labour expended. If that is not protection run mad I do not know anything about the subject.",124
1059,Mr CONROY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Werriwa) [9.50] - I cordially endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Grey, and I was very pleased to listen to his contribution to the debate. According to the proposal now before us, the farmers of Australia are to be called upon to pay the whole of the wages of the men employed in the manufacture of harvesters, whilst their employers are to be permitted to pocket the profits. We have been assured that the manufacturers will be required to sell their machines at a smaller price than they would be able to obtain if they were free from alt restrictions. Further, it is started that provision will be made for an immediate reduction of the price to £ 7 5 ; but I would point out that two years ago, before the methods of production were improved, harvesters were being sold for £ 6 5 . Thus the reduction offered is worth absolutely nothing, and is intended merely to deceive the farmers. According to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, the local manufacturers entered into a combination in October, 1904, and raised their prices to £ 8 1 . They were previously selling their machines at £ 7 0 , and at a 10 per cent, reduction on that price in the case of purchases made direct from the manufacturers. As a matter of fact, the Murtoa Farmers' Union had machines offered to them at £ 6 2 each. If it had not been for the combination among the manufacturers, 1ihe stiripper-harvesters would have been available to the farmers at a price much lower than that proposed to be fixed under the Bill which the Minister has promised to introduce. It is perfectly plain that the action now proposed to be taken will have the effect of keeping up prices, instead of exerting an influence in the opposite direction. There will be no competition from outside, and the local manufacturers' ring will be able to work their own sweet will upon the farmers, who are being deceived and tricked in every possible way. I thank the honourable member for Grey for his speech; and I can say that I fully endorse the opinions he expressed.",125
1060,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"New England) [9.55]. - This attempt to raise the duty on harvesters is simply an outrage, especially in , It view of the fact that our manufacturers are already selling these machines at a very great profit. We know that some time ago the price was as low as £ 6 0 , and that it was raised to £ 8 1 , owing to the action of the ring. I refuse to be a party to helping any combination of the kind. I cannot tforget that St was becaujse of the action of the inside men that the ring was brought into existence. The Australian manufacturers could get the whole of the trade by selling their machines at a fair price; but this they have refused to do. One of the importing firms is now selling this machine at £ 7 0 , and we ought not to consent to the proposal before us simply in order to give the Minister an opportunity to say that owing to the imposition of the new duty the price has been reduced. In my opinion, at least £26 worth of the material in each machine is imported, leaving only £ 1 3 worth of labour to be done within Australia.",125
1061,Mr THOMAS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If there are duties on the parts imported, it gives the local .manufacturer a strong case for a duty on the finished article.",125
1062,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"There may be a duty on the smaller parts, although there is no duty on iron and steel; but that is not the point. I desire to emphasize the fact that a duty of £ 1 6 per machine is proposed in order that £ 1 3 worth of work may be created within the Commonwealth.",125
1063,Mr THOMAS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The duty will be reduced to £ 1 2 .,125
1064,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But jthe ""Minister, proposed that it should be £ 1 6 That harvesters can be made here successfully is proved by the immense increase of the local output of late years. Last year the local production largely exceeded the importation. The proposed increase of duty will not benefit the consumers, because it will not reduce prices. On the contrary, it will give the manufacturers an opportunity to charge more for their machines. It is claimed that it will give more employwealth. ment to our people; but while if all the agricultural implements required in Australia are manufactured locally, employment may be found in the industry for perhaps 600 men more than are now engaged in it, work will be taken from the large number now connected with the business of importing. The coming here of ships gives work to our people in many directions, and 'the stoppage of importation would injure them by putting an end to their employment. It is, however, well known that it is impossible to manufacture locally all the agricultural implements and machinery required by Australian farmers and cultivators. Between 1900 and 1904 the value of the output of the Victorian implement industry increased by £199,000, and the number of Hands employed by 350, so that 600 is a very liberal estimate of the number to whom employment would be given if the whole agricultural implement trade was under the control of the local manufacturers. At the present time there are 2.770 people connected with the industry.",125
1065,Mr THOMAS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Is the honourable member sure of his figures? Mr. LONSDALE - Yes . They have been taken from the Tariff Commission's report. In Victoria the number of hands employed in the industry in 1899 was 1,107, and in 1905, 1,624; in South Australia in 1899, 242, and in 1905, 723; in New South Wales in 1899, 193, and in 1905, 386; and in Western Australia in 1899, 38, and in 1905, 39. There are no figures available for Queensland and Tasmania. Thus it will be seen that the total number employed in the Commonwealth in 1905 was only 2,770. Adding to that number the 600 to whom work might be given if the whole of. the agricultural implement making were done in Australia-whic h is an over-estimate-the total number then employed would be only 3,370. To get the 7,13 worth of work done in making a harvester the people of Australia are asked to pay a duty of £16. No doubt these remarks are displeasing to those who are helping the manufacturers tofleecethe public, but that will not prevent me from proclaiming my views on the subject. The Treasurer, speaking yesterday at a luncheon, said that last year Australia's exports were valued at £54,000,000, of which £38,000,000 represented the produce from farming and grazing, while £16,000,000 was mineral Yet, for the sake of the miserable industry of harvester making, which has proved that it can do well without a duty, it is proposed to penalize our producers in every direction. I shall vote to secure whatever reduction of the proposed duty can be obtained. Question-That the words proposed to be inserted be so inserted-put . The Committee divided.

1072,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Hindmarsh) [10.42] - The Government are placing their supporters in a very peculiar position. I said last night that I was entirely in favour of their proposals, but we now find the Government running away from them, although they have not been defeated. I do not feel inclined to depart from the views that I expressed last night, but the action of the Government may give rise to misapprehension as to the position occupied by some honourable members. It is questionable whether the duty on strippers ought to be reduced. I should like the Minister to inform the Committee what is the difference between the cost of making a stripper and that of' manufacturing a stripper-harvester? Some honourable members may assert that a higher duty than the present one means prohibition, but I do not think so. Even if that were so, it would be an inducement to me to vote for the duty. I shall not quarrel with the Government f f AYES. they think that they are making a fair proposal in view of the reduction of the duty upon stripper-harvesters.

1073,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Boothby) [10.47]. - I understand that strippers are sold at J- from £ 4 5 to £ 5 5 , and if that be so, the proposedduty of £ 8 would correspond more closely than would £ 6 , with the duty imposed upon stripper-harvesters.",128
1074,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.48] - When the duties were first decided upon, they were based upon a 25 per cent, ad valorem impost, and were fixed with due regard to the relative values of the machines. In view of the fact that the duty upon stripper harvesters Has been reduced by one-fourth, NOES. I am seeking to reduce the duty upon strippers in similar proportion, and thus Hutchison, J. preserve the harmony which characterized Tudor, F. G. the original proposals.  imported.",128
1075,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That isi my impression, because I know that strippers are one of the most common articles of manufacture by country implement makers. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That after the words "" Metal parts of stripper harvesters and strippers, per lb., 2£d.,"" the words "" and on and after 8th September, per lb., 2d.,"" be inserted.",128
1076,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"New England) [10.50] - I understand that the metal parts referred to can be obtained at from 12s. to 16s. per cwt., and, as 2d. per lb. would be equivalent to 18s. 8d. per cwt., it will be seen that the duty would be equivalent to over 100 per cent, ad valorem. It would be absurd to impose any such duty. It appears to me that although honourable members were elected under a pledge to preserve fiscal peace, they are intent upon introducing prohibition. If the present proposal were carried it would be in distinct violation of the pledge given to the electors. At the very outside, the duty should not exceed 25 per cent, ad valorem; therefore nothing beyond a duty of id. per lb. should be imposed. Local manufacturers find it to their advantage to import some of the parts instead of making them here, and if we impose too high a duty we shall penalize our manufacturers, and at the same time place unnecessary obstacles in the wav of owners of imported machines who may require duplicate parts. I wish to encourage the manufacturing industry, but not by imposing duties. My desire is to make everything free of duty. It seems to me surd to attempt to force our industries along to an extent that is not warranted by the requirements of the community. I feel very strongly disposed to move that the duty should be 25 per cent, ad valorem.",128
1077,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Corinella) [10.55] - If my memory serves me rightly, a request was made by some of the manufacturers for a duty of £ 2 5 upon stripper-harvesters and a duty of 2^d. per lb. upon the metal parts. The proposed duty upon the parts was regarded as corresponding with and proportionate to the £ 25 duty upon the completed machines. Therefore 2d. per lb. would not be the equivalent of the reduced duty of £12 per machine. I am informed that, roughly speaking, there is a ton of metal parts in a stripper-harvester, in a duty of 2d. per lb. upon such parts would represent an impost of £ 1 8 13s. 4d. - a n amount very largely in excess of the duty proposed to be levied on the completed machine. The Tariff Commission recommended that there should be an increased duty on only some of the parts, namely, malleable castings, and that the duty should be fixed at 20 per cent., and not 25 per cent. Consequently the Government proposal of 2d. per lb.' is largely in excess the proportion which it should bear to the duty upon the completed machine, and also largely in excess of the amount proposed by the Tariff Commission. In view of the reduction of.the duty upon stripper-harvesters to £1,2, the duty on the parts should be reduced to id. or i j d . per lb. If we impose too high a duty, it will operate to the detriment of the farmers, who will have to pay very much higher prices for duplicate parts of imported machines. So far as I can work it out, i d . is the proper proportion of duty according to the Tariff Commission's report. To my mind, it would be detrimental to our farmers to place a high duty on parts.",129
1078,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Part s are always sold at prices proportionately higher than those charged for complete machines.,129
1079,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes , and to put a high duty on them will increase that difference, and burden those who now have imported machines.",129
1080,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Moira) [n.3] - The duty on stripper-harvesters has been reduced by one-fourth.,129
1081,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is not a duty of -2\&. per lb. on parts out of proportion when abcompared with the original duty of £ 1 6 on a stripper-hars'ester ?,129
1082,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not think so, talking into consideration the amount of metal. The machines vary in weight froiir 23 to 26 cwt. The parts of the American machines are known as malleable castings.",129
1083,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The duty covers all metar parts.,129

1087,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The proposed, duty would increase that trouble.",129

1090,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable and of learned member may be able to get that information by examining the catalogue.,129
1091,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The makers' profits come largely from the sale of parts.,129
1092,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"For that reason we should be careful not to allow parts to be imported at duties relatively lower than are charged for machines. Otherwise, we may have parts imported and put together here.",129
1093,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Supposin g the weight cf a machine to be 24 cwt, a duty of 2d. per lb. on parts would be equivalent to £22 8s. on the completed machine.",129
1094,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I canr.ot say offhand how much of a harvester is wood and how much is metal; but I think that 2d. is a fair duty to impose on parts, having regard to the fact that the duty upcn the machines is £ 1 2 each.",129
1095,Mr BROWN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Canobolas) [n.9] - On e of the reasons why farmers buy imported machines is that it is easier to get satisfactory parts for them in the event of repairs being needed, or replacements becoming necessary! "" The Australian manufacturers have not given sufficient attention to the manufacture of duplicate parts, whereas with the Americans it is a specialty. It is a common experience with farmers to have tremble with Australian duplicate parts, which very often do not fit. That has been my experience. Moreover, the American parts are more durable than the Australian parts. The Tariff Commissioners, speaking on this subject, sayMost of the parts of an imported stripperharvester consist of malleable castings, in the manipulation and use'of malleable castings that the secret of the success of American and duty ? Canadian competition in Australia is to be found. The Americans and Canadians used very little forged iron, every joint or boss, or anything that kind, is made out of malleable iron, means a great saving -(Q . 16158.) On the hand, the Australian implements are made offorged iron, or steel, which is more expensive. Malleable castings are not made in any tity in Australia, and such as are made sent are not so cheap as those imported. rageous one. America has practically a monopoly in the - duction of malleable castings, and can easily undersell local manufacturers. Australian facturers cannot produce the essential parts the machine as cheaply as their Canadian American rivals; such parts can only be out cheaply in the form of malleable castings. The honourable and learned member for Corinella is right in drawing attention this matter. If the duty were made high it would prejudice the users of magret"" chines. I find that in 1905 the parts ported into New South Wales were valued at £ 1 1 , while those imported into land were valued at £398, and those imidea, ported into South Australia at £1,325 ; the interest of both farmers and manufacthese turers-until the local industry has proved its manufacture of parts-wil hest served by keeping down the duty on assistance parts. Instead cf reducing the proposed seen offers the duty by only Jd., I think that it should be ""reduced by i j d .",129
1096,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Echuca) [n.15] - We ought to be very careful as to what action we take in this matter, because I am it is not the desire of any honourable ber that the farmers who have purchased American machines during the last year two should be penalized. Within the from abroad. period indicated there has been considerable competition between the various foreign implement makers, and that competition had the effect of reducing the price of harvester to the Australian farmer. I would not be fair to penalize him now requiring him to pay a heavy duty upon the duplicate parts which he may require for the machines which are already Those parts would be difficult to obtain locally. Many of them are patented, and could not be made here. They have to be manufactured by a peculiar process of annealing. They are first cast in the ordinary way, and then put into furnaces for some days, during which period they become very tough., I should like to know if the Minister cannot see his way to meet those who have already purchased Ameriand it is can machines, and allow those who may purchase them hereafter to pay the full",130
1097,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"New England) of [n.18] - When Mr MCKay appeared bewhich fore the Tariff Commission he stated that other these malleable castings could be landed here at from 2^d. to 3d. per lb. The quanMinister's proposal to levy a duty of 2d. at preper lb. upon them is therefore an outI t is quite natural that promanufacturers should charge relatively more manufor the duplicate parts of these machines of than they do for the machines themselves. and Assuming that they are of the weight inturned dicated by Mr MCKay, their cost at 2|d. per lb. would work out at £ 3 8 . If we levy upon these duplicate parts the heavy to duty proposed by the' Minister we shall too merely be penalizing the farmers. I rethat there is no disposition on the part imof Victorian representatives to view this matter from a broad and liberal standQueenspoint. They are imbued with only one namely, that of enriching local manuand facturers. Personally I am of opinion that duplicate parts should be admitted imfree. The only State in the Commonl be wealth which is pleading for Government in these matters is Victoria. I may tell Committee that I have to manufacture these parts for about 16s. per cwt., so that the duty proposed by the Government is equivalent to an impost of quite 100 per cent. I appeal to the protectionists to be reasonable in sure this matter. Even the honourable member memfor Moira must recognise that the proposed duty would constitute a heavy tax upon or those who have already purchased machines",130
1098,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Moira) [11.25] - I has estimate that the maximum weight of the the duplicate parts that would be required durt ing the life of an ordinary harvester would by be 5 cwt. Except in case of accident, the only parts which a farmer would need to renew would be the bearings, the spindles, in use. and the segment of the main driving wheel. The life of an ordinary harvester is about twelve years. I am estimating that during that period it harvests 250 acres each season, or a total of 3,000 acres. I venture to say that my estimate is a fair statement of the position. I feel confident that the weight of metal in the duplicate parts that would need to be renewed would not exceed 5 cwt., or, roughly speaking, 600 lbs. A duty of 2d. per lb. upon these parts would therefore mean £ 5 , which amount distributed over twelve years would be equivalent to 8s. 4d. per annum. The proposal of the Government, if adopted, will bring this duty into harmony with the duties that have already been agreed to. My contention is that the imposition of a protective duty causes a reduction in the price of the article protected.",130
1099,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,There would be' no sense in importing these duplicate parts.,131
1100,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Exactly . The point which I wish to emphasize is that there will be no increase in the cost of these parts if we adopt the proposal of the Government.,131
1101,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Kalgoorlie) [11.30] This is a proposal that requires to be carefully considered, and in respect of. which more information should be forthcoming from the' Minister. Whilst I am prepared to vote for a duty which will give the Australian manufacturer the local market-subjec t to certain conditions as to selling prices, and so forth- I do not propose to erect a tariff wall against the introduction of parts that may be required under circumstances that render it impossible to impose the conditions I have mentioned. We must be careful not to impose such a duty on parts as would nullify the provision we have made in regard to the complete machine. I have made a rough calculation as to what would be the effect of the Government proposal. Assuming, that the weight of the machine complete is about 24 cwt., a duty of 2d. per lb. on the whole of the weight would amount to about £ 2 2 8s.",131
1102,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,But the honourable member is wrong in his premises. It is not proposed to impose a duty in. respect of the total weight.,131
1103,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"A duty of 2d. per lb. would amount to £ 2 2 8s. on all the parts necessary to make up a complete machine. This successfully disposes of the objection that under this provision it would be possible for these parts to be imported and fitted up for sale as a machine, since the duty paid in respect of them would be double that imposed upon the completed article. If only three-fourths of the weight of the machine were subjected to this duty the total impost would be about £ 1 6 16s. per machine, so that even under that duty no one would think of importing the parts separately and assembling them here. My experience leads me to agree with the honourable member for Moira that the main bearings, spindles, segments, and, perhaps, one or two others, are the parts most likely to require renewal, and that we must be careful to impose such a duty as not to place at a disadvantage those who already own imported machines, and may require any of these duplicate parts. In the circumstances, therefore, I think that a duty of i j d . per lb. on parts-whic h would be equal to about £ 1 3 in respect of the complete machine-woul d afford effective protection. If the Minister will accept my proposal, he will deal fairly with the Australian manufacturer, and at the same time safeguard the interests of the consumers.",131
1104,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Wide Bay) [ n - 3 i ] There is a good deal of force in the remarks just made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, but there is another aspect of this question that yet remains to be dealt with. I refer to the fact that stripper harvesters, on which we have imposed a duty of £ 1 2 , are not brought out here as complete machines. As a matter of fact, the parts are largely assembled here. That is a point that should not be overlooked. The proposal of the Government is to impose on duplicate parts a duty which will be almost double that on the complete machine. As some parts are in greater demand than others, it might pay those who supply them to import from time to time complete machines, and to sell them in separate pieces. Whilst I held office ss Minister of Trade and Customs it was urged that importers should be compelled to bring out their machines in a complete state, the idea being that the cost of transit would in that way be increased. Such a proposition would be scouted by any man who believes that no one should be subjected to unnecessarily costly shipping freights. The imposition of a high duty would undoubtedly be unjust to these who have alreadv ' purchased machines from oversea. Parts have to be replaced from time to time, and it would be unjust to penalize, the owner of one of these machines to the extent of even jQi per annum in respect of the duty on parts requiring to be renewed. I am sure the Committee does not desire that those who purchased machines under the Tariff prevailing prior to the introduction of these proposals should be prejudiced in any way or disadvantaged by a sudden increase of duty. The proposed duty is too high. I think that a duty of i j d . per lb. would be ample. I have a suggestion to make to overcome the difficulty in regard to those who have already purchased imported machines. My proposal is that for six or twelve months we should allow these parts to come in at the rate of i d . per lb., so that those requiring duplicates could obtain the necessary stock.",131
1105,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Does the honourable member know that the importers have frequently thrown an implement completely out of order owing to their inability to supply, perhaps, one component part.",132
1106,Mr FISHER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is a serious charge to make. If importers carry on business in that way it is, to say the least, surprising that they obtain any sale for their machines. Even in that regard the local manufacturers have a great advantage over their foreign competitors. I trust that the Minister will, be able to see his way to permit of the almost free importation of metal parts of harvesters and strippers, so that those who require duplicate parts for imported machines may not be unduly penalized. I am sure that honourable members have no desire to inflict an injustice.",132
1107,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) [11.46] - I find that some difficulty was experienced in substituting a fixed duty for the ad valorem duty recommended by the Tariff Commission, and an approximate amount had to be adopted. The prices of the parts range from about 2d. per lb. to is. i d . per lb., and a fixed duty of 2^d. would correspond as nearly as possible with a duty of £ 1 6 per machine. I think that, if anything, 2id. per lb. is equivalent to something slightlv in excess of 25 per cent., because the departmental officers had to strike an average of the various prices. As a rule, only the smaller parts are imported. Having regard to all the circumstances. \ am willing to reduce the duty to if d . per lb. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

1116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I think that we shall do well to adopt the old Victorian duties, under which the industry with which we are now dealing, and others, flourished. If the Victorian Parliament thought fit to reduce the duty from 20 per cent, to 15 per cent., further reason is afforded why we should adopt the latter rate. We have been told by the representatives of Victoria that all sorts of misfortunes have befallen the manufacturers of that State since the rates of duty prevailing under the old Victorian Tariff were abandoned and lower duties were substituted by the Commonwealth Parliament. They have represented that prosperity would be fully restored if the old Victorian duties were revived. Certainly, the Victorian manufacturers did well enough, and the implement makers sufficiently taxed the Victorian farmers under a 15 per cent, impost.",133

1120,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Dalley) [11.59] - I shall support the amendment. I think that, as the Victorian Parliament,' possiblyled by the Prime Minister, adopted a rate of 15 per cent., and as the other States, particularly New South Wales, were not accustomed to these high duties, it is asking us to make too big a plunge to propose a duty of 25 per cent. that the Government will accept the compromise which has been offered.",133
1121,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Franklin) [12.2]. - Ha d not the amendment been moved, I should have asked the Committee to leave out all these items, with a view to leaving the duties upon them as they stand in the original Federal Tariff. The House of Representatives, after thoroughly threshing the matter out. agreed to a duty of 15 per cent, on the articles under review, which the Senate made 10 per cent., and 12^ per cent, was fixed upon as a compromise. The Victorian rate, which was the highest in Australia on agricultural implements, was only 15 per cent., and I ask honourable members, not to put a heavier duty on the farmers' tools of trade. The question which I hope the country will be asked to decide' within the next few weeks is whether the great primary industries of Australia exist for the sake of a few Melbourne manufacturers, or whether the Melbourne manufacturers exist for the sake of those who buy their machines. We are continually hearing from those who advocate the piling up of duties that the manufacturers say this and that; but surely the users of these implements deserve consideration. My experience has been that the farmers receive very little consideration at the hands of honourable members. A majority is always ready to vote for duties which will bleed the farmer to enrich the wealthy few in the cities. The members of the Labour Party talk of the necessity of distributing among the many the wealth which is now in the hands of a few, and yet they help the protectionists to compel the poor to contribute out of their poverty to the wealth of the few by swelling the bank balances of the Melbourne manufacturers.

1123,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is the construction placed upon it by the Chairman of Committees. Another point made by the honourable member was that the higher the duties on articles of trade the cheaper will those articles be to the consumers. A third point was that, because the Victorian I trust farmers get certain railway concessions, the farmers of the Commonwealth must pay more for their tools of trade, in order to benefit certain Victorian manufacturers.",133

Victoria has been working under the policy of protection for fourteen years, and it is the only State that is howling for more protection. The more she gets the more she likes it. If the whole of the agricultural implement business of the Commonwealth were captured by the local manufacturers they would not be able to afford employment to more than 600 men.

In years past, the particular orable members to whom he referred, were satisfied with a duty of 15 per cent., cause the working man was not then deriving any advantage from it under the law. To-dav. however, the position is very him ? different. The proposed increase of duty is sought not in the interests of the workers, but in the interests of the manufacturers. The latter are compelled to pav higher wages than they did formerly, and to comcommunitv,ply with certain conditions, and as a sult the Victorian representatives in this Tariff. Committee wish to recoup them at the expense of the farmer. I am glad that the honourable member for Maranoa has seen through their little scheme. The proposed duty is championed for the purpose of increasing the price of imported ploughs, so that the local manufacturers will be able to demand a higher price. That higher price will be paid by the farmers of the Commonwealth. That is the idea underlying the imposition of the proposed duty. The representatives of Victoria are endeavouring to bolster up the local manufacturers with a view to "" getting at "" the general community. The articles enumerated in this schedule are the tools of trade of the farmer. I think that our manufacturers can make these implements just as successfully as they - are made elsewhere, but they are not satisfied to accept a similar rate of profit. This morning I stated that the annual value of agricultural implements imported into Australia was £329,000. I find, however, that I omitted to deduct from that sum the value of our exports which amounts to £48,000. It will be seen that the total annual value of the agricultural implements imported into the Commonwealth is only £280,000. If we'commanded the whole of the trade in this industry it would not afford very much additional employment.

1243,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have already said that it did.

I recognise it. He us that the farmers were well protected. He us that they had nothing to lose, and that were well provided for in comparison with the other sections of the community. Unfortunately for myself, I have not the good fortune of agreeing with the honourable gentleman. We are told that the farmer has his reaper and his binder free. So he has. Is his plough free? Is his harrow free? Is his chaff-cutter free? Is the very twine with which duce free? Certainly not. This shows that the farmer has much to gain, and that there is much that he ought to gain, before he is placed on a level with his more fortunate brother in the town. I endorse this statement, and refer to it as something that is pertinent to the question before the Chair. I should like at this stage to read what was said by Mr now Senator-Best , a member of the Victorian Government, who was in charge of the Tariff Revision Bill in the State Legislative Assembly. At page. 1088 of the Victorian Hansard, vol. 77, session 1895-6. Mr Mclntyre is reported to have interjected, in the course of a speech by that gentleman : "" Would you accept the amendment, then?""' To this he replied:The Government could, not accept the amendment, for the reason that in some instances it would have the - effect of making a reduction from 30 to 15 per cent. So far as agricultural implements were concerned, the Government simply accepted the recommendation of the Tariff Board, and it would appear that it was not against the wish of some of the agricultural implement makers, at all events, that the proposal to reduce the duty from 20 to 15 per was made. That was the duty on agricultural implements.",141

1253,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The same considerations that then influenced the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Laancoorie, and the honourable member for Echuca, should weigh with them now. The farmers have the same needs and necessities today as they had then. I am not advocating a reduction of the existing duty. Ploughs are now subject to a protective duty of iz£ per ""cent., and I think that a 15 per cent, duty would afford fair protection, and would be as much as the farmer should be asked to pay. In fairness to the agriculturists, the ploughs to which I am referring, which are different from those manufactured in Victoria, should be admitted at the existing rate of duty. I admit that in the heavy classes of ploughs, the Victorian implements are among the best in the world, but the ploughs to which I have been referring are of a lighter class, suitable for woriking with one horse and for use in orchards and in light volcanic soils. Most of these ploughs have been cent, imported in the past, and we should give the farmer the advantage of a lower rate of duty. I would also suggest that plough mould-boards 'should be admitted free of duty. I am given to understand that imported mould-boards are almost entirely used by our implement manufacturers.",142

We have a very great Commonwealth-on e of great splendour and great promise. But, with all its magnificence, I shall not think much of it if it is not going to make happier and tetter the lot of the people in Australia who have to labour - My view of protection is that it is part of a great scheme for the amelioration of the lot of those, who have to labour- I draw no distinction between labourers, whether they use the plough, the pick, or the pen. I think that the honourable member for Maranoa was right when he said that we have to look"" to the welfare of the workers who are engaged in these industries. I have never been an advocate of protection by means of Tariff duties merely to make fortunes for manufacturers, and I should like to inform the honourable member that the same Parliament that passed the Victorian Tariff in 1895 passed the Factories and Shops Act, which made provision for Wages Boardsthe first Act of its kind in Australia. In this House at the present time there are a number of honourable members, including the Prime Minister, the 'honourable member for Laanecoorie, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, the honourable member for Bourke, the honourable member for Moira, the honourable member for Gippsland, and others, who sat in that Parliament and gave protection to the manufacturers, not merely for the sake of the employers, but for the general welfare of the consumers and the workers. The same honourable members also helped to place upon the statute-book the Factories and Shops Act, which was a humane measure, and which was passed in spite of the resistance of the free-traders. It is the protectionists and not the free-traders, except connected withi the Labour Party, who have done so much for the workers of Australia.",142
1257,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The free-traders have done as much for the workers in New South Wales.,143

1260,Mr ISAACS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"During the political history of Victoria the free-traders as such, have done very little indeed to soften the lot of the worker, and give him better conditions. I say that that is a fair answer to make to the honourable member for ""Maranoa. I think that the Prime Minister can fairlv claim the credit of having originated the Factories and Shops Act. That measure was gradually developed, and eventually he was able, alonir with others, including myself, to put it upon the statute-book. We feel very strongly, and I think we can share the feelings of the honourable member for Maranoa, and those of the same political mould of thought as himself, that sweating is an abhorrent thing. We desire not only to prevent the Australian worker from being sweated by the man standing alongside him, but also to prevent him from being sweated by men working abroad. There is no reason why, whilst preventing sweating upon our own soil, we should at the same time allow the products of sweated labour to come into the Commonwealth, and compete with goods produced here. Therefore, I cannot understand how free-trade and labour legislation can go hand in hand. Labour legislation for the improvement of the lot of the workers forms one of the great parts of the scheme of protection, and I believe that our friends of the Labour Party will soon realise that they cannot provide means for paying good honest wages to the workers unless they protect the manufacturers from the. sweated labour of foreign countries.  afraid of.

With regard to the observations of the honourable member for Corangamite, the remarks I made upon the occasion mentioned I hold to now, and, if the same Tariff were before me, I should make the same statements. They have been quoted as if they were used in reference to protection, and not to that particular Tariff.

I shall support the proposed duties, beI believe that in doing so I shall assist those, who have honoured me by reand turning me as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. To my mind, protection is not for the manufacturers only. Provision is to be made in connection with these Tariff alterations for the protection the workers employed in our factories, as well, for the protecjtion of the consumers. I believe that the farmers will get as much advantage from the proposals as will any other class of the community. been We are always expressing the desire that more people shall be settled on the .land;, but already the production of our farmers is overtaking the home market, which is the best market. As that production increases, the surplus must be sent into the markets of the world to compete with the produce of countries where cheap labour is employed, unless, by encouraging existing manufactures, and creating others, If we do that, we shall increase the markets of farmers, and in those markets they will be protected, just as the manufacturers and skilled employees will be protected, from the competition of sweated or low-paid If I could have mv will, I would the 20 per cent, ad valorem duty to the list of articles which it is proposed I had something to do with the placing of the duty on combined huskers, baggers, and in other machines used for the marketing maize. It is sometimes asked why is it, Australia can produce a superior article, that that article cannot command the local In reply, I should like to give the experience of Mr Barbat, of Ipswich, who put a considerable amount of money into an engineering plant there, and commenced to manufacture a corn-sheller and husker which is supposed to be the best in the world, its capacity being twice that of the imported American machine. He was able to put his invention on to the market at a cost of £ 7 5 , but before he could get an agent to sell it for him he had to promise to pay him £ 2 5 , letting him have the machine for £ 5 0 . Moreover, the agent refused to handle it unless he promised that he would not give that right to any one else. When he took over his works there were 200 or 250 men employed there; but when the Tariff Commission was making its investigation in Brisbane the number was only 70, because of the competition which he has to fight. His evidence will be found on page 2184 of the minutes of evidence relating to ""'machinery. Examined by Senator-Higgs, he saidFor one class of machine we used to get £50 from this firm, and their price to the farmer was £75. We thought that, instead' of allowing the firm to have this large profit, we could do better; but on approaching other implement men outside, we found that they would not touch our machines unless we paid them a commission of from 35 per cent, to 40 per cent. Even then they were prepared to undertake the agency only on the understanding that they handled everything we manufactured. That is one reason why Australian manufactures are not making'the headway which their merit warrants. This is another part of his examination91353. You say, on your oath, that they gave as the reason for refusing to handle your goods that they would be foolish if they enabled you to build up an industry which must sooner or later cut them out?-Yes . When questione'd' as to the superiority of his machine, he gave this evidence91441. In connection with the corn-shellerto which you' have referred, could you tell us whether it embodies the original ideas of anyAustralian mechanics?-The whole machine is an Australian invention, and is manufactured solely from Australian material. The only imported material used in its construction is the pig-iron and the raw bar-iron. Everything else is manufactured at our works, or sawn from colonial timbers. 91442. Are the imported corn-shellers different from yours, or are they merely imitations?They are quite different. 91443. How do they compare with yours in efficiency?- ! do not think that they are within 20 per cent, of ours, which is a superior machine. Mr Wilkinson. 91444. How do you compare in price?-We sell a 40-bag-per-hour machine for ^75, whereas the Marcelles machine, which is imported from America, is sold for ^128, and is not capable of turning out more than 20 to 25 bags per hour. This man cannot get his machines placed on the market on fair and equitable terms, because of the profits insisted upon by the agents. I am satisfied that I shall be justified in supporting these duties for the protection of Australian industries, and that my action will be endorsed by the farmers of my constituency. Whether that happens or not, I am convinced that I am taking the right step, and that in passing this legislation we shall be benefiting the farmers. They may have to pay a little more for their implements until internal competition brings prices down again, but that will not be for long, while they will have the great advantage of a larger home market. The Australian scale of living is more liberal than that of other countries. Heads of families can give their children better food and education than can a great majority of the people elsewhere; and when we have hundreds of thousands of workmen connected with factories settled in the country under reasonable conditions, the farmer and Ihe community at large will gain a great advantage.",144
1270,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Riverina) [3.15] Prior fo the adjournment for luncheon, the suave and conciliatory honourable member for New England doubted the veracity of my statement that he had voted in favour of certain protective duties in the New South Wales Parliament. I have before me a copy of the New South Wales Hansard., and I now say that the statements which I made were perfectly accurate. At the instance of the late Sir George Dibbs, who was Premier of New South Wales at the time, a very mild - protective duty-bu t one which was of great assistance to the farmers-ha d been levied upon imported grain and foodstuffs of all kinds. The honourable member for New England assisted the right honourable member for East Sydney, who was his leader, to remove that duty. He also assisted to abolish an impost upon silks and satins which taxed the wealthy classes, and substituted for them taxes upon the necessaries of life.",145
1271,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What were they?,145
1272,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member voted to impose a protective duty of 3d. per gallon upon beer.,145
1273,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I have always supported beer and spirit duties.,145
1274,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,He also assisted to .re-impose a duty upon tea.,146
1275,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Is that a protective duty ? The honourable member's charge against me was that I had supported protective duties, and I repeat that the accusation is untrue.",146
1276,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"As the honourable member has again challenged the accuracy of my statement, I should like to substantiate it by quoting from the New South Wales Hansard.",146
1277,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I cannot see that the action of the honourable member for New England in the New South Wales Legislature has anything whatever to do with the question which is before the Chair.,146
1278,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"As the rules of the House will not permit me to confirm my statement upon the present occasion, I wish to tell the farmers that there is no man in the public life of Australia who has more deliberately attempted to gull them by preaching one thing and practising another than has the honourable member. ""For partypurposes, he has done everything that he could against the interests of the farmers, and at the same time he has helped those who did not require assistanceFor example, he has ""helped"" the farmer bytaxing his land and his breakfast table, and by imposing a duty upon tea. Yet in a manner peculiar to himself he has the audacity to deny the accuracy of my statements, the confirmation of which is to be found in the New South Wales Hansard reports. I do not wish to occupy the time of honourable members unduly, but upon a future occasion I shall embrace the opportunity of showing to the public exactly the type of politician that the honourable member is.",146
1279,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"New England) [3.21]. - I cannot allow the honourable member for Riverina or any other honourable member to make statements concerning me which are not correct. He has produced the New South Wales Hansard in support of his charges. If he will hand that publication to me, I - will undertake to show that his assertions are absolutely unfounded.",146
1280,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Upon a point of order, I desire to know whether there is no limit to a discussion of this kind, which, in my opinion, is entirely foreign to the question before the Chair?",146
1281,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"A good deal of the irregularity is caused by the Committee itself refusing to assist me to maintain order. I would also point out to the honourable member that the question before the Chair opens up the fiscal issue, and that, therefore, it is quite competent for the honourable member io deal with the matter which he is discussing.",146
1282,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have been charged with having supported protective duties in the New South Wales Parliament. The accuracy of that statement. I absolutely deny. I have never voted in favour of protective duties. The honourable member for Riverina has quoted the duty upon beer as a protective duty. I have always supported levying the heaviest possible duty upon beer and spirits moie from a moral rather than a protective stand-point. He also stated that I voted to impose a duty upon tea. That is not a protective duty, and if I had the opportunity to do so again, I would vote for a similar impost. I maintain that all the revenue derived from a duty upon tea finds its way into the Treasury. It is purely a revenue duty. When the honourable member, after a diligent search, can bring against me only such paltry charges as these",146
1283,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I could quote a number of others, but the Chairman will not permit me to do so.",146
1284,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It shows that his statements have very slight foundation in fact. When I entered the Chamber, I gathered from the remarks of the honourable member for Moreton that he favoured the imposition of a duty upon cotashellers. I understand .that there are two kinds of cornshellers in use here'. The locally manufactured article is sold at £ 7 5 , and the imported at £128. If the difference between the prices of those articles is not sufficient to enable our own people to manufacture cornshellers, I maintain that a duty of 20 per cent, will be of no 1 assistance to them. Amendment negatived.",146
1285,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Boothby) [3.28] I move That after the words "" a d valorem, 20 per cent.,"" the following proviso be inserted :, : Conditional upon the passage of an Excise Act imposing duties equal to 50 per centum of the Customs duties in this Schedule, and a Bounty Act being passed during this session providing for the payment of a bounty (equal to the amount of Excise paid) to such manufacturers as receive a certificate from the Registrar of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court showing that the wages and general conditions of employment in their factories were not less favourable to the workmen employed therein than the wages and conditions prescribed by awards of Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts lawfully established in the States in Australia."" I look upon this proposal as one of very great importance. It is infinitely more important than were the duties which we have been discussing. If an industry is worth protecting, it ought to be able to provide for good wages and fair conditions of labour for the workers engaged in it, as well as to return a reasonable profit to the manufacturer. If it will not come within those requirements, it is not worthy of protection. If it is worth developing, then we ought, as far as possible, by legislation, to insure that the benefit of the protection granted it shall extend to the workers as well as to the employers. Difficulty always been experienced in determining the best way to secure these conditions. I do not suppose that we can arrive at any means of absolutely insuring that, in all cases, the workers shall have a fair share of the advantages derived from protective duties. But the proposal which has hitherto found most favour is that made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that the power to pass industrial legislation should be vested in the Commonwealth Parliament, in order that we mav insure to the full the advantage of absolute free-trade between the States, and pass, as the natural corollary of our protective legislation, industrial laws that will make the workmen more confident than they are under present conditions of being able to participate in the benefits of the system. I think honourable members will agree that, while such a scheme is desirable, some time would necessarily elapse before it could be carried into effect, and that meanwhile we might have sweating existing in industries protected by legislation passed by this Parliament. We have Wages Boards in Victoria, and an Arbitration Court in New South Wales, as well as in Western Australia. But the workers in South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania have absolutely no protection from the sweating evil. In some cases, in order to avoid conditions imposed by Wages Boards for the protection of workmen, the work of Victorian factories has been removed to Tasmania and South Australia.",146
1286,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Whol e factories have removed.,147
1287,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I cannot speak with authority on that point: but I know that work at one time carried out in Victoria has been sent to South Australia and Tasmania by persons anxious to evade the humane conditions imposed by the Wages Boards of this State. Such a state of affairs ought not to prevail. It is a barrier to absolute Inter-State free-trade and does serious injury to the States which have humane legislation. In this respect Victoria has set an example which the other States might well emulate. The Government of South Australia sought to copy her legislation, but their intentions were frustrated by representatives of the wealthy sections of the community in the Legislative Council - It is almost painful to contemplate the fact that these representatives always prevent the passing of humanitarian legislation. That, at has all events, has been the experience of South Australia. The wealthiest man in the Legislative Council of that State-on e of the wealthiest men in Australia-submitte d a motion disallowing a regulation which, if carried, would have prevented some of the worse cases of sweating that have ever occurred there.",147
1288,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Whic h is the better system - that of Wages Boards or an Arbitration Court ?,147
1289,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I think that the Wages Board system is the better one. The chief consideration at this stage is as to what are the best means to secure the protection of the workers as well as of their employers. I need scarcely say that I think every honourable member is anxious that the best conditions shall prevail amongst the workers engaged in our various industries; but many obstacles blocked the pathway to the protection of the workman. The honourable member for Wide Bay and I have been talking over this matter for some time, and have endeavoured to work out a practical scheme. After careful consideration, we have arrived at the conclusion that the best method to achieve this, object is that adopted by this Parliament in connection with the encouragement of sugar-raising by white as opposed to black labour-to provide an Excise duty, and to give a bounty on the carrying out of certain conditions.",147
1290,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Such a proposal would have to be inserted in the Bill. We can-' been not add it to the motion now under consideration.,147
1291,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I quite agree with the honourable member, and I do not put forward this scheme in anticipation that the Committee will at once pledge itself to it. I am not going to ask honourable members to adopt so vague a scheme that it cannot be shown that it would prove effective. We put this forward as a practical scheme-no t necessarily the bestbut as one which appears likely to bring about the desired result.",147
1292,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If we adopt the amendment, shall we not be tied down to the scheme.",148
1293,Mr BATCHELOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"We should provide in the Bill itself what, after full discussion, we think is the best means of securing the object we have in view. Let us have something which seems practicable and best fitted for our purpose. The honourable and learned member for Corinella has suggested another method, which is certainly simpler, although I am not satisfied that it could be carried into effect. I should like to hear the honourable and learned member explain it fully. The only point that I ask the Committee to consider this afternoon, however, is whether they cannot see their way to carry this or a similar proposal, laying down a cardinal principle on which the Government must work. The honourable member for Wide Bay and I have adopted the machinery of the Excise Bill and the Bounty Bill for our scheme, and we think it is essential that the Wages Boards and Arbitration Court should constitute part of the machinery by which it may be ascertained whether fair and reasonable conditions are being observed in any industry, instead of leaving the matter entirely in the hands of the Department of Trade and Customs. We shall require some competent authority in order that we may secure official information on these subjects. However efficient the officers of the Customs Department may be, they are not accustomed to the work which members of Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts have constantly to attend to. We propose that in South Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland, where there are no Wages Boards or Courts of Arbitration, a certificate of the registrar that the conditions prevailing in the industry to which they relate are no less favorthe able to the workmen than those prescribed by Wages Boards in other States shall be accepted as sufficient evidence that the ditions have been complied with. There would not be any difficulty in ascertaining the exact conditions prevailing in any of the industries covered by the schedule now under consideration. I do not ask the Committee, however, to tie themselves down to the exact details of this proposal. I simply ask honourable members to consider this question, if they have not already done so, and I trust that the Government will look very carefully into it. Perhaps the Minister will inform the Committee whether the Government are favourably impressed with the method which I have suggested this afternoon, or whether they have any better scheme to propose. We certainly do not do our duty by the manhood and womanhood of Australia when we simply pass protective duties, the only effect of which may be to fill the pockets of some manufacturer. Whether we be protectionists, free-traders, or fiscal agnostics, returned by the citizens of Australia to legislate in the interests of the people, we shall not do our duty unless we take steps to evolve some scheme that will raise the manhood and womanhood of Australia.",148
1294,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.45] - I would ask the honourable member not to press his amendment. I have already promised the honourable member for Hindmarsh that I will consider his proposal, and others having the same object. I have already consulted the Attorney-General with a view to having a clause inserted in the proposed Bill which will effectively carry out the wishes of honourable members. The whole question will be considered by the Attorney-General before the Bill is introduced.",148
1295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Parramatta) [3.46] - I agree to a large extent with many of the remarks of the honourable member for Boothby. If we are going to protect the manufacturers in the manner proposed it is only fair and logical that the workers should also have a look in. I understand that this afternoon the Attorney-General has been unctuously stroking his breast and declaring his undying love for the workers and the farmers and other producers of Australia. In my judgment, I have been acting in the best interests of primary producers by trying to reduce the duties proposed by the Government. I have failed in every instance, for the reacon- son that the House as at present constituted is unmistakably in favour of high protection. The majoritv in this Chamber may fairly reflect the opinions held by the majority of the people of Victoria, but I decline to believe that they reflect the opinion of Australia as a whole, or that their views are in accord with those of the primary producers of Victoria. However, the whole question will be tested very shortly. have striven merely to reduce the proposed duties. No effort has been made to bring them below the present Tariff level. On the contrary, I and those with whom I have been associated have gone the length of consenting to some increase of the existing duties. I emphasize the fact that no attempt has been made to interfere with the present Tariff, because this is supposed to be a Parliament of fiscal peace. Now, however, considerably higher duties have been imposed upon our primary producers. After having listened to this debate, one almost shudders at the prospect of a general raising of the Tariff. The raising of the Tariff would seem to be synonymous with "" raising Cain,"" and the prospect before us, if it can be gauged by the discussion which has taken place during the last two or three days, is simply appalling. I would call down peace upon this assembly, for the week-end, at any rate. Our proceedings have been conducted, and I hope will end, with the greatest good feeling on the part of the members of the Committee.",148
1296,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Corinella) [3.52 ] - Wit h regard to the remarks of the honourable member for Boothby, I have always held the opinion that it is our duty, when granting protection to manufacturers, to endeavour to secure to their employees fair wages and other conditions of labour. So far as I can see, the most workable method that could be adopted would be to bring in an Excise schedule, providing that where goods have the Commonwealth trade mark lawfully applied to them, they shall be free of Excise, but that where they do not bear the Commonwealth trade mark they shall be subject to the Excise duty determined upon as a practical penalty for non-compliance with the requirements in regard to labour conditions. I had the privilege of talking this matter over with the Attorney General, to whom I communicated my ideas on the subject, and I think that, by using the Commonwealth trade mark, we may arrive at a conveniently workable method of carrying out the object which we all desire to attain.",149
1297,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yarra) [3.53] - I trust that the honourable member for Boothby will agree to the suggestion of the Minister. The Ministers. principle for which we have been fighting will be affirmed, and that is all we need concern ourselves about at present. The suggestion of the honourable and learned memI ber for Corinella is an admirable one, and I trust that a workable scheme may be evolved.",149
1298,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Hindmarsh) [3.54]. - I have no desire to press an amendment at this stage, but I understood that it would be necessary to amend the resolution in the direction suggested before a provision to give effect to it could be inserted in the proposed Bill.",149

1300,Mr FRAZER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Kalgoorlie) [3-55]- I think that we should exercise some care in dealing with this matter.

1301,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Provisions such as those contained in the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Boothby could be embodied in the proposed Bill.

SECOND READING.",149
1306,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Swan-Trea surer) [4.0] - I have great pleasure in movingThat the Bill be now read a second time. The object of the measure is to enable the Parliament to take over the whole or any part of the debts of the States now existing, or which may hereafter come into existence. Under the . Constitution only the debts which were in existence on the 1st January, 1901, can be taken over; but in a memorandum prepared by me dated 9th July, 1906, and included in the Budget papers presented to Parliament I made a proposal on behalf of the Government that provision should be made for altering the 'Constitution so as to give us the completest control in this matter; and the object of the present measure is to carry out that proposal. The debts of the States at the present time aggregate over £236,000,000, while, the debts in' existence on 1st January, 1901, were only about £202,000,000, so that under the Constitution as it stands there are debts amounting to about £34,000,000 with which the Commonwealth cannot deal. If the Bill is passed by both Houses, and the proposed alteration is approved by the electors in the manner provided for by the Constitution, Parliament .will have the complete control for which I ask. The object of taking over the debts is to place the borrowing power of Australia on the best possible footing, to enable us to borrow to advantage, and to give an opportunity for the saving of a considerable sum of money. We are advised, and believe, "" that by having one denomination of stock firmlv established on the London market, secured on the consolidated revenue of the Commonwealth, a considerable advantage and saving to Australia must eventually result."" The Commonwealth will not gain a penny by the transaction. memorandum to which I have referred it is proposed "" that all net profits arising from any conversion or redemption of existing loans shall be credited by the Commonwealth to the State concerned, and the annual payment by that State reduced accordingly from time to time."" The financial authorities whom I consulted in London were unanimously of the opinion "" that it would be disadvantageous to place the Commonwealth brand on State stocks before conversion. They thought that such action would prevent the possibility of any profitable conversion, and would be making to the existing holders of State stocks a present of any increase in price caused by the additional Commonwealth security."" The procedure to be followed, and the conditions to be observed in regard to the taking over of the debts of the States are clearly stated in sub-sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of paragraph 8 of the memorandum which I have placed before honourable members1. That a law be passed enabling the whole of the State Debts to be converted before maturity, or redeemed at maturity by the Commonwealth (subject in regard to debts incurred since 1st January, 1901, to the necessary amendment of the Constitution), by such successive operations as may be thought fit. 2. That until conversion or maturity of the State Debts, as the case may be, each State continue to pay its own annual interest and sinking fund (if any). 3. That on conversion or at maturity of the State Debts, as the case may be, the Commonwealth become solely liable for the annual payment of interest and sinking fund as well as for the redemption of the Stock. 4. That the Commonwealth deduct each year from the amount to be uaid to each State the expenditure made on behalf of that State for interest and sinking fund, and, if such amount is insufficient in any case, the deficiency be paid to the Commonwealth by that State. I am sure that no one desires that we shall continue to have power to deal only with the debts of the States as existing at the establishment of Federation, leaving £34,000,000 undealt with. There seems to be no difference of opinion as to the advisability of taking over the whole of the debts of the States. All the members of the conferences which have been held, the Treasurers of the States, and my able predecessor in office for so many years, are in favour of the taking over of the whole, and not only a portion of the debts of the States. The country is greatly indebted, as I am personally, to the late Treasurer, Sir George Turner, for the foundation which he laid in preparing information In the and in inaugurating the discussion of this very important matter. Good work was done by the two conferences which he summoned, and although our proposals do not exactly coincide with his, we have been very much assisted by his labours. In asking honourable members to support the motion, I am fortified by the knowledge that the taking over of the whole of the debts of the Stares, instead of a portion, as provided by the Constitution, has been approved by every one who has had the matter under consideration. Debate (on motion by Mr MCWILLIAMS) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. ORDER OF BUSINESS.",150
1307,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.10] - In movingThat the House do now adjournI ask the serious attention of honourable members to the state of public business, and to the necessity of so arranging, and, if necessary, extending our sittings that we may be able to cope with the measures upon the notice-paper within the next three or four weeks at furthest.  us will have to go away at the end of that time, and the Government may be unable to make a House.",151
1308,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We shall be sorry to part with any honourable member, because the work to be brought forward during the last days of the session will necessarily be of great importance. There is on the notice-paper no Bill of any length, though all will call for serious consideration. I appeal to honourable members to assist us to deal with these measures satisfactorily. There are two ways whereby we can lengthen our sittings without repeating the experience of last night. We can meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays at JO.30 a.m., as on Fridays. This will increase the strain on the Departments, but, under the circumstances, that is unavoidable. We mav also have to ask honourable members to sit on Fridayevenings, but we wish to resort to that expedient only under extreme pressure, because of the inconvenience it would impose upon those who reside in other States.",151
1309,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If we meet on Wednesday and Thursday mornings, will there be the possibility of all-night sittings?",151
1310,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There will be that possibility, but we hope to be able to compose our differences in time to. adjourn at a reasonable hour.  doing with the Postal Rates Bill?",151
1311,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is a short measure, and one decisive vote will determine its fortune. The Works Expenditure has now been authorized by both Chambers, but the ordinary Departmental Estimates are yet untouched, and many important questions may arise in connection with them. A glance at the Bills on the notice-paper will show that we have reached a period of the session when it has become impossible to pursue further the fiscal revision upon which we have been engaged during the last two or three days. It is with great regret that Ministers, having carefully considered the position yesterday, concluded that we could not, in justice to the work or to the country, propose further recommendations in respect to the Tariff. I have this afternoon received another report from the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, which I have not yet opened, and do not expect to be able to ask my colleagues to examine, because recent experience shows that it will not be possible to deal satisfactorily with its proposals, whatever they may be, without involving the sacrifice of measures on the notice-paper, and causing an extension of the session, seriously encroaching upon the interval which should separate the prorogation of Parliament from the holding of the elections.  report ?",151
1312,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is another of the reports relating to metals and machinery.,151
1313,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will no measures relating to the Tariff be introduced other than those on the business paper?,151
1314,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have dealt with the strangled industries.,151
1315,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unfortunately , we have not. I have read in the newspapers that there are more than twenty reports in preparation by the Tariff Commission. Therefore, even if we dealt with that handed to me today, and with two or three more which may, perhaps, be received within the next three weeks, we could consider but a small proportion of those which will be presented before the Commission concludes its labours. Unless we prolonged our sittings for months, it would be impossible for us to do more than make a beginning with the great revision which the Commission is proposing. But as it has been urged upon all sides that it is highly desirable that the elections should be held either at the close of November, or as near that time as possible, it would be futile to lay before honourable members now propositions which-as we have proved within the last two or three days-no t only concentrate the attention of the House, but demand an excessive strain upon the physical strength of honourable members. That has been necessary to dispose of the important items embodied in the schedule with which we have just dealt. Of course, a Bill has yet to be introduced covering that schedule. That Bill, with the proposals relating to the Reciprocal Tariff Agreement with New Zealand, and the preferences which we propose to extend to the goods of the mother coumtrv will probablv occupy the greater part of next week. It is, therefore, quite impossible for us to deal further with other Tariff proposals ihis session, even if we accomplish our present work at that speed. The business for Tuesday will include the amendments of the Constitution that we have proposed. The measure of which I have charge relates to the imposition of special duties for the payment of old-age pensions, and that which the Treasurer has introduced today relates-as honourable members are aware-to the transfer of the States debts. We expect to receive later from another place the Bill which provides for an alteration in the date upon which senators will take their seats-a n alteration from the spring to the autumn. I should be glad to see our two Bills and the Referendum Bill dealt with upon Tuesday. Upon Wednesday the Reciprocal Tariff Agreement with New Zealand will be considered, and also our Tariff preferences to the goods of the United Kingdom. These will probably engage our attention for at least the remainder of the week. We shall then have only a fortnight or three weeks at most within which to dispose of the remaining Bills and the Estimates.",151
1316,Mr MAHON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable and learned gentleman is a very sanguine man.,152
1317,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I admit that I might be considered unduly sanguine if the present session did not mark the close of the Parliament. We shall certainly accomplish a feat if we clear the paper as it stands fore proroguing. But I trust that our responsibilities to our constituents will not [147 } prevent us from dealing with these proposals in an expeditious manner. Their purport 'is thoroughly understood, and by assiduity and self-sacrifice I think that we can clear the business-paper before separating. I rely on the assistance of all parties to enable us to close the session in a manner which will be creditable to us and satisfactory to the people whom we represent.",152
1318,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Dalley) [4.1.9] - I think that the Prime Minister has put before us a very full dish for the next few weeks. The desire of the Opposition to dispose of the remaining business of the session is quite as strong as is that of the Government. The latter cannot complain of anyfactious opposition upon our part. There has been no obstruction and no waste of time. The greater portion of last night was occupied by the Prime Minister's own supporters. I think that the honourable and learned gentleman is acting very wisely in deciding that the House shall meet in the mornings, and that we shall do our work upon four days of the week instead of six. It is inconvenient, especialllv to the representatives of distant States, to be obliged to remain in Melbourne over the close of the week. I wry much regret that the Prime Minister has left the consideration of the Tariff until such a late stage in the session. I certainly thought that the Government, having received the Tariff Commission's report regarding metals and machinery, we should at least have been, called upon to deal with that.",152
1319,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have only received it within the last hour or two..,152
1320,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But it was known that the report was to be presented. I maintain' that the claims of those interested in the iron industry should receive just as prompt consideration as the claims of those engaged in our primary industries. I regret exceedingly that the session is to close without honourable members being afforded an opportunity for giving them that consideration. The Prime Minister is indeed a sanguine man if he expects to carry all the measures which he has outlined. He must have some slaughtered innocents at the end of the session. To my mind, the subject of preferential trade might well be put upon one side until the report of the Tariff Commission re'begarding metals and machinery has been disposed of. The Prime Minister is evidently endeavouring to compress a session's work into three or four weeks. result of his action will probably be that the next Parliament will be kept busy for some time in repealing the legislation which will be hastily enacted during the next few weeks. It is our duty to see that Commonwealth legislation is an exemplar to the States Parliaments, and that the introduction of amending Bills is not necessary to remedy its defects. I do not believe in any Ministry attempting to put up a legislative record. It is the effectiveness of our work which we should consider rather than the number of Bills that we pass. Without having .any strong authority from the Opposition to say so, I think I can promise that after fair criticism of the Government proposals, members upon this side of the House will endeavour to expedite the transaction of the remaining business of the session.",152
1321,Mr MCLEAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Gippsland) [4.24] - I quite approve of the proposal of the Prime Minister to extend the hours of sitting in order that we may get through as much business as we can during the remainder of the session. But I extremely regret to hear the announcement that the Government intend to proceed no further this session with the amendment of the Tariff. Every section of the House-excep t the Ministry themselves-foresa w what would happen months ago. We realized that Tariff revision was being postponed to such a late stage of the session that we should have no opportunity to deal intelligently with it.,153
1322,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have dealt with all the reports which have been presented by the Tariff 'Commission.,153
1323,Mr MCLEAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If those reports had been dealt with earlier, others would have been presented. I had that assurance from the Chairman of the Commission a little time ago.",153
1324,Mr ISAACS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What has occurred has'not prevented the reports of the Commission from being presented.,153
1325,Mr MCLEAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If there be any honourable member in the House who shoufid have endeavoured to push forward the question of Tariff revision, it is the Attorneytatives. General. We all recollect the attitude which he and his colleague, the Minister of Home Affairs, took up some two years ago regarding strangled industries. know perfectly well that every hour that the Attorney-General could spare from the Law Courts was devoted to castigating the The late Ministry for neglecting to deal with them, in the absence of any information. He at least should have seen the necessity for proceeding with Tariff revision at a much earlier stage of the session.",153
1326,Mr ISAACS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We did all that we possibly could.,153
1327,Mr MCLEAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the country will believe that statement, it is very credulous. The need for bringing forward the subject was rendered all the more pressing in view of statements made by the Prime Minister at Maryborough. In addressing the electors there, he declared that all the concessions that could be obtained from free traders would be secured this session, because nothing could be expected from them next session. But despite the fact that every section of the House was anxious to deal with this matter as expeditiously as possible, the Government have postponed its consideration. It is too late now, I know, for recrimination; but I do feel that we might have done a great deal more than we have in, the way of Tariff revision, had the Government been so disposed. I heartily endorse the concluding remarks of. the Prime Minister, and I hope that the session will close in a manner which will reflect credit upon Parliament and the country.",153
1328,Mr CROUCH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Corio) [4.28] - It seems to me that the difference between the present Government' and their predecessors in regaird to Tariff reform lies in the fact that the latter used the Tariff Commission as a means of postponing Tariff revision. The present Government, on the otiier hand, have dealt with the reports of the Commission as early as they conveniently could, in view of other pressing business. I wish to point out to the Prime Minister that, at the forthcoming general elections, the Government propose to submit three Bills to the electors for their approval. What I fear is that the submission of so many proposals regarding amendments of the Constitution will lead to ai tremendous number of informal votes being recorded. I believe that in every constituency there is to be a contest for the House of RepresenThe elector will also be called upon to vote for the return of candidates to the Senate, as well as upon three referenda. In other words, he will be required to mark We five ballot-papers, and, even though they may be printed in different colours, I am satisfied that an immense number of informal votes will be cast. The success of the referenda will be mailed if voting papers relating to Bills which they have not had an opportunity to study are placed in the hands of the electors. I hone that the Government will either cause the several Bills to be bound together or allow some of them to stand over. Mr BROWN'(Canobolas) [4.31] - I was not present when me Prime Minister announced the remaining business for the session; but I would urge him to bring forward the Estimates as speedily as possible. If they are left over until practically the last moment, a number of matters, which might be discussed with advantage to the different departments, must necessarily receive but scant attention, whilst it is a long-standing grievance with the Senate that the time allotted to it to deal with' the Estimates is far too limited. I understand that there are some matters relating to Papua that need to be dealt with in connection with the Estimates, and I think it would be well if the Government would arrange to push on with them next week, so that they may reach the Senate without delay.",153
1329,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.33] - If the honourable member for Canobolas had been present he would have heard my announcement of the business for next week. I hope to ask the House after that business has been disposed of to take up the Estimates - as opportunity offers, and to deal with them as quickly as possible. In reply to the honourable member for Gippsland, let me say that I am quite satisfied that no action that could have been taken by the Government would have expedited the reports of the Tariff Commission.",154
1330,Mr MCLEAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I was assured by the Chairman of the Commission two or three weeks ago that it could.,154
1331,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have been in informal communication with the Chairman of the Tariff Commission from time to time during the whole of the session, and the question of . the presentation of reports has been mentioned on several occasions in the course of our conversations. I have always urged the Commission to press on with the preparation of its reports, and to present them as early as possible. I wish to make it perfectly clear that the fact that other reports have not been presented earlier is, in my opinion, no reflection whatever on the members of the Commission. Their task is enormous; [147]- 2 the detail with which they are coping, as the evidence before us shows, presents serious questions of the most 'intricate character. I am fully assured that, while draft reports have been in some stage of preparation for weeks, and in some cases for months, the natural complexity of the circumstances involved in them have prevented their earlier submission. To-day, when presenting the report to which reference has been made, the Chairman intimated that he hoped, although he could not be sure, that another report would be ready by the beginning of next week. When a third report would be presented he could not say; it might be in a comparatively short time, or a longer delay might necessarily occur. The Commissioners needed time for the full discussion of points of difference, and for the elucidation' of problems that arose as they pursued their investigations. In these circumstances, the Chairman said, quite fairly, that it was not possible for him to hurry the Commission more, than he had done. I am able to say, from the Chairman's own statement, that the Commission has been working-and I know it also as a fact-at high pressure for weeks, and, indeed, for months. Nothing that might have been done in this House could have hastened the presentation of further reports. We have now disposed in this House of every report submitted to us with the exception of that which has just reached me, and which I have not yet had an. opportunity to read. The Department has not yet had time to scrutinize it, and we feel that we should be unable to deal with it this session, as it deserves, in view of the work already in hand.",154
1332,Mr MCLEAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would it not be possible to deal with one part of it?,154
1333,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have not had an opportunity to read it. It relates to a section of one of the largest and most important divisions in the Tariff-that of metals and machinery. I cannot say with what particular part of the division the Commission have dealt in this report.,154
1334,Mr MCLEAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Doubtless , the report relates to the part concerning which the most complaints have been made.'",154
1335,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have dealt with one part of the division; there is now another in hand. Calm inquiry and a study of the facts will show that a Commission constituted as this is could not have presented their reports earlier; that no action of-ours could have expedited their reports, and that as we are within three or four weeks of the close of the session, it is really impossible for honourable members during that already overcrowded time to give another report that close study which is necessary in order that our revision of the Tariff may be properly carried out. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.36 p.m. (Friday).",154
