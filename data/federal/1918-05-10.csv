There are a couple of little matters in regard to which he 'might be able to remove' a bad impression when he attends on Monday.

12,Mr SINCLAIR,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS OF,I wish to know from the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation whether a civilian has been appointed to take charge of an industrial institute for returned soldiers in Queens,20
13,Mr GROOM,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS OF,"The Minister informs me that he has learned that a Mr . MCMinn, who is not a returned soldier, has been appointed manager of a returned soldiers' institute ""in Queensland, and that the soldiers who were attending the institute have absented themselves by way of protest. My honourable colleague believes that the institute has received a subsidy from the Queensland Government, but he is unable to say by whom appointments connected with it are made. The bringing of all such institutions under the control of the Commonwealth Government is being considered. TARIFF : PROTECTION.",20

18,Dr MALONEY,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS OF,"In the Age of the 4th May, the Acting Prime Minister is reported as having spoken of the Pacific Islands as being ' ' within naval striking distance of Australia for an enemy that would eventually challenge white rule in this country."" Is not this statement likely to be taken as an insult to Japan, whose actions as our. All y have been as noble as was her conduct in the Boxer rebellion ? Is it not to the cursed cancer nation called Prussia that the Acting Prime Minister was referring?",21
19,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS OF,"The honourable member is forming a desirable habit, which I hope other honourable members may copy when they wish to ask difficult questions without notice, of giving a copy, a few minutes beforehand, of the question that he wishes to ask. I understand that the passage which he has quoted was takenfrom the report of an utterance made by me at Dandenong last week in connection with the Flinders election. It is clear that what I - was referring to was the suggestion of some persons in this country that it would be wise to offer to return to Germany, as a condition of peace, her oceanic possessions which Australia and New Zealand have helped to capture. I was showing what a danger it would be to Australia if jjreat naval bases were established within striking distance of this country. I regard it as an important condition that Australia should insist, so far as it can insist, on the retention of those islands for the future safety of her coastal trade. I d id not intend any reflection on our All y , Japan. I had in mind, rather, an enemy nation that, through mistaken views prevailing at the Peace table, might eventually jeopardize the safety of Australia. END OF SESSION.",21
20,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS OF,Is there any truth in the common report that it is the intention of - the Government to close Parliament within four weeks? Is there notsufficient urgent legislation to require that we should be kept here for three or four months ?,21
21,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS OF,"I am glad to notice the repentance indicated by the question. Enough attempts have been made to frustrate the doing of business by»the Govern-, ment.

28,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS OF,It is so stated in the Age today.,21
29,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS OF,"The honourable member must allow me to answer the question. I do not know whether the honourable member for Grampians said what he is alleged to have said, though I doubt it ; at any rate, I know I did not write what an honourable member is reported to have said I did. When the Government is able to indicate to honourable members generally what its - proposals are in relation to the session, it will do so in open House, and not trust to common report to in for m them.",21
30,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS OF,"I neither wish to misrepresent the Acting Prime Minister (Mr . W at t ) , nor to be misrepresented by him ; and I may be permitted to explain that I based my question on a statement published in the Age, over the name of Mr . H . Glowrey, the acting secretary of the Victorian Farmers Dnion. In that communication, Mr Glowrey saysI hereby append a statement made by Mr J Watt, Acting Prime Minister, to Messrs. Allan and Weaver, M's.L.A., at Federal Parliament House, in the presence of Mr Edmund Jowett, M.P., on the 2nd May. The statement is to the effect that there was this private interview with the Acting Prime Minister, who said he could not pledge the Government with regard to suggested legislation, but he expected the present sittings would close within four weeks, witli the prospect of a spring session some time in August, when he would introduce certain measures. Does the Acting Prime Minister think it is necessary to adjourn for any period of the kind? Why should we not go right on?",21
31,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS OF,"I shall not, of course, deal with the personal explanation made by the honourable member. I - m u st say, however, that the publication of that letter to which he has referred is the grossest breach of faith I have ever been associated with or have known in parliamentary or public life-that , I am bound to say, whoever may be responsible for the breach. I do not blame orable member; the man who. signed the letter is, apparently, the man who is guilty. That letter contains a document, which, as .this gentleman properly observed, was written at my request by the honourable member for the Grampians (Mr . Jowett), arid it correctly described my expectations at that particular time. But , as I said to the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) a moment ago, as soon as the Governmeut is able to determine how long the present sittings will last, and what measures are to be dealt \ i it h, it will inform the House generally.

Mr Gillespie, and those associated with him, have done splendid work, as will , I am sure, admitted by the Minister who represents the Minister for Defence.

60,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS OF,"Balaclava - Treasurer) [11.35] - I m o v e That the Bill be now read a second time. This measure is to provide a sinking f u n d for Commonwealth loans. Honourable members know that we have, with regard to some of our loans, what is known as a Stock Redemption Fund, but it applies only to portion of the loans that we have floated. It does not extend to those loans which were obtained from the British Government, and it is felt that if we are putting aside a certain sum to provide a sinking fund in connection with loans locally floated, we ought to do the same in regard to loans on British credit. This Bill will be deemed to have come into operation on the 1st July, 1916, the object being to validate something that # was done in that year. ""With the exception of a 5 per cent, contribution which was specially provided by Parliament for certain works, it seeks to establish a uniform sinking fund of J per cent, per annum. In the year 1916-17 a sinking fund of 1 per cent, per annum was established by the Government of the day, but this appljed only to loans for war purposes. We think it time that all loans should be placed on the same footing, and that instead of putting by irregular amounts applicable to portions of our indebtedness, we ought to establish a sinking fund of 4 per cent, in regard to all loans floated by the Commonwealth in connection with the war. The Bill contains the usual provisions relating to the uses to which , such moneys may be put. They may be used only for the purpose of re-purchasing, purchasing, or redeeming any security issued under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911-15, repaying any moneys borrowed from the Government of the United Kingdom,. and paying any expenses incurred in connection therewith. No purchased, re-purchased, or redeemed stock is to be re-issued. There is another provision which entitles the Treasurer, in accordance with established State practice, to invest any moneys standing to the credit of the sinking fund in the purchase of any securities of, or guaranteed by, the Government of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth, or any Australian State, and he may at any time sell such securities. The proceeds of all such sales are to be paid into the sinking fund. All moneys standing to the credit of the Stock Redemption Pund are to be transferred to the credit of the Loan Sinking Pund. Those, broadly, are the purposes of the measure, and honourable members will, - I think, on careful examination find this proposal a healthier and more regular way of doing ""business than we have adopted in connection with our loans in the past. Debate (on motion by Mr HIGGS) journed. NA STOCK. In Committee (Consideration of Governor General's message): Motion (by Mr Watt) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of moneys be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to amend the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911-1915.

Bill presented by Mr Watt, and read a first time. » SECOND READING.",24
61,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.40] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The main object of the Bill is to supply a deficiency in the Inscribed Stock Act caused entirely by the last war loan. When the Government decided to invite the banks to enter into a closer partnership with them in connection with the loan, and to consider the advisability of encouraging their clients, by special advances at low rates of interest, to lend money to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the loan, a new question arose. All the Inscribed Stock Acts of Great Britain, the Commonwealth, and the States have prevented a lien being registered against an inscribed stock registration. That is to say, nobody can pawn, or in any way hypothecate, the stock or interest. Yet it became plain that if the banks were to advance 90 per cent, of the war loan offerings of every customer, they had to be sure that the customercould not lift and sell his stock without paying the debt he had incurred to the bank on account of a special advance. In order that the banks might be protected when they gave favourable consideration to the Government's proposals, I took the responsibility of advising the Government to issue a regulation under the War Precautions Act giving the banks temporary power to register such a lien with the consent of their client. The purpose of this Bill is to substitute for that regulation a direct legislative enactadment. When honourable members study the clauses of the Bill , they will regard it as a wise precaution from the point of view. alike of the stockholder and the bank.",25
62,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Does the Bill apply only to banks?,26
63,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"It applies to those who assist their customers by special advances, and private persons do not do that.",26
64,Mr BAYLEY,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Some firms have done so.,26
65,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"That is true; but in the m a j o r it y of such cases these firms have taken the stock in their own name. When an employee has paid the full amount they distribute in his name the number for which' he has paid. That has been done to my own knowledge by a large number of companies and associations - whic h will be known as section 5 1 G I propose to briefly explain the provisions of the Bill . Clause 2 is a mere drafting amendment to remedy a technical defect in the principal Act. Clause 3 is vital. It is to enable certificates of Hen to be accepted by the Registrar of Stock, in respect of moneys advanced by banks for the purpose of assisting the war loans. The banks naturally expect a continuation of this protection, ancl this will give it legislative and binding effect. Clause 4 deals with the interest on war savings certificates, which are here referred to by their technical name as "" Treasury bonds."" The interest on. these war savings certificates, or Treasury bonds, as honourable members are aware, is payable at the end of a definite time, namely, three years. The purchaser of a £ 1 certificate pays for it 17s. 6cl. in cash, and it is worth f l at the end of the three years' period. The Treasury will pay that f l at the period of maturity, but there is not in our law any provision to enable the Treasury to set aside every year the interest payable on these war .savings certificates. Thus, when a certificate matures at the end of 'three years, the whole of the interest payable in respect of it falls on that particular year.",26
66,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Then the Government are This proposing to spread the interest payable transactions. over the three years' period, so that at the end of that term, when the interest becomes payable, the money will be availnot able for it? _ Mr Watt - That is so. The B i l vides for the payment of the interest demption. into a Trust Pund in three stages instead of one. The issue of war savings certificates has already become fair l y large. It n.mount3 now to over £6,000,000, and we hope that it will become very much larger. As the result of advantages that we propose to offer in connection with them, the savings of the people are more likely to be put into them than to be invested, in other directions more fashionable before the war. We think, therefore, we should tackle this question now, so that the Treasury will not feel the weight of the full interest payment three years hence.",26
67,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,The Government are not going to continue the issue of these certificates after the war?,26
68,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"No ; they are purely war measures. The second part of this clause gives the Treasurer power to repurchase these certificates out of the proceeds of war loans. There are only two ways in which such certificates can be redeemed. They may be redeemed either out of revenue or out of loan money. This clause gives the Treasurer power, at the end of the three years-the period of maturity - to pay for the certificates out of regu' lar loan raisings, for which parliamentary authority will have been granted. Mr WEST,-This will save taxation?",26
69,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"It . will . It will take the inoney into a larger loan, offering at the end of the three years' period. Ma-. WEST - We ought to have more taxation.",26

A the.present time no war loan securities liable for stamp duty under either Comvenue, monwealth or State law. This clause - continues that provision, but with a viso that such securities shall be free from taxation, unless declared by the prospectus to be liable. This provision is necessary, because in connection with the last loan we it. introduced a new system-the system of issuing 5 per cent, bonds subject to taxakeeping tion. I am aware that honourable members in some cases have doubted the wisdom of bers that system, but it is in operation today. We thus have two stocks running-the one free of taxation, and the other liable to taxation. We propose by this legislathe tion to guarantee to those to whom we gave a guarantee of immunity from taxain tion a continuation of that freedom from taxation, but those who with their eyes open purchased the 5 per cent, bonds to taxation will be liable. Clause 6 deals with the same subject in another form. merely gives the guarantee that the spectus gives to the people who purchase State Treasurer possesses. stock. I think this measure will comsurers mend itself to honourable members as tary and necessary, in view of the altered character of our recent loans offerings, and I hope it will be agreed to.

77,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.53] - I That this Bill be now read a second time-. t The object of this Bill is to provide the are Treasurer with moneys-no t out of reas was the case in respect of sinking funds, but out of war loan funds-for prooperating on the market in the purchase of war loan stock, so as to keep the market healthy. That puts the purpose of tha Bill as clearly and as briefly 'as I can state Mr WEST.;--It is with the object of up the price of our stock?",27
78,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Yes . As honourable memknow, there has been a sagging in respect of our 1925 and 1927 war loans, and' it is no one's interest in particular to see that money is available to' take in slack in the market. Numbers who have invested their moneys in these stocks quite a bond fide way, hoping to be able to keep their securities, have been driven by circumstances on to the marliable ket, and have had to sell below par. That sort of thing always injures a marI t ket, and we are now proposing to give the proTreasurer of the day a power that every State Treacarry on these operations out of salusinking funds, and have done so ever since they have had a sinking fund. They have resorted to such operations whenever it has been considered advisable to do so, particularly when they haye been apadproaching the London market. The quotation they receive for a loan from the underwriter or offering bank is to some extent determined by the look of the market. If it looks weak, a Treagets a low offer; but if it looks tolerably healthy and strong, he receives a better offer. Consequently, the State Governments have always had money in for hand to keep the market active, and not war to let it fall against the holder or Treasury. The British Government has been doing this extensively in connection with war loans, and the policy has been regarded as a sound one. We think we should have money for the same purpose, but the fund is to be governed by certain limitations prescribed by the Bill . We ask the Parliament to authorize us to set aside on the 1st of every month £ per cent, per annum of the whole of the war loans in Australia. That will not apply to the British war loan, because that stock is not on the market. It represents a loan between the two Governments, and there are no transactions in connection with it . The setting aside on the 1st of each month of $ per cent, means l-£ per cent, per annum, and on our present indebtedness it will amount to over £2,000,000 per annum. « The further condition that is attached in the Bill to the exercise of this power is that when the f u n d to be created under it amounts to £1,000,000, no more money can pass into it until it falls to £900,000. That means that if further payments into the fund are not necessary to keep the loans active, and the price satisfactory, the f u n d will be stationary; it will remain at £1,000,000, or between £1,000,000 and £900,000. But if the Treasurer and his advisers should consider it necessary to keep building up a loan, this £ per cent, may go out as fast as it is coming in . If that should be necessary, and no one can quite t e l l ' how far it will be necessaryample opportunites for operations in respect of the several loans will be afforded by this Bill . Clause 3 contains the essential provision that the Treasurer shall uot pay above par for the stock. That, of course, is vital, otherwise speculations would be extensive and unnecessary. It follows that any transactions conducted in connection with such a f u n d as this will be beneficial to the Treasury as well as to stockholders. We shall be buying back our indebtedness at below par, and we shall be performing a double service in affording a market to those stockholders who for any reason feel compelled to sell. I strongly recommend this Bill to the House, because I feel we haye these conditions too much in the Many patriotic and decent citizens put small as well as large amounts our loans, and have had to face a loss when realizing. This Bill will be a guarantee against loss and it will be an assurance of better market conditions as the result of these operations. Mr Watt.  the Treasury will not be re-sold?",27
79,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"No ; the stock when purchased, must be cancelled.",28
80,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,There is no power of compulsory purchase?,28
81,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"No ; we shall operate within the limits of the f u n d established just as we consider the state of the market justifies operations. There is in the Bill a provision which will enable the Treasurer to close the f u n d , if he thinks it necessary, at the end of the war. And then having achieved its purpose, if its purpose will have been achieved, the money passes back to the loan f u n d , from which it is appropriated by this Bill . It is thrown back into the cistern from which we draw it now. I hope that the House will accept the provisions of the Bill as another important factor strengthening the hands of the Treasurer in the matter of dealing with loan funds. Debate (on motion by Mr HIGGS ) adjourned. INCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BILL In Committee (Consideration resumed from the 8th May, vide page 4505) : Clause 4 1 Section 59 of the principal .Act is amended hy omitting sub-sections I and 2 thereof, and inserting in their stead the following subsection :"" (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the last preceding section, any person who(6) fails to include any assessable income in any return; or (c) includes in any return as a deduction an amount which is not lawfully allowable, or an amount which is in excess of that actually expended or incurred hy him, shall, if a taxpayer, be liable, except as provided in this section to pay by way of additional tax . . . the amount of One pound or double the tax which would have been evaded if the assessment had been based on the return lodged, whichever is the greater, in addition to any additional tax which may become payable by him in accordance with section 43 of this Act: Provided that the Commissioner may, in any neglected particular ease, for reasons which he thinks past. sufficient, remit the additional tax or any part thereof. have into Mr Charlton (Hunter) [12.2] I take exception to paragraph c of the proposed new sub-section because, if it is inserted in the Act, it will impose hardships on many people who include in their, returns deductions which they consider are lawfully allowable, but wbicb the Taxation Office may not deem allowable. It will impose a penalty on people wbo err in this direction quite innocently, and will place persons who are desirous of complying with the law, and have no intention of evading it, in a very invidious position. A case in point would be that of a member of Parliament who included his election expenses as a deduction, on the ground that they are expenses incurred in earning his income. In my opinion, election expenses are a perfectly fair deduction to include in one's income tax return, but they are not allowed as such, and if an honourable member should include them in his return he would be liable to a penalty under this proposed new paragraph. The provision goes altogether too far, and is not a reasonable one. It is not a party matter. Honourable members are endeavouring to do all they possibly can to provide efficient machinery for the purpose of enabling the Commissioner of Taxation to collect the income tax. It should be our endeavour to rectify any blemishes that we find in the measure before us, and. to effect any improvements in it. As I consider that paragraph c is a blemish to the Bill, I move That paragraph c he left ont.",28
82,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"""Wakefield) [12.7] - I agree with the honourable member so far as the first portion of paragraph c is concerned, but I do not think that the words "" or any amount which is in excess of that actually expended or incurred by him "" should be omitted.",29
83,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,I am agreeable alter my amendment in order to allow those words to be retained.,29
84,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"The Comsioner missioner of Taxation, in the preparation of his forms, has attempted fairly to direct the attention of the taxpayer what deductions are permissible, but cannot contend that they cover everything that is allowed. There are conceivable points wihich are not covered by the ductions specified in the forms, and ' are matters that should be left to the tion Office to deal with when the returns come to hand. I am sure that not 10 ceut. of the taxpayers of the' Commonthis wealth really understand what are mate deductions. There are many which people may believe to be legitimate, which the Commissioner may not allow. Honourable members have been very sympathetic in their attitude towards the Commissioner. They have allowed him a very generous latitude in order that he may collect the income tax, and reduce to a minimum losses which his office should not be called upon to bear, but it is asking the Committee to go too far to ask it to render a taxpayer liable to a penalty for including in a return as a deduction an amount which is not lawfully allowable. Nothing in this Bill will incite opposition on the part of the taxpayer more than this particular paragraph. I hope that the Treasurer, with whom I have already discussed the matter, will see his way to eliminate the first portion of it. (Sir ROBERT BEST (Kooyong) [1-2.10] - Honourable members have recognised, with a great deal of sympathy, the. difficulty that the Commissioner encounters in performance of his duty, and they have permitted very drastic provisions to be inserted in this Bill regarding the furnishing of returns, because the object has been to prevent obvious leakage, and to throw on the taxpayers the burden and obligation of making returns. To do so was very necessary, because it is a notorious fact that there have been, considerable leakages in that direction. But the first j * ^ 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 paragraph c goes far beyond what the Committee should consider fair o$ reasonable. No one can say definitely what item of expenditure is deductable unless he goes to a Court for a decision. Many matters are subject for dispute. If this to paragraph is allowed to stand, it will mean that if any item of expenditure is in dispute the view taken by the Commismust prevail, and the taxpayer will be liable to a penalty for having asserted well his own view as to what is a doubtful to piece of law. Giving to the Commissioner he the arbitrary power to say what shall be the law in any particular direction is not the proper method of settling a dispute. deHe will practically have every taxpayer those at his mercy, because the latter will be Taxaobliged to pay the fine or go to Court over any matter which is in dispute. That per is hardly a fair proposition. I do not say with any desire of reflecting on the legitipresent Commissioner. He is a very fair and just man, but he cannot possibly hope but to deal with every case, and the taxpayer is entitled to some protection at our hands. I am pleased that the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) has agreed to limit his amendment to the words, "" an amount which is not lawfully allowable "" ; but paragraph b- "" Fails to include any assessable income in any return.""-is also subject to very much doubt. However,, if we give the Commissioner the benefit of the doubt, and allow him to have the drastic powers for which he asks in. that respect, we should certainly not render any taxpayer. liable to. a penalty for including in. his return as a deduction an amount which is not lawfully allowable.",29
85,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"East Sydney) [12.13],I hope that the Treasurer will, agree to the amendment. In my last Teturn I included an amount, which I thought was permissible, by way of deduction. However, it was not allowed. I paid the amount at which I was assessed, and afterwards en"" tered my protest, only to find that the amount was allowable. Very few honourable members understand what is legally disallowable under the Act. It is such a complicated measure. One return which I have seen included an amount set down for repairs to the whole of a man's property, but that deduction was disallowed. It appears that under the Aot'a deduction in this respect cannot be made mare than once in three years. I do not think that this provision will be of any real assistance to the Commissioner of Taxation. It may rJbssibly have the effect of preventing people including in their returns expenses which should be allowed, in the fear that if they do so they may be penalized. It is not necessarily a crime to claim a deduction which is not legally allowable. The officers of the Department must scrutinize every return, and it is an easy matter for them to disallow claims incorrectly made. In my view the Committee will be wise to accept the amendment.",30
86,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Moreton) [12.16] I believe that the whole of paragraph c of the proposed new sub-section should be omitted. It seems to me that the object of the paragraph is rather ""to reduce the clerical work of the Taxation Department than to prevent the undue inflation of deductions by taxpayers. In the preceding clause of this Bill, which has already been agreed to by the Committee, it is made an offence to send in a return which is false in any particular. It must be admitted that the undue inflation of expenditure to increase, a claim for deduction would render a return false in that particular and bring the taxpayer under the previous clause. There is therefore, no necessity at all events for the latter portion of paragraph c. I can give an instance to show how its operation would result in hardship to the taxpayer. I had the management of a trading concern, for which I sent in the income tax return. The whole of our expense for postage, was, connected with the conduct of the business, in sending out invoices, credit notes, and so on. I naturally thought that the postage would be a fair item for deduction, and so included it in the income tax return. It was disallowed by the Commissioner of Taxation. I am of opinion to this day it was fair to claim deduction for postage in that case. Under this paragraph that trading company would be liable for making a return of an amount in excess of that actually expended or incurred by the taxpayer. I do not think that an innocent mistake in the compilation of a return should be punishable. I agree that where there is a wilful attempt to evade taxation the provisions of the Act should, be as rigid as possible, and, as I have already said, I think that, the previous clause is made sufficiently tight to catch any one who makes a false return. There are many thousands of' people in Australia who find it difficult to make out income tax returns. Thousands are spent every year in their preparation. It costs some people an amount almost equal to the tax they have to pay to cover the expense of making out their returns. If an item is included in the deductions which ought not to be so included it will be an easy matter for the officer of the Taxation Department to disallow it. I hope that the honourable member for Hunter will not agree to amend his amendment, but will insist upon the omission of the whole of paragraph c. .",30
87,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Hunter) [12.19] I ask leave of the Committee to amend my amendment and to move the omission only of the wordsAn amount which iB not lawfuly allowable, or, Amendment, by leave, amended, accordingly.",30
88,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [12.20] - Thes e words were not included without a great deal of consideration. In some cases a taxpayer will include in his return an item which is not allowable in connection with another item which - is allowable, and the result is an excess in the amount which should be claimed under the allowable item. We cannot get at that unless under the terms of the latter part of paragraph c of the proposed new sub-section. Cases of the kind to which I refer are fairly frequent, and many taxpayers take their chance, and in this way make claims which are not allowable. I , however, quite agree with honourable members that there are probably many cases in which taxpayers, owing to an imperfect knowledge of the law, include in their returns in quite a bond fide way items which are not allowable.",30
89,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"There is great difficulty in making up these returns. The compilation of State and Commonwealth income tax returns is on a different footing, and so it is an easy matter for a taxpayer to make a mistake. A",31
90,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"It is due tS.the Commissioner of Taxation that I should state there have been cases in which frauds have occurred through the absence of such words in the Act as are .included in the paragraph under consideration. In all the circumstances I think that it is, perhaps, better that I should aecept the amendment. Amendment, as amended, agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to.' Clauses 42 to 45 agreed to. Clause 46Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that any person who was assessed to pay income tax under sub-section 2 of section fifteen of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1015 has paid the tax out of his own moneys, and has not been able to recover the amount of the tax from his principal, the Commissioner may refund to the person assessed the amount of the tax so paid.",31
91,Sir EOBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Kooyong) [12.25] - I ask the Minister in charge of the Bill to give further consideration to this clause. Under section 15 of the Act of 1915, agents carrying on operations on behalf of principals abroad were made personally liable, on and after the 30th June, 1916, for all business operations of their principals which took place in Australia. It was discovered later that this section seriously interfered with the business of British manufacturers, and practically gave a preference to the foreigner. In an amending Act that section was repealed. It so happens that whilst the section was in operation many British merchants regarded it as their duty to obey the law, though they most strongly protested against it, and they paid the taxation levied under that particular section. There were others who resisted very strongly and never paid any taxation under it. Clause 46 of this Bill seeks to remedy, to some extent, the hardship created under section 35 of the Act of 1915. It provides that where an agent has paid on behalf of his principals any income tax incurred under the section which has been repealed, if the principal has refused to refund the taxation to the agent, the Government may refund it. There are a considerable number of cases in which the .British manufacturers have actually repaid the income tax paid on their behalf by the agents. These men were honest, prompt, and fair, but they will be penalized under this clause by being placed in a position of disadvantage as compared with the men who refused to refund the taxation paid by their agents.",31
92,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,The honourable member desires that the taxation paid under the repealed section shall be refunded whetlier it was paid by principal or agent?,31
93,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Exactly ;- I hold that the money paid by way of income tax under the repealed section by honest business men abroad should be refunded. I know that it is a difficult operation to take revenue from the Treasury once it has been collected, but it seems to me to be a serious hardship to British manufacturers, who promptly paid income taxation instead of disputing it, that they should be made to suffer under this clause as against those who protested against the taxation and refused to pay it, and whonow cannot be made to pay it. I ask the Minister in charge of the Bill to give the case of .these men sympathetic and generous consideration.",31
94,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Wilmot) ri2.30] The contention urged by the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) is a sound one, and I hope that the Government will see tiheir way to accord equitable treatment to those men who recognised their obligations by paying the tax. I know that it is hard for the Treasury to be called upon to make refunds under existing conditions; but it would certainly be inequitable to allow men who law immediately. had disregarded the law to go scot-free, whilst penalizing others who had spected the law to the extent of the tion which they had paid. If Parliament had not repealed the provision relating to this matter at the earliest possible moment, there would not have been so much to be said in favour of the suggesment tion of the honourable member yong; but, seeing that it did repeal it 'at the earliest possible moment, the vernment should either refund the money whichwas paid by those who honestly obeyed the law or collect the taxation which ought to have been paid by those who disobeyed it .",31
95,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"East Sydney) [12.32] - It is the duty of this Chamber to protect the revenue, and to see that no injustice is done. If the difficulty mentioned the honourable member for Kooyong be real one, the easiest way to overcome is to vest in the Commissioner a discresion, tionary power. I fear that the adoption of - the suggestion which has been made would open the door, very widely to evasion of the tax.",32
96,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,That question is not involved at all.,32

100,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [12.35]- I quite recognise the difficulty pointed out the honourable member for Kooyong Robert Best) that it is rather rough on some men who have paid the tax that others who were liable to it , and d id not pay, should appear to be benefited by a change in the law.",32

109,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Kooyong) [12.39] - I suppose that this is the most important provision of the Bill-important from the stand-point that it provides for retrospective operation of certain clauses which are enumerated in it. Under it we are asked to sanction the retrospective operation of the Act so far as those provisions aire concerned. As I have previously pointed out, it is a vicious principle for Parliament to sanction retrospective legislation. Probably the most important clause that will be affected by this provision",33
110,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Paragrap h 2 of section 2 is pretty bad ,33
111,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"I know that it is, but the money has already been collected. Probably section S is the most important provision in the Act which will be made retrospective. The provision has been inserted because of certain cases that have been decided by the Court-case s involving some very difficult and technical questions. Under the old law, all accumulations outside of the profit and los3 account, prior to the 1st July, 1914, were exempted from taxation. But it appears that a Mr Meares, who carried on a pastoralist's business, had appropriated the sum of £26,000 to what was called an appropriation accoimt. The Taxation Department ruled that this account was practically a profit and loss account. It is only fair to the Department to say that when the case went before the primary Oourt, Mr Justice Barton agreed witih that view. Subsequently, however, an appeal was made to the Full Court of the High Court, which decided that the account was not a profit and loss account, and that, therefore, the money standing to its credit was not liable to taxation. This decision, of course, completely altered the view of the Taxation Department, and the clause which we aTe now discussing has been introduced for the purpose of authorizing the collection of the tax in accordance with the former practice. Although the words aTe wide enough, I take it that the clause cannot possibly apply to the case of Mr Meares, who has already obtained a judgment in his favour.",33
112,Mr BOYD,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Is that point certain? .' Sir ROBERT BEST -(It is not absolutely certain, but I know the practice of the Department, and it would be nolihing short of an outrage if , after a judgment had been obtained from the High Court, an attempt was made by legislation to disregard that judgment. MT. BOYD -""We ought to have an assurance on the matter.",33
113,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"That is so. Then there were two other cases which came before the Court-on e that of the Commercial Bank, Sydney, and the other that of the Bank of Few South Walesrelating to the question of what were accumulations, and therefore what amounts were free of taxation prior to the 1st July, 1914. In both these cases the system adopted by the Department .was challenged. In my judgment, the interpretation put upon the law by, the Commissioner of Taxation was entirely in accordance with the intention of Parliament, and whilst Mr Meares obtained a judgment, it must be recollected that he secured it, to some extent, upon technical grounds. I know that this question involves the sacrifice of a revenue of upwards of half-a-million sterling already paid into revenue, and consequently we need to be very careful as to how we deal with it. I am not prepared to accept the responsibility of opposing the clause for three reasonsfirst, because I believe that the interpretation placed upon the law by the Commissioner of Taxes, which was supported by Mr Justice Barton, was really in accordance with the intention of Parliament; secondly, because Mr Meares has practically succeeded on wihat was regarded as a technical point; and thirdly, that something lite £500,000 of revenue is involved. Of course, we cannot lightly attempt to deal with the matter under those circumstances, but at the same time we should register a protest against this vicious principle of retrospective legislation. I am in sympathy with the Commissioner in this regard, but I hold that the Bill should have been introduced immediately after the decision in the action to which I have referred. I now submit to the Minister another matter. Under section 37 of the Act the taxpayer, when served with his assessby ment, has the right within t h i r t y days, think, to lodge his objection by way of appeal. Many objections have been lodged, and these have accumulated and have not been dealt with. I submit it is unfair that those objections should be wiped out in fchis way. I am sure the attitude will be taken, so far as the cases decided are concerned, that those verdicts should not be disturbed; but there are other cases where men have objected that they were not liable, and if we pass the clause in its present form those objections, and all pending litigation, will be wiped Out. I recognise that there is a large sum of revenue involved, yet those who have appealed are entitled to the sympathetic consideration of the Minister, and t relief, since, by their deliberate action, they have sought to conserve their legal claims. ; Mr BOYD. (Henty) [12.48] - I heartily re-echo the sentiments of the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best). .This is not the first occasion on which have taken objection to retrospective legislation. The community is entitled to be governed by the Acts upon our which statute-book. Every individual has the right to whatever privileges or the Courts may confer. It is a sound principle. The consideration operating in the mind of the honourable member for Kooyong, that he would not care to press his point because of the money involved, is the weakest argument he has adduced. Such a consideration should not prevent Parliament from doing what is right. If we have illegally collected from amendedthe taxpayers £500,000 in revenue we should not be put in the position of having to legislate three years afterwards to ratify that collection. It is a vicious principle, and I shall vote against it .",33
114,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Angass-Minister for Home and Territories) [13.50] - The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) has put the ease fairly. Concerning the question of profit and loss account, the earlier section of the Act was intended by Parliament to apply as the Commissioner applied it . It may be possible to manipulate a trading account in such a way that really what is a profit and loss account might be nominally called an appropriation account; and, under the decision in the Meares case. the manipulation of his accounts, a I man could, escape taxation altogether.",34
115,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"In respect of taxable moneys prior to July, 1914?",34
116,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Yes , under this particular section. So far as I can see, from the complicated cases mentioned, it was merely a technical distinction which got Meares out of the position in which he found himself. B ut in some cases there was really an appropriation account, operating as a profit and loss account; and, though only technically an appropriation account, the money was not liable to taxation. Mr B o r a - Will you say how the Government view the suggestion of the o some honourable member for Kooyong that, a man having secured a verdict of - the Court, this clause means that he may be taxed? Will he still be taxed, following upon that verdict ?",34
117,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"This section will apply to taxes that ought to have been-collected. I However, the best course is not to pas9 the clause under discussion at present. There are some amendments to be made will necessitate the recasting of the whole clause. It will be better therefore exemptions to postpone consideration.",34
118,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Will the Government reconsider the objections to appeals ?,34
119,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,We will look into that. Clause postponed.,34

I have had an assurance from the Minister that the method of taxation with respect to such bodies will not be altered by this amending Bill, hut I am still receiving letters to the effect that those associated with co-operative societies doubt very much if this is so. I think it would be very much better if , in addition to giving the Committee an assurance, the Minister could, by means of the press, remove any doubt in connection with this matter. Mr Glynn"" (Angas-Minister of Home and Territories) [2.16] - I have already told the honourable member that the Bill will not make any alteration with reference to co-operative societies, and I shall be only too pleased to draw attention to the fact in order to remove any misconception in the minds of those concerned.",35

123,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Angas-Minister for Home and .Territories) [2.18] - The position of clubs is set out in the defees, cision in the Bohemian Club case, real- ported in the Argus Law Reports of 16th allowances and April. In that case it was decided that the annual subscriptions of members of social clubs were not regarded as income within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1915-16. I think the Chief Justice decided that the subscriptions of members were to be regarded in the same light as if a single man had paid a sum of money for a certain benefit. * * # That is to say, if one man, by paying a - certain amount of money, could get certain social benefits, he would not be liable ' to be taxed upon that payment as such, and if the persons making the payment were multiplied by 100 or 500, the position would not be altered.",35
124,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"I think the judgment went further, and stated that subscriptions were not revenue, but capital. That is practically what it said.",35
125,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Perhaps it would be as well if I read the remarks of the Chief Justice on this pointThe argument is, indeed, founded upon a complete misconception of the nature of a club, which is a voluntary association of persons, who agree to maintain for the common personal benefit, and not for profit, an establishment, the expenses of which are to he defrayed by equal contribution of an amount estimated to he sufficient to defray those expenses, and the management of which is intrusted to a conunittee chosen by themselves. On principle it is quite immaterial whether the contributors are 2 or 300. If there were two or three only it would not occur to any one to say that the two or three are collectively in receipt of income from the individual. Nor are the committee of the club, or the club itself. That is to say, the judgment did not make any distinction - between capital and come in the ordinary sense of the word. . Sir ROBERT BEST - It states virtually that the income is capital.",35
126,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Thes e subscriptions would not that meet the case? were regarded as contributions of inoney by themselves. The contributions are, in substance, advances of capital for a common purpose which are expected to be exhausted during the year which they are paid. They are not income of the collective body of members, any more the calls made by members of a eompany their shares arc income from the company. If anything is left unexpended, it is not income or'profit , hut saving,- which the members claim to have returned to them. The notion tions ? that such savings are taxable income is quite novel, and quite inadmissible. As a matter of fact, without reading the report of the judgnient, I think I gave same reasons during the debate on the second reading of the Bill . Under the as it stands, a club managed for profit, that is to say, mixing up social benefits with profit, is liable to taxation. English decisions state that English clubs which depart from the object for which they were formed, and are not now being carried on as social clubs, come within the schedule of the Act, and are taxable. I do not know whether it would be possible in this Bill to include the institutions referred to under the term of proprietary clubs, but I am afraid it would probably lead to trouble in interpretation. In judgnient on the Bohemian Club case, the position of the Carlisle Golf Club, English case, was quoted, showing that taxation was imposed in respect of visitors' fees as representing income side the ordinary functions of the club. That really is the decision as regards clubs. An y clubs that do not depend interests. merely upon subscriptions will be liable under the existing law for taxation.",36
127,Mr BOYD,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"In view of the probable relent work. venue, is it worthwhile to cause so much irritation throughout the country?",36
128,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,It is expected that fair amount of revenue will be obtained from club taxation. Mr A r s r i x OKAI-MAN - How much?,36
129,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"I am not sure, but I sary to carry them on. think it will amount to £10,000 or absurd £11,000. It really depends upon much of the revenue of a club comes fro subscriptions. If only an insignificant portion of club revenue were so represubscriptions sented, it might not be desirable to insert this provision; but if a larger portion incomes from outside sources, it would not be wise to knock out the exemptions.",36

131,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Friendl y societies are already exempted. It is very hard to discriminate between the different classes of clubs that will be affected by this Bill . for Perhaps the honourable member would like further consideration of the point, but at than present I cannot see any good reason why on clubs should be struck out of the definitions.",36
132,Mr BOYD,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Will the Minister consider may a suggestion to exempt these organiza,36

134,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Kooyong) [2.25]. - Socia l clubs other than those of a tradthe ing character should never have been included, because they have been estabAct lished to enable members to come together for social purposes only. Owing to the comprehensive divisions of the Bill , other The classes of clubs which should not have been included are affected. According to the State law, manufacturers' and employers' organizations are exempt from taxation, and .according to Federal legislation, trade unions and employers' federations which are registered, are also exempt; 'but manufacturers' and employers' organizations which are not registhe tered would now come within the provisions of the term "" club."" The Chamber an of Manufactures in Melbourne may be regarded as a typical example of what I mean. In that body, manufacturers are outjoined together for purposes similar to those which animate unionists when they join a union, namely, to protect their own",36

These organizations are not formed for the pura pose of making money, but simply to enable members to protect .their own interests, and so subscriptions are regulated by the amount of expenditure necesI t would be to suggest that their subscriptions how sliould be subject to income tax. It was m practically decided in the Bohemian Club case, to which the Minister referred, that are virtually capital, and that, therefore, they cannot be regarded as income. I hope the Minister will see his way clear to exempt social clubs, and make the provisions wide enough to in clude the organizations to which I referred. Mr TTJDOB, (Yarra) [2.27] - I regret that I was absent from the chamber while the Minister was making his explanation, but I understand that he intends the provision to apply only to proprietary clubs.",36
136,Mr BOYD,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,That has not yet been decided definitely - (,37
137,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"I have taken the trouble to get a few examples of clubs which should be exempted, and have here the balance-sheet of a club with a liability of about £4,000, with assets valued at £4,700, and £3,235 owing on debentures issued for the erection of a grand stand. It is in default in respect of payment of interest to the debenture holders, and is going back at the rate of £ 1 6 1 12s. a year. Last year's income was £ 1 68 10s. The committee of management were in formed that the reduction of the overd r a f t by £ 2 6 l is . 7d. was not an allowable deduction.",37
138,Mr BOYD,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,I suppose that is the Richmond Cricket Club.,37
139,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Yes . I have here a letter from the secretary, who statesI enclose a copy of our last balance-sheet, on which I have marked the items which the Income Tax Office would not allow as deducted. The present method of assessing a club's income is to take all income, even including voluntary donations",37
140,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Does he say "" i cluding voluntary donations""?",37
141,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Yes , but the Commissioner tells me that is wrongand allow therefrom certain deductions, such as rates, rent, wages, and general working penses. The balance is treated as profit, the case of the club it is not so, because we were actually defaulting on the debenture terest, and, had we been a proprietary affair, would have been in the Bankruptcy Court. Furthermore, any amounts paid off the cannot be considered an addition to the of the club in a taxable way, because the club could never realise on the asset, on account the building being on Crown land, of which our tenure is only a permissive occupancy. clause to the effect that any club not existing the ordinary individual. for the purpose of profit, and occupying or municipal ' land on permissive occupancy only, should be exempt from the operation of the Act, would amply protect all similar to ourselves. I know the Commissioner is against that proposal, because he says it would exempt such clubs as the Victoria Racing Club and the Victoria Amateur T u r f Club. None of the clubs to which I am referring have made a penny of profit during the last four years. I am not alluding to racing clubs, which, I understand, have given the whole of the money to patriotic funds, but tp cricket, football, bowling, rowing, swimming, and other sporting clubs. Where a club is going back in its debenture account, as the club I have quoted is doing, it ought not to be charged on an alleged income from subscriptions. This club, while receiving an income of £ 1 6 8 , went back £ 1 6 1 12s.",37
142,Mr B,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,- The r e is no cricket club 0YD around Melbourne today that can pay its rent to the Parks and Gardens Committee for the public ground that it occupies.,37
143,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"This club had to pay for "" permissive occupancy and maintenance, Yarra Park,"" £ 2 6 , according to the balance-sheet, but it owes £ 7 8 5s. to the Parks and Gardens Committee. If £ 2 6 is one year's rent, the club has gone back three years. I quoted the case of the St. K i l d a Cricket Club, in the Treasurer's own electorate, when speaking on the second reading. It is not their own ground that these clubs have to plant trees or erect buildings upon, but the rent they pay to the Parks and Gardens Committee means payment of wages and the planting of hundreds of trees in the surrounding parks. What the Richmond and Melbourne Cricket Clubs, and, I presume, the East Melbourne Cricket Club, have n - paid has gone to beautify the Yarra Park righ t down to the river. The Pitzroy '-and Carlton Cricket Clubs have made the same compIaint_ about this clause, and it is safe to say' that no club of this class exis today in a solvent position. A great but in number of their members are away at the inPront, and, from my personal knowledge as a member of it , I can say that the Melbourne Cricket Club is keeping every stand one of its members good on the books assets while they are away. The swimming of clubs also feel that they will have to pay under this proposal if they make £ 1 of A profit, ancTpay,' too, at a higher rate than The secretary Crown of the Swimming Association tells me that, in some of the swimming clubs, 90 clubs per cent, of the eligible members have gone to the Front, and the average is over 70 per cent, for all the clubs. Not a great number of persons join swimming clubs as members for what they can get out of it , and the membership consequently is not very large; but two years ago 1 unveiled an honour board with over 100 names on it at the head-quarters of the. Melbourne Swimming Club, at St. Kilda. What is true of that club is true of others. I hope we shall not penalize purely sporting clubs that are getting no income, and cannot pay their way. The Commissioner is proposing to charge them upon a basis of income on which I do not think they should pay. ' Will the M in ister in charge of the Bill frame a clause to prevent them being penalized in view of the strenuous times they are passing through ?",37

In the Meares case the Court held that money ' been distributed. paid into an appropriation account was not money in a profit and loss account paid the taxation. within the meaning of section 14, and therefore was not taxable as income.

If , then, a company chooses to build up a in fund, called by what name they please, t certainly ought not to be taxed twice; but I should say that about two-thirds of the funds that are created are the results of profits, and ought to be taxed.

The first part of the clause deals with what the Committee have already validated, and the second part deals with matters such as the exemption of horticultural societies, which was urged by honourable members last year. We are constantly making the Bill retrospective for the benefit of those societies. This clause is only carrying out the promises I gave to the Committee. I therefore ask honourable members to agree to it now, on the understanding that it will be recom mitted. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to.",41
180,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [3.15] - I move That the following new clause be inserted : "" 43A.

Not a foot park lands has ever been alienated withCommonwealth out the responsible Government putting .infomn forward some excuse for their action. protest The honourable member for Dalley (Mr . Mahony), witliin whose electorate this land is situated, went specially to Sydmental ney last week to get into touch with the people concerned, and he will inform the House that their view is not what we 18th were told it was. The Minister should give us a definite statement as to how far the Government .have gone towards securmade ing other land, in the district, that is suitable for recreation purposes.

182,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Dalley) [3.25] When this matter was brought before the apparent. House previously, the Acting Prime M in ister (Mr W at t ) said that""'the Governto ment were prepared to give another rethe creation groundi n lieuof this park land ground.as which is being taken away from the people of Leichhardt for the pur-pose of Ordnance the centre of the municipality. Stores, and the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) stated that the Leichhardt Municipal Council had raised no objection to the proposal, and that so far as he knew the Department was not tinuance aware of any objection having been raised by the ]>edple of. the district. On visiting my electorate at the last week-end, I diswhich covered that there was a good deal of oband, jection on the part of the people, and the mayor-and town clerk of the municipality one assured me that when they .received the notification from the Department, and the Gazette notice from the Department, they took it that the whole matter was finalized, and that no protest on their part would be of any avail. They f u r ther assured me that they had had no in tention of agreeing to the proposal. On this, I asked the mayor of the BILL. municipality to put the views of the council in writing, so that I could place them before honourable members, and in furtherance of that request I have received the following letter signed by the of the Gotown olerk of LeichhardtEeferring to the interview of His Worship the Mayor and myself with you this morning respecting the matter of the acquisition of cerof tain park lands in this municipality by the Government, I am directed to. you that this council did not formally against such resumption, as it understood that, at the date of the receipt of the first intimation thereof, the transaction had been completed, that is to say, the departcommunication covering such intimation was under date 10th April, 1918, ""whilst the specific proclamation of the acquisition was published in the Commonwealth Gazette of March. Some day or two only before 10th April, an oflicer of the Government interviewed the mayor on the subject, and gave him to understand that due compensation would be by the Government in respect of the area thus taken. For these reasons the council did not consider that a protest would be effective, although it was, and is, most emphatically of opinion that the Commonwealth should provide another area for public recreation purposes in lieu of that resumed, so that the park lauds of this closely populated municipality shall not be curtailed. When it is remembered that the population of the municipality is over 30,000, and that it now has but one recreation ground (exclusive of the one under notice), and that at the extreme northern end of the area, the importance of this aspect will be It is recognised that difficulty may be experienced in securing another area of the size in the municipality, and I am, therefore, suggest that the substitution might take form of the conversion of the area known the Balmain Cemetery into a recreation That area comprises some ten acres, situated at Norton-street, Leichhardt,-in about For many years the cemetery has been closed against burials, ancl the graves and area generally are in a dilapidated and unkept condition. It is in a main thoroughfare traversed by a tramline, and is right in the heart of dense population; so that from all points of view its conis very detrimental to the locality. The area is at present vested in this council, subject to certain restrictions as to its use, might possibly, in the hands of the council, require adjustment by State legislation, further, the removal of bodies therefrom would, have to be provided for; but, on the oilier - hand, the purchase of land would be avoided. It is felt that such matters should not be incapable of adjustment, and I am, therefore, to suggest it to you as a practical means of overcoming the difficulty referred to. The site suggested by the council is an admirable one. It is a burial ground containing 10 acres which has been closed for years. If the Govern. ment who are taking away the people's park will undertake to meet the expense of removing the bodies and the tombstones in the cemetery, and will vest the area in the council for the people of the district, I shall be prepared to vote for the third reading of the Bill . The suggestion put forward is a very fair one, and only carries out the offer made by the Acting Prime Minister. If the M i nister will give me an official communication which I can forward to the municipal council stating that the Government will meet their wishes in-this matter, there can be no objection'to the Bill .",42
183,Mr BAYLEY,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Oxley) [3.32] - As one who has always been opposed to taking away park lands from the people, I made it my business to visit the electorate of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr . Mahony) last week-end, and found that the area which it is proposed to acquire for the purpose of Ordnance Stores is altogether unsuitable for park purposes. It contains about 5 acres of park land. I understand that it is the intention of the Government to resume another 5 acres which will increase the area to 10 acres. The land borders on - the Leichhardt Canal. It is altogether too narrow for recreation purposes.",43
184,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Not for a playground for children ?,43
185,Mr BAYLEY,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"I rise to support the suggestion put forward by the honourable member for Dalley because I realise that the site chosen by the municipal council is far more suitable as a playground for children. The area to be acquired is not more than 300 yards from the Leichhardt Canal, and is right at the extreme end of the suburb, whereas the cemetery which it is suggested should be taken in exchange is situated exactly in the centre, and is far more accessible to the children and residents of the district. I sincerely trust that the Government will see their way clear to give effect to the transfer, because if it be carried out, not only will residents of Leichhardt not be deprived of park lands, but they will also be benefited by-it.",43
186,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Maribyrnong) [3.35]. - I object to the whole proposal contained in this Bill , notwithstanding the fact that the honourable member for Dalley is prepared to accept another area in lieu of the park which the Government propose to acquire for the new Ordnance Stores in Sydney. We shall require to establish Ordnance Stores in all the capital cities of the Commonwealth, and at present the buildings used for the purpose are situated upon valuable city areas. The Defence Department have purchased in the different States very considerable areas of land as manoeuvre areas. In New South .Wales they have spent a considerable sum of money in the purchase of hundreds of acres at Liverpool Plains. They have also purchased a large area of land at Broadmeadows, about 10 miles outside of Melbourne. One of the reasons given for the purchase of the land at Broadmeadows was that later on the Department would be able to devote a portion of the land to the establishment of military stores.",43
187,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,In this case a water frontage is wanted.,43
188,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Why ?,43
189,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,The Department does not say.,43
190,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"The Naval and M i l i tary men never, do say why they want a .particular thing. They are quite prepared to pick the eyes out of a city park if it suits their convenience.",43
191,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,I should say that water frontage is required for the convenience of transport.,43
192,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Convenience of transport by rai l and water is desirable.,43
193,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"There is a railway to Liverpool. I remind honourable members that there is no railway connection with the Ordnance Stores at South Melbourne. Everything has to be carted from the railway to those stores. Later on, I understand that the Ordnance Stores for Melbourne will be established on some of the land purchased at Broadmeadows. I have yet to be convinced that it is essential that military stores should be in close proximity to the general Post Offices of our principal cities. The Defence Department are already in possession of land .upon which Ordnance Stores might be established in New South Wales.",43
194,Mr AUSTIN CHAI,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,MAN - Where ?,44
195,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"At Liverpool. It would appear that a different policy is to be adopted for New South Wales from that followed in Victoria, and land for Ordnance Stores is to be purchased at considerable expense in Sydney, although the Government are already in possession of land suitable for the purpose of the erection of permanent Ordnance Stores.",44
196,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"The Ordnance Stores to be erected at Leichhardt are to be permanent, according to the statement of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt).",44
197,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"That is so, but we have been told that the Camp at Liverpool is to be permanent. I want to know why it should be necessary to encroach upon park lands within 4 miles of the Sydney General Post Office, in order to secure a site for the erection of Ordnance Stores.",44
198,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Is it not a fact that the erection of the stores at the Leichhardt site would save hundreds of pounds in transport charges.,44
199,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"No . I do not think that this should be a matter of bargaining between the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) and the Government. If this proposal is agreed to we shall have the Naval and Military authorities seeking to invade other public parks to suit their personal convenience, when the purpose to be served might be just as wel'l met by the acquisition of sites outside city areas. In the course of the inquiries by the Public Works Committee it was found that big firms in Sydney and other places were adopting the policy of purchasing land in suburban areas, where sites could be obtained cheaply, for the erection of their large store houses. That is a commercial policy now being adopted in all the large cities of the Commonwealth. If private indito viduals see their way to save money by the adoption of that policy we may safely take a leaf out of their book. I had no opportunity to speak on the Other stages of this Bill, so I enter my protest at this stage. I stand up to protect few park lands we have in close proximity to our large cities from the invasion the Naval and Military authorities, especially when the Defence Department already has land better suited for the purpose of military establishments.",44
200,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Capricornia) [3.40] - I also desire to utter a final protest against the passing of this Bill. I deplore the tendency of modern times to encroach upon park lands dedicated to the public. Wherever we go we find business men taking the most direct and easy way to obtain their ends. They appear to find it the' easiest way to encroach upon public parks for commercial purposes. It is characteristic of the age, which is distinctly a commercial one. Thirty years ago it would have been impossible for any Government to take lands which had been set apart for the use of the public. I have no doubt that you, sir, have taken part in agitations against the use of public parks for improper purposes. I can remember the time when the people of Sydney used to take up the .fences put round lands there, and I believe that the name of Mr Speaker (the Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) was associated with an agitation of that kind. We appoint medical commissions to inquire into the best means of maintaining the public health. ""How to save the babies?"" is a question that is now frequently asked, and we have doctors appointed to take the height and weight, and examine the eyes, ears, and teeth of children in our State schools, with a view to securing a standard of health amongst them which will ensure a virile race of people. In spite of this we neglect one of the best means of keeping children in good health by failing to supply them with sufficient playgrounds attached to their schools and sufficient public areas-in which they may play. I do not happen to know the particular site referred - to in this Bill, but it is quite sufficient for me that the Government of New South Wales thought it good enough to proclaim it as a public park. Although I may not go so far as call for a division on the third reading of the Bill, I shall be prepared, if it goes to a division, to vote against it. *. Mr Laird SMITH (Denison) [3.44] - I should like to say that I also the am totally opposed to any public parks being acquired by the Government or any of one else if the lands set apart for the purpose are suitable. On making inquiries I find that the lands sought to be acquired under this Bill at Leichhardt are not suitable for a public park, and we'have a promise by the Government that they are prepared to enable the municipality concerned to purchase a more suitable site. The present park at Leichhardt is dangerous to the children, whose health the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) would like to conserve. I have been informed that two children have been drowned at this site owing to the fact that it has a water frontage. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) has made an extraordinary suggestion. At a time when we should be anxious to make every saving possible he suggests that these Ordnance Stores should be established at Liverpool, that the stores should be taken all the way to that place and then taken back to Sydney for distribution. interest upon the sums which we pay for freight at present would go a long way towards defraying interest upon the cost of constructing these buildings. I am of opinion fihat the erection of the proposed Ordnance Stores in the park will not constitute a menace to the locality, but will, on the contrary, improve it by securing the utilization of land which is not suitable for recreation purposes.",44
201,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"East Sydney) [3.46] - I protest against the resumption of this land for the erection of Ordnance Stores. In other suburbs of Sydney ample areas, eminently suited for that purpose, are available, and any of these areas might be utilized without encroaching upon park lands in the immediate vicinity of the metropolis. Everybody knows that the foreshores of Port Jackson have already been alienated to'such' an extent that the public can scarcely gain access to them. This is a deplorable condition of affairs, and one which evidences great short sightedness on the part of those responsible for it. It is true that the suburb of Leichhardt has a population of only about 30,000, but it must be remembered - that this particular park serves as a creation ground for at least 100,000 people. I am glad that in 1906 this Parliament, in its wisdom, decreed that no public reserves should be resumed by the Commonwealth. It evidently recognised that the time would come when the House would contain a number of park butchers. I protest against the resumption of this land, which is situated in the most densely populated portion of .Sydney. As a matter of fact, it provides the people of the suburbs immediately adjacent to it with their only outlet to the water, to which the State Government have provided a tramway to convey the people. For proposing such a rascally move, a vote of no-confidence in the Government is abundantly warranted. However, I can only place upon record my disgust and contempt for the action of Ministers in thus attempting to. rob the people of their reserves.",45
202,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) ] 3.55] - I .have been asked by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) whether I ' could give an assurance in the matter of the GoThe vernment helping to secure a park for the people concerned. Originally it was stated by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) - and I now repeat it-that no proclamation would be issued for the taking over of this land unless some arrangement was first made with the Government of New South Wales to obtain a park in lieu of the acreage secured. The honourable member has suggested a way of doing that, in the letter he has placed before me, which indicates that there is a cemetery in the centre of the district that could be used as a play-ground after necessary work upon it. The Federal Government could not interfere with the State in its relation to cemetery matters. We could only promise to make representations to the New South Wales authorities. I hope that what was proposed in the telegram which I read out from the representatives of the Commonwealth in Sydney, namely, that the council was favourable to the transfer on the assumption that the State would apply the money to secure another park, will be carried out. All we can do, however, is to ask that the purchase amount be applied for that purpose.",45
203,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Will you put that re- undertaking in writing to me, and definitely state that the proclamation will not be issued unless what you have indicated is done?",45
204,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Yes , I will do. that, in accordance with the promise of the Acting Prime Minister. I shall suggest that the proposition receive very careful consideration, while remembering, of course, that we cannot dictate to the State. Question-That this BilL be now read a third time-put .

That, to me, is a most offensive remark, and the honourable member who made it has been good enough to express regret for what he said. I shall, of course, accept that 26 expression in the spirit in which it . was 9 was made; but the interjection has probably gone to every daily newspaper 17 throughout Australia.",46
206,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"He a r , hear! I ATES. read it at Lang Lang at six-thirty this morning. Splendid for the Plinders by-election !",46
207,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Yes , no doubt, and reported in every newspaper in the Commonwealth. I remember reading some- where in Edmund Burke's speeches that Watt, W . A'. one could never impeach a nation. That is so true, to my mind, that in none of m y speeches throughout my political career will it be found that I have said anything Story, W . H . against any nation, whether Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, French- I will not say NOES. with regard to the Germans since the war. But there has never been any word of mine against any nation. The majority Tellers : among a people must be good in , themselves; otherwise they, as a nation, would PAIRS. soon become extinct. W it h regard to England, I have never said anything against her. I have on occasions deemed it necessary to criticise some of the rulers of England, because we cannot forget- I do not want to go into these .matters - at 1 this particular time-that , - prior to the war, there were from 10,000,000 to 12,000,000 people in England who were unable to get enough to eat. But I have never said anything against t'he English people. Indeed, I could not, because my people on my father's side came from Cornwall, and my relatives there would be extremely pained if they read the in terjection by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), "" Say a good word for England, by way of a change""-because , no doubt, they conclude that I have been continually attacking the English people. I hope the press will be good enough, since no doubt they nublished the interjection of the honourable member throughout Australia, to report what I am saying now. I have never said anything I found in",46
208,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Grampians) [4.7] - I rise to support the remarks made by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs), and to echo his wish, that the press will take full notice of his remarks today, as it did of my most unfortunate interjection last uight. Since I made the interjection, I have been deeply distressed, because I realise that a remark made in a careless moment like that cannot be recalled.",46
209,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,All new members make mistakes.,47
210,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"My friends, including the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West), and the House generally, are very kind to me in this matter. think that the interjection I made last night was offensive aud uncalled f u r . I know that I oannot atone for the pain caused, and 1 can only offer my deepest regret to the honourable member.",47
211,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"Batman) [ 4 . 8 ] - I do not desire to say anything concerning the matter upon which the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has made such a manly and generous withd ra.wal, but' I wish to - take advantage of this opportunity-as no other has been afforded to us by. the Government-of entering my protest against the policy of the Government in enlisting youths of eighteen years of age for active service abroad. I have quite a vivid recollection of allegations, levelled more than once against the Labour party by supporters of my honourable friends opposite, to the effect that the Labour party was the party, of aU. others, whioh had no respect for the sanctity of the home, and I cannot imagine anything more calculated to break down family life than this proposal of the Governmenb to deliberately offer a premium to the youths of this country of eighteen years of age to disregard the wishes; of thoir parentsi n respect of this important matter of enlistment.",47
212,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Does the honourable member say that a premium is being offered because - the young men desire to serve their country?,47
213,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"When strong men, in the fulness of their manhood-and a n i mated, aa they would have us believe, by a burning patriotism, themselves ref r a in from enlisting, and refrain also from raising the maximum age to enable strong, able-bodied men to enlist and serve their country-see k to induce youths to disregard the wishes of their parents in this matter, I cannot help thinking that this Government and the party that stands behind them desire to fight tiheir battles with children in the front rank, and men in the area of safety. The war has been in progress for nearly four years, and the proposal of the Government now affects a class of persons wh'o were under fifteen years of age when the war was declared, while at the same time there remain exempt from service men who, when this war broke out, were well under 45 years of age-men ; in fact, who told us that, at a later stage, they would I enlist. I can well understand, the restiveness of honourable members opposite at the thought that the Government are proposing to take children foractive service abroad, aud that the new regulation will immediately release a certain class of youths who will now be able to say to their parents, "" I am going in spite of you,"" and wil l also enable the Defence Department to say to the mother or the father, "" We are going to take your boy in spite of y o u . """,47
214,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,The honourable member would not allow anybody to go.,47
215,Mr BKENNAN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"L i this chamber, T have heard the former honourable member for Flinders (Sir Will i a m I r v in e ) , who is now occupying a distinguished position elsewhere, amidst the applause of members - on his own side, deprecate the enlistment of boys of eighteen years, even with the consent of their parents. I wonder, what his viewwould he now if he were called upon to excuse the position now taken up by the Government, which seeks to take boys without the consent of their parents, without the consent of, it may be, the widow who, perhaps, has said to herself, "" My son wants to go to the .war, and perhaps in a year or two, when he is twenty-one years of age, when his health, education, and my position, may be such as to justify it , I may be reconciled to the thought of seeing him go.""' Such a . parentmay now be told, "" W© do not care what your views are in this matter. The boy isw ill in g; &e is actuated by the. spirit of adventure; and is prepared to take the risks of. active service abroad-; so it does not matter whab you, with your riper opinion and better judgment, may think. We propose to enlist him whether you will or not "" '  to apply to all ages between forty-five and fifty-five.",47
216,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"If the need of men has become so acute that it is necessary to enliBt those outside the prescribed ages, let us enlist some active men between the ages of forty-five and fifty. Let us get, into the firing line some of those lipfighters that talk so glibly about the thing in this House and elsewhere.",48
217,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,Some of those between thirty and forty .,48
218,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,The honourable member might just happen to miss me. - Mr Webster - That would not be much. loss.,48
219,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED,"No doubt he,, thought he would include me. I can discover no justification for this departure of the Government, nor do I believe that it has the unanimous support of the Government - I cannot imagine the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) being favourable to it . I have no ill - w i ll against him, but when I remember his own attitude in regard to the war and his duty to the war, and when I see him there with others in their middle age, strong and hefty, deliberately moving these regulations for the purpose of taking youths against the will of their parents, I cannot believe that it has his approval or his sincere assent. It m a y satisfy the ambitions of honourable members who, not having been able to obtain conscription, want to go as close to conscription as possible. They have tried the process of industrial conscription, and have experimented with the plan of conscripting our allied friends here whose bodies they have seized, and whom they are attempting now to deport against the will of the majority of the Australian people. Lastly, they have introduced this mean device, the conscription of the mothers and fathers of children whom they propose to take without the consent of the very people whose responsibilities should be regarded and whose views should be respected. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.18 p.m.",48
