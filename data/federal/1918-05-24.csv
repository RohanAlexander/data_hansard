1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) took the chair at. 11 a.m., and read prayers. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",20
2,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In a leading article in the Argus this morning reference is made to the statement made here yesterday way of interjection, that I was the member of the Labour party who was that assisting in getting recruits.",20
3,Mr WATT,Unknown,I did not say that.,20
4,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,No ; but that inference has been drawn from what was said.,20
5,Mr WATT,Unknown,It-is an incorrect inference.,20
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The attitude of Senator Gardiner, the Leader of the Labour party in the Senate, towards recruiting is well known. He and I were the representatives of the Federal party at the Conference vened by the Governor General. He has, since the Conference, in the press, and, think, on the platform, advocated voluntary recruiting. The Leader of the New South Wales Labour party (Mr J. Storey), who was also at the Conference, has done the same. Unfortunately Mr. Elmslie, the late Leader of the Labour party in Victoria, died soon after the Conference, but those who knew him know what he would have done had his health permitted. Mr Jolley, the Leader of the Labour party in South Australia, and a member of the Conference, has, since it was held, advocated voluntary recruiting from the public, platform, and was, prior to the Conference, and is still, a member of the State Recruiting Committee. The Premier of Queensland, Mr Ryan, who also attended the Conference as a Labour representative, is at the present time actively engaged in addressing recruiting meetings, as the Minister for Recruiting (Mr Orchard) can testify. This week Mr Ryan addressed, I believe, a meeting in Queen-street, Brisbane, at which 6,000 persons attended. Mr Collier, the Leader of the Labour party in Western Australia, another member of the Conference, has, since the Conference separated, been actively engaged in recruiting work, arid I read in the newspapers that the Deputy Leader of the Labour party in Tasmania, Mr Ogden, was present at the meeting which opened the recruiting campaign in that State, and did his best t to get recruits. The names I have mentioned include all the parliamentary Labour leaders of the Commonwealth, and of the six States, and all the Labour parliamentarians who attended the Conference, and in justice to them and to the movement I have made these facts known. Mr ""WATT - I had no intention of by asking the public to draw the inference only that has heen drawn by the newspaper has heen mentioned. In answer to an interjection, I commented on the vigorous way in which the Leader of the Opposition has always supported voluntary recruiting, and I am sorry that the interjection has caused misapprehension, but that was not its intention. I do not wish to differentiate between members opposite. Yesterday I invited the full cooperation of the House in the matter of conrecruiting, as I have always done since I took my present position. Later I shall I make a statement regarding the sessional arrangements, and I shall invite the cooperation of members, during the parliamentary recess, in the advancement of recruiting in the country. I am sure that the influence of members' speeches will be salutary and will be visible in the recruiting returns. NAV Y DEPARTMENT. APPOINTME NT OF MB . LATHAM .  orable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked, as a third of a series of questions on notice, if it was ""the practice Of Mr Latham to accept one-third of the fees received by the barristers under a system whereby a solicitor delivered to a barrister, say Mr A.B., a brief marked ' Mr A . B . , for Mr Latham, 15 guineas,' and Mr A . B . will have to appear in the case and hand over one-third of the fee to Mr Latham?"" My answer to the question was that no such arrangement was known to the Department. To that answer I wish to add, in justice to Mr . Latham, that the practice of delivering to a barrister a brief on behalf of another barrister on active service was adopted in Victoria by the Attorney-General's Department several years ago, at the request of the Bar Council. It is understood that a similar practice has for several years prevailed in England. So far as Mr . Latham is concerned, however, this practice has not been applied by the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, at the time when Mr Latham joined the Navy Department, he held from the Commonwealth several briefs in pending cases. These he surrendered, and the Commonwealth thereupon briefed fresh counsel quite independently of Mr Latham. RETURNED SOLDIERS. WEAVING OF CLOTH.",20
7,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"As a large num. ber of returned soldiers and other workers will be out of employment at the end of the war, and the price of clothing is ever increasing, because of the dearth of shipping, will the Government consider the urgent necessity of at once making full inquiry regarding the establishment of works for the manufacture of the raw material in Australia?",21
8,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I do not think that the question is an urgent one in the parliamentary sense, and I am unable to replv [187] to it now. I understand that the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen} is dealing with the matter referred to, aDd if notice is given of the question, I shall be prepared to give it an answer next Wednesday. ORDNANCE CORPS, AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE.",21
9,Mr STORY,Unknown,"Has the Defence Department arrived at a decision regarding the establishment of an Ordnance Corps in connection with the Australian I m perial Force, and will the Minister representing the Minister for Defence in f o rm the House on the next day of sitting what is being done in this direction, and if it is intended that the Ordnance Corps shall be established before the end of the war?",21
10,Mr WISE,Unknown,"I shall bring the question under the notice of the Minister for Defence, and endeavour to get an answer by next Wednesday. PACIFIC ISLANDS.",21
11,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"There are rumours current to the effect that Australia, New Zealand, and Japanese interests are making a sort of grab at certain islands in the Pacific, and adjacent to Australia or New Zealand. I should like to be in formed whether the Government know anything regarding the claims of these countries to these islands.",21
12,Mr WATT,Unknown,"That is hardly a question to be answered without notice. The honourable member is becoming a phonograph for the repetition of rumours. I know nothing of those to which he refers. Are they current ou the tongue, or in the press ?",21
13,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,There is trouble in the Marshall Islands between the Japanese and Australians.,21
14,Mr WATT,Unknown,"If the honourable member will be explicit, and give notice of his question, I shall have enquiries made. OPENING PRAYER.",21
15,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Yesterday a question was asked regarding the prayer with which our proceedings are opened each day, and it was suggested that an addition should be made to the for m of words used. On several occasions in the past I have suggested that the wording of the prayer should be amended, by the substitution of the word "" deliberations "" for the word "" consultations,"" which, in Australia, has a meaning altogether dissociated from prayer. I ask you, Mr . Speaker, whether, . when the Standing Orders Committee is considering the alteration of the prayer, consideration can be given to my suggestion?",21
16,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," Of course, I read the prayer .that is embodied in the Standing Orders, and if it be the desire of the House that an additional prayer shall be read, I shall be pleased to consult the Prime Minister and the Standing Orders Committee on the matter. garding the suggestion of the honourable member, I shall be very glad to do what he desires. EXPORTATION OF LEATHER .",22
17,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am informed, from a source that is very correctly primed, that there are now 3,000 tons of surplus leather held in the Commonwealth. That leather is worth over Â£600,000, and tanners and their employees are in a serious position because its exportation is prohibited. The Board of Shipping gave its consent to the exportation of a certain quantity of leather from Sydney by the ship Llanse-phen Castle, but, unfortunately, the order came to hand twenty-four hours after the vessel had left the harbour, carrying away 15,000 raw hides. Will the Acting Prime Minister do something to assist the tanning industry, both from the employers' and employees' standpoint, by allowing the exportation of surplus leather?",22
18,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The Government is f u l ly aware of the importance of the tanning industry from many points of view in regard to both production and employment. For a considerable time it has been pressing the British authorities to allow greater freedom in the export of Australian leathers to Britain . For some reason, which we have not been able to full y appreciate, there is a practical embargo against such export. Leather is not on the list of priorities that the British Government allow. As the result of further representations, we obtained, on the occasion referred to by the honourable member, a special permission, which I understood had considerably relieved the tanning trade.",22
19,Mr FENTON,Unknown,But the vessel had left before the permission arrived.,22
20,Mr WATT,Unknown,I do not think that was the fault of the Government; but I do not know the circumstances. I shall in quire into that feature of the matter. The tanners know that the Government are very anxious to assist them so far as they can to secure space for the export of a reasonable quantity of leather.,22
21,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"When the opportunity offers in the way of shipping space to relieve the leather industry by making exports of leather, will the Acting Prime Minister, as far as possible, allow Rethat relief to be given proportionately in the different States 1 ",22
22,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I think that proposition is quite fair, and I understand that the Leather Board's operations would give effect to it . BUILDING OF SHIP S.",22
23,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister in charge of shipping whether it is correct, as reported in the press this morning, that a contract for the construction of five 12,000-ton ships has been let at Parramatta? If so, will he lay the contract on the table?""  of the contract referred to, but if the honourable member will give notice of his question I shall supply him with the in formation desired. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",22
24,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. The Agethis morning, in referring to the interchange which took place last night between the honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) and myself, states that the honourable member said there were members of the Opposition who "" saw the light "" but did not follow it owing to the pressure of a section flying, not the Australian, but the Red flag. It then goes on to say that I "" interjected and smiled."" That is in accurate. As a matter of fact, I was laughing at a thought that was in my mind",22
25,Mr BOYD,Unknown,What is the line of demarcation between a smile and a laugh ?,22
26,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"A lady smiles, b ut the honourable member grins. The Age report continues as follows: Mr Laird SMITH 7,heatedly) - You smile. You have no one at the Front. I throw back the laugh into his teeth.",22
27,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"To hell with you. (Disorder.) Having been called to order by the Speaker Dr Maloney withdrew the remark. "" I desire to explain that I did not use the expression attributed to me by the Age.  orable member said.",23
28,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,He did not.,23
29,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Y o u , Mr Speaker, did not hear what I said. I do not know whether the Age reporter was new to the work, but I did not use thÂ© expression.",23
30,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,If Mr Speaker had heard what the honourable member actually d id say he would have called upon him to withdraw it .,23
31,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"This is a case of, "" save me from my friends,"" I am glad, Mr Speaker, you d id not hear what I said. If you had you would have called upon me to withdraw the remark, and I 'Would have done so. I do not think the honourable member for Denison (Mr . Lair d Smith) heard what I said.",23
32,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,No ; I heard afterwards what it was.,23
33,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"If the honourable member had heard what I . said I would have withdrawn the expression. The Age reporter did not hear me use the words which he attributed to me, because they did not leave my lips.",23
34,Mr BOYD,Unknown,He made a mighty good guess.,23
35,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I ask the Age reporter, in the best of good humour, to report what I actually say, no matter how bad it is, and not to make, as i u this case, three inaccuracies in one paragraph. As u matter of fact, I have four relatives at the Pront. One of them has been wounded four times, aud I am trying to find another man to take his place, so that he may come back. SOLDIER S' NEXTOFKIN",23
36,Mr WISE,Unknown,"Yesterday the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) asked me a question with reference to the issue of badges to the mothers and next bf ki n of soldiers who have fallen in the war, and I promised to make inquiries. A similar question is being asked in the Senate this morning, and the following reply will be made by the Minister for Defence:The position is that considerable delay has occurred in obtaining delivery of the badges [187]- 2 from the contractor, who has been hindered through inability to obtain adequate supplies of suitable enamel. I have referred the matter to the recently appointed Board of Business Administration with a view to the manufacture of the medals being expedited, and early issue commenced. TELEPHONE BOX REPAIRS.",23
37,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"L as t Friday I in vited the attention of the Postmaster General to certain statements with regard to the method of repairing telephone boxes, and embellishing the f u r n it u re of his Department. I wish to ask the honourable gentleman if his attention has been directed to a paragraph in last Saturday's issue of the Herald, and whether he is prepared to make any further statement jiu reply to that rather strong corroboration of the complaint I voiced on the previous day?",23
38,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I have seen the paragraph. My reply will appear in the Herald. NA MALDON.,23

In view of the existence in Brisbane of every facility for the carrying out of such repairs, wiil the honoraible gentleman see that the work is done there, thus avoiding a delay of many day3 during which the vessel could be profitably employed?  comes under the control of the Shipping Board. If the equipment necessary for the repair of this ship is available at Brisbane, it should not be necessary to* send her down to Sydney. I shall make representations to the proper authorities. SCOTTISH REGIMENTS.",23
46,Mr LIVINGSTON,SHIPPING REPAIRS A T,The Acting Prime Minister promised last week to obtain from the Defence Department the objections they have to the raising of Scottish regiments in Australia. Has he that information ?,24
47,Mr WATT,SHIPPING REPAIRS A T,"I do not know that I promised to give the information to the House. The honourable member originated his question upon'the report of a deputation which I had received in Sydney at the time of the Premiers' Conference, and I then said I had undertaken to collect from the Department the military objections to the proposal and to forward them to the Highland societies from whom representations had been made to me on the subject. That has been done, and these societies in New South Wales have undertaken, I understand, to endeavour to meet the objections. So far I have not received their answers.

50,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH LIF E,"The honourable member, as is his custom, gave me a few minutes' notice of this question. I do not know' that if the Commonwealth were to insure our own boys who are going overseas the result would be to minimize the cost to any extent.

SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 23rd May (vide 5075), on motion by Mr Watt That this Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr TUDOR had movedThat after the word "" That "" the words this House condemns the action of the Government in enlisting for service abroad youths of eighteen years, who have not obtained the been consent of their parents,"" be inserted.",27
78,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Melbourne Ports) if [11.39] - It is a mere bagatelle to ask for authority to raise another Â£80,000,000 by and way of war loans, but we can easily see give that very soon the Commonwealth Gol the vernment will have an indebtedness of it about Â£500,000,000, and the Government give' are showing no evidence of any desire bn their part to compel those people who can afford to pay to contribute their fair share of the war expenditure. I am not in the habit of making statements which I cano r not prove. I am sure that 90 per cent, of the Â£80,000,000 which will be contriperbuted to the loans which will be author rized by this Bill will be contributed from excess war profits, which have been made the out of the community generally and which for the Government should get without having This statement of mine for may be considered a very wild one, but if the Government had done their duty they would have compelled the people who are steps making money out of the war to pay for enthe cost of the war. The Commonwealth exthe penditure was Â£28,000,000 prior to 1914, army and we were told that the taxation which of was imposed to meet that expenditure was were excessive, but I am of opinion that it will cost us Â£60,000,000 to administer Commonwealth affairs when the war comes to an end. If the taxation necessary to produce a revenue of Â£28,000,000 from a paltry 5,000,000 people was considered too much, how are we to raise Â£60,000,000 when the majority of our soldiers will retur n to us in a very much impaired condition, as compared to their virility prior to the war, unless those who are making money are taxed to the fullest possible extent! I can quite understand why a section of the Government's supporters are satisfied with the position, but it is , natural to suppose that there are hundreds of thousands of people supporting the Government who are not well off, and they will have to pay while others who are supporting the Government will go on in creasing their banking accounts. uot wish to weary the House with my impressions on this matter, but it seems foolish to talk of economy, as some conservative politicians and the conservative press teach it , that is, by lowering wages aud impairing the service rendered by Government utilities, when we are borrowing Â£80,000,000 from people who will make the most of it out of war profits.",27
79,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,If we tax those people they will pass it on to others.,28
80,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Certainl y they will . They Iiave not had the common decency to pay Â£500,000, representing the paltry share of excess profits which this Governmenb proposed to deprive them of. they will contribute this Â£80,000,000 for war loans from those self-same profits. One inatter that should receive great attention from the Government is that of shipbuilding. The necessity for the building of ships has been made apparent every day durng this war. It has been recognised now for over three years. do not blame any Minister or any Government in regard to the delay that has taken place, but I claim that a Government which makes such a pretence about having a greater desire to win the war than any other Government have had, should have been farseeing enough to commence the building of ships long ago. Instead of that, the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) conceived the idea of being able to build these vessels without any interference from unions, and ""to that end he held a number of conferences with representatives of the workers at which some sort of agreement, not a unanimous one, was reached. Yet nothing has been done, because we are told that we can do nothing without material. But when the idea was first conceived arrangements should have been made to get the necessary material. The Government started in a wrong fashion with the unions, and made one of the silliest arrangements possible. In the Government shipyards the rule was laid down that there should be piecework, and to this the unions objected. However, some sort of an arrangement was come to, a number of the unions reluctantly agreeing to the condition. In spite of this, no further progress has been made; and the farce is that, while there is to be piece-work, contracts have been let without calling for tenders. Three firms-two in Victoria and one in another I do State-hav e been given contracts at a fixed price for the construction of engines and other necessary parts for the vessels, but not, as ought to have been the case, in open market. Why should these firms - on e the Castlemaine Foundry, aud another in the Prime Minister's electorate of Bendigo-be selected and given this advantage? The farce is rendered still more glaring by the fact that private firms which are manufacturing other parts, have the work done by day labour, as in the past. Either the contractors are getting special consideration, for some reason that I do not know, or the Government realise that their insistence on pieceYet work will be a failure, especially in certain directions, aud are adopting this plan so as to avoid admitting the failure. ' Apparently this sort of thing is to be permitted to go on unchallenged; at any rate, any remarks on the subject from this side f all on deaf ears. If there is a desire on the part of the press to ventilate the I subject, the War Precautions Act is put into operation, so that there is no opportunity to show how inefficient the plans of the Government are. We ought to kuow why the Government are departing from the ordinary rule of letting contracts, and why a system found good enough for private firms cannot be f o l lowed in the Government shipyards. Of course, there is a certain strain of parochialism in every man. I have often said that you have only to scratch a man a little deeply to find that he is a Statesrighter; and no doubt we all have a desire that the places we represent shall have a fair proportion of the public work. Why are firms in my electorate, or in otlier electorates, not given an opportunity to compete with the firms at Castlemaine and Bendigo? If the Government can adopt procedure of this kind without being called to account, tlieir supporters are willing to stand anything. We are told that the Australian workman is the cause of all the trouble; that the Government had to insist on piecework because the workers here are never satisfied, and always demanding higher wages. On this account, it is said, we' cannot construct ships as cheaply here as they are built in America, but that is not a fact, because the wages tliere are high enough to drive our dear old Conservative employers into fits if they had to pay them. For instance, I have here an American shipbuilding agreement.between the California Metal Trades Association and the California Foundryman's Association on the one part, and the Iron Trades Council of San Francisco on the other part. This agreement is intended to prevent industrial troubles, which I can tell honourable members are quite as great in America as they are here. Further, the wages are higher in America, and the'demands of the workmen are quite as persistent as those in Australia. Yet in America they are building ships efficiently under the order of things that is desired in Australia. In the agreement to which I have referred, it is laid down4. Under no circumstances shall any work he f ierformed on Labour Day, except to preserve ife or property. 5. Such grievances as do not relate to the subject of hours or wages covered by this agreement, which may arise in any shop, shall be given consideration as follows: Upon complaint being made by either party to this agreement in writing, the duly authorized representative of the firm and the business representative of the union, or the representative of the Iron Trades Council, who may be elected to represent the union, shall immediately proceed to the shop or shops where such grievance exists and endeavour to mutually settle the same. 6. Any grievance that cannot be settled manner must be referred to conference, the call and subject for such conference to be made in writing. This conference shall be called within six days from receipt of notice, for the purpose of adjusting the question at issue, nnd the conference shall continue day after day until the question at issue is settled, unless mutually postponed. 6(a). Any dispute which cannot be settled by means provided herein shall be referred to the Examiner appointed by the Lahour Adjustment Board of the Emergency Fleet Corporation, for investigation and recommendation, such recommendations to be subject to ratification by parties to this agreement. We are told that it is impossible to construct shipping here by the day-labour system, under which the men will not work, and which proves too costly; but in most skilled trades in Australia the wages are not nearly so high as in America. For instance, machinists are paid $5.80, or about 24s. a day; machinist specialists, $4.40; machinists' helpers, $3.96, or about 16s. a day; while, in Australia, the last-mentioned are paid only about 8s. 6d. Pattern-makers in America are paid $7.15, or about 30s. a day, as contrasted with not quite half that amount in Australia. In America,- blacksmiths' helpers are paid $4.30; anglesmiths, $5.80; heaters, $4.95; pipe fitters, $5.80; and so on until shipwrights, boatbuilders, and millmen are paid $6.60, or 27s. 6d.; caulkers, $7.15, or 29s. 3d. per day; aud labourers and helpers, $3.57, or 14s. 10$d. a day. Here there is a howl because shipwrights and so on are paid 15s. a day and demand that when they go to Williamstown from their homes in the city they shall be paid their fares and their time in travelling. Further, in America, with such wages as these, ships are constructed more cheaply than in Australia. I fancy that if the dear old gentlemen, the employers of Australia, were asked to pay anything like 29s. 3d. to caulkers they would go into a permanent fit; nevertheless, in America ships are being turned out like sausages, while, as yet, we have made no attempt at construction. I am sorry the Minister in charge of these matters is not present, because I know the other day, when I was making some remarks, he felt that I was attacking him when I ought to be helping him. It is very evident that it is not the fault of the unionists of Australia that our shipbuilding cannot be proceeded with; and there ought to be in this genius enough in Australia, as in America, to remove the industrial troubles by the simple expedient of not insisting on piece-work. . If the old plan can be followed in America, with the big wages I have quoted, there is no reason why it cannot be followed here. Of course, I know that it was a great conception on the part of the Government to catch the public ear with the name of the ""Win-the-war"" party.",28
81,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,The Government did not conceive that name-the y stole it.,30
82,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Howeve r that may be, if it is the Prime Minister that is the cause of all the trouble, have honourable members opposite not enough force of character to declare that ships shall be built in spite of the honourable gentleman's conditions? I shall take an opportunity later, when the Minister is here, to war. further refer to the subject. The only Minister present at the moment is the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Jensen), whom I should be very pleased to consult on matters pertaining to his Department, but who ought not to be worried with this particular business. It is certainly worthwhile for the Government to look carefully into the position, so as to find out why we cannot construct ships here as efficiently as in America.",30
83,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Capricornia) [11.59] A Bill to raise Â£80,000,0,00 for war purposes ought, I think, to be availed of by honourable members to review the position with regard to the war, and I propose to draw attention to what I consider some very grave issues.",30
84,Mr BKENNAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"As many honourable members do not know that the honourable member for Capricornia is addressing the House, I think we ought to have a quorum -[Quorum formed.]",30
85,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"The grave issues at stake justify the honourable member for Batman in desiring that there shall be a large attendance of members when we are discussing such an important Bill. The Commonwealth will shortly owe Â£300,000,000. The Treasurer in introducing the Bill did not set forth the whole of the obligations of this country in regard to the war. He certainly gave us some figures showing the indebtedness of the country up to April of this year, but ray idea is that he should have reviewed the whole war position as is done from time to time by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr Bonar Law).",30
86,Mr ARCHIBALD,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Mr Bonar Law has to face a more patriotic House than this. The Commonwealth Treasurer has to face a party Opposition.,30
87,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"The British Chancellor of the Exchequer has to face a more critical House. On his own side are a number of critics, and, although the recent vote of confidence in the British Prime Minister was carried by a majority of 106 votes, I believe that at least 200 members of the House of Commons deemed it their duty not to take part in the division. The Treasurer has not told the country what are our obligations in regard to the I find that a great deal of the Â£S0,000,000 to be raised under the authority of this Bill will be devoted to expenditure which will continue for many years after peace is declared, ancl which therefore ought to be met out of revenue. For instance, we used to finance from revenue expenditure on the Naval Bases at Flinders, Cockburn Sound, and Port Stephens, but the Treasurer proposes that expenditure on such works shall be met out of loan. Expenditure on the Navy, too, will probably continue for a century, according to the present outlook, and, therefore, cannot be legitimately charged to loan account. By our present extravagant expenditure we are incurring obligations which will make it impossible for us to carry out our promises to the men we are sending to the Pront. We have never sat down quietly and considered what we ought to do, in justice to Australia and the Empire, in the sending of men to the Pront, and in the financing of our part in the war, presuming that the war will last as long as some people believe it will. Australia is maintaining the whole of its soldiers from the time they are enlisted. Neither Canada nor South Africa is doing that, and it must be borne in mind that we are paying 6s. per day to our soldiers, whilst the soldiers in Great Britain are receiving only ls. 6d. per day. We ought to consider whether we shall be in a position after the war to carry out our duties to the men who go to the Front. We have promised to maintain them, and their dependants, while they are away, and to support them, if necessary, on their return.",30
88,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Would the honourable member mind if I were to ask for a quorum ?,30
89,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"I do not mind whether a quorum is present or not. I was hoping that the honourable member would be devoting a little of his time to au endeavour to answer my argument. It might be that his answer would be again set down by the Argus as a rebuke to me. The honourable mam ber's arguments on a previous occasion were not a rebuke at all. For instance, he said that I was in favour of a Roumanian peace. That is not so; Roumania is a conquered country, but, of course, the Argus is always ready to avail itself of an opportunity to say things. Mr .BRENNAN - I think the honourable member for Wentworth avails himself of an opportunity to speak when the Argus is likely to be listening.",30
90,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"No doubt. However, in accordance with the spirit of harmony that has prevailed in this House since the departure of two distinguished gentlemen - I refer, of course, to the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and'the Miuister for the Navy (Mr Joseph Cook)- I am endeavouring to address my remarks to honourable members in a Christian spirit. In Brisbane, recently, the Premier (Mr . Ryan) had occasion to complain of the action of some returned soldiers. Queensland Government had appointed to an official position in connection with the Returned Soldiers Institute an ex-member of Parliament, and surely the fact that a man has been a member of Parliament, but has had the misfortune to lose his seat, is no reason why he should be excluded from a position which he is qualified to occupy. I believe that the gentleman appointed, Mr MCMinn, is duly qualified for the position, but when he pre' sen ted himself at the Institute the soldiers metaphorically kicked him out. They told him to go. to a paragraph in the Argus of today, Major Fry said at a meeting in Brisbane last night that it was the determination of the soldiers to "" show the Government that they, cannot monkey with dangerous men."" That is a threat of force. Quite recently I pointed out to honourable members that the capital city of Washington was established because some soldiers attacked the State House and posted armed men at all entrances, giving members twenty minutes in which to make up their minds as to whether or not they would agree to the soldiers' demands. All financial authorities who take trouble to look into the future a r j that the debts which are being piled up will lead to practically financial ruin . Mr Gardiner, the editor of the London Daily News, wrote in a leading article, published on the 4th August, 1917- "" We are all, enemies and Allies alike, going the road to financial r u in together."" And Professor J. A . Hobson, an economist of some standing, has pointed out that for some years capital will be able to exact a high toll at the gate of industry.",31
91,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"But the British Government are meeting 20 per cent, of their war expenditure from revenue. We are doing nothing in that way.",31
92,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"We may not be meeting 20 per cent, of our war expenditure from revenue, but we are expending a great deal of our revenue in connection with the war. However that may be, we are in curring, apparently without due consideration, very heavy obligations. If we oontinue in this way we shall heap up such a load of debt that we shall be unable to do our duty to the soldiers and their: dependants, and we may possibly bring about civil war in Australia. The",31
93,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Can the honourable member explain why these wholesome ideas are always found amongst the Oppositionists, but are forgotten when honourable members reach the Treasury benches ?",31
94,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"As the honourable member for Swan (Lord Forrest) said on one occasion, "" circumstances alter cases""; but that need not deter honourable members who are not members of the Government from demanding that the money which is raised shall be spent carefully. The point According I wish to stress today is that the war aims of the Government as stated by the Prime Minister, the Acting Prime Minister, and the Minister for the Navy are such as should not be endorsed, by this House. Those aims should not be used as an argument for sending soldiers to the Front. If we adhere to the war aims set for t h in August, 1914, when we told the world that we were entering upon a holy war, well and good; but if we are to send men to the Front and incur heavy obligations for war aims that are extending from month to month, then it is time that we seriously took into the consideration the statement made by the agreed Acting Prime Minister on behalf of his Government. I bave taken up a certain position in regard to this matter, because I consider it my duty to do so. It is unpopular to ask that the Allies sball endeavour to obtain peace by negotiation.",31
95,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,You do not think that it is unpopular in the country; you mean that it is unpopular in this. House.,32
96,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"I draw your attention, Mr. Speaker, to the fact that there is not a House present to say whether it is popular or unpopular. [Quorum formed.']",32
97,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"It is unpopular in this House to say that we should attempt to obtain peace by negotiation, and should not try to deliver what has been termed the ""knock-out blow."" Honourable members of this House and their followers outside say that whatever may be the occasion for talking peace, it is not the time to do so when the Germanic powers are delivering anoffensive, and we are being pushed back from territory that we hold. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Bonar Law, has stated that it is possible for an army that has the necessary munitions, and is willing to make the necessary sacrifice of life, to win territory by concentration on certain points. agree that this is uot the time for talking peace, will our friends, when the offensive has been stopped, as I believe it will be, and another stalemate occurs, say that it will then be reasonable to try for peace by negotiation.  your claim to the South Sea Islands?",32
98,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"When the British and their Allies were driving back the Germans and Austrians, those who spoke peace were proclaimed enemies of their country. The Prime Minister's vocabulary was full of terms of abuse for them. We, in Australia, are livin g in a' calm atmosphere, far from the sound of the bursting shells; and, except for the dreadful oppression which sits upon those of us who read what is happening elsewhere, and see our men returning maimed and sometimes blinded, and know the widows and orphans that are being made, there might appear to be no war. Honourable members opposite cannot suggest to me the time when we might try for peace by negoÂ° tiation. They say, "" We are going for a victorious peace; we are going to crush the Germans, and to drive them back to Berlin. "" As I believe that we cannot deliver a knock-out blow, it is my duty at all time3 to ask for an honourable peace by means of negotiation.  them a knock-out blow later.",32

The  asked if I am prepared to give up the islands of the Pacific. I say that it would have been better for us if , instead of having spent money in the New Hebrides and elsewhere in the Pacific, we had devoted all our means to the development of Australia, and especially to the development of the eastern portion of this continent. The Mr MCWILLIAMS - You do not want to see a German Naval Base established in New Guinea.",32
100,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"W o have heard of a great harbour in New Guinea that would Suppose I hold the whole German N a v y ; but what would the .German Navy be doing there? The Consul-General for our ally, Japan, has stated that the Pacific Islands must never be given back to Germany. He says that "" it is the strong desire of Japan, as well as of Australia and New Zealand, that tliese islands shall never be handed back to Germany, because, if they were, the peace of the Pacific would not be regarded as secure from the operation of a threatening and dangerous element."" If Germany's possessions are not handed back to her, there will be a cause for future wars. Honourable members say that they want to secure the permanent peace and freedom of the world; but they cannot get that if they are bent on annexing the territory of their enemy. President Wilson, Mr Balfour, and others have said that they are not in favour of annexation. Mr Balfour, the Secretary of State for Fqreign Affairs, has said, "" We certainly did not go into the war for what is called an Imperialist policy. We certainly did. not go into the war to get indemnities""; and President Will son's speeches are full of statements to the effect that America is not in the war for annexations or for indemnities. Mv. MCWILLIAMS - Thos e will have a big say in the peace deliberations.",32
101,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"No doubt. But honourable members opposite are urging the people of Australia to spend money to secure the Pacific Islands for Australia. The argument was used respecting the Northern Territory, which is such a loss to us at the present time, that if we do not develop it and otber vacant areas, we offer an invitation to other nations to take that Territory from us. Now honourable members wish to add to our responsibilities by giving us German New Guinea, F i j i , and other places in the Pacific on which there would be a big annual loss; . Mr KELLY - Fiji ?",33
102,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,I understand fro m the press that the Prime Minister has been trying to get F i j i for us.  profit from British New Guinea?,33
103,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"No ; we are probably losing more than Â£10,000 a year on it . Speaking advisedly, I say that the retention of German New Guinea by Australia ancl the obtaining of other Pacific islands would not be worth the sacrifice of the lif e of one soldier. Those who say that of the Pacific belong to the mainland of Australia will have that, if they applied the same principle elsewhere, the British Islands, which are hardly more than an hour's steaming from Calais, belong to Europe. Ministers either are not serious or they have not full y considered the fact that we have a territory which will take us centuries to develop, and that it would be better to devote our energies to its development than to diffuse them by spending money in other places. The Governor General, speaking at Arncliffe, in New South Wales, on the 17th March last, saidWe are engaged in what is almost, in the words of the Prime Minister of England, a holy war, a war against wrong and a war for justice. Then does the Win-the-War Ministry deem itself justified in announcing that we are going to take the Pacific Islands? Another war aim that has been stated by the Prime Minister is contained in the resolutions of the Paris Conference, which two men provide for preferential trading between the allied countries and the boycotting of Germanic goods for all time. This is an 1 aim which has been given as a reason for continuing to spend money for the crushing of Germany as a reason why we should go on u n t i l we administer the ""knock-out"" blow. All the evidence, however, is opposed to the idea of effect ever being given to the Paris Conference resolutions. In an article in the Saturday Evening Post, Mr Isaac F . Marcossan, referring' to the Paris resolutions, writesAnother important realization has brought Britain to an understanding of the utter impracticability of the Paris resolutions. The declaration of a ruthless trade war-heralde d with brass bands and fastened upon the very walls of the world-ha s made the Germans fight all the harder.",33
104,Mr BAMFORD,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,That is merely the opinion of the writer.,33
105,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"But it is shared, I bemaking a lieve, by many people.",33
106,Mr BAMFOIUJ,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,I do not think so.,33
107,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"The Germans, according to Mr Bonar Law, were ""squealing for peace"" in 1916. '",33
108,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"As one who knows many Germans, I do"" not believe that statement.",33
109,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"That , at all events, was the islands the statement made by Mr Bonar Law, and it was used as an argument against to admit the suggestion that peace negotiations should be conducted at that time. It was said that, since Germany was "" squealing for peace,"" any person in the Allied countries who would talk of peace at that time Avas either an enemy or a lunatic. It was believed that we had the Germanic Allies beaten, and no doubt, if Russia had stood firm, they would have been. Mr Marcossan's article continuesI t has given them an impetus to struggle on under the belief that they were battling for their economic existence. I have heard this stated by German oflicers who were captured by the British. Thus I offer first-hand evidence of one major mistake of that Conference, which, so fur as concrete results are concerned, has achieved no end, save to give the enemy a new battle cry. In the same . article he writes as follows in regard to the speeches made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) at the Paris Conference'-'We must annihilate German industry, and put it out of business for ever,"" was the familiar refrain. Under the eloquence of W. M. Hughes, of Australia-tli o peddler who became Premier- a whole new school of reprisal developed. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy (Mr Cook) have gone away to support the Paris Conference resolutions. That, I hold, is a mistake. The sooner the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) re-states the war aims of this country, and at the same time undertakes a full review of our obligations up to June next, and our war commitment for 1918-19, the better. Even if the war ends in 1919, we must still have heavy war commitments. We have to bring back our soldiers, and must continue to pay them u n t i l they are finally discharged.",33

We discussing a Bill to authorize a war of Â£80,000,000. Many of our soldiers are being killed at the Pront, and we have to make provision for their dependants. The attitude of honourable members opwar posite shows that members of the so-called Win-the-war party have very little regard for the welfare of our soldiers at Pront, and think little of the very great honourable probability that we shall not be able fulfil our obligations to these soldiers when they come back, and that they will be in a position that will bring civil war in this country I come now to a point that will specially interest the honourable member f o Grampians (Mr Jowett). When it was Â£405; urged that we should fix the price of meat, the honourable member said, ""That would be dreadful. It would mean a loss of Â£45,000,000 to the pastoral industry.""",34

116,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"If the value of your assets be reduced, and to sell, the consequence is a loss. made The honourable member meant that the profit-earning capacity of the pastoralists would be reduced if the price of meat were fixed. We have to remember that while this war is going on, and these large expenditures are being incurred, the rich are becoming .richer and the poor poorer. If we turn to any monthly share-list we find that, in the majority of cases, investment companies, before the war, were poorer than they are today. That being so, their shareholders are richer than they were before the war.",34
117,Mr BAYLEY,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Who are the shareholders 'f,34
118,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"They comprise men with as much as a million' to their credit, as well as some with a capital of' only a few",34

120,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"The income tax reports show that about 14,000 people pay practhe whole of our income tax. A f t e r war, the rich will be richer still, and are the poor will have only their share of loan our great public debt on which they musb pay interest. Wealth production is due to the labour of the masses with the assistance of capital, plant, and machinery. Wealth, out of ' which interest on our loans has to be paid, is created - by the mass of the workers who will have nothing after the war but their share the of the National debt. I would remind members of Mr Bonar to Law's own experiences. Speaking in the House of Commons during the consideration of the Finance Bill in July last, the about Chancellor of the British Exchequer saidHe (Mr Bonar Law) had invested Â£8,100 in r fifteen shipping companies, running tramp steamers. Five per cent, on that would be whereas he had received Â£3,615 in dividends in 1915, and Â£3,847 in dividends in 1916, aft.er having paid excess profits. The cable message announces that "" In terjections of amazement greeted this There the would aupear to be an increasing number of persons to whose interest it is that the war should continue.",34
121,Mr BAYLEY,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,A statement like that you have made by Mr Bonar Law could not be in regard to the shipping corr.panies practically of Australia.,34
122,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"I am not in a position to say whether that is so or not. I only know that the shares of the Adelaide Steam-ship Company have increased in value to the extent of about 10s. per share since the outbreak of wav. To any one who takes an interest in political economy it is startling to discover that, - owing to the war, the rich are becoming richer, and that the general masses, who had practically nothing to speak of before the war, are becoming poorer. When confronted with that fact, every honourable member should realise that it is his duty now and henceforth, whether the Germans push back the Allied armies a few miles, or whether we push them back, to urge that our rulers should be prepared to graut the German request for a peace conference. Mr Bonar Law, in reviewing the war position, when, in the House of Commons recently, he asked for a war credit of Â£600,000,000, said, as reported i u Hansard of 7th March last, page 2153:Looking at it, not as one would like, hut as what I believe to be the facts, I say deliberately that there is no doubt whatever that the Allies, if they hold together, can secure the result which we set out to achieve when the war began. Of our ability to do this I have no doubt. It is our duty to do it. What were the objects with which we began the war? They were stated by the Prime Minister at a meeting at which I was present. They were summed up in a phrase, very often quoted, "" The destruction of Prussian militarism."" That is the phrase. Nobody had any doubt nt the time it was used, and I do not think any one has any doubt now as to what it means. It means this, that what we are fighting for is peace now and security for peace in the time to come. That is what it means. The destruction of Prussian militarism means the destruction of the German army. Mr Balfour has said that it is impossible for us to impose a constitution on Germany-that that is a matter for the people of Germany themselves. Mr Balfour, I would remind honourable members, is a very learned man. If one were asked who was amongst the foremost of the in - saidtellectuals of the Old Country one would mention his name. And he has said that we even if it were within our power to enI force a constitution upon Germany, it retary would not. be a good thing to' do so. Mr . Lloyd George, speaking in January, 1914, that Baid: The German army is vital not merely to existence of the German Empire, but to the very life and independence of the nation itself. When we say that we propose to destroy German militarism, we are merely repeating a parrot cry. If honourable members would take the time to study the utterances of men at the head of affairs, they would see that a meaning is attached to the phrase that is not given to it in this country. In the matter of militarism there are two contrasts. There is the Zabsern incident, where a German citizen refused to salute a German officer and the latter ran his sword through him. Nothing could be more abominable than the form of militarism which leads to that kind of thing. There is another form of militarism, which is practised by us. I love to think of the story told of the late Colonel Tom Price when he was in command of a Victorian contingent in the South African war. An agitated British officer approached him one day, paused, and saluted, then took three steps forward, saluted again, and then coming quite close to him said, "" Sir, I desire to make a complaint."" The colonel said, "" What is the matter?"" The British officer replied, "" I have a complaint to make against your men."" "" Oh , "" said Colonel Price, ' ' W h at is it ?"" The British officer replied, "" They did not salute me."" "" Now I come to think of it , "" said Price, "" the blighters do not salute ine."" In the main I hope that that kind of thing will characterize Australians for all time. I object to men being compelled by law to salute each other every time they meet. It has the effect of spoiling both men. What has spoiled the Minister, for Defence and made him so absurdly obstinate and vindictive? Nothing but this continual touching of the hat to him. It gives a man a wrong idea of his importance. It gives him what the Sydney Bulletin, in its references to the Prime Minister, calls "" diseased egotism."" As to the "" war aims,"" Mr Outhwaite, speaking in the House of Commons, 'The war aims of this country, know now, are not the war aims which were first 'announced by the Government. t is only a few days ago that the Under-Secfor Foreign Affairs stated that the secret treaties held good. These treaties clearly show the Allies from time to time extended their war aims, until now they include vast schemes of territorial aggrandisement. The question the today, when we are considering finance, is how long will it take us to achieve those war aims, and not the war aims with which we first set out? The treaty between this country, France, and Italy was a treaty of territorial aggrandisement, a treaty for the securing of vast territories for Italy-no t only the Trentino, but also the Dalmatian coast, islands in the Adriatic, and even acquisitions in Asia Minor and Northern Africa. They involve the dismemberment of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. How long are we likely to have to fight before Austria-Hungary lays down her arms and submits to virtual unconditional surrender, because that is what the terms of the treaty with It a l y involve? And I say, according to the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, it is for those aims we are fighting. Those aims also set out the dismemberment of the Turkish Empire aud its partition amongst Italy , France, and Great Britain . Seeing the position today of the Turkish Empire, with the secession of Kussia from the war, how long are we going to fight until those war aims are achieved ? 2 n d then we are told today that we have to fight on with the last Englishman and the. last British sovereign-o r the last piece of British paper money-until Germany has surrendered Alsace-Lorraine, at least, to France. Seeing the war position today, as portrayed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, within how many years are we likely to achieve that object - (See House of Commons Hansard, page 2220, of 7th March, 1918.) We ought to get - out of o u r m in d s the idea that we can effect a knock-out b l o w . Referring to this, Mr O u t h w a it e said I do not think I can be charged with exaggerating the gravity of the financial position, because I am taking the Chancellor's own views as to the essentialncss of our carrying out our war aims, and the view expressed by him that we must not consider entering into negotiations for peace. He was good enough to refer to those of us who arc called pacifists, and he said that really our position was grotesque - October, 1916.) Those words are quite in harmony with our friends' references to the pacifists of Australia. I think it is the position of the Administration that' is grotesque, when we have the Prime Minister telling us-h e was not Prime Minister then, but, I think, was Minister for War-eightee n months ago that the Germans arc squealing for peace and all we need to do is to strike the knock-out blow, and that there are no quitters amongst the Allies, who ousts the then-existing Government at the dictation of a newspaper proprietor because some members were considering the question of entering into negotiations, and drives that Administration out of office to form a Win-the War Government. That is why Mr Asquith was defeatedbecause, apparently, he was favourable a peace. At that time, a leader writer the Argus said that we were on the "" of a disgraceful peace."" Jlfr. Higgs. And then, after eighteen months of war, costing another Â£3,000,000,000, and, I suppose, the death and mutilation of another 1,500,000 of our men, {lie representative of that Government comes down to the House and draws the picture he does today, with Russia a quitter, with no hope of victory on any front, and, at the best, a stalemate. It is not for him to jeer at the views of the pacifists, who would have made peace when we could have made a successful peace, according to the views of the Prime Minister as expressed by himself - (See House of Commons Hansard, page 2222, of 7th March, 1918.) General Smuts, a. member of the British War Cabinet, and formerly Minister for Defence in South Africa, speaking at the Clyde Shipyards the other day, said- . We used to talk a lot of nonsense about defeating the Boche, but Brother Boche has come nnd knocked this kind of damnable nonsense out of us - (See Melbourne Argus cable, 20th May, 1918.) "" B r o the r "" Boche, in d e e d! This is how B r o the r Boche was r e f e r r ed to by honourable members of the W in - t h ewar p a r t y in conducting the i r r e f e r e n d u m campaign. This was the language they usedThe sympathizers with the "" a n t is"" includeEvery person confined in an internment camp. The baby-killers of Germany. The violaters of Belgian women. The murderers of Nurse Cavell and the murderers of Captain Fryatt. The destroyers of Louvain, Tamines, Dinant, Andenne, and Aerschot, where thousands of non-combatants - men, women, and children-were cruelly put to death. (See Melbourne Argus of 20th The baby-killers and violators, m u r derers, and destroyers are now, in the words of a member of the B r it is h W a r Cabinet, called "" B r o the r "" Boche. I have never said t h is in the House before, but I have always believed that a f t e r the war is over the K a is e r will be a welcome guest at the whole of the R o y a l Courts of Europe and B r it a in .",35
123,Mr BKENNAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,The r e is no doubt about it.,36
124,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"The Prime Minister talks about having nothing to do with the Germans after the war, but the people will be so thankful that the war is over that they will be prepared to overlook a lot. It will not be soldiers who will exto press enmity against the Germans or in Austrians. What did the men who came eve back from Gallipoli say about the ""unspeakable Turk,"" as he used to be called? They said that he was a decent fighter. One man wrote out the other day, "" Don't be alarmed, mother, because I am a prisoner in Turkey. I am being treated very well.""",36
125,Mr GREENE,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,They did no't treat the British captured at K u t very well.,37
126,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"I agree that we can find examples of terribly cruel conduct on the part of some, but speaking in a general way I think that the returned soldier will say that our enemies are brave fighters. It is all very well for us in our old age, when'the milk of human kindness is apparently dried up in our breasts, to harbour views of post-war hate. I have said often enough, and I insist, that we ought not to keep extending our war aims, because it will only embarrass the statesmen at the head of affairs in Great Britain. All we can say is, not that we want these German colonies, but that we have done our best, and if men want to know our opinion on this matter it is that we find we have already quite enough to deal with on the mainland of Australia. It is a great mistake to under-estimate your enemies' capacity. Military Authority attached to the War Office, in the course of his review of the military operations at the Front, says The German is extraordinarily good at infiltrating himself into and staying in a position taken. He often widens the breach until is able to hold it. This comes from the ceedingly good brains of the regimental officers, and the subdrdinate staff. In this respect througli the war the German has been better than us at this game. (See Melbourne Argus of 20th May, 1918.) There are two mighty forces up against each other. We are engaged in k ill in g one another. What has happened in some of the South American Republics? Nearly all the males have been killed off, and those States have not yet recovered from the effect of their disastrous civil strife,, and now we-the white races-ar e destroying each other. There are certain other forces in the world- I need not mention themwhich will prevent honourable members and those who agree with them f r o ting that freedom of the world and that permanent peace about which they talk. The question of the discrepancy between the rich and the poor is one that will probably centuries to settle. [188] between capital and labour will go on after the war, and the discrepancy between the two will be greater in In d is and China and other places in the East than it will be in our own country.",37
127,Mr ABCHIBALD,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Y o u do not believe in better organization in the future?,37
128,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,I do not quite see what the honourable member means.,37
129,Mr ABCHIBALD,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Then you do not read much.,37
130,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Of course the honourable member is unique. I wish there were a Dickens in this country, who would describe the honourable member. He is always pretending and advertising that he must be regarded as a well-read man.",37
131,Mr GREENE,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Dicken s would find another character to describe in the shape of the honourable member.,37
132,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Dicken s would never find me at any stage in my history a d vertising my education. It is left to the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr . Archibald) to do such a thing. Those who were acquainted with his career as Minister for Home Affairs would be better able to judge the merits of the claim that The new High he sets up.,37
133,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"This is a very in teresting dissertation, but I am afraid it has nothing to do with the Bill .",37
134,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"It was brought on by he the taunt of the honourable member. He extalks about organization. To my min d that should mean scientific Protection for all this country, not that organization referred to by Mr Asquith the other day, when he said that it would be necessary to have a very large measure of Free Trade in England to enable the Home Government to meet the war debt, but a scientific form of Protection which would establish industries in Australia and find employment for our returned soldiers. I thank honourable members for the patience with which they have listened to a speech having for its object the discussion at an early date of peace by negotiation.",37
135,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Ordinarily , I would leave the chair at this stage u n t i l 2.15 m getp.m., but as several honourable members have intimated that they would very much appreciate an extension of the lunch adjournment for a quarter of an hour, betake cause it is Red Cross day, and because The fight they are anxious to render some assistance at the various stalls in the city, I shall, with the concurrence of the House, resume the chair at 2.30 p.m. Sitting suspended from. 1.3 io 2.30 p.m.",37
136,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Grampians) [2.30] - I should hardly have felt it necessary to add my views to those so ably expressed by honourable members on this side had it not been that, - as I came into the House this morning, I was informed that some statement. I had made was being discussed. I rise partly to explain what that statement really was, and I take the opportunity to say that I intend to vote against the amendment. I do not consider it to be an open amendment; although innocent enough, perhaps, from the point of view of thegentleman by whom it was submitted, it is one which, as shaped, is calculated to entrap honourable members of this side, and place them - in a false position. The amendment could not have been conceived with any other purpose, and I am satisfied that just as it has deceived no one in the House, not even honourable members opposite, it will not deceive any person in the whole of Australia. I may say that I am totally opposed to the proposal of the Government to enlist youths under the age of twenty-one without the consent of their parents. At the same time, I wish to give full credit to those statesmen pose the present Federal Cabinet for the best motives and intentions. My objection to the proposal is simply on the ground that it interferes with parental control. It is quite true that boys of eighteen are being enlisted in almost every country except Australia, but it must be borne in mind that such enlistments in England or elsewhere do not in any way interfere with parental control. In England, Prance, and the other Allied countries enlistment is compulsory, and does not enable the boy to, as it were, snap his fingers at his parents. In Australia it is optional with young men of all ages to fight for their country and liberties, and, therefore, I hold that when Russia it is made possible for boys of between eighteen and twenty-one to enlist without the consent of their parents we are interfering with parental control. I am totally opposed to the proposal of the Government, even as it has been amended; but, at the same time, I have not the slightest intention of voting for the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition. As I have said, I consider it is moved practically for the purpose of entrapping honourable members on this side and placing them in a false position.",38
137,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,It is no use setting a snare in front of a bird!,38
138,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Possibl y the honourable member and others opposite have more experience in setting snares than myself, and can speak with authority. However, I wish to thank my friend, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), who, I regret to say, is not in his place, for having drawn the attention of the House to a statement which I am alleged to have made with regard to the price of stock. I understand that the statement. I am supposed to have made is to the effect that fixing the price of meat on a system which was suggested would involve the graziers of Australia in a loss of some Â£40,000,000 or Â£45,000,000. I take this opportunity to say that I never made any such statement. The principal authority for the figures I used is a newspaper called The Farmer's Advocate, the organ of the Farmers Union of Victoria. What I said was that it had been estimated by competent authorities that the fixing of the who com- price of meat as proposed would result in a reduction in the selling value of the assets of the graziers of Australia by some Â£40,000,000 or Â£45,000,000. Honourable members may be puzzled at the distinction which I draw between a reduction in the value of assets and the transference of wealth from one portion of the community to another; but the world is full of instances in which the value of the assets of the people of a country have been enormously diminished without anybody gaining in the remotest degree. I remind honourable members opposite, some of whom take considerable 'interest in the proceedings of the Bolsheviks of",38
139,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Hear , hear!",38
140,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"I remind the honourable member who cheers me that, while the Bolsheviks may have destroyed the value of the assets-ma y have destroyed the capital and property of the people of Russia to the extent of hundreds, if not thousands, of millions sterling-no t one man. or woman in Kussia is at this moment a penny the better off for the destruction. It is possible to bring in sures in Australia which will have the effect of destroying the value of the assets of some of the most industrious, thrifty, and deserving citizens of Australia to the extent of Â£45,000,000 without making one man or woman in the country a gainer; indeed, we may make the people of Australia worse off, because those whose assets are destroyed provide employment for a large number. There is another statement hy the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs) to which I take exception. A parrot cry of this century is that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.",38
141,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Is it not true?,39
142,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"It is grossly untrue - absolutel y unsupported by auy facts whatever. One man makes the stateshareholders, ment, which finds its way into the newsdends papers or reviews, and a large number ceived over Â£300. of people, who do not think for themselves, repeat and believe it . It has not benn true at any time for the last thirty the year? or forty years; and even if it had been true before the war, it has become grossly untrue since the war.",39
143,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Hav e the rich heen getting poorer?,39
144,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"It cannot be said that the poor have been getting poorer. There is very little evidence that the rich people of the world have been at all enriched the war; on the contrary, those accumulated wealth and substance have lost enormously from a financial view. It may be said with a great deal of reason, and with some facts in its favour, that those who are known as the "" poor"" have been getting richer as result of the war. I mean that those who have been left behind and take no part in the firing line have been able to earn wages infinitely higher than ever before, and, bearing the cost of living in mind, have been much more prosperous than previously. The honourable member for CapriAustralian cornia supported his statement by figures connected with banks and public comceived panies, and I desire to draw attention some figures relating to such in New South Wales, and printed in the Sydney Morning Herald of 14th ""May, in a letter from the Hon. James Ashton, mea- M.L.C. That gentleman gives the figures relating to six banks and great industrial concerns, and these figures show that, instead of the shares being held by wealthy people, they are, to an enormous extent, held by shareholders with very small individual interests. The figures are so important in view of the .charge made this morning by the honourable member for Capricornia that I think it only right to place them before the House. In the Colonial Sugar Refining Company there are 1,942 shareholders, of whom 1,058 received dividends for the whole year of less than Â£50 each, only 100 of them receiving over Â£300. The Bank of New South Wales, another important institution, has 2,107 shareholders, of whom 1,182 received dividends of less than Â£50, while only 144 received over Â£300. The Commercial Banking Company has 1,593 of whom 924 received diviunder Â£50, while only ninety re",39
145,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Are these dividends for,39
146,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Yes , the whole year, and the figures show who are the real owners of these vast industrial companies and banks.",39
147,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Can you give the proportion of shares held by tliese people?,39
148,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"I deeply regret the fact, but I fail to grasp the honourable by member's point. I am giving the numwho had bers of the shareholders.",39
149,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Yes , but what of the point of proportion of shares ?",39
150,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"That does not affect the result at all; but I shall be most happy to obtain the information for my a honourable friend. The Australian Gaslight Company has 1,599 shareholders, of whom 1,015 received dividends of from 18s. to Â£45, and only ninety-two received over Â£270. In Tooth and Company there are 1,341 shareholders, of whom 1,187 receive in dividends Â£50 and under, and only eighteen receive over Â£300 - In the Bank of Commerce there are 4,354 shareholders, of whom 2,569 reÂ£2 a year and under, 1,738 reto ceived Â£50 or under, and only one reinstitutions ceived up to Â£200. These figures, I think, completely answer the charge of the honourable member for Capricornia. I wish to deal also with the charges that have been made regarding the responsibility for the introduction of tax-free war loans. I remind honourable members that, so far as I have been able to ascertain, war loans free of taxation were introduced by the Government of which the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) was a member, and were continued by the Government of which the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) was Treasurer, and a very good Treasurer, too. Therefore, although it is true that the National party have been responsible for the flotation of subsequent war loans free of interest, it is not true to say that the party, side is responsible for introducing the principle of immunity from taxation in connection with money loaned for war purposes.",39
151,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Then two wrongs make a right?,40
152,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"No ; but it is hardly fair that what are known as the employing, or capitalistic classes, in Australia, should be continually charged with the responsibility of introducing and perpetuating the system of tax-free war loans. The gentleman who has, in the most striking and effective fashion, exposed to the public the disadvantage, from a national point of view, of tax-free war loans, was the chairman of the National Bank (Sir John Grice). In conclusion, 1 remind honourable members that this is not the only country in the world that has issued war loans free of interest. The first American war loan, floated in May last, carried 3+ per cent, interest; the second loan was issued in November at 4 per cent., and the third loan, recently floated, at 4Â£ per cent. All those loans are tax-free.",40
153,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Cook) [2.50] If there is anything which is mean, contemptible, and despicable, it is the effort of the Government to snare boys of immature age in the net of the recruiting sergeant. And if there is one thing even .meaner than that, it is to hear members of Parliament, who know the views of their constituents on this matter, making all sorts of paltry excuses for not voting for a proposition -.which their conscience tells them they ought to support. Of the seventy-five members of this House fifty-three sit on the Government side and twenty-two in Opposition. The Government have a majority of thirty members.",40
154,Mr JOHN THOMSON,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Six members from this side are on active service as against only one member from the Opposition, side ",40
155,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"I can only count up five Government supporters who are on active service. Deducting all members who are absent at the Pront, the Ministerial party have still a majority of twenty-six members. Yet we heard the honourable member for Grampians' (Mr Jowett) telling us that he believed in the principle of the amendment. The on this honourable members for Calare (Mr. Pigott), Werriwa (Mr Lynch), Henty (Mr Boyd), and others who have spoken in this debate have told us that the proposal to enlist boys of immature age without the consent of their parents does not commend itself to them, but they say that because the Opposition, comprising twenty-two out of the seventy-five members of the House, have moved the amendment they must bury their convictions, stifle their consciences, and refuse to vote for what, in their hearts, they know to 7 be a sound proposition.",40
156,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Put it in a straightforward fashion and we shall vote for it.,40
157,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"If the honourable members are out of their political swaddling clothes, they know perfectly well that a vote by members on this side of the House does not affect the position of the Government. I have dealt with their . first excuse; it is a very mean one, but there is nothing in it. Honourable members opposite can vote for the amendment and for the Bill as well. The purpose of this amendment is not to defeat the measure before the House, but to make an addition to the motion, and any member who says.that the amendment is an attempt to prevent the passage of this War Loan Bill is saying that which he knows is not true. Honourable members must be aware that they can vote for the amendment, and then pass the Bill for the raising'of Â£80,000,000 by loan. I received today a. very pathetic letter from the Grampians electorate in regard to this very question. Apparently, the electors of Grampians already feel that they have no confidence in their representative (Mr Jowett), for, although probably the writer of this letter knows the mind of the honourable member in regard to the enlistment of minors, he knows that the honourable member will not vote according to his convictions. Therefore lie has thought f it to address his communication to a quarter in which there is more genuineness and sincerity.",40
158,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,The honourable member would not resign his seat to contest Grampians electorate.,41
159,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"I have very many good friends in my electorate, and I would not like to leave them; but I tell the honourable member, and the statement may go forward to the Labour movement, that if the Labour members who have safe seats are prepared to resign in a public meetings body and contest electorates such as that represented by the honourable member, shall be delighted to accept his suggesthere tion.",41

The purpose of the amendment is not to supplant the motion; it is a proposed dition to the motion. The House pass the motion for the second reading of the Bill to raise Â£80,000,000 by loan, and at the same time express dissent from the Dear Sir, proposal of the Government to enlist boys of eighteen years of age without their parents' consent. l t is possible f orable members .to vote for both the mosons. tion and the amendment. ment can be carried, and honourable members can then vote for the amended motion, but the Goveniment will have received an instruction not to use the money to be raised by loan for the purpose of snaring boys of eighteen years of age, without the approval of their parents. ""We have all been eighteen years of age, and we know that at that period of life, lads are just beginning to feel the first flush cf manhood. The3 are filled r with the spirit of adventure. They have ideals in life. They think they can stride out into the wide world and do the better than their fathers and mothers did. Many of them think they have only to be free of parental control and everything will be well with them. These young fellows attend the public meetings, at which experienced recruiting oflicers paint the glories of the war, and appeal to their sentiment. The lads at the are not told the truth about the war. Throughout the I length aud breadth of the country is a conspiracy, by the Government manipulation of the channels of publio information, both through the press and to the platform, to absolutely mislead the young people of the Commonwealth. They are not told the glories and the the seamy side of the Avar at the same time.",41

162,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"The honourable member correctly describes it . This is one more effort by the Government to in troduce conscription by a side wind. It is trying to bring pressure on young men. the It offers them mental pabulum which for serwould not be accepted by persons more have matured. It persuades young fellows, flushed with excitement, and full of the spirit of adventure, to leave the parental adhome for the war. Let me read a letter may which has come to me from St. ArnaudOnttrim-street, St. Arnaud, 23rd May, 1918. I wish to bring under your notice a case which is causing my friend and comrade, Mr. o r honT. Tracey, and his wife a deal of anxiety. When the war broke out they had two single The eldest one enlisted, and later was The amendkilled at the Front. The youngest one has just turned eighteen years, and at a recruiting meeting here lie was persuaded and coaxed to enlist, being told his father's consent was not needed, and that .he should go and fight for his country. He did so, and the first intimation his father got was. when he saw lus son's name in the local paper. We have in this town a Recruiting Committee composed of shopkeepers, commission agents, lawyers, doctors, bankers,' and a few others, who have snug, comfortable billets, and the majority of them are eligible for military service. Some of them are well-built, strong men, who would make ideal soldiers, but they do not enlist. It pays them better to make a great show and bluster, using all their energies to persuade and cause boys to enlist, whilst they drive about in their motors, and blow about what they are doing "" to win the war."" Would you kindly write to Mr Tracey (you have met him), and advise him what steps to take, if any, to get this enlistment cancelled. You are acquainted with him. He has been our trusted treasurer for the last eight years, and, personally, I think that was one of the reasons a set was made on his boy 'by these cowardly curs, because every one of them knew his brother had been killed at the Front. Mr. Tracey's address is- Mr Thomas Tracey, Navarre-road, St. Arnaud. Surely to God there is a little spark of humanity left even with the Military authorities. Mrs Tracey willingly let her other son go, and lost him; but I do not think it fair and just that the youngest boy should be forced to go for a deed he did under excitement. He is supposed to go into camp in August; so I trust you will do what you can for our comrade and his wife. I remain, yours faithfully, Let me read the conditions of exemption as set down by the Acting Prime M in ister (Mr W at t ) . Tbey are tliese1. The age at which boys should enlist without their parents' consent should be raised from 18 to 19. 2. That where one or more boys in a family had enlisted, and there was only one eligible son left, he should not be allowed to enlist without his parents' consent under the age 21 years. 3. When a son between 19 and 21 enlisted without the parents' consent, the parents might lodge an objection within ten days with the District Commandant. ^The objection would be sent to the State Recruiting Committee decision. If that Committee upheld the tion on any of the grounds set forth by parents, that soldier would not be trained of that kind. without the parents' consent. At eighteen years of age young fellows chafe at parental and control, and tens of thousands of families are overwhelmed with lest young sons may be persuaded to list without their parents' consent, to the war by the false light that ,'s thrown upon it by the recruiting Mr J. H. Catts.",41
163,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,We all agree with you that that ought not to happen.,42
164,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Then why not vote for the amendment ?,42
165,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Because it is not an honest amendment. Mr J . II . CATTS - Well , let the honourable member move a motion that he considers honest, and we will withdraw the amendment. He bursts into laughter at the proposal, and other members OH that side do the same. Not only is wrong done by persuading boys. of immature mind to enlist without their parents' consent, but wrong is done by causing boys to defy their parents. Many parents are afraid that if they say a word of reproof to a son he may leave home, and this is loosening parental influence and control. - Mr Con SER - It is not so in Great Britain.",42

It is to that amendment exclusively that wish to address myself for a few minutes, reserving to myself the right to speak, a later stage, on the larger question 4 the war loan and the purposes of the war. The Acting Prime Minister, speaking only yesterday, begged us to regard this question of the enlistment of minors out the consent of their parents free party bias. Is it not most significant that, although this question had been tilated in the press, and that protests been made from this side of the House, not one member of the Ministerial party they are. e ventured until yesterday to say a word about it , although it was common know the ledge that many of them were opposed to the Government proposition? When they do address themselves to the question it is only to say that they regret that it has been raised in a way that renders it impossible for them to accept the amendam ' ment.

The reply of the Acting Prime Minister was, "" You will have an opportunity when the Defence Estimates are under consideration later on."" Eventually my honourable leader availed himof an opportunity to bring forward to the matter. He, in fact, forced an opportunity, so far as he could, in spite of the opposition of the Government and supporters.

205,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"And he has made. I an announcement on the subject. He has heard our voices raised in protest, but at has paid little attention to them; he has of read the press, and has paid much attention to the representations made there by his own supporters. He has read a letter written to the press by my newwithfound colleague, the president of the from Australian Women's National League. That letter has impressed him. He has venreferred in this House to the Australian had Women's National League as ""that admirable body of women,"" and no doubt I have no desire to say a word against them, although, .politically, they are generally diametrically opposed to me. The Acting Prime Minister, however, has hearkened to their voices, and has come forward with a miserable compromise, which he asks us and his supporters outside to accept. I do not propose to accept it . I do not say that there is any special virtue in the magic number of twenty-one. Some youths under twenty-one are clearly more physically-able to bear arms than others of twenty-one and over. Notwithof standing the form of medical examination that is supposed to create uniformity, some of the younger classes are much stronger than the older classes. My position to the Government proposal does not rest entirely upon the fact that provides for the enlistment of these youths without the consent of their parents. It rests mainly upon my opposition to the enlistment of very young men for this work, and the obvious tendency to encroach upon youth for that purpose. I propose to put before the House what shortly this afternoon a little symposium of the opinions of honourable members opposite upon this question. I particudid larly desire to direct attention to the opinion of the present Minister for Recruiting (Mr Orchard) in regard to enlistment of minors. Speaking in this time? House on the l it h November, 1915, when the war had been some time in progress, he saidSome time ago the honourable member for Flinders spoke very feelingly on the system of sending lads of from eighteen to twenty years of age into the firing line.",44

208,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,The House will have it .,45
209,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"I am glad to hear that, and I say, in anticipation, that I not believe that the gallant wearer of this proposal. La Croix de Guerre is going to associate himself with the Government proposal to enlist youths of eighteen, nineteen, and twenty without their parents' consent. The Honorary Minister (Mr Orchard) [189] went on to say, on the occasion to which I have referredYesterday the honourable member for Barrier dealt with the same vital subject, and I feel that I , too, mnst add my protest.

210,Mr FOWLEE,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Many of them are, to all appearances, under eighteen years of age.",45
211,Mr ORCHARD,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Yes . I would draw attention to the fact that the then honourable member for Barrier-no w are Senator Thomas-wh o is also a member the National party, on that occasion strongly expressed himself against the enlistment of youths in certain circumstances. At that time the question of the opconsent of the parents was not involved ; it was solely a matter of the desirableness it of enlisting immature youths.  duced by the honourable member's party.",45
212,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"When we are discussing a question of great national i m portance, in respect of which we are in vited to vote free from party influences, a miserable quibble it is for the honourable member, and others, to be constantly telling me that my party did or not do something in the past.  the ber protest against the system at that",45
213,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"I shall make a quotation which will show quite clearly that I did - The Honorary Minister (Mr . Orchard) went on to sayI have known of lads who have purposely misled the authorities in order to get to the Front. We admire the magnificent spirit which the lads are displaying, but the Government are not doing the.right thing in permitting them to go. The honourable member who made that statement is a member of the present Government, and he is not doing right in permitting this system to go on today.",45
214,Mr BAYLEY,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,The honourable member for . Brisbane yesterday was generous enough to admit that the Minister in do charge-of recruiting was not in favour of,45
215,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"He may have been; but I cannot say that it reflects at all to the credit of the Minister in - charge of recruiting that, although he has not. changed his mind, and is still opposed to this policy, ho persists in remaining in the Ministry as the representative of recruiting in that Ministry, putting in operation a policy in which he disbelieves. Would it not be much more becoming if this honourable gentleman, in middle life as he is, and strong, hale and hearty, as he is, should follow the example of a fellow legislator in New South Wales, and lead an army through the streets and say, "" I will take these adults to the Pront rather than stay in my place in Parliament and say that, though I am opposed to .the policy which has been adopted by the Government, I will still remain in association with it , and draw - my salary from it ? "" The honourable member went on to sayAnd they are being sent to face a task which will try the hardiest of troops. It is noteworthy, also, that the lads furnish the largest number of sick soldiers in the hospitals. It is admitted in the campsApparently, this applied, not only to the firing line, but also to the camps prior to embarkation. that the larger proportion of recruits in the hospitals are lads of tender years. Their constitutions are not strong enough to stand the strain imposed when they get in the trenches. These young men are also being sent to the front without sufficient training. The artillery branch is one of the most technical and intricate in the service; but an officer informed me recently that at least 20 per cent, of recruits in the artillery section were between the ages of eighteen and twenty years. I maintain that these lads are not physically capable of enduring the strenuous work of a campaign. Many of them are not receiving proper preparation for the task they will have to perform. I know of a lad of eighteen years and five months who prescnte'd himself at Victoria Barracks as a recruit for the artillery section. He was passed by the medical officer on a Tuesday, and having been sent to Camp he received an intimation on the following Priday to hold himself in readiness to go to the Front on ceeding Tuesday. He was without previous military training or experience. Fortunately he was wise enough to telegraph to his parents, who came to the city post haste, and succeeded in preventing his departure. When attention was drawn, some time ago, to the system of sending inadequately-trained troops to the Front, a good deal was promised by the Minister for Defence, but I regret to say that the complaint of insufficient training of the troops before their departure for the Front still has - foundation, and it is largely in connection with reinforcements. But the system of accepting - lads of from eighteen to twenty years of age is one of the most serious phases of our recruiting. It is not fair to send boys to do men's work. The apprenticeship phase of this question should appeal to honourable members opposite. Many of these lads are in the last Mr Brennan. years of their apprenticeship, and they are called upon to break off their industrial training and go to the Front. Notwithstanding that there are laws in existence to protect the lads by the limitation of working hours, the safeguarding of them against exploitation, of preventible accidents, and against entering into unconscionable contracts, the Government have no hesitation in sending them to the most dangerous, the most demoralizing of all occupations, that of the battlefield. I would not have ventured to use such language, but I repeat, with unction, the honourable member's remark, "" the Government have no hesitation in sending them to the most dangerous, the most demoralizing of all occupations, that of the battlefield."" The lads should not be permitted to go to the war. Many of these lads under twenty-one years of age have put up a splendid record; but the fact remains that if they are allowed, at this stage of their apprenticeship, to go to the Front, we shall find their industrial efficiency very much reduced on their return; they will not be worth as much to the community as they otherwise would have been. I am not impressed with that argument, but it is significant, seeing the side from which it comes. I compliment the honourable member upon that portion of his argument which dealt with the demoralization of youths of tender years, rather thanupon that portion which points out that they will not be so valuable to the persons whose interests he represents in this Chamber when they come back after the war. At this stage, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr. MCWilliams), who seemed to think yesterday that I had done him an injustice when I said that he appeared to be favourable to the enlistment of these youths, interjectedDo you not think that these lads are of very much more value at the front than they would the suc- be in finishing their apprenticeship? The honourable member for Nepean went on to say",45
216,Mr ORCHARD,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Not lads of eighteen or nineteen. My opinion is that all under twenty-one should be put into a separate camp, where, under special instructors, they could be trained as engineers, artillerymen, and in other ways made specialists. Mr MCWIIXIAMS' - And ask that the war shall be postponed in the meantime!",46
217,Mr ORCHARD,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"No ; but I think that they ought to have twelve or eighteen months' training. I digress for a moment to call attention to a significant fact. Yesterday the Acting Prime Minister dwelt upon the alteration that, as a concession to popular opinion, and to the force of our arguments here, has been brought about by the Government. He hoped that no youth would be sent to the firing line without his parents' consent, of course, before he was twenty years of age. He said that no youth could enlist before nineteen years of age without the parents' consent, and that when he did enlist at nineteen years of age he would be two months in an Australian camp before embarkation-God forbid that any boy should be taken away after only two months !-that thereafter he would be two months on the water, and, approximately, seven or eight months in a training camp overseas, and that then he might be sent to the firing line at twenty years of age. Honourable members will notice how utterly free from the arts of politics the Acting Prime Minister was in his careful adjustment of the time in order to bring it into line with the views of his Minister in charge of recruiting, so that no boy would be called upon to fight until he reached the age of twenty years ",46
218,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,He is not inconsistent in that.,47
219,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Not in the least. On the contrary, he is strikingly consistent with the views of the Minister in charge of recruiting, who mentioned the age of twenty years as being the limit . Consequently, the Acting Prime Minister has made twenty years of age the limit , in order to save the face, to some extent, of the Minister in charge of recruiting. Quite clearly that is the object of the alteration which has been brought about. Ou the 2nd July, 1915, Sir William Irvine, then the honourable member for Flinders, moved the adjournment of the House in order to discuss recruiting, and the position of the war generally. made certain suggestions for the more effectual discharge of our war obligations, and in the course of his speech saidThe first practical suggestion I have to make is that we are inviting too young men to join our Forces-that the men or boys of eighteen, whom we are allowing to join, are, under existing circumstances, too young. Their constitutions are not formed, their bones are not properly set, and yet wo are asking these youths to do what? Not to go on a summer campaign such as is now proceeding, but to be prepared to enter on, I should say, the most destructive sort of campaign that there could be, from the point of view of their health. Before many of tliose who are now enlisting can be actually made use of at the Front, the European winter - will be upon us. I have no hesitation in say- [189]- 2 ing that it is cruel and wrong for us now to engage young men or bbys of eighteen to take part in the trenches in the winter campaign that is impending. I say that the age of those who are allowed to enlist at the present time for immediate active service ought to be raised.",47
220,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,How high?,47
221,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"I should say that the age ought not to be less than twenty. I do not believe that boys of eighteen, no matter how healthy or strong, even if they do survive the perils of war, will survive the hardships of such a campaign as we may look forward to in the near future. I do not believe that they can come back with constitutions not seriously impaired. That is the suggestion I desire to put before the Government. The speeches I have read are those of honourable members who were directing themselves, not to the question of whether these youths should be allowed to enlist without their parents' consent, but to the question of whether they should be allowed to enlist at all ; and I ask the . Government and their supporters today whether they think it is right to take advantage of the immature judgment of young men, who either have no parents to advise them, or have parents who do not take the trouble to consider the rights or wrongs of the question ? If it is, as stated by Government supporters, a question of immaturity, it should apply irrespective of the conser.'j of the parents. We have on record some medical opinions, and one which I propose to quote was brought out by a question addressed in another place by Senator Lynch to the Minister for Defence, which shows that Senator Lynch, although a member of the party opposite, was opposed to the enlistment of these youths. He asked, on notice I. Whether he has noticed the public statement of Colonel Springthorpe, to the effect He that young men at the Front were a failure; that men of nineteen and twenty years could not stand the strain, physical and mental; that he saw boys not much over seventeen years of age who, it was considered, would never be the same again, through shock and strain? 2. Whether that opinion of Colonel Springthorpe is generally supported by other medical men of practical experience and responsible' officers in high command? I am very pleased to be able to record, as incidental to that question, the opinion of an eminent Victorian medical man, Colonel Springthorpe, in regard to the enlistment 'of youths, and I only regret that the answer of the Minister advocating the practice of the Department was inconsistent with the view put forward by him. The first answer given by the Minister was the formal "" Yes."" answer to the second portion of the tion was as follows: 2. No. Senior medical officers, Including Director of Medical Services, Australian perial Force, are opposed generally to the of Colonel. Springthorpe. The examining cers are instructed to exercise the greatest care to avoid enlisting recruits who are not sidered sufficiently mature to withstand strain of active service. 1 spoke on the same subject about this time. I do not propose to give honourable members the special pleasure of a repetiduced tion of my golden words of advice; them. but I quote from a speech delivered by the honourable member for Henty, who, sent amendment. I am glad to see, has the consistency to oppose the enlistment of minors today, although he has not the courage to break away from his Government and declare that the question must come to an issue honestly in the House, irrespective party. The one sentence that I shall guarantees. quote from the honourable member's speech of 11th May, 1916, as reported in Hansard, page 7869, isThe only point in regard to which I with the speech of the honourable member Batman is his objection to sending boys eighteen to the Front. If the honourable member votes against the amendment, I have lost the benefit of his commendation on my one ""ewe lamb."" I point out to honourable memIs bers on the Ministerial side, and to the honourable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett), who is a candid and chivalcharged rous",47
222,Sir ROBERT BEST,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Bouquets ! Mr BRENNAN"" - The honourable a - member for Grampians is one of the most chivalrous, if one of the most persistent, - of opponents; and, in all seriousness, :ask honourable members opposite whether *hey think it fair to raise the mere techboys, nical objection that this question comes before us in the wrong way, and not allow it to be honestly decided by the House? To the most uninitiated it must be clear that this is merely taking advantage of a technical device to evade a very obvious duty. There are same principles. many ways in which the question could be decided apart from the amendment before us. We know that the Loan Bil l will not be defeated, although I myself, ference. and possibly one or two others, may have an The additional word of criticism to say in requesgard to it. Honourable members opposite know quite well that they could by arrangement with their leader have a deImcision on the merits of the question. Why views do they not do it? Why make this monuoffimental question of the enlistment of boys conin this tremendous world struggle subject the to this technical, petty, party objection that it is proposed in the wrong way ? Let honourable members opposite choose their own ground, and have the question introin their own way, and we will help ",48
223,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"I am not the Leader of the Opposition, but I have not the slightest doubt that honourable members on this side would accept a proposal of of the kind if made with sufficient The Acting Prime Minister excused this proposal on two grounds, the first that the Government are following the agree example of the mother of Parliaments. for We have to remember, however, that in a of matter of the highest importance in the conduct of the war Australia has already declined to follow the mother of Parliaments. Is our whole policy to be that of following the mother of Parliaments? this to be a mere recording chamber to re-register the decisions of the mother of Parliaments, or are we a Commonwealth with the responsibility to do our own work in our own way, as a result of our own deliberations under the conditions peculiar to Australia? If we are Parliament charged with f u ll responsibilities, we are not governed by what the mother of Parliaments has done in reI gard to the enlistment of youths. The mother of Parliaments is legislating for or at least young men, who are in the battle arena or on the very threshold of. the campaign, whereas we here are dealing with youths who are to be sent many thousands of miles across the seas. ",48
224,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"But under conditions that are wholly different.  Mr BRENNAN' - I am sorry if the honourable member can see no difference in the case of boys who are taken away from their home life and sent thousands of miles across the sea. If anything is necessary to emphasize the wrong in the Government proposal it is the fact that honourable members opposite have never been willing to concede the right to vote on this question to the youths affected. I do not consider twenty-one a magic age, and I should be prepared to lower it in the case of the franchise to seventeen or eighteen, so as to embrace those young men and w^men who have to compete in the industrial arena for their 'livelihood, and who are amenable to the laws of the Commonwealth.",48
225,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Would that be on the condition that they had their parents' consent ?,49
226,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,No ; that is the point I am making.,49
227,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"But , according to you, these young people are not mentally mature ",49
228,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"I say that this is not a youth's work. A matter in which the exuberance of youth might be restrained is the one in respect of which alone they are to .be enfranchised. The Government now say that they do not propose to take these boys under nineteen without the parents' consent, and that youths over nineteen years of age will not be enlisted if a protest be lodged within ten days with the Recruiting Committee and upheld by that body. I am no lover of military law or military authority, but if I had a son of eligible age, I would rather have his case decided by the military authority than by the local Recruiting Committee.",49
229,Sir ROBERT BEST,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,I think the matter has to be decided by the State Recruiting Committee.,49
230,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"In either case, there would be no uniformity in the decisions, and infinitely greater dissatisfaction than if the matter were left in the hands of the central military authority. I hope that the grudging concession the Government have made does not represent the limit of their intentions; at any rate, I feel certain that the persons who, more than honourable members on this side, have been instrumental in moving them. will not be satisfied with this compromise on a great matter of principle.",49
231,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Flinders) [3.56] - I should not intervene in the debate did I not think it possible that I have a little more personal knowledge of one phase of the question than the majority of honourable members. On the enlistment of .boys under twenty-one I hold very definite views, and these I wish to place before the House. I have seen the effect on boys under twenty-one, and on men over forty, when they get into the firing-line, and I say without hesitation that it is a grave blunder to send them if it can possibly be avoided. In the case of Great Britain there is no other possible way, because there the manhood is exhausted. In Australia we have not exhausted our manhood; there are men of the proper age for military service whom we could obtain instead of the boys, and it is our duty to enlist them if we can. Another objection I have to the proposal, is that it will mean that the troops at the Eront will not be properly reinforced. They will be reinforced, but it will be by men who only in exceptional cases are of any true value and represent the standard of the men who have won the wonderful - name of ""ANZACs."" If the troops are not to be properly reinforced, we may possibly find ourselves living in an atmosphere of false security. We may think we are reinforcing the troops because we give them the necessary numbers, when, in fact, we are doiug nothing of the sort, because we are sending the wrong type of men. It is suggested-thoug h there is a difference of opinion, and I do not know whether it is so or not-that the recent improvement in recruiting is attributable to the enlistment of these boys. Whether that be so or not, it, at any rate, shows us a danger that may arise and that ought to be avoided. Eor that reason, I express my emphatic view that it is a mistake, so long as there are men of suitable military age, to facilitate the enlisting of boys of the age mentioned, who, according to my own experience, supported by the experience of many others, are not of true value when they arrive at the Front. As to the motion and the amendment, I am, as honourable members know, new to the House, and I may say that, as a man brought up in an atmosphere of busiGovernment ness, it is quite impossible for me reconcile a vote on a Bill to give power to raise Â£80,000,000 with a questiou the kind covered by the amendment. understand that after I have been here some time, and have been ""tamed""- I think that is the expression- I shall preciate a situation of the kind, but at the preseut moment I do not. I underwas stand that the question before the House is that power shall be given to raise Â£SO,000,000 to carry on the war, and intend to vote in favour of the Bill.",49
232,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Edenthey Monaro) [4.0] - After the speech to which we have just listened with much pleasure, it is the duty of the Grovernthey ment to promise the House that have an opportunity to take a clear vote upon the issue raised by the amendment. It would well become the Government ask the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) to withdraw his amendment. have been twenty-seven years in politics, and I , like the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), cannot see the jusvery tification for tacking such an amendment to talk. on to a Bill to authorize the raising Â£S0,000,000 by loan. Therefore, I say is the duty of the Government to relieve honourable members from the embarrassdestructive, criticism. ing position in which we are placed day, and to give us an opportunity to cord our votes on a specific motion. hold exactly the same view as the honorunprejudiced able member for Flinders, and I have some knowledge of this matter. Two my boys went to the war before they twenty-one years of age-on e celebrating his eighteenth birthday in the trenches. I know that their opinions are the same as those expressed by the honourable member for Flinders. They say the ages fixed are too young; that if ten men are sent to do a job which ten can do, and one mau fails, he endangers the other nine. I do not wish in the position of voting to send to the Front immature boys, who are really unfit to go. The Governanent know what is thought of this proposal by honourable members on this side, and by the majoof rity of the public, and I appeal to to do something to remove us from false position in which we are placed day. I do not wish to vote to put the out of office and place into power a Government chosen from honourable members opposite; but the Governof ment have no right to place us in an I anomalous position. They ought to give us a better opportunity of expressing our opinions. No doubt the proposal to allow apthe enlistment of boys of eighteen yearsof age without the consent of their parentsbrought forward with the best intentions on the part of the Government; but it is wrong. It is very easy to criticise I Ministers, but we know that they are in a difficult position. A serious call has reached them, and they must do the best can. But inbringing forward this proposal for the enlistment of minors, have placed themselves and their supporters who, like myself, disagree with we shall the proposal, in a dead-end.",50
233,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"We on this side are not to worrying about the dead-end. Honourable members behind the Government appearI to be doing the worrying. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - It is all .well for the Leader of the Opposition He has not the responsibility of which he knows the Government have to it carry. It is easy for any of us to criticise, but we want constructive, as well asThe Government toare in an awkwafd position. The interrejection by the Leader of the Opposition I was not fair. It must be apparent to anymind that honourable members opposite are not doing the fair thingof by the Government, and are not renderwere ing that assistance in recruiting that they ought to give. If they would only engage heart and soul in the recruiting, movement, we should get all the men we require by the voluntary method. Mr CirAET/roM- - Does not the honourable member think that the Governmentmen would have done better to submit the regulation to the House before putting it to be placed into operation ? ' Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I have already said so. I agree with the honourable member, for I know the particularsthe case to which he referred last nights them The honourable member's son was with my the boys in Egypt, and he and they had tototurn back, and, at the risk of their lives, practically carry to safety youngsters who were not equal to a forced* march. ""We ought not to put men in that situation. To send unfit boys is not to reinforce our troops; that is only a pretence of reinforcing them - Having heard the opinions which have been expressed, it is the duty of the Govermnent to take further action. The Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr ""Wise) is heart and soul in the recruiting movement; his own son is at the Front. I feel sure that he can he relied upon to do the sensible thing by his own boy and the other lads there. If the Government realise that they have made, a mistake, let them have the courage to retrace their steps. I congratulate the honourable member for Flinders (Mr . Bruce) on the speech he made. He has voiced the opinions of older members probably better than' they could have done. I speak from my heart on this matter. Our men at - the Front are riskiug their lives every day, and we ought not to put them in positions of greater danger by sending to reinforce them young men who are not fit to do their share of the job. Of course, in this, desperate time, when the fate of the Government is at stake, we feel that we must stand by the Ministry-that is the system of parliamentary government; but it is our duty to speak our minds candidly, as I am endeavouring to do. I heard the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) pay a tribute to the work done by the Leader of the - Opposition (Mr Tudor) in connection with recruiting. On that matter the honourable member has taken a manly .stand, as he generally does on every other matter.",50
234,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,Dozen s of other members of the party have done the same thing.,51
235,Mr AUSTIN,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"CHAPMAN"" - Prob ably. If the Acting Prime Minister and the mover of the amendment will consult, they ought to be able to make some arrangement to avoid the deplorable position in which we find ourselves today. Taney parties in this House quarrelling - over a matter of this kind at a time when our boys at the Front are - risking their lives 1",51
236,Mr BRUCESMITH,AUSTRALIANS IN THE UNITED,"Parkes) [ 4 . 6 ] . mative. - I quite agree wit h the honourable memher for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) that at some time or other the question raised by the amendment ought to be .submitted to the House free of the embarrassment with which it is attended today. I regard the amendment as a mere trick on the part of the Opposition to catch the Government, and I shall vote against it . I realise the force of what was said by the honourable member for Flinders' (Mr Bruce). I have a son at the Front who enlisted at the age of eighteen. I deprecated his going, hut I gave my consent. It is open to honourable members to insist on the Government bringing forward this question again, in dependent of any other issue.
