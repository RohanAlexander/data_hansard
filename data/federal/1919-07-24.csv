NA . OFFICE.",23
18,Mr BAMFORD,MELBOURNEGENERAL POST,"Herbert) [ 2 . 4 2 ] wish to make a personal explanation. I would have made it sooner but for the absence of the Postmaster-General (Mr . Webster). A few weeks ago I asked him of the following question: 1. Whether there is any truth in the stateis ment which lately appeared in the daily to the effect that he (the Postmaster-General) paid to Mr Walter Burley Griffin £1,000 for designing the alterations recently made at the Post Office, Melbourne?. 2. Is it correct, as alleged, that Mr Griffin's design, for which the £1,000 was said to have been paid, was, if not wholly, at any rate part, a copy of a design prepared for the alterations by Mr Murdoch, an architect the staff of the Commonwealth Public Department ? 3. Whether the Mr Murdoch here referred to is identical with the Mr Murdoch who was engaged in his professional capacity in nexion with Australia House, London T 4. If the press statements here referred to and are correct, does the Postmaster-General that it was because, in his opinion, the Public Works Department was not competent to sign and carry out the alteration at the Office, that he engaged the services of Griffin at the said special fee of £1,000? The Postmaster-General's reply was as follows: 1. I should like to see the statement referred 'to. If it has been made, as stated, it correct. I neither engaged nor paid Mr. Griffin. This was done by the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Works and Railways respectively. The reply, to my first question is sufficient for my present purpose. The remark, "" I should like to see the statement ferred to. If it has been made, as stated, it is not correct,"" inferring that I had fabricated the statement myself, is most offensive to me. It impugns my sincerity and honesty in asking the question, which those an extract from the Argus of 31st May last will show I did not trump up. This extract isFEDERAL CAPITAL. MB. GRIFFIN'S APPOINTMENT. No intimation has yet been forthcoming about the Federal Government's intentions regarding Mr W. B. Griffin's tenure of. office as director of design and construction for the Federal Capital. Mr Griffin's appointment terminates in .October. For half his time Mr Griffin is paid £1,050 per annum, and is allowed to do private work in the remainder. Of late years practically no works - have been carried on at Canberra, and, consequently, Mr Griffin has had little to do in his Federal capacity. Last year, how- I ever, he was paid special fees for designs for altering the General Post Office in Elizabeth Street, and the .telegraph operating rooms, amounting to over £1,000. This work was not given to Mr Griffin because there was a lack officers in .the architectural branch of the Department of Works and Bailways, which is under the direction of Mr S. Murdoch, who responsible for the whole of the building press operations of the Commonwealth. Mr Murdoch, in the execution of his duties, also prepared plans for the very works for which Mr. Griffin's plans were made, and the greater portion of the new post-office buildings in Bourke street was built from Mr Murdoch's designs. in In the light of that extract, I think that same the least the Postmaster-General can do on is to offer me an apology for haying re Works plied to my question as he did.",23
19,Mr WEBSTER,MELBOURNEGENERAL POST,"Gwydir-Postmaster General) [ 2 . 4 4 ] - I wish to make a conpersonal explanation. I am - surprised at the honourable member's remarks, at the - conclusion he drew say from my reply to his question. He has deno reason to infer that I attempted to be Post offensive or unfair to him. I simply said Mr that I had not seen the statement he referred to, and, in the circumstances, it was quite natural for me to question whether it was in accordance with the facts. As a matter of fact, I knew that it was is not not. Hence I asked for the source upon which my friend was basing his question. No personal reflection was intended, nor was any implied. I am pleased that the honourable member has brought forward this matter, because it gives me the opporretunity of correcting an inaccurate statement, namely, that the plans which were drawn by Mr Griffin were copies of something done by the oflicers of the Public Works Department. The plans used were drawn by Mr G r if f in; that is to say, his ideas and his design were used subject to some alterations arranged by the officers of the Works Department and myself for various reasons which I need not specify here. These alterations necessitated another set of plans being drawn up by the officers of the Public Works Department. The bulk of the design, practically 99 per cent, of it, was the work of Mr Griffin. If we had had some competition with regard to the planning of necessary public works on which millions of pounds have been spent in Australia, we could have saved a very large public expenditure, and would not have had so many buildings which do not meet requirements, and which are so common a feature in the Commonwealth today. Later: . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Were the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) ? the plans submitted by Mr Griffin for the alterations to the General Post Office, Melbourne, compared with those issued by the departmental officers, and was .saving, as well as convenience, in carrying out of the work of the Post Office effected by using Mr. sign?",23

Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - In view of the Government control of cornsacks, what hope can the Minister for Trade and Customs give the wheat-growers, potato-growers, and other primary producers of Australia of procuring ample the supplies of jute goods for the coming season at reasonable prices?",24
27,Mr MASSYGREENE,CORNSACKS AND PRODUCE,"There is no Government control of cornsacks at the present time. Early this year, the Government announced its intention of releasing all control of cornsacks, and sold all the bags it possessed. It intimated at the same time that the duty would devolve the trade in the usual way to make tell the necessary preparations for the coming season. The difficulty this season, owing to the rapid increase in price, has been Engaging the serious consideration of the Government for some time, but it will be impossible for the Government to redo anything save in co-operation with the States, and negotiations are at present proceeding (between the .Commonwealth and the States regarding the matter. I am unable to say that it will be possible for the associated Governments of Australia to do anything, and it may be necessary still for the trade to make the full provision for the season. CONTROL OF NECESSARIES.",24
28,Mr TUDOR,CORNSACKS AND PRODUCE,"As the Government are going to take the action indicated by the Minister for Trade and Customs, in answer to the previous question relating to cornsacks, will they consider the other necessaries of life, which are used by the great bulk of the community?",25
29,Mr MASSYGREENE,CORNSACKS AND PRODUCE,"As I have already explained, this Government, standing by itself, is powerless in the matter. The position is as I have stated it, and-1 do not think it would be desirable for me to go 'farther. COURT MARTIAL ON HMAS. AUSTRALIA. SENTENCES ON SEAMEN.'",25

Mr Webster.^Yes. The full solu r - tion of the problem , is being deferred until the return of the Prime Minister, under whose regime this matter was initiated.

Who was responsible for the 'Statement that tbr soldiers were to be quarantined on arrival of the troopship, thus misleading the public? 3. What action does he propose to take to avoid a repetition of trouble of this kind?",26
45,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEFENCE ANDNAVY,"The answers are1. The troopship Somali had .reported by wireless that there had been a succession of cases of mild influenza and allied disorders. It was, therefore, necessary, in accordance with the procedure at that time in force, that the vessel and all troops should be quarantined, and an announcement was accordingly properly made to that effect by the Chief Quarantine Officer. Negotiations' were, however, in progress with the State Government with the object of agreeing upon a mutually acceptable policy permitting of modifications in the quarantine restrictions. An agreement having been reached with the State Government subsequent to the announcement above referred to, it became possible to allow the Somali troops to land and proceed to their homes instead of spending seven days in quarantine. inconvenience caused by this change in arrangements was more than offset by the advantage to the troops and the economy to the Commonwealth. As the changes made apply to all subsequent troopships, no recurrence of the conditions is likely. 2 and 3. See answer to No. 1. TRADE RESTRICTIONS. LANDING CERTIFICATES.",27

47,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEFENCE ANDNAVY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low :_ 1. The matter of giving relief tion indicated has been under consideration, and it has been decided that the requirements regarding landing certificates will be dispensed with immediately; but as to permits, it 'is necessary that those be required in connection with a few items for the present.

I do not think that it is the province of the Government to inquire into the merits or demerits of advertisements which appear in newspapers.

SHIPBUILDING; MINISTERIAL STATEMENT.  ter for the Navy) [3..7] -(B y leave.)In answer to a question some time ago -1 promised that either the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) or I would make a statement at an early date regarding the programme of ship-building for Australia, in and out of Australia. I am now in a position to give the particulars. The first programme of ship construction in Australia consists of six vessels of the three island or well deck type. These; vessels are 331 feet by 48 feet by 26' feet 1 inch depth, moulded to the upper deck, and are being constructed at the following dockyards:- Dromana ' and Dumosa, Commonwealth Dockyard, Williamstown. Delungra, Dinoga, and Dilga,, Government Dockyard, Walsh Island, Newcastle. Dundula, Commonwealth Dockyard, Cockatoo Island, Sydney. These vessels are about 5,500 tons dead weight on 21-ft. 9^-in. draught, and are - fitted with single screw eugine and Babcock and Wilcox boilers-with an i.h.p.. of about 2,200. capable of driving a vessel at a .speed of 10$ knots at-sea. The cubic capacity of the vessels is about 282,000 feet - The Delungra was launched on 25th March, 1919, and is now fitting out. The Dromana was launched from the W i lliamstown yard on 11th April. Engines and boilers and all auxiliary machinery have been installed, and :the vessel is practically complete, and will probably be proceeding on trial in the early part of next week. The Dundula, at the'Cockatoo Island yard, was successfully launched on. 9th July, and the work of fitting out is proceeding. No. 4 ship, the Dinoga, is practically - ready for launching at Walsh Island, and No. 2 ship, Dumosa, at Williamstown, would have been launched at the .end of this month, had delay not .occurred owing to. the seamen's strike and. the coal and - power restrictions. No. '5 ship, 'the Dilga, at Walsh Island, is completely framed out. The plating of the hull bias be^n commenced, ) d the bujkai heads' are'fitted complete. The-cost of these vessels will average about £155,000 each! Mir. TUDOR:-Can you state how much that works out at per ton?  ton'.. A. second programme, consisting of fourteen steel ships, has' been commenced. These will be built in the following 1 yards:2 at Commonwealth Dockyard, Williamstown. 3 at Government Dockyard,. Walsh Island. 1 at' Commonwealth Dockyard, Cockatoo Island. 4at Walkers-Limited, Maryborough, Queensland. 4 at Poole' and Steel's, Adelaide, South Australia. These vessels'will be'of the'shelter-deck type, and will be 331 feet B.P., 48 feet' in breadth, by 31 f t . 7 in. depth moulded to shelter deck: They will carry about 6,000 tons dead-weight on 23' ft. 8$ in. draught. The to tall capacity will be about 338,000 : cubic feet. The machinery driving the 1 vessels will be the same as for the vessels building under the first programme. Arrangements will be made for the carriage of oil fuel, and the boilers will be suitable for burning either oil or coal, as may be considered desirable. Steel plate material for these latter sels building at Walsh Island, Cockatoo Island, and Williamstown has been ordered from England, and about 2,500 to 3,000 tons have already beeu delivered into theabove yards. A portion of steel sectional material has also beendelivered from the Broken Hill Company. Work, has actually commenced on three of the last-mentioned ships. . These vessels will, cost, approximately, £155,000 each. This shows a considerable reduction per dead-weight ton, which is due to the fact that the steel plates and bars were purchased at a lower figure than for the first six ships - It is anticipated that six of these vessels wilbbe completed ineighteen months, another six. in two vears, and. the balance in two and a half years. ""Two wooden fife-mastedauxiliary schooners are under' construction by Messrs. Kidman'and Mayoh. The dimensions'are 250 feet x 45' feet and. 24""ft. 5 in. The-dead-weight will be about 2,600 tons on a load draught of about 19 f t 10 in. One vessel is framed out and partly planked, and the second vessel is partly framed. The timbers used in the construction are Australian hardwoods. The propelling machinery consists of two sets of semi-Diesel Bolinder engines, developing about 240 BHP., at about 240 revolutions per minute, and it is estimated will drive the vessel at 7 knots. The contract' price for these vessels is £26 per dead-weight ton. Negotiations have been, completed for the construction of four larger vessels, with the option of two more;, the dimensions being-52 0 feet over-alllength; breadth, 62 f t . 3 in . ; depth, moulding, 45 feet. These vessels are of the shelter deck type; with a long bridge and fore^ castle above the shelter deck, and three 1 complete decks laid. It is estimated that they will, carry about 12,800tons deadweight on a load draught of 30 feet. Twin-screw quadrupleengines, with cylinders 23$ inches,. 34 inches, 4S inches,, and . 73 inches, and ' stroke 51 inches, will be fitted, and steamwill be generated by an ample installation of water-tube or .Scotch boilers. The machinery will develop ves- 7,300 horse-power, with, a speed of 15 knots, under trial conditions, the. speed at sea over a long voyage being 13 knotsj fully loaded. About 250,000 cubic feet of insulated space for thecarriage of frozen meat or chilled produce will be provided."" The total cubic capacity of the vessels, including, insulated spaces, will be about 700,000 cubic feet. Liberal accommodation will be provided for officers and crew. The cargo arrangements will be of the most modern and up-to-date description, and will enable rapid handling of cargo. Arrangements will also be made in these' vessels for the carriage of oil fuel, and the boilers will be suitable for burning either oil or coal. The cost of these larger vessels will be £423,000 per vessel, or for the four £1,692*000. ' It'is anticipated-that two of - these vessels will be in commission in two yearSj.to Shipbuilding. [REPRESENTATIVES. be followed by a further two at intervals of six months. Deliveries are, of course, subject to reasonable deliveries of material and the absence of industrial strife. All the vessels mentioned are being built to Lloyds' highest class under special survey, and the requirements of the N a v i gation Act are being carried out.",29
64,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Before the gentleman leaves that matter, will he say whether tenders were called for the construction of the large vessels ?  now referring are to be built in Australia.",31
65,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"What will be the cost per ton?  about £ 3 5 per ton. The greater the speed and the larger the insulated space for refrigeration, the greater the cost of the vessel. The cost estimated for these vessels will compare very favourably with the cost of shipbuilding in any other part of the world today. The question of extending the Will liamstown Dockyard, so that vessels of the larger size and type can be built there, is at present having consideration. In addition to the foregoing, a contract has been signed with Vickers, in Great Britain, for the building of three vessels of 12j000 tons dead-weight, 900,000 cubic feet, of which 370,000 is to be insulated. The length of these vessels will be 520 feet by 68 feet beam. The vessels are to be built to burn oil fuel or alternatively coal fuel as required. The speed is to be 15 knots. The vessels are due for delivery in January, June, and October, 1921, respectively. A similar contract has also been entered into with Beardmore's to build two - steamers similar in all respects to those being built by Vickers, referred to above. Complete details of these contracts have not yet been received fro m London.",31
66,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"How many vessels will be provided with refrigerated space.  referred to will have refrigerating space. The first-mentioned tramps, of 5,500 tons, will not have refrigerating space.",31
67,Mr MAHONY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"In what yards is it proposed to build the large ships in Australia? ] Shipbuilding.  are to be built at Walsh Island, and two at Cockatoo Island, the Government having the option to have a third built there at the price fixed. Wooden Tonnage - A contract was arranged for the construction of f o u r wooden full-powered motor vessels with honourable the Sloan Shipyards Corporation at Seattle. These vessels were completed and delivered as follows:Cethana, 18th July, 1918. Culburra, 26th August, 1918. Ohallamba, 2nd October, 1918. Coolcha, 26th October, 1918. A further contract was arranged in the same way with the Patterson, MCDonald Shipbuilding Company for ' the construction of ten wooden steamers. Of these, the following have been completed and delivered:Bellata, 8th October, 1918. Bundarra, 11th December, 1918. Bethanga, 5th May, 1919. The following vessels have yet to be delivered :B i r r i w a , expected end July. Berringa, expected beginning of September.'",31
68,Mr SINCLAIR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Where do they get these fancy names?  names.,31
69,Mr FLEMING,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Can the Minister say whether the wooden ships built for the Commonwealth ' in America have proved to be satisfactory ?  member will permit me, I prefer to makethe statement in my own way. W it h regard to the remaining boats, an alteration in the motive power was decided upon, and arrangements made for the substitution of Diesel engines in place of steam engines originally provided for . Below are particulars of these motor ships:- Benowa, delivered 15th July. Babinda, delivery expected middle August. ; Balcatta, launching expected beginning of August; ready for delivery end of September. Boobyalla, delivery indefinite. Borrika, delivery indefinite. It will be observed that the date of delivery for the last two is indefinite, in consequence of the several strikes which have taken place at the shipbuilding yards; but the latest information I have is that deliveries should be one month between each boat, so that if the Balcatta is delivered the end of September, the Boobydlla will be handed over the end of October, and Borrika the end of November. It is impossible .to say with any degree of certainty that these expectations will be realized. I am sorry to say that the wooden boats built in America are not turning out satisfactory; but that is not the faul t of the Government. In America the yards were taken over by the United States Government, which, apparently, could not supervise them. We have had the best legal opinion obtainable in regard to the orders.",31
70,Mr MAHONY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Hav e we not a representative over there to look after. the interests of the Commonwealth? What is he doing ?  he is doing. He has been there for some time, and yet ships of which he was in charge were delivered months ago. It is all very well to be wise after the event. When this contract was made the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was cheered for having the courage to do something to meet our great necessities at the time. As to the local ships under my control, I have cancelled their building as far as possible, with the exception of the two mentioned, and that exception was because a quantity of timber was left over. Last week, in answer to a question, I showed that the cost of cancelling contracts for those ships was about £ 5 per ton, whereas in the case of 370-odd ships, the contracts for which were cancelled by the American Government, the cost was from £ 1 3 to £ 1 4 per ton, although the vessels were at similar stages of construction, and none of them completed within 50 per cent. Under the circumstances, I think we have to congratulate ourselves on being relieved from these contracts for wooden ships-although , as I say, there were cheers when I .announced that they had been made. I have now carried out my promise to present a full statement to the House in connection with the shipbuilding programme.",32
71,Mr TUDOH,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I suggest that to the statement just read there should be added the cost paid for the cancellation of the contracts for wooden ships in Australia, so that the statement may appear complete in Hansard.  statement in regard to these wooden ships here; but, in any case, *the facts have already appeared in Hansard.

They now propose to extend for itself. a period of ten years what they describe as an illegality, so that their proposal suggests the attempt of a.man to multiply nothing hy ten. In view of the ment advanced by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat (Mr. hony) as to an extension of our constitutions tional powers, it is just as the Committee that it is only some three years ago that a measure providing for a referendum of the people on an amendthank ment of the Constitution' was introduced undertaking. in this House, and that the Labour vernment then in power denied the an opportunity to vote upon it ",34

It is not intended to argudo more than that - As' to the matter of administration referred to by the honMaorable member, I shall make representato the Wool Committee on the lines well to remind suggested by him.",34
87,Mr RODGERS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Wannon) [3.46] - I the Acting Attorney-General for his Generally speaking, the Gobenefactions of the Wool Pool are acpeople knowledged throughout the length and breadth of Australia.. I would point out that traders, as well as country operators sheepskins, in small lines of wool and hides, and those engaged in fellmongery works in country towns, loyally stood by . what they deemed to be the needs .of the country during the war, and in doing so being they surrendered their life's work. The fellmongers in country districts, for in stance, have for five long years practically closed down their business places. In their works many men were employed, and the wages earned by them were a valuable asset to the small towns close to which they were established. These industries, however, have all been stopped. In one case of which' I know, three generations of a family have carried on the onebusiness of skin buying and dealing. They have had their own stores, waggons, and agents, but for the last five years they have had practically to give up their business. In view of the fact that there is plenty of wool to enable the contract with the British Government to be carried out, and that great quantities of raw material are no longer required for the purposes of the war, I ask the Acting Attorney-General to make to the Central Wool Committee the most earnest representations possible as to the importance of giving the class of men to whom I have referred a chance to resume their business during the coming wool ""season.",34
88,Mr LYNCH,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Werriwa) [ 3 . 4 8 ] to support the plea advanced by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers). The position taken up by the Government is that this Bill can be applied only' to contracts that were entered into . during the war period, and that it cannot be extended, as many' of us would like it to be, so as to permit of a greater measure of governmental control in directions of much importance to the people, who are complaining of the high cost of living. It should be possible, however, as the honourable member for Wannon has pointed out, to do something for those country business people who have will ingly given up their industry during the war. The Central Wool Committee have shown much capacity, and their operations have been of almost immeasurable worth to the community; but their disastrous policy of centralization has caused much suffering on the part of country wool, merchants and their agents. The sooner we get back to normal conditions in this regard the sooner we shall do a measure of justice to these people, and give our rural towns an opportunity to advance. Country representatives do not ask the Government to do anything calculated to endanger the validity of a Bill of this kind, but we certainly think that this measure of justice should be done to men, who, in consequence of the war, have lost their means of livelihood. If that cannot be done under existing arrangements, then the sooner we wind up the governmental activities covered by this Bill the better for all concerned. That is my view, notwithstanding that I am prepared to support a system of Government interference in connection with the marketing of our produce and the fixation of prices. We shall have to make a most emphatic protest against-any extension of the period to be covered by this Bill , unless we can secure for the country wool and skin merchants the measure of justice for which we ask.",35
89,Mr FENTON,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Maribyrnong) [3.50] According to the legal authorities quoted by the Acting Attorney General (Mr Groom) in introducing this Bill , it is competent for this Parliament to pass a measure of this kind in relation to contracts made during the currency of the war provided it I rise be passed prior to the date of the exchange of ratifications. All thinking men iriust agree with the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) that the settlement of the difficulties to which the war has given rise will call for the exercise of more genius than even the successful prosecution""' of the war demanded. It seems to me that many years will elapse before we shall return to normal conditions, and that being eo, we should extend the operation of this Bill beyond 30th June next unless in the meantime we can obtain an amendment of the Constitution vesting wider powers in this Parliament. As an illustration of the way in which legal opinions differ I would point to the case which the Premier of Queensland (Mr Ryan)- conducted before the Privy Council. In the first instance, Mr Justice Cooper, of the Queensland Supreme Court, gave a decision against the State Government in an action brought by local pastoralists in regard to the Government acquisition of cattle stations. The Government appealed to the State F u l l - Court, and obtained a judgment in its favour. The pastoralists then went to the High Court, which decided against the State, but the Privy Council, on appeal, reversed the decision. Four different tribunals gave alternative decisions on the same set of particulars.",35
90,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Is that an argument in favour of an extension for twenty years?,36
91,Mr FENTON,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"It is an argument against placing too much faith in legal opinion, and if this measure the same variations of opinion may be expressed by tribunals as were given in connection with the Queensland land case. In view of the possibility of the measure being challenged, and seeing that we may not, through apathy, seek from the people the powers the Commonwealth should possess to deal with these matters, it is as well for us to extend the operations the measure for another ten years, so that we may make our position doubly secure. There may be a good deal in the claim that throughout the country districts the operations of the Wool Committee have deprived many agents of their means of livelihood; but I contend that, if the operations of that Committee are not continued by an extension of this Bill, the people of the Commonwealth may be mulct in very heavy charges for wool after the 30th June, 1920. The operations of the .Wool Committee have had some little restraint on those who sell wool. At the recent wool sales in London wool has sold as high as lOOd. per lb.",36
92,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR, Does the honourable member propose to connect his remarks with the amendment?,36
93,Mr FENTON,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Yes . If we do not extend the powers given by the Bill for another ten years, provided we have the constitutional authority to enact such a measure, which I doubt, a great injustice may be done to the people of the Commonwealth. Wool, which is now sold at lOOd. per lb. in London, can be bought - by Australian woollen manufacturers locally at something like 42d. per lb.; but if we abolish the restrictions present existing under the contract relating to wool and the operations of the Wool Committee, the local price of wool may rise to a considerable extent. Thus the woollen manufacturers may be called upon to pay double the present price, and those who desire to clothe themselves in woollen goods may be obliged to pay very heavy prices for them. I am prepared to accept the chance that this Bill may be declared unconstitutional; but, in order to set our house in order, I think we ought to extend its operations for anis challenged other ten years.",36
94,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Then why did the honourable member advocate the wiping out of the War Precautions Act?,36
95,Mr FENTON,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The honourable member need not look up to the reporters' gallery to see whether they are taking a note of his interjection. We can all play ro the gallery. I am out every time to .of protect the pockets of the people, that are already being delved into too deeply, and which will be delved into more deeply in the future if we do not protect them. If this measure will protect them for another ten months, I am ready to give my vote to extend that protection for another ten years. '",36
96,Mr FLEMING,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Robertson) [4.0] The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) has used the same old argument that unless the operation of ' this measure is extended the mam who produces our raw products will secure something like a fair market price for his goods.,36
97,Mr FENTON,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,A fair price?,36
98,Mr FLEMING,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Yes . . The world's parity. There is no fairer price than the world's price. The only justification for the extension of this Bill is the fulfilment of the contracts into which the Commonwealth Government has entered in reference to various commercial activities. I support the remarks of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) that, throughout the country districts, many small traders have been deprived of their ordinary means of living. A good deal of roguery has been carried on in the past in connection with the skin trade, at and it is to be hoped that now conditions are normal more discrimination will be shown in regard to the issue of permits in reference to these matters; but, whatever date is fixed for the termination of the Bill, the Government should do something to give those honest people who have been dealers in a small way in country districts an opportunity to Teturn to their . ordinary ..avocations. I hope .that 'Ministers will not consider the proposal put forward by honourable members opposite to further - extend the period in which they may .still .be in a position to hold down the primary producer, who today is the most ill-used man in Australia.",36

He wants to he assured that he is to have the .benefit of the War Precautions Act in securing for the primary producer, for some months in advance, what he is. pleased to call a fair price, and which, ,he says, is the world's price. It . is a very cheerful, if somewhat - voracious, admission, from an honourable member who used to . twit the Labour party in regard to their ambitions in the matter of fixing prices. . . . I .leave that matter, to remind' the Minister (Mr Groom) of what' I reminded .him in my speech on the second reading, and that is the fact that the .duration of'this Bill .bias .been determined upon by reason of the certificate supplied by certain eminent. legal gentlemen outside this House. I had hoped that he would pay honourable .members the compliment, even at the eleventh hour, of justifying his attitude towards the Bill, and the .dates he has' fixed for the termination of its operations; but I learn that he has said nothing by way of justification or excuse, or even palliation, and that we still rest on this certificate, which I now declare to be, in my opinion, an utter absurdity, if, indeed, it does not perpetrate something close to a fraud on this Parliament.  ber had been in the chamber last night.he would have heard what the Minister said.",37
100,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Le t him go on. Mr BRENNANr - If the honourable member did deal with that aspect ,of the question I am doing him an injustice.",37
101,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Stat e exactly what you mean, by-"" fraud."" Mr BRENINAGSr - The certificate supplied to the House would convey to the minds of . honourable members the impression _ 'that some one, , or all, of the activities that are proposed to be .carried out . imder this. ..Rill were guaranteed by high legal authority out-, side the House as beiug capable of accomplishment; but there is not a single activity proposed .to be. carried out that .is guaranteed by legal ..authority any> . where. ,AH that .the certificate says is that the Bill is, in the opinion of these gentlemen, within .the competence of Parliament. That opinion carries us nowhere. The Bill may be, and probably is, within the competence of Parliament, but it involves a fixation, of .prices, it involves commercial operations within the boundaries of a single State, and it involves the possibility. or intention of carrying.out a vast number of operations which Jiave from time ;to time been declared to be - without ' the , competence of the Federal Parliament. These .legal gentlemen do not know any more than ' we know .as .to what is proposed to 'be done'under., the measure. If at any future time, as. will probably 'be. the case, some one .challenges thp Bill .as - to - the fixation of the price of sugar, or as .to commercial dealings, in dairy produce, and the High Court decides that such an interference with local trade is absolutely outside - the competence of this - Parliament, these eminent legal gentlemen will :simply say that it - was not a transaction of that kind, or at .that time, it may be six months after the war. they had in contemplation, when they said that - the bare machinery of the measure was within the competence of the Federal Parliament. It was due to honourable members that the Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom), the chief law officer of the Commonwealth, should have supported the Bill by authority, if he felt competent to do so-and I pay him the compliment of saying that I think he is competent to do so-and if he was capable of giving it candid and sincere support,, and if there was any authority he could quote. He has not done so. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) has moved an .amendment that the .period' iof ihe regulation - relating to dairy produce shall end ten years later than-'is"" intended'hy the regulation itself; but if the honourable member refers to clause4, sub-clause 3, he will find there, as he will find nexionwith all these activities, a provision which will carry them on for an indefiniteperiod, and for the purpose of reference,, and taking this clause in conjunction with the one we are discussing, I may be permitted to read it . Thesubclause provides - 1 After, the prescribed date the Dairy Produce Committee may continue to exercise such powers as are specified in the War Precautions (Dairy Produce Pool) Kegulations, or in any Kegulations made in pursuance of this section, but only so far as may be necessary for the. purpose of completing transactions, matters, and things in relation, to the operations of the'Committee which have not been completed by the prescribed' date;, and of winding up theoperations, of thei Committee: In that provision there is abundant food' the country. for contention and litigation as to what things are completed and what are notmember's' completed, and when these regulations of misleading are to end. 3STo end is prescribed f o them by this Bill . The Bill is to a kind of liquidator, just as there are liquidators now in Melbourne engagedi winding up the affairs of various boom companies that went . into' liquidation about twenty-five years ago. still going strongly, and under this B i these Pools may still be operating long after the amendment of the Leader of Opposition has run even its extended course.. Still , if the G overnment arc fied, as apparently they are, that the ciple of control and fixation is now .within the competence of this Parliament, a fact which they denied ad nauseam in many speeches on the floor of this chamber, this carefully. is an excellent opportunity for them to show their sincerity by giving the country the benefit of. the extended power which, they have so recently f ound to exist in the Commonwealth Parliament. Mr GROOM' (Darling Downs-'Minis - pened in this matter. ter for Works and Railways and ActKingdom ing Attorney-General) [4.12] - The honlegal orable member for Batman (Mr . naitr) hashardly done himself justice,nor do I think he has done justice to the Committee: . The honourable member made' a speech earlier in-' the debate; Activities Bill. 10955 and I remained here to reply to. him. I replied late last night, but the honourable member was. not in his in con- place tohear me. I went into, some of. the matters to which hehad referred.. If . he was not here, he must, not blame me for discourtesy because he did not hear my reply. He has said this afternoon that the certificate of these honourable counsel amounts to. a f r a u d, on the House - That, was an iniquitous remark for the honourable member to make, and in his calmer moments, when he reads it 1 in black and white, no one will regret it more than himself.",37
102,Mr BKENNAN,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The honourable member, asked me to explain'exactly what I-meant,, and my. explanation madei t perfectly clear, that there was no reflection on counsel. I meant that it amounted to misleading the members of this House and",38
103,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Then the honourable remark amounted to a charge on m y ' p a r t . ' D u r in g' the r eighteen years I have been in this House> become I have always taken honourable! members' f u l ly and frankly into my confidence! n upon every subject which I have had"" to submit to them. I do not believe! there was ever a Bill submitted' to ParThey are liament in connection with which the Gol l vernment more full y put upon the table the whole of the facts than in this case. the I am forced to the conclusion that the honourable member has not read the' satisspeeches made here, or studied the subprinject, and probably.has not even read the preamble of the Bill , where he will find the material facts' completely set out.",38
104,Mr BKENNAN,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,I have read it most,38
105,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Then let me examine first the honourable member's charge that Parliament is being "" t r i c k e d "" by the certificate presented to it . I explained to honourable members exactly what hapI n the United a large number of difficult and administrative problems arose,, Brenand the British .Government obtained! the assistance of experts in several in^ stances. . Even on. the definition' of the termination of the war, it took the advice of two Judges-and a number-of experts. The honourable member's (Mr Tudor) takes a very different from the honourable member. ex-Minister for Trade and Customs, he said he thought the Government had acted very wisely in taking the advice of eminent counsel in this matter.' May I interests concerned remind the Committee of what we are doing, because the honourable member evidently does not realise it? We have made big contracts with the Imperial ment. We have organized the resources and products of these industries, into millions of pounds. Large financial obligations had been undertaken, and were coming to the close of the war. If the waf terminated suddenly, and we no legal power to carry ou these acwith tivities, obviously chaos and confusion faced us in connection with all these transactions. The obvious duty of Government under those conditions was Parliament. to have all these activities closely investigated, to see exactly where it stood. If , by legislation, we could in a legal and orderly manner complete the operations which were necessary during the course of the war, it was our bounden duty to do so. We did so accordingly. mendous task has - been placed upon the Attorney-General's Department self, and during the last six months have had in that Department more serious and difficult problems than at any period I can remember, consequent .to enact. upon the great difficulties arising out the war. In the circumstances, my duty to the House not to rely upon my own opinion as Attorney-General, seeing that so many millions were incontinue. volved, such large interests concerned, and so many relations implicated, secure also the best advice I could tain in Australia. The honourable ber himself admits that the Committee is a good representative body of legal ability of the Commonwealth. to the eternal credit of these gentlemen, who are capable of commanding highest fees in their profession, that in a spirit of patriotism they gave up all their time, learning, experience, and thought to assist the Commonwealth in solving the very difficult and serious problems before it. The facts connection with each of these Mr Groom. leader Commonwealth activities were placed view before them, together with the cirHe is an cumstances in which the legislation was and carried out. The contracts that were made, the regulations involved, the course of administration pursued, and the were put carefully before them, and before this the - Department took the responsibility of drafting Bills representing the departGovernmental view of the legislation that sliould be introduced. Each of these Bills, torunning gethei with the circumstances, were put before the Committee, both in Sydney we and Melbourne. I presided over the deliberations here, and on several occasions had went to Sydney to preside in connection these matters there. After all the consultations and deliberations on the subject, counsel gave their opinion in the the form in which it has beenput before",38
106,Mr BRENNAN,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,I have never seen an opinion like that before.,39
107,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The honourable member knows that a brief is sometimes endorsed with a plain "" Yes "" or "" No,"" while in A tremany other cases considered opinions are given almost in the nature of a judgment. and myThe Bill has been submitted to Parliawe ment, and what Parliament very properly to face wants to know is whether it is a measure which this Parliament has the legal power That was the question, and of counsel's opinion is the answer in clear, it was definite, and unequivocal terms.",39
108,Mr SAMPSON,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Anothe r question was but, whether the control was a good thing to",39
109,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Counse l were not conto cerned about policy. The Government obtake the responsibility for the policy. memThey were asked to advise only on the legal question. For all the rest, the Go the vernment, and of course Parliament if it It is passes the measure, must take the responsibility. The Bill having been put the before counsel, they certified-""We have carefully considered the Bill , and are of opinion that it is within the competence ability, of the Commonwealth Parliament."" The honourable member says that I have put that opinion before honourable memin bers as if it were a guarantee to Parliagreat ment that Parliament has power to pass this Bill . I defy the honourable member to quote a single line in anything 1I have said that will convey that opinion. Here is the official report of the words I uttered. The honourable member, as a lawyer, knows that no such guarantee could be given.",39
110,Mr ARCHIBALD,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,He is on the other side.,40
111,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"No , he is not, because he expressed a sort of doubting opinion that the Bill is within the competence of this Parliament. He is inclined to agree with counsel on that point, although he disagrees with the judgment of the majority of the High Court in the case of Burvett v. Farey. The honourable member asks me for an authority on this question. How could I cite to him the judgment of the High Court upon the interpretation of the Constitution regarding a question that"" has never arisen ? The honourable member knows that no such direct authority could be given.",40
112,Mr BRENNAN,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"It is just for that reason that I say the certificate of compe-tence carries us nowhere. It is valueless, although it is not valueless as a declaration of law so far as it goes.",40
113,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"-The honourable member knows that in 1903, when the High Court was established, we had a written Constitution. It was known that that Constitution would have to become a living organism expressive of the life of the people, and that of necessity there would be conflicts between the Commonwealth and the State""!. We constituted the High Court for the express purpose of deciding the issues that were likely to arise. No one at that time could give a guarantee as to how the Court would in terpret the Constitution, but students of constitutional law, who understood the principles upon which the Constitution was laid down, and who had studied the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States,, were able to predict in certain cases, with a fair amount of accuracy, how the decision might go.",40
114,Mr SAMPSON,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,I do not think they did so far as State rights are concerned. They did not expect that the States would be superior to the Commonwealth.,40
115,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I am.speaking only of opinions that were given. If the honourable member looked at the advice given by the ' Commonwealth law authorities during the early stages of the development of the Constitution, he would find that they were able to give very competent advice which proved correct on a great many of the leading problems affecting the Constitution. Opinions given by the Attorneys-General of the. United States of America have been published, giving their advice as to how they - believed the Constitution would be in terpreted. No one ever suggested that they could give a guarantee. But , in the light of the judicial interpretation of the Constitution, these couusel were competent to give to Parliament what was. their opinion as to what could have been secured. I take full responsibility for the legislation which has been introduced, and I advised honourable members that I believe this inatter to be within the competence of Parliament. Last night I briefly indicated some of the reasons which had led me to that conclusion. An honourable member, by in terjection, seemed to think that I had based my position on the fact that the Commonwealth had entered into contracts. That was not the only ground. Where the Commonwealth has entered into contracts which extended beyond the termination of the war, I hold that we are competent to deal with such matters. Suppose that we took the interpretation to be that the - defence power was one which could only be exercised during the period of war. What an extraordinarily limited power that would be. We, in Australia, are exercising, with in our jurisdiction, on behalf of the Empire, the complete power of defence, not only forourselves, but for the Empire. We have had relations with the different parts of the Empire in the despatch of our troons from Australia, in handing over our Pleet to the Imperial authorities, in our financial undertakings and obligations, and in providing food and equipment necessary for the conduct .of the war. If we took the stand that defence is a power to be exercised only during the period of actual war, we would not be able even to get ready for warfare. . It is admitted that in the defence power - there is. included preparation i for war. It is obvious that it must' bee included: What an extraordinary Constitutions' this would' be if we knew that there were large forces about to' attack us and that, because the Empire had not technically and legally declared war, wei were impotent to exercise a single power of defence, until the enemy had.landed.upon our shores,-and we were in. a: state of confusion. It is generally admitted that included ih the power of defence is the power to prepare in anticipation of attack.. Leti ua now consider, the: other side ofi the case'. Can we exercise preparatory/ powers: and full war-time powers;' amd; then,, immediately upon the'cessation of warfare, can we go no further ? That would lead to an absurd position. In regard, to all; our obligations we would be able to do nothing. With respect to OUT troops overseas we might have somelimited power; but, as for our administrative actions, immediately upon the cessation of war we would become powerless.  with the clause under discussion?",40
116,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I am endeavouring, courteously, to answer a proposition, stated by an honourable member on the Opposition benches. If , immediatelyupon the conclusion of the war, all the administrative activities which we had created and. organized in order to give effect to obligations entered into, and which were essential for the carrying on of the war, were to cease, then all Federal control would be absolutely ended.",41
117,Mr FINLAYSON,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Nobod y has gested that.,41
118,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"""Unde r such circumstances, obviously, the power of defence must continue. Mr - PAGE - I rise to a point of order. You, Mr Atkinson, prevented several honourable members on this side from discussing the whole Bill, and yet you allowing the Miuister to make a secondmade reading speech while we are in Committee dealing with one clause.",41
119,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,The honourable memformed ber for Batman (Mr Brennan) spoke considerable. length while you were not 7>resent.  .time.,41
120,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR, Order ! The Minister; is replying to a point raised by the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan).,41
121,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Of necessity there 1 must' be implied in the Constitution a power of defence which, in certain circumstances, must last beyond' the actual declaration of Peace. I pointed out last night, in connection with the activities within' the' scope of the Bill, that there were circumstances which justified the making of contracts, and which contracts were essential in the interests of the Empire. It was urgently necessary that certain of our resources should be organized' and placed at the disposal of the Empire;, and, to do that effectively,, we had to take up a control which would extend over a certain prolonged and definite period. Por the security of the United Kingdom itself,' the Imperial Government desired these resources, in order that it might be able effectively and successfully to carry on the war. My opinion is that, as regards these particular activities, and in the circumstances which existed during the war, and still continue, the' Parliament, is competent to pass this legislation in order to-.wind up these activities in. the manner set forth. There are also other circumstances, in connection with the moratorium which justify Parliament in legislating beyond the period actually concerned. But to contend, that if we have this power we therefore possess unlimited sug- power to fix prices generally is not reasonable. When warfare ceases the ordinary working of our constitutional provisions will be reverted to; and then the power of price-fixing within a State will naturally devolve upon the State.",41
122,Mr BRENNAN,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Batman) [4.34] - The are Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom) some observations last night, it appears, which I did not hear. Having made inquiries today, I was in that he had'not touched upon the at aspect of the case which has now been debated. I was .evidently misinformed, and I record my regret that I have* done the honourable ..gentleman, to that extent, .au injustice.. I thank him also - for his defence of the constitutional position,. It was a statement due to this Committee, and was, I think, too long delayed. Owing to the unprecedented circumstances in which the Bill was introduced, it was incumbent upon the Minister to present his view of the constitutional position.' Something .more was due to honourable members than the words of a bare certificate- a certificate provided, as I have more than once stated, iby an irresponsible body, however eminent those.gentlemen may be outside of Parliament. ' The Acting Attorney-General has logically pointed out, as members of the High Court Bench have 'also done, that since we have .a general power of defence .given under the Constitution, it , follows that that involves matters preparatory to defence. And the honourable gentleman argued from that that it must necessarily include power to continue even what might bo called remote defence operations after the war was over. suggest, however, that the real test appearing from the decided cases upon' this question is the extent of the nation's danger or embarrassment arising from the war itself, and that there is, therefore, a vast difference between operations preparatory to war and operations carried on after danger has passed. As these operations under the various contracts are clearly to be carried on in time of peace, when the international crisis has, in fact, passed away, I suggest that they will ably be found, when tested, to be outside the competence of the Commonwealth Parliament. I repeat that a certificate.of - competence to pass a Bill affords no assurance that we shall be able to do, under that Bill, anything we may desire to do, for the simple reason that the matter of our powers to do a particular thing .cannot he decided until the time and circumstances arrive when it is to be - determined.  desire to speak briefly from the point of viiew.,Qf the producer. Every producer will be prepared, to affk-m that contracts which were made in good faith, and in. the. expectation .that tbo warj-would.have lasted considerably longer than it did, should be carried out;-and, therefore, every producer will be quite willing to concede ,the time regarded by the Government as necessary to effect those ends. But .any proposal that the Government should exercise, a regulating influence on prices of commodities, produced at a date subsequent to that period would not find acceptance with the producers. The interests concerned in this measure are too big and important to be trifled with. We regret that prices had tp be fixed at all. But it was necessary to establish 'these Pools and Committees, and to enter into these contracts, in order that we might qarry on in time of war. Such a condition of affairs was inevitable, and we are prepared to see the business through so far as those contracts are concerned. But we will strenuously resist any .attempt to prolong such a situation. ,Lf the wool contracts had,not .been in existence, we would have been free to sell wool at the world's price today, and. we .would be able to.get.a I better price than that which has been fixed under the contract. It ,is a - monstrous proposition that .that condition of things should be prolonged for a. moment longer than is necessary. Honourable members opposite, always speaking from the point of view of the .consumer, ask for a lowering of prices, but I point out to them - that the only - way to reduce the cost of living is to encourage production, and the only way to encourage production is to give the pro..probducers the advantage of the world's markets. The primary producers have droughts and other natural adverse conditions to contend against, and if we add to those natural difficulties the valuation of their products by the Government, the result must be fatal to the interests of the producer, and, consequently, to the interests of the consumer and of the Commonwealth as a whole.",41
123,Mr FLEMING,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Especiall y when the valuations are made by men whose only idea is to keep prices down. Mr ,TUDOK -^Tlier e is not one representative of the consumer on /any of these Boards.  Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), with the idea of cheapening butter to consumers in Australia, prohibited its exportation. The result was that the big dairy herds were dispersed, no butter was being manufactured, and, naturally, the price went up.",42
124,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The honourable member ought to get his head read.  Opposition does not like to be told what were the effects of his action. In view of the mistake which he made on that occasion, he ought to restrain honourable members behind him from any line of aetion which would have similar evil effects upon Australian industries today. The honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) has suggested that the operations dealt with under the Bill can be carried on for a considerable period after the present time. It is clear that for some time after the contracts are finished a considerable staff must be continued in employment to wind up the whole of the Pool business. In 'connection with wool, for instance, one of the conditions incidental to the contract is that the wool producers are to receive 50 per cent, of any profits made (by the British Government upon the re-sale of the wopl to manufacturers in England. That is a matter which cannot be finally settled for a considerable time after the contracts are closed, and until it is settled there cannot be a winding up of the whole scheme. 'There must be power given to continue in existence the Departments which have been provided for, until all the details connected with their operations have been brought to a conclusion.",43
125,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,YaTra) [4.45] - I do not know that I would have spoken again if it were not for the remarks of the hon and of the Acting Attorney-General (Mr. Groom). The honourable member for Echuca has stated that the way to lower prices to the consumer is to encourage production in this country. Let me inform the honourable member that there are more sheep in Victoria today than there ever were before.,43
126,Mr FLEMING,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,'But not in Australia.,43
127,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"We only use Victorian sheep in Victoria. Although there are more sheep in the State today than there eveT were before, mutton is dearer today to the consumer than it was at any time within the past forty years. The honourable member has said that I prohibited the export of butter. It is true that I did, and I remember that the gentleman who was then Minister of Agriculture in Victoria, Mr Hagelthorn, said that we should send away the butter from Victoria, and that the people here should use treacle. We are told that honourable members on this side represent the consumer, and I may be allowed to say that the honourable member for Echuca has never said a word for the consumer since he has been in this House.  man is quite .wrong there. Mr TUDOR.^- I advocate equal consideration for producers and consumers. When we secure the extension of the operation of the Bill, I intend to move an amendment dealing with the composition of the Dairy Produce Pool.",43
128,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Will the honourable member not move that amendment before the extension is secured?,43
129,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,I shall move my amendment whether we secure the extension or not.,43
130,Mr FLEMING,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Will the honourable gentleman say what his amendment is?,43
131,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The honourable member will find that my amendment has been printed. The Government, in arranging for a Dairy Produce Pool, have decided that there shall be three representatives appointed by the Government in connection with that Pool. I intend to move . that there.shall also be three representatives of the consumers, appointed by the Leader of the Opposition. I think that is only fair. Surely if the Government are to appoint three nominees to represent the producers, who, I understand, are to be Mr Mears, the representative of the South Coast Company",43

134,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,In the opinion of the Legal Committee it will be valid.,44
135,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Is the honourable member prepared to block any Bill for which he cannot set such a guarantee?,44
136,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I am not blocking this Bill, The Minister in charge of it has proposed that its operation shall extend for one year, and I am going ten times further, and proposing that it shall tend for eleven years. The Government' wish to extend the power of price fixing. The honourable member for Perth (Mr. Fowler) yesterday was able to point out that this Parliament dealt with this matat ter in 1906, when considering the Austraunder lian Industries Preservation Bill. There were in this House at that time constituof tional lawyers quite as eminent as who are members of the House today. motion- At that time the present Mr Justice Isaacs, Mr Justice Higgins, Sir Edward Braddon, Sir Jdhn Quick, and others - allowed. were members - of the House. Wot one of these gentlemen stated at that time that this Parliament did not possess the power claimed for it. The Acting Attor1917 ney-General (Mr Groom) has stated that, in accordance with a judgment of the allowed. High Court, we have the power to fix prices under the defence powers of Commonwealth.",44
137,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Not for an indefinite period.,44
138,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"In speaking on the second reading of the Bill, I mentioned that, while we were sunplied with the opinion of the Legal Committee which has been referred to, I wished to know the question that was submitted to that mittee..",44
139,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,The question submitted was the Bill itself.,44
140,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"They have expressed the opinion that we have the power pass this measure. I wish to know whether we could not submit .to these gentlemen the question whether the power to deal with these matters for an extended period. I am not a lawyer, but I venture to say that if you tell any person of average common sense outside will be that the Commonwealth Parliament is competent to extend this power to the 31st - August, 1920, without any alteration of the Constitution, he will say that it is equally competent to extend that power to 1930. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) this afternoon interjected that we wish the War Precautions Act wiped out. Honourable . members on this side of the House have given notice of motions for the disallowance of certain regulations under that exAct which they consider obnoxious. I sent a lengthy letter to the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt), referring to certain regulations under the Act which we desire to have repealed, but I have never any time said that all the regulations the War Precautions Act are bad. I have said that, in my opinion, certain them are beneficial to the public. I any gave notice nearly two years ago of a That Statutory Eule No. 212 of 1917 relating to the deregistration of unions be disThe honourable member for West Sydney .

The honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H. Catts) also gave notice of a motion",44
141,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Order! What is the honourable member's point in making these quotations?,44
142,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,We have been told that Comwe desired to wipe out the whole of the War Precautions Regulations. I am pointing out that we desired that certain of them should be disallowed. In this case there are some regulations under the to War Precautions Act which I propose should be extended. The honourable memlegal ber for Cook has a notice of motion on we have the. paper to this effect The ' TEMPORARY ' CHAIRMAN. Order !

143,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The Government in this measure are setting, out the time to which they desire that certain of the regulations. under the War Precautions Act shall be extended. I believe that that is the method which should have been adopted previously in regard to these matters. remind honourable members, however, that of the regulations which we held to be obnoxious, not one has been, disallowed, by the Government.

184,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,You want to lock out those men at Botany for ten years more.,52
185,Mr FENTON,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"No . I am quite with the honourable member there, and the present is a good opportunity for the honourable member to discuss the operations of the Wool Pool in that regard. I will have to complain later on, as I propose to do now, of the operations of the Pool regarding certain aspects of the wool industry. The big prices I have quoted as obtaining in Great' Britain are participated in by the Australian wool producers to the extent of 50 per cent, of the excess above the fixed Fool price, but there are certain sections controlled by the Wool Committee which do not participate in that enhanced price. Take the case of the fellmongers. Who gave the Wool Committee the autocratic power to determine that some sections of the wool trade shall participate in those enhanced values and that others, such as the fellmongers', shall not? That is what the Committee has done, and other complaints can be made against it. At the same time, for the protection of the Australian users of Australian wool, it is advisable to extend the period of control May, April, July, for another ten years. I recognise that I 1919. 1919. 1914. am on rather flimsy ground so far as the d. d. d. legality of the Bill is concerned. It has been said here that its validity is likely to be tested. The wool scourers will most likely test the action of the Central Committee in denying them the right to participate in the enhanced prices obtained in Great Britain. The New South Wales Government may take the same action with regard to wool as they took' in regard to wheat in 1914 during the war period. They commandeered the wheat of New South. Wales, and held it, as we thought, contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. The then Attorney-General (Mr. Hughes) took the matter to the High Court, which upheldthe action of the New South Wales Government. I know of nothing to prevent that Government from commandeering the wool supplies of New South Wales in the same way. They can easily say that they will not deprive the Imperial Government of their share of the wool, but they may claim their right as a. Government to deal with the wool within their own .borders. I believe the Bill will be tested in the Courts by that Government, and possibly by other Governments, as well as by private individuals who find that they are suffering injustice under the administration of the Wool Pool. However, we must take all these risks. There is also the possibility indicated by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming) and the honourable member for  ment is carried and the operations of the Pool are extended for ten years, the Australian-wool producer will receive for his wool only the price that may be fixed by the Wool Committee for ten years. should say that would be fairly safe, in view of the present composition of the Wool Committee, because the majority of its members are interested in wool production. That being so, the wool producer's interests are well catered for. If , however, we remove that restriction, and our wools are submitted to public competition, without any restraint by the Wool Pool or by Parliament, who is to say that the Australian manufacturers of woollens will not have to pay up to 5s. and 6s. a lb. for their wool, or even more, against the competition of eager buyers from other countries ? I am assured, on the most reliable authority, that the finest and best wools we produce in Australia can be bought today, not at lOOd., but at 42d. per lb. In asking for this extension of control for ten years in'stead of ten months, I am taking action that will ultimately prove to be of benefit to the growers of Australia, and more particularly to the wool users, or consumers of manufactured woollen articles.

The raw sugar millers of Queensland are aware that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are not too well pleased with the present position.

We decided that the people should get their sugar for 3^d. per lb., plus the cost of delivery to the retailer. The sugar industry is one in which there must be some £12,000,000 invested today, and there are many thousands of people engaged. The efforts of the Commonwealth authorities to establish the sugar industry have been most successful. We have a Tariff which protects the Australian producer, and now we dpsire a Federal control which will protect the workers and at the same time allow the general public to secure sugar at a reasonable price. We have succeeded in that direction for a certain term ; and all that is now proposed is to extend the term to ten years. The sugar-growers of Queensland prefer Federal control to any other.",54

190,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I Say that they would prefer it. The Queensland Government have assisted the Federal Government; but some day, when another Commonwealth Government asks for ful l powers, we shall probably have complete Federal control of the industry. It is very difficult to solve the problems which confront us today. There is much unrest, and all kinds of schemes have been proposed to deal with production and the distribution of wealth. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has nearly the whole of the business in its hands today; its ramifications cover nearly all the continent; Prior to the war one or two men sitting in their offices decided what should be the price of sugar. The company is the most perfectly organized industry in Australia from that view-point. [408]- 2 Mr Knox, who is, perhaps, the most experienced and capable man connected with the sugar industry in Australia, probably has most influence in fixing the price of sugar. For the reasons which I have stated the sugar industry ' is one which is most easily controlled by the Government. After the deliberate and wholesale abandonment of the individualistic principles which have been professed by honourable members opposite for so long, I should think there would be no objection on that side to permitting the Government to control this industry for the term I have mentioned. The Acting  told us this afternoon that the Government are going in for a wholesale programme of shipbuilding. I believe it was Sir William Harcourt who said, some time ago, speaking, of parties in Great Britain, "" We are all Socialists now,"" and doubtless the Melbourne Argus, in view of the statement of the Acting Minister for the Navy this afternoon, will tomorrow sing the same refrain in its leading columns, and "" Ithuriel "" will adopt it for his notes at the close of the week. My amendment should commend itself to the Tories on the other, side who are willing to support a wholesale programme of Government shipbuilding, and who, along with the Bolsheviks, are to bo fought by the Prime Minister (Mrit. Hughes) on his return to Australia.",54

The honourable member and the party opposite made up the money which I would have taken from that industry by taxing the little children on the 3d. tickets of admission to picture shows.

200,Mr RODGERS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Wannon) [7.45] - This clause has afforded members of the Opposition an opportunity to propose, under various headings, the prolongation of a temporary organization that was improvized during .the war period as a sort of compromisebetween pre-war conditions and post-war conditions. Those producers whose commodities alone are being dealt with in this Bill , were quite willing, in view of the greater needs of the State, to .give up for the time their individual rights in order that the State, for its preservation, might set up a form, of control for the war period; which may be described as the pooling period. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), no doubt out of his oft-expressed - anxiety for the dairy farmers, has shown a desire .that the pooling period shall be extended, but the dairy farmers throughout Australia know what his interest is in their great industry, and are not likely to be hoodwinked by his efforts. "" Then the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) desires that the control should be extended also in the case of wool, but all that that honourable member knows about wool, either in its raw or its manufactured state, as expressed by him in this chamber, could be writteni n a very short volume, and his solicitude for the producers may be easily passed over. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs) is always worth listening to, bu t I do not think that he has ever been more interesting than he was this afternoon when he moved an amendment in connection with the sugar industry. Of course, hailing as he does from Queensland, he can be expected to have no other desire than the welfare of the sugar producers there. But what struck me as unique in the speech of an avowed apostle of the doctrine of Socialism was the great tribute he paid to the genius of 1 private enterprise in his State. In the - whole of Australia he singled out Mr . Knox as the man who knows more about sugar than any other person in the country; as the man whose genius, the honourable member told us, is responsible for the organization of the industry on the most highly scientific basis. Mr . Knox, by his own will, and because of the - desire of his company that all should be well with the sugar - industry of Queensland, was lent to the Commonwealth during this trying period - in order that the standard of excellence in the organization might be maintained. During the whole of his address, to which I was very careful to listen, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) never dealt with the merits of the industry as an argument in favour of the prolongation of the pooling system, nor with the power of the State to cail for t h a high effort in the production of more cane or a more refined sugar. This is the only period I can .remember in the history of Australia when black and coloured, and piebald sugar has had to be' accepted for A l quality, and it is the most unfortunate period that' the honourable member could have selected for the purposes of his case, for it is the time when all our f r u it growers of Australia have been clamouring for sugar. The honourable member and his associates from Queensland were much concerned in holding up the industry until they got a special award laying down conditions unheard of in the country before; and to. that end, while Mr Knox and others should have been able to carry on without interruption, the honourable member's friends paralyzed the sugar industry. The honourable member for Capricornia has not advanced one argument to show that we should grant an extension of ten years to the pooling system, nor has the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . Fenton), the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor), or any other honourable member, attempted to show that the advance of the nation would be in any way furthered by the prolongation they propose. All they are concerned in showing is that, under the machinery of the Bill j there might be some kin d of hybrid price fixing. Those who have scanned it carefully will recognise that sugar is about the only commodity that the Government have had to hedge round with all kinds of conditions; and altogether it is the most unfortunate commodity that the honourable member for Capricornia could have selected for the purposes of his argument. The wholesale price and the retail price are fixed, and importation and exportation-excep t by the Government-prohibited , and no margin is allowed as a reward for in creased production. ' Sugar is the only commodity in regard to which the community has been denied the right to call for what it wants, and has been obliged to take that which is offered. I must say that during this period of the temporary pooling of Australia's raw products the producers have never winced. The arguments from the. Opposition side today have shown such a lack of uniformity-hav e been so piebald and so mixed-that they cannot but prevent the party from exerting its full weight in support of its proposals. The honourable member for Maribyrnong first attempted to show that the producers were not getting their all, and when we on this side expressed our satisfaction with the sentiment, he said the consumers were not getting that to which they were entitled. However, I shall not traverse those arguments further, but merely say that this ""has been a period during which collective bargaining in the primary products of Australia has taken the place of the right of individual contract on the part of the producers. As I said before', the producers have not winced, but have been prepared to deliver over to the State the whole of their products at a price to be fixed by the State. In spite of the fact that for wool, wheat, and dairy produce fabulous prices have been recorded on the other side of the world, they have never asked the Government to explain how the fixed prices were arrived at, but have been quite content to believe that the Government was acting, not only in their best interests, but in the interests of the country as a whole. What I am anxious to show-and this has not been recognised by the Opposition, though it has weighed with the primary producers-is that we could not in any spirit of fairness ask that our products might be treated as if they were the products of a neutral country. We in Australia were at war .as much as B rita in or the Empire was at war, and the primary producers, feeling that it would not be in keeping with the spirit of the race, have never taken a "" stand-and-deliver"" attitude, or demanded that they should retain their produce and deal with it on a strictly commercial basis. They have never attempted to obtain those higher prices that a neutral country might have got; and, consequently, when the honourable member for Capricornia asks for a continuance of the Pool, it is not in the interests of the men who were content to 'accept the conditions of the war period in order that their less fortunate cousins in the Old Country-o n whose shoulders the burden of the war mainly rested-migh t get commodities at reasonable prices. I hope that the support to perpetuating the pooling system given by representatives of primary producers on the Government side will not be taken as an indication that the producers have suddenly embraced the Socialistic idea of collective bargaining.",55

In the early stages of the, war there was a grand public spirit i Australia in relation to trade, the war, and the welfare of the nation. Any who had dared to breathe a word against this country would have been hissed off the political platform, if not off the face of Australia, and the profiteer would found a brick on his head. But by a cess of muddling and, in a sense, through temporary State control, this country has degenerated until we find in industralia trial circles a band, of outlaws, and trade and commerce our public conscience has been dulled.

When this Parliament adopted proa certain policy with the deliberate object of freeing the industry in Queensland of Kanaka labour, the people of Ausacquiesced-without demur, but if we in impose a duty of £ 6 per ton on imported sugar we have a right to expect",57
211,Mr CORSER,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,The people of Tasmania paid £ 6 per ton on sugar before Federa,57
212,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"That is not correct; manufacturers were allowed a rebate to the full extent of the duty on - all exports of manufactured goods sent - from the State. To many thousands of last people i u Tasmania and Victoria the small f r u it industry is a considerable the part of their means of livelihood, and If there is no reason why justice should not be done to that industry without in juring the sugar interests in the slightest the degree. Tropical Australia is the test market for the jams and preserves which are produced chieflyin Tasmania and Victoria. The makers of jams and preserves in. those States are the largest consumers of sugar. Only a little common sense is required to reconcile the interests of the two industries. There can be no question n that the people are paying an exceedingly from high price for the maintenance of the sugar industry. The duty of £ 6 per ton means a contribution by the Australian consumers of approximately £1,750,000 per annum to the sugar industry. During the last few years the small f r u it in dustry has benefited by reason of the high prices obtained for jams required for army purposes.",57

214,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I have always said that the duty imposed upon preserves is of very little use. The f r u it producers and jam manufacturers would gladly see that duty removed if they could have, free of duty, the sugar used in their industry. Why cannot, that be done? Nearly every year we have to import a large quantity of sugar, and a great lack of foresight was. shown in that regard during the present year. It was known, many months ago, that we would have to i m port a considerable quantity of sugar.",58

216,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"A b o u t the middle of last year, when I brought this matter under the notice of the Government, we could have bought sugar in Java at £ 7 10s. per ton. We have had to import about 100,000 tons of sugar this year, and it was not good business to defer the purchase until the price rose to £ 2 0 per to n . Having regard .to the fact that for every 1 lb. of f r u it used in preserves a similar weight of sugar is used, surely the Government can devise some scheme by which the jam manufacturer can get sugar free of duty. Several HONOBABLE MEMBEBS - What is the price of jam ?",58

The Government at present allow a small rebate to the jam manufacturers, and they could, without prejudice to the sugar industry.,-make a further rebate. In New Zealand, where sugar is not grown, the price is £ 6 less than it is in Australia, where sugar is produced. must take into consideration the fact that New Zealand is becoming a big competitor with Victoria and Tasmania as a producer of small f r u it preserves. I assure those who are interested in the production of sugar that they cannot expect to continue for all time the present exceedingly heavy levy on the jam industry, which is just as important to some States as sugar production is to Queensland. I suggest that those industries of which sugar is one of the principal raw materials should be able to get their requirements practically duty free.",58

At present the Government are controlling the: sugar in dustry, and the - selling price is fixed by law. Already they have made a small rebate to the jam manufacturing in terests, and I ask them to consider if they cannot make a further concession to manufacturers - who during the present year will be in a difficult position,'because the British Government bought largely for Army purposes, and have big stocks in hand. Unless preserves can - be sent from Australia at prices much below those that have ruled during the last three or four years, countries like New Zealand, which are getting sugar for manufacturing purposes duty free, will occupy such a favourable position that the Australian manufacturer will not be able to compete with them.",58
222,Mr CORSER,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Wide Bay) [ 8 . 1 5 ] - I feel constrained to make some reply .to . the absurd arguments that have just been, advanced by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), whose stupid assertions have caused me no little astonishment. The jam industry carried on, not only in Tasmania, but on the mainland, during the war has not merely We received the benefit of a protective duty of 2d. on every pound of jam or preserved f r u it produced by it , but has been absolutely free from outside competition, since in no other country except New Zealand, which is not competing, have jam manufacturers been able to obtain their sugar at even double the price fixed by the Federal Government. In these circumstances, what reason have the jam manufacturers of the Commonwealth to Domplain ? The Government have also been attacked by the honourable member for their failure to provide a sufficient supply of sugar to meet all requirements up to the beginning of next season. I would remind the Committee that it is little more than twelve months since the Federal Government were faced with an actual sugar surplus. When they entered into the last contract with the Queensland Government for the purchase of sugar for a period of two years, they had a six months' surplus in hand, and were doubtful as to whether or not they should enter into that further contract over so long a period without imposing stringent con' ditions. By reason, however, of severe frosts, followed by cyclones, and, later on, by drought, a great part of the crop that' should have been harvested and manufactured into sugar, was completely lost. Against such visitations no Government could have provided; and it is to those causes that the shortage, which has been ascertained only of recent date, may be attributed. The Government could not have taken action earlier than they have done to meet the situation, and the jam manufacturers are obtaining all the sugar they require at the present time at as low a price as they could expect to secure it. It is absolutely absurd for the honourable member to say that sugar could have been obtained from abroad at £7 10s. per ton during the last twelve months or two years. No one has been able during that period to land it here for £15 per ton duty paid - When a deputation of jam manufacturers told the Minister for Trade and Customs some little time since that they could import sugar at something like that price, his answer was, "" I am prepared to take 50,000 tons, if you can supply it at anything less than £15 per ton."" I think that was the price named. If it is true that these men could have landed it here for £7 10s. per ton, why did they not accept the Minister's Mr Corser. . offer ? These attempts to mislead the publio-and such statements are intended only to mislead-ar e quite beside the mark - The facts can be easily ascertained. If any honourable member has a doubt on the subject, he has only to apply to the Minister for Trade and Customs for a statement in writing as to the actual position. Sugar from overseas cannot be landed here today. under £51 per ton. And at no time during the war have jam manufacturers in the United States of America or Great Britain been able to obtain sugar, except at double the price ruling here.",58
223,Mr SAMPSON,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,What is the position in regard to Java sugar?,59
224,Mr CORSER,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"It has not been possible to introduce Java sugar; but, e/en if it could be brought in now, the price would be double that which - the jam manufacturers of Australia have to pay the Federal Government. No industry in Australia is better protected than the fruit and jam industry. Although my honourable friend (Mr MCWilliams) denies my statement that, prior to Federation, there was a duty ef something like £6 per ton on sugar entering Tasmania, the Hobart press did not deny it when, in the course of an interview, I made the statement, and gave my authority for it. I had large dealings with Tasmania before 'Federation, and I know that, under the Tasmanian Tariff, the duty .on sugar at that time was from £5 to £6 per ton. Another consideration which should not be overlooked is that, although there is a duty of £6 per ton on sugar,' jam manufacturers are receiving their sugar at about £3 7s. 6d. less than the retailer can obtain it. Their exports compete with jams the manufacturers of which pay twice as much for their sugar; so that, if there is any complaint to be made, it is that the local jam manufacturers have been treated too leniently by the present Commonwealth' Government. There is another misapprehension on the part of some honourable members that I should like removed, and that is as to the treatment received by the Commonwealth Government in its dealings with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. As a matter of fact, that company is only working as the paid agent of the Commonwealth. In that capacity it receives £1 per ton on the sugar produced by it, and out of that amount has to provide for loss of interest, insurance, depreciation, and other charges. Some honourable members appear to think that a man who huys a ton of sugar, on, perhaps, three months'' terms, should be granted the same advantage that is extended to a firm which buys a large quantity involving an outlay of, say, £5,000. In the case of the larger transaction, prompt cash is paid, so that the Commonwealth avoids any loss of interest upon that amount, and a good deal of handling is also avoided by it. Those who take delivery of these large quantities are granted an allowance of 6 per cent, and of that they have to pass on to the retail purchaser from 2^ to 3 per cent. Thus they do not get a return of more than from 3 to 3 i per cent, for handling these larger quantities, paying cash, and providing for cartage and storage, insurance and interest, as well as incurring the risks involved. No one is able to carry on a big business with the grocers of Australia without running the risk of loss, since small business men often get into financial difficulties through no fault of their own, and in such circumstances their creditors have to take less than 20s. in the £1. Under the system now in operation, the Federal Government take no risk. I thought it only right, since I knew all the circumstances, that I should make these facts clear to honourable members.",59
225,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Yarra) [8.25] - I am reluctant to interpose in the debate between representatives - of Tasmania and Queensland, but, as a representative of Yictoria, where we also have large jam manufactories, I should like to offer a few observations. The fruit-growing industry in Tasmania is undoubtedly an important one, but large quantities of frui t are also produced in this State, and we have a. number of extensive jam factories. Some very interesting information on this question appears in an article written by Mr. Pritchard, secretary of the Australian Sugar Producers Association,' and published recently in the Sugar Journal in reply to an article which' appeared in the Argus. A conference of various industries interested in the sugar question suggested that the duty should be removed. I am confident that the increase in the price of sugar, like that of many other commodities produced in Australia, is not' equal to the increase in the prices of imported articles. In support of that view, I would invite honourable members to read the reports of the Inter-State Commission, and particularly the report dealing with rents, in which it is shown that, although the prices of bricks, tiles, hardwood, and other locally-produced building commodities, have increased, the increase is nothing like as great as in the case of galvanized iron. The fruit-growers and jam-manufacturers of Australia have reason to be thankful to the sugar industry of the Commonwealth. If we had had to depend upon outside sources for our supplies, then householders, instead of having to pay 3s. 6d. per dozen pounds for sugar, as they do today, would probably have to pay the prices that have been ruling in Great Britain and the United States of America during the war.",60
226,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,What is the price of sugar in New Zealand?,60
227,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,I understand that New Zealandis practically taking the whole of the sugar output of F i j i .,60

229,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"That is so. This Parliament, in 1901, decided for the policy of a White Australia, and in order to secure it we have to pay a duty on sugar. Jam manufacturers here, however, have obtained their sugar cheaper than manufacturers in any other part of the world.",60
230,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Onl y during the war period.,60
231,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Quite so. I think the honourable member was right in saying that the duty of 2d. per lb. on jam is of uo value to the local manufacturer. I should be prepared to impose a duty of something like ls. per lb. I do not think it would affect the price.,60
232,Mr RILEY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Would it not?,60
233,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"No . Those who import jams today import nothing but high-class preserves, such as Crosse and Blackwell's jams, and Kieller's marmalade. As a matter of fact, the duty on jam is not operative, because the ordinary Australian housewife can make all the jam she requires, and she can get her sugar cheaper than can the housewife in any other part of the world. Let me quote the exports of commodities of which sugar forms the chief constituent for the four years preceding the war as compared with the four years while the war lastedQuantity. Value.

234,Mr LECKIE,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,How much of the in creased value was due to the increase' the cost of t in plating?,61
235,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I do not think that that accounts for more than one-fourth of ticular class of work. the increase. The ordinary 2-lb. t in lemon and melon jam, one of the cheapest lines, is sold at l i d . or l l ^ d probably the cost of the t in container about 3d.",61

239,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I have heard honourable members opposite say that it is difficult to control the seasons in Australia. our friends in Tasmania occasionally have a shortage of f r u it , it is just as likely there may be at times a shortage of cane production in Queensland. At any rate, I understand that there is a greater acreage under cane in Queensland today than there has ever been before. The remark that land is going out of cultivation, which we have heard applied to other farming operations, does not hold good in regard to sugar cane. According to the price-lists in the daily press, the sugar-cane farmers have not secured that huge increase in their returns that some other farmers in Exports, Exports, Australia have been fortunate enough to 1910-1918. 1914-1918. get.

As there is no export of sugar, the primary producer of Australia in will get the whole of the benefit of the of the extension asked for.'",61

Sugar is harvested during the next few months, and the season will terminate towards the end of. the year. If this Bill is not extended If the growers in future will not be sure of the destination of the cane they may plant or of the price they will get for their product. Honourable members will simply be saying to these people, "" You are all I moveright u n t il the end of September, 1920. and after that you can fish for yourselves. We shall endeavour to fix the price to ""thirty."" ' the end of September, 1920, but after This that we throw you to the wolves.""

I said on the second Teading that a the Government were selling the people a gold brick, inasmuch as they pretended that they had full powers to deal with flax, wool, wheat, butter, cheese, and sugar, but no power to deal with any other ' commodity. Evidently it is not the in - tention of the Government now, or at any ' f u t u re date, to deal with any commodities 31- other than those covered by the Bill . If 14 the Government believe that it is good to extend these controls, why do they extend 17 them only u n t i l next year? That is the test of their sincerity. The contracts AYES. which have been mentioned do not apply to flax.' If the pooling system will help the new flax industry in Australia, it should be giveu a reasonable chance to operate. What is the good of this Parliament attempting to help an industry if on the 31st December, 1920, the whole of. the assistance ceases ? A r e the men who put their capital into the industry to be lef t utterly dependent on themselves after having been sold a gold brick by the Government? The Government tell the potential flax-growers of Australia . that they will give them certain assistance, supply them with seed under ""cerNOES. tain conditions, guard their interests, and pass'a Bill dealing with the subject;-but after the men have sunk their capital in the industry, they are to be told that withi» a certain period they must do the best they can for themselves.

It is my intention to move an amendment but, in doing so-, I have no desire-sinc e the case is sub judice-It o discuss the merits of the pending litigation between the Commonwealth Government and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company. I wish to keep out of this debate any question whether-the Commonwealth is entitled to £280,000, for which it is suing, or whether .the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company is justified in its refusal to pay that sum. The Commonwealth Government NOES. entered into an agreement with the Riley, E. Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company and with Messrs. S. W . Whiddon and Company, in March, 1917, under which the Commonwealth Government were to receive 50 per cent, of the profits made by those companies as the Watkins, D. result of carrying on the wool-top making industry.",63
249,Mr RODGERS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"If the company were engaged in legitimate trade, why should it agree tohand over a percentage of its profits ?",63
250,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I shall deal with that later. The amendment which I shall presently move will , of course, enable the Auditor-General to inspect the books, vouchers,' accounts, and documents of those companies.",63
251,Mr JOWETT,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Is that not done now 1,63
252,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"No . That is the reason for my proposed amendment. - I have Mr GROOM - The books of those companies are audited by an auditor who is nominated by the Government. MT . HIGGS - That is not so. The auditor was appointed by Sir John M . Higgins, as Chairman of the Central Wool Committee: Sir John Higgins was asked by the then Commonwealth Treasurer (the late Lord Porrest), and by the Auditor-General himself, to permit the latter to examine the accounts of those companies. But Sir John Higgins said, - I "" No ! I do not think that would be as sound an arrangement as the one at present in operation."" He made a most extraordinary statement as to the reason why he would not accept the services of the Auditor-General. He stated, that the members of the Central Wool Committee, being technical men, were in a better position to decide on matters connected with that business than the Auditor-General. There was no reason why the Auditor General should riot have had the assistance of the members of the Central Wool Committee, if he or his officers so desired, in deciding any matter connected with those agreements. But, as I have stated in this House before, Sir John Higgins is a would be Czar; he was able to defy both Lord Forrest and the Auditor-General.. Far from carrying out his desire expressed to me in a letter, namely, that the Central Wool Committee courted the strictest investigation into all these matters, Sir John Higgins appears to have taken up the position of one who finding .that he has been outwitted by a man as clever as himself, is unwilling to allow the Auditor-General to inspect those accounts for the reason that it would' show the extent to which he had been caught napping as Chairman of the Central Wool Committee. Some days ago the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) read an affidavit by Mr Mackenzie, who was the voluntary liquidator of F. W. Hughes Limited. I have previously stated in this chamber that that firm had gone into liquidation in order to break certain contracts entered into with Japan. In making that statement, I should have said it was rumoured at the time that that was the reason.",63
253,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,You should not repeat a rumour of that kind unless there were some reasonable ground upon which you believed it to be true ,64
254,Mr HIGOS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The honourable member is quite right; and I shall give the reason for my assumption. His homily affords me an opportunity of saying that I will support my impression by documentary evidence. The firm of F. W. Hughes Limited was originally a woolscouring fellmongering company. Then it occurred to Mr F. W. Hughes that it would be a good idea to manufacture wool tops. He' issued a. prospectus to - the.general public headed "" The development of industries in Australia- a bonus of £50,000."" That was the bounty which he had induced members of the Federal Parliament to grant his oompany by saying that he was going to' establish an industry which would give a great deal of employment to skilled labour. I am speaking of matters which occurred in or about 1908. Members of this Parliament, anxious to establish a local industry, granted him a bounty. He was not satisfied, however. After enjoying the bounty for some five years he approached the Inter-State Commission with a request that the Federal Parliament should renew the bounty for an unlimited number of years and make the amount £20,000 per annum. The Inter-State Commission decided that there was no reason for granting the bounty under the circumstances; that this gentleman had deceived the Commonwealth Parliament when he had said he was going to give employment to skilled labour; that the skilled labour employed, on account of the automatic machinery installed, was very limited; that 80 per cent, of the work was done by the woolscourers and the fellmongers. However, by the use of the prospectus, in which he said the profits would be £50,000 per annum, hefloatedthe new company, F. W. Hughes Limited; and he was making wool tops, not for anybody in the British Empire, but for Japanese manufacturers, who were competing with the manufacturers of Bradford. That was one of the reasons why the. Inter-State Commission recommended to this Parliament that the bounty should no longer be paid. It was considered that the bounty enabled P. W. Hughes Limited to give an advantage to the manufacturers in Japan as against those in Britain. , The honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) has, by way of interjection, on several occasions endeavoured to show that I am not acting rightly in attacking this company. I ask him' whether he approves of Mr F. W. Hughes' action in disadvantaging the Bradford manufacturers by availing himself of Australian money to send Australian wool tops to Japan. Mr HECTO B LAMOND - Do that the Japanese manufacturers sending goods to England?",64
255,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I asked the honourable member a question. I request him to - give me ananswer, and not to ask another question. The Inter-State Commission considered that it was wrong to grant a bounty. Does the honourable member for Illawarra approve of what the Inter-State Commission said, or does he hold that we should pay the bounty ?",65
256,Mr HECTO BLAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,I want to know the facts before expressing an opinion.,65
257,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I have given the facts, and I challenge the honourable member disprove them. At the time when P. W . Hughes Limited applied, to Wilson held 3,000 shares. the Inter-State Commission for the tinuance of the bounty the f i r m was ing wool tops for Japanese manufacturers at 2s. 5d. or 2s. 6d. per lb. The company had certain contracts with Japanese not manufacturers. When war broke some of the members of the company p u their heads together and said, "" What are we going to do? "" I say that the evidence goes to show that they decided go into liquidation in order to break those contracts. The company was payLimited ing an average dividend of 6 per cent., and,there was no other reason for going into liquidation.",65
258,Mr HECTO BLAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,The honourable member is .avoiding a very important piece of evidence which was read by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd).,65
259,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"There is nothing in evidence which disproves what I am saying. The gentleman concerned states his affidavit that the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company astake sumed responsibility for all existing uncompleted, contracts entered into .by P. W . Hughes Limited, and, parwas ticularly, for certain the sale and export of wool tops to Japan. The company assumed responsibilit y for those contracts because, through the price fixed by the A r m y Contracts Committee in the Old Country, it was able to get 6s. per lb. for wool tops as against the sum of 2s. 6d. per lb. which it had been getting from Japan. you say P. W . Hughes Limited, from which were the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company was formed to assume the responsibility of the assets bf the former, was a company possessing 180,000 shares. Of these, 73,001 were paid up to f l ; 76,999 were paid up to 18s.; 19,685 were paid up to f l ; and 10,315 were paid up to .10s. per share. That is, there were 180,000 shares, with a capital of £167,152 2s. 6d. paid, or deemed to be paid. One would imagine that the new company would have a large paid-up . capital, but it got over the matter in this  shares; Mrs Diana Matilda Hughes held to 20,113 shares; Mr F . Y . Wilson held 1,600 shares; and Mrs Laura Maud These two conmarried couples held 92,341 out of mak180,000 shares, and thus had a majority of the votes. It was"" very easy for them, therefore, to say, "" We cancarry out these contracts with out Japan &t 2s. 6d. a pound; therefore we. t will go into voluntary liquidation, and will form a new company."" I can well imagine that when they put their heads, to together the y decided not to tell - the other shareholders of F . W . Hughes what a gold mine they were expecting from the Central Wool Committee through the good offices of the Hon. J . C. Watson, and the fact that Mr . P. W . Hughes was a member of the Central Wool Committee.",65
260,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Does that explain - the satisfaction of the Japanese that buyers, as set out in the affidavit?",65
261,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"They decided to form in this new company, the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, to over the assets, liabilities, and conand tracts of F . W . Hughes Limited, As stated in the affidavit, the new. company formed in 1915, and consisted of the contracts for following persons: Philip Henry Moreton, 1 share paid up to £1. . Fred. Wm.

John Christian Watson, one pound share. C. E. R. MACLean, one .pound share. Directors-F . W. Hughes and J. C. Watson: This Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, with a paid-up capital of £5,008, took over the assets, liabilities, and contracts of F . W. Hughes Limited , a company of 180,000 shares and a paid-up capital of £167,152 2s. 6d. This company, consisting of a few persons, was able to obtain contracts, as I say, through the influence of the Hon. J . 0. Watson, and with the approval of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds during the first six months, and amounting probably to millions of pounds since the 1st March, 1917. There were about four of these contracts in the first six months, and the sales were- - 1 47,550 .lbs., at 72d. .per lb. 14,265 0 0 114,120 lbs. , at 71d. per lb. 33,760 10 0 28,530 lbs., at 70d. per lb. 8,321 5 0 52,450 lbs., at 72d. per lb. 15,735 0 0 76,080 lbs., at 71d. per lb 22,586 3 4 21,470 lbs., at 70d. per lb. 6,262 1 8 480,000 Lbs., at 72d. per lb. 144,000 0 0 414,000 lbs. , at 71d. per lb. 122,741 5 0 150,000 lbs., at 70d. .per lb 43,750 0 0 355,000 lbs., at 72d. per lb 106,500 0 0 539,900 lbs. , at 71d. per lb 159,720 8 4 150,000 lbs. , ait 70d. per lb. 43,750 0 0 Total 721,391 13 4 That accounts for a total of £721,391 13s. 4d. within a period of six months. When honourable members bear in mind that the company was getting an average of 6s. per lb: for wool tops, whereas only 2s. 6d. was received before the war, they will understand what an enormous concession Sir John M . Higgins was giving to this company and S. W . W h i d don and Company under a private arrangement that was not advertised in any newspaper, and was concluded secretly.",65
262,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,What these contracts?,66
263,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Contract s with Japanese merchants and manufacturers.,66
264,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Why does honourable member say that Sir John Higgins or the H o n . J . C. Watson had anything to do with the contracts?,66
265,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"'Will the honourable member support me in a request for a Royal Commission to inquire into this whole matter to discover who was the mover in the business, and. how it was that the Central Wool Committee did not advertise publicly their intention to give such gilt-edged concessions?",66
266,Mr RILEY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,The Hon. J. C. Watson was not in the firm when the first contracts were made with Japan. He came in later. Mr HIGGiS - He came in about the time the company concluded its agreement with the Commonwealth Government.,66
267,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,The Central Wool Committee did not get a single pound's worth of contracts for F . W . Hughes.,66
268,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"J do not say that they' did, but they gave these .concessions to - £ s. d. the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company and S. W . Whiddon privately and secretly. The information had to be dragged out of them by questions put in this House. It was reluctantly given by the Chairman of the Central Wool Committee, who, while professing a desire for the strictest investigation, placed every obstacle in the way of the Auditor-General or any one else in quiring into these contracts.",66
269,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,What were the concessions ?,66
270,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"If the honourable' member is really seeking for information, I can tell him that the very great concession lies in the fact that, whereas Japan before the war was permitted to. obtain. greasy and scoured .wool from this count r y , the Central Wool Committee, while we were professing to be friendly to Japan, prevented that country from getting any wool at all unless it purchased it from Australia in the form of wool tops, and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company and S. W . Whiddon were were the only people manufacturing wool tops in Australia.",66
271,Mr JOWETT,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Is the honourable member not aware that the' whole of the wool the was sold to the Imperial Government, who were dealing with it , and so he can hardly charge the Central Wool Committee with preventing Japan from getting it?",66
272,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,The honourable member knows that Japan was prevented from getting wool from Australia.,66
273,Mr JOWETT,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Not by the Central Wool Committee. r,66

275,Mr JOWETT,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,The Director Materials.,67
276,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Who was able to operate the matter so that Japan was not given the right to get this wool whilst other countries, and amongst them even Russia, were allowed to obtain it?",67
277,Mr JOWETT,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,That was done by the Imperial Government.,67
278,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Si r John M . Higgins, in his report on the Australian wool clip for 1916-1917, presented here on the 25th July, 1917, has this to say in paragraph 22, of the reportContinuous audits are conducted under the direction of the Auditor-General's Department of all business transacted' through the Central Wool Committee and all State Committees. That statement is not accurate. He says, "" all business,"" and I contend that these agreements are a part of the business transacted through the Central Wool Committee. Now what does the Auditor General say about the .matter in his report for 1917-18? He saysOn the 1st March, 1917, agreements were entered into between the Commonwealth Government and Wihiddon Brothers Limited, of Sydney, and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited, of Sydney, respectively, under which these companies were authorized to purchase wool for the purpose of manufacturing wool tops. It was .provided that all the. books, vouchers, and documents in the possession, or under the control, of the respective companies, relating to the purchase, manufacture, or sale of the sheepskins, wool, and wool tops, referred to in the agreements, should be produced to an auditor nominated by the Commonwealth Government for that purpose,' and it was also provided that any nomination or other communication by the Commonwealth Government to the 'Committee should be deemed to be duly given if signed on behalf of the Commonwealth Government by the chairman of the Central Wool Committee. The chairman of the Central Wool Committee was Sir John M . Higgins. That is an extraordinary power to give any man. Sir John' M . Higgins, a man :responsible to no one but himself, is sign a document, .and it is then deemed to be signed by the Government of Commonwealth "" of Australia. too.absurd. Sir John M . Higgins is a very clever man. We have been told repeatedly about the work which he has believe. done for the Commonwealth ' for four years for nothing, but I venture to say of Raw that there are a thousand people in the Commonwealth who could give £10,000 to obtain a title. Sir John M . Higgins has got his title.",67
279,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,The honourable member must know that is a very unfair aspersion to cast upon Sir John M . Higgins.,67
280,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"He got his. title, anyway. I am not suggesting that he paid money for his title.",67
281,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,That is a very unfai r suggestion to make.,67
282,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,It is about as fair as the honourable gentleman's attack on the Honourable J . C. Watson and others associated with this matter.,67
283,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I am pointing out the reward that Sir John, M . Higgins got for services rendered. The Auditor-General in his report proceedsIn pursuance of this provision the Central Wool Committee and not the Government, as stated by the Attorney-Generalappointed a' Fellow of the Australasian Corporation of Public Accountants to conduct the audits. Subsequently the right honourable the Treasurer (Lord, then Sir John, Forrest) submitted his opinion that these audits should be conducted under the control of the Auditor General of the Commonwealth, and suggested that the auditor appointed by the Central Wool Committee should act under an appointment made by the Auditor-General, under the provisions bf section II . of the Audit Act-shoul d the Auditor-General be willing to make such appointment. I was quite prepared to do this, but, upon the matter coming 'under the notice of the Chairman of the Committee (Sir John M. Higgins), he declared that such an agreement would not be as satisfactory as the then procedure.",67
284,Mr GREGORY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,He had more power than the Treasurer of the. Commonwealth.,67
285,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Yes , he had more power than the Treasurer, and he told to the Treasurer and the Attorney-General that he did not think the Auditor-Geneto ral's supervision of these matters was as good as the audit of a gentleman in Sydthe ney appointed by himself-a n auditor .That is named Mr All a r d .",67
286,Mr JOWETT,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,A good man.,67
287,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Quite a good man, I",67
288,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"As good as the Auditor-General, and more experienced in commercial enterprises. Mr HIGGS t - I do not believe that ; but I say that, however good Mr Allar d might be, an ordinary clerk in his office did most of the auditing in connection with these accounts.",68
289,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,That occur under any other system of auditing. The honourable member would not expect - the Auditor-General to go into the office of the company and dothe actual work of auditing himself.,68
290,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"When the honourable member spoke of the ability aud experience of Mr Allar d as an auditor, I thought it as well to remind him that Mr Allar d did not do the whole of the word of auditing in this case. If it was work which required special capacity he should have done it himself, or should have consented to be attached to the Auditor-General's Department. Auditor-General further says in his reportUpon receiving the balance-sheets of the auditor appointed, the Treasurer (Lord Forrest) asked for further information with respect thereto, but it was pointed out by the auditor that his reports were final, and that if further information with respect to accounts was required this s'hould be obtained from the companies direct. It is evidently desirable that in any future similar agreements, or in any regulations governing the agreements under review, provision should be made for such cpntrol by the Auditor-General as would enable the Treasurer and the Auditor-General to obtain all the information that may be desired. ' The position with respect to these audits has been fairly set forth in a memorandum prepared by the Assistant Secretary to the Treasurer, and, as it agrees with my own views, it is published under Appendix D.",68
291,Mr JOWETT,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,What is the date of the document to which the honourable gentleman is referring?,68
292,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"It is the Auditor-General's report for 1917-1918, and what I have read is followed by a memorandum by the Assistant Secretary to the Treasurer, dated 8th August, 1918, which readsFrom many points of view this business is in a most indefinite and unsatisfactory position.",68
293,Mr RILEY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,What does the Government say to that ? [409],68
294,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I hope the Government will say that they have no objection to the amendment providing that the A u d i tor-General shall audit the accounts. 2. Under the agreement between the wool tops companies and the Government, the audit of the business of the wool tops companies is to be conducted by an auditor nominated by the would Commonwealth Government. Mr Allard, of Sydney, was appointed by the Central Wool Committee as the auditor, the nomination by the chairman of the Central Wool Committee being made on behalf of the Commonwealth Government (see clause 6 of the agreement). 3. Correspondence has taken place between the Auditor-General and the Treasury in regard to the business of the companies concerned. The Auditor-General states that an outside auditor-, not acting under his authority in cases where Commonwealth moneys are involved, is not approved by him. 4. Under the agreements, large sums will DC payable to the Commonwealth, and the Treasurer expresses the opinion that it is the duty of the Auditor-General to make the audits. The Treasurer also suggests that Mr Allard might be appointed by the Auditor-General to act as The his deputy. To this suggestion the chairman of the Central Wool Committee (Sir John M. Higgins) took exception",68
295,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR," The honourable member's time has expired. No other honourable member rising"",,",68
296,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Why should Sir JohnHiggins take any exception ? W h at reason can Sir John Higgins advance, after;his writing to me complaining of my> asking questions, and saying that trieCentral Wool Committee welcomed ""- theminutest and most searching analysis of the contracts,"" and that "" the more exhaustive the investigation the better the Committee would be pleased ? "" Why ; after saying that, does Sir John Higgins object to the suggestion that Mr Allar d should be attached to the staff of the Auditor-General to carry out these duties ? But he takes exception, and for reasons thus set outremarking that he did not think that the arrangements would work as satisfactorily as the present procedure, and that, in the condue) of the manufacture of wool tops many technical processes are involved, and the trained members of the Central Wool Committee should be better able and more competent to control same. He also stated that divided supervision cannot be recommended. . . . Surely the assistance of the Committee ought to be given to the Auditor-General just as readily as to Mr All a r d 14. I understand that the agreements have sow terminated, and I do not know whether ur not it is intended to have new' agreements. 1 would, however, suggest that, in""the event of fresh agreements being entered into, the Auditor-General should have some voice in settling the important questions of principle involved. That is my case with regard to. the. first portion of my amendment, and I move That the following sub-clause.be added:"" (4.) Notwithstanding anything appearing to the contrary in .any Act or regulation or agreement, all books,, vouchers, and documents in the possession or under the control of the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited, and Whiddon Brothers Limited, aud . relating to the purchase, manufacture, and/or sale of the sheepskins, wool, and wool tops referred to in any agreement made or to be made with the said companies by or on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, shall be produced to the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth, who shall inspect, audit and examine such books, vouchers, and documents; and shall from time to time prepare and sign a report for submission through the Treasurer to both Houses of the Parliament. And the said companies shall facilitate in every way the checking by the said Auditor-General by a continuous audit of all calculations made by the said companies in ascertaining the net earnings of the companies for the purposes of any agreement. It shall be the duty of the Auditor-General to decide what amounts should be credited and debited in order to ascertain the net earnings of the companies, and his decision shall be final and binding on both parties. The Auditor-General may disallow any items, and such items shall be omitted from the accounts. The Auditor General may by writing under his hand appoint any person to exercise such powers and perform such duties of the Auditor General under-this Act as he thinks fit.'There is a second paragraph, but it deals with another matter, and as my time is exhausted, and I cannot move another amendment, I shall ask another honora.ble member to move it separately.",68
297,Mr WEST,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"East Sydney) [ 9 . 3 8 ] - I think the Government ought to make quite clear to the Committee what are their grounds of opposition to the amend the books. ment, for it is one to which I think honourable members will be inclined to agree. I take it that the object of the amendas ment is - to obtain information for Parthese liament, and likewise to insure business is under the supervision .of persons occupying responsible positions. However able those other .gentlemen mentioned may be as auditors, there may be a tendency, if they, represent any public companies, to refrain from giving utterance to opinions that might be very usef u l from a public point of view. Surely the Government have every confidence in the. Auditor-General. I am sure the public would be better satisfied if this business were in the hands qf some .public official, responsible to Parliament and the Government.",69
298,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways and .Acting Attorney-General) [ 9 . 4 0 ] - I ask the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) not to press the amendment. The subject-matter is embodied in existing agreements; . that is to say, contracts have been made, two of whioh are now current, one with Whiddon Brothers Limited and the other with the Yarra Falls Company. I have not got copies of those contracts here, but I am informed that there is the same arrangement for the auditing by Mr All a r d , who is admitted to be a proper person for the work, in the contract of Whiddon Brothers Limited . I am also informed that on 'a previous occasion the Treasurer, in a letter, agreed to concur in the appointment of Mr Allard if no objection were raised. That was on the ""25th A p r i l , 1918. Mr Yeo, the accountant appointed in the Yarra Palls Company's contract, is, I understand, an official of the Auditor-General's Department, who has been loaned to the Wool Committee, so that he is really a publio servant. As these matters are subjects of contract it would hardly be just for us to override the arrangements made. This Committee has not much longer to run , seeing that it is. only necessary to cover the season's clip after the cessation of hostilities.",69
299,Mr RILEV,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Mr F . W . Hughes would not object to the Government auditing,69
300,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I am not dealing with that point now, but merely urging that contracts have been entered into with two firms, it would not be .just to that this practically override them.",69
301,Mr FENTON,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,What objection have the Wool Committee or Sir John Higgins to the strictest investigation by the Auditor General ?,70
302,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The honourable member is on another point. At-the present time the whole of the Wool accounts are audited by the Auditor General. That is quite a different thing. The honourable member for Capricornia seeks power to have an audit by the Auditor-General of the accounts of cer""tain firms which have made certain contracts with the Central Wool Committee.",70
303,Mr HIGQS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,A : money is involved.,70
304,Mr FENTON,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,The . Treasury Department made certain protests on. the subject.,70
305,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,The honourable member for Capricornia desires his amendment to cover contracts which contain a clause providing for an audit.,70
306,Mr RILEY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"As the companies and the Government share the profits, the Government should have the power to conduct an audit by their own officers.",70
307,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"That is correct, but the contracts made, with Whiddon Brothers and the Yarra Falls Company contain provision for an audit. The amendment practically seeks to override those contracts, but we intend to abide by them.",70
308,Mr GREGORY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Dampier) [ 9 . 4 8 ] hope that the Committee will insist upon the amendment proposed'by the honourable member for Capricornia. A contract has been made between the Central Wool Committee and certain manufacturers of wool tops, and the Acting Attorney; General has forgotten to tell the Committee that the Commonwealth is a partner in. the operations of those firms.",70
309,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,I thought the Committee were quite aware of that fact.,70
310,Mr GREGORY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"That is an important point, and the Committee should see that Parliament and the community are protected. In his last report the Auditor General asked that his officers should have special powers to audit the transactions under this agreement. The late Lord Forrest, when Treasurer, demanded that the Auditor-General's staff should be employed to audit the accounts of these companies, but apparently the chairman of the Central Wool Committee has more 1 - power than the Auditor-General, backed by the Commonwealth Treasurer. Before bhis Bill leaves our hands, we ought to in Committee's sert the provision that the accounts of every Pool shall be subject to audit by the Auditor-General.",70
311,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Thes e accounts .generally are audited by the Auditor-General.,70
312,Mr GREGORY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Why not insert in the Bill a definite provision to that effect?,70
313,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,There has been a conlot of Government tinuous audit in connection with the Wool Pool.,70
314,Mr GREGORY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Then why was a protest made by the Auditor-General and the late Lord Porrest?,70
315,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The Auditor-General stated that Lord Forrest demanded a certain inquiry, and was refused. Mr . HECTOB LAMOND - The Treasurer is in a position to demand the fullest particulars of these transactions.",70
316,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"He is not, because Sir John Higgins is the czar.",70
317,Mr GREGORY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The agreement made with Whiddon Brothers providesIf the earnings of the company in any accounting period during the continuance of the agreement shall become taxable under any special taxation imposed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth on profits earned in war time, then the Commonwealth Government shall refund 'to the company''an amount equal - I to one-half of the war-timeprofits tax which shall be payable or shall have been paid by the company in respect of such accounting period, and if in any accounting period the amount so to be refunded, when added to the amount retained by the company (after pay-> ment of the war-time profits tax), makes a sum less than one-third of the total net earnings for that period, then the Commonwealth Government will also refund to the company sueh further amount as shall be sufficient to make the total sum to be retained by the company equal to one-third of the total net earnings for the period. So that, no matter what legislation this Parliament may have passed in regard to war-tjime profits taxation, the Commonwealth Government must, under this agreement, refund to the company a sum sufficient to insure that certain profits are made by it .",70
318,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,That matter is the subject of litigation at the present time.,70
319,Mr GREGORY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I am showing the Committee the sort of agreement that was made hy the chairman of the Central Wool Committee, who puts himself above this Parliament. Now he wishes to carry on without the Auditor General having power to examine the books and documents of the Wool Committee. I hope that the Government will insert a. clause to provide that the accounts of all the Pools shall he audited by the staff of the Auditor-General.",71
320,Mr ARCHIBALD,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Hindmarsh) [9.54]. - The Committee should act carefully in this matter. These various Committees were appointed during a time of war, following the precedent of the Old Country, where a patriotic appeal was made to the merchant princes to give their services for the benefit of the country. They did that; I do not say that they did not make money at the same time. The principle has always been recognised by this Parliament that we ought not to pass legislation of a Paul Pry character. We have no right to probe into the private business affairs of any person or company. The Auditor-General is appointed to supervise the expenditure of the various public Departments, because the money for them , is voted by Parliament, which is entitled to a guarantee that the votes are expended in a regular manner. If the amendment is agreed to, we shall give to somebody a right to pry into .people's private affairs. I know the chief purpose of the amendment is to give power to inquire into the affairs of F. W. Hughes and Company. The operations in connection with the manufacture of wool tops are of so technical a character that fewv-persons are able to understand them, but there is a general impression abroad that however much the Government may have gained by that mixed-up transaction, Hughes and Company have certainly not lost. But assuming, for the sake of argument, that the Commonwealth has made a loss on that contract, it is better that we should bear that loss than that we should depart from the principle of not prying into people's private affairs. If there has been amy scandal in connection with this or any other transaction, Parliament can order a judicial inquiry by a properly constituted Commission. I shall support the Government in; resisting the amendment. We must be careful not to trench upon the principle of individual freedom unless we are confident that it is necessary to do so in the public interests. We have gone far enough im> that direction, and we should cry a halt. Under the pretence of doing something in the interests of the people we ought not to claim the right to poke our noses into the private affairs of any company or individual.. Certain powers of inquiry are given to the Government in connection with the collection of revenue, but all such investigations are governed by a pledge of. secrecy. There is to be no secrecy about the inquiry proposed by the amendment; anything disclosed by the audit may be published throughout the country.",71
321,Mr RILEY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,The audit is to be by a Government officer.,71
322,Mr LAIKD SMITH,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Unde r the existing law the Auditor-General can make an investigation into any transaction in which Government money is involved.,71
323,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,That is not so.,71
324,Mr ARCHIBALD,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The amendment seems to be aimed principally at the contract made by the Commonwealth Government with F. W. Hughes Limited, and I think that it is far better that we should adhere to the old principle of not probing into private affairs than that we should sanction any inquisitorial departure such as the amendment proposes.",71
325,Mr MCWIXLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Franklin) [10.0]. - I regret that this amendment has been framed to deal with one individual case, but I should certainly support it if it would bring the whole of the transactions of these Pools under the supervision of the Auditor-General. This is not a proposal to pry into the business of private individuals. Having regard to what is appearing in the daily press relative to the operations of the Wheat Pool in New South Wales, and to rumours on every hand as to the Metal Exchange, will any one say that it is unreasonable to urge that the accounts of .all these Pools should be subject to the scrutiny of the Auditor General? What abjection can there be to the Auditor-General dealing with them just as he deals with every item of departmental expenditure? Under war conditions much has been done, not only by Governments in Australia, but in Great Britain, the United States of America, and, on the Continent, which, in ordinary circumstances, would not have been sanctioned by any Parliament. For the successful prosecution of the war it was necessary that the Government should be given power under the War Precautions Act to engage in various operations, and members of Parliament on every hand jettisoned tlieir tenets of political economy to sanction much which they would not otherwise have permitted. Under this system there have grown up in Australia a number of Trusts, Pools, and Combines, with which this Parliament will have to deal in the near future. The whole of the transactions of the Pools which have been created by the Government should be subject to the scrutiny of the Auditor-General. In the Auditor General we have one of the most trustworthy public servants in the Commonwealth, and I do not know why these Pools should object to their accounts being scrutinized iby him.",71
326,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,What Pool is objecting to a Commonwealth audit? Mr MoWILLIAMS - I am informed that the Wool Pool objects.,72
327,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,I am informed by officers that the 'accounts of both the Central Wool Committee and the State Wool Committees are subject to a continuous audit by the Commonwealth Auditor General.,72
328,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,What about the conofficers tracts ?,72
329,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,That is another matter.,72
330,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The contracts audit. entered into by these people should also be open to examination by the Auditor General. Is it not in the interest of Pools themselves, and the good name Australia, that they should amined ?",72
331,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,I am advised that in the particular case covered'by. this' amenda ment the contract itself makes provision for an audit in respect of both Whiddon Brothers Limited and the Yarra Falls Company.,72
332,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,I do not believe in legislating to deal with individual cases.,72
333,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"But this amendment, if passed, will affect the two contracts which have been entered into, .and in which provision is made for an audit.",72
334,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"It would be a good thing if all contracts made by the Pools were subject to examination by the Auditor-General. I do not approve of this amendment, since I think it unwise to pass laws dealing with individual cases, but I should like the Minister to frame a clause bringing under the supervision of the Auditor-General the accounts of all the Pools created by the Government, as well as all the contracts made by them. That would be a wise precaution to take. I do not think any of the Pools would object to such a provision as long as it was general in its application.",72
335,Mr JOWETT,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"If the Defence Department entered into a contract - with a woollen manufacturer for the supply of 10,000 yards of flannel, would the honourable member say that the Auditor-General should have power to examine the accounts of that manufacturer?",72
336,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Not at all. All that I suggest is that where any of the Pools created by the Government enter the into a contract either to buy or to sell, that contract,*as well as the whole of the accounts, should be subjected to the supervision of the Auditor-General.",72
337,Mr JOWETT,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,That is already done.,72
338,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,I am informed by the that the accounts of both the Central Wool Committee and the State Wool Committees are subject to a continuous,72
339,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,But not the contracts.,72
340,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,The honourable member the was referring to' the accounts of these of Pools. The accounts of the Butter Pool be so exhave also to be audited.,72
341,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,I am aware that in the case of some of the Pools there is special provision that their contracts shall be subject to examination by the Auditor-General. Can the Minister tell me now that the same provision applies to the Metal Exchange?,72
342,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,That is on an entirely different basis.,73
343,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Unles s we have some provision that the whole of the contracts and pools shall be subject to the examination of the Auditor-General, we shall wake up to find that abuses have crept in, and that great scandals have occurred.",73
344,Mr YATES,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Adelaide) [10.11] - We are indebted to the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) for putting forward this amendment. Asthe honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) has pointed out, the Government are financially interested in these concerns. Seeing that the taxpayers' money is, involved, surely there can be no objection on the part of the Government to the amendment - I heard the honourable member for Capricornia pointing out .that it was the desire of the Auditor-General to audit the accounts of the transactions in regard to wool tops, but honourable members did not seem to understand this clearly. Auditor-General, whose reports ought to be our guide in financial matters, has furnished a report 'upon this matter. If we are not to take notice of his reports, he might just as well be out of existence, and the cost of printing the reports avoided. On page 229 of the Treasurer's Statement of Receipts and Expenditure during the year ended 30th June, 1918, the Auditor-General saysMANUFACTURE OF WOOL TOPS - AUDIT OF 64. On the 1st-March, 1917, agreements were entered into between the Commonwealth Government and Whiddon Brothers Limited, Sydney, and the Colonial Combing, Spinning and Weaving Company Limited, of Sydney, respectively, under which these companies were authorized to purchase wool for the purpose of manufacturing wool tops. It was provided that all the books, vouchers, and documents in the possession or under the control of the respective companies relating to the purchase, manufacture or sale of the - sheepskins, wool, and wool tops referred to in the agreements should be produced to an auditor nominated by the Commonwealth Government for that purpose; and . it was also provided that any nomination or other communication by the Commonwealth Government to the companies should be deemed to be duly given if signed on behalf of the Commonwealth Government by the chairman of the Central Wool Committee. In pursuance of this provision, the Central Wool Committee appointed a Fellow of the Australasian Corporation of Public Accountants to conduct the audits. Subsequently the Right Honourable the Treasurer submitted his opinion that these audits should be conducted under the control of the Auditor-General for the Commonwealth, and suggested that the auditor appointed by the Central Wool Committee should act under an appointment made by the Auditor-General-unde r the provisions of section 11 of the Audit Act-shoul d the Auditor-General be willing to make such appointment. I was quite prepared to do this; but upon the matter coming under the notice of the chairman of the Committee, he declared that such an arrangement would not be as satisfactory as the then procedure. Upon receiving the balance-sheets of the auditor appointed, the Treasurer asked for further information with respect thereto, but it was pointed out by the auditor that his reports were final, and that if further information with respect to accounts was required, this should be obtained from the companies direct.",73
345,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Who appointed that auditor?,73
346,Mr YATES,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The Central Wool ComThe mittee; but when the Treasurer of the day (Lord Porrest) asked for further information, like the man playing cricket, the umpire gave him "" out""; and he was out. He was told that the report submitted was final, and that if he required further information he must seek it from the company. Although the Commonwealth Government are partners in the matter, they can go a certain distance, but no further. They are up against a stone wall. It seems to me that some further ACCOUNTS. supervision is required in regard to-the wool tops contracts. The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley), who is interested in the industry because it isestablished in his electorate, and the honourable member for Capricornia, who has a close knowledge of it, are quite satisfied that some control other than that which we have now should be established over it. We shall not be doing our duty to the 'taxpayers if we do not properly safeguard the Commonwealth activities which have been called into operation during the war. I am aware, from a telegram I have received, that the contributors to the Wool Pool are very well satisfied with the managenient of the Pool;, but this matter of wool tops manufacture is a transaction in which the Commonwealth Government are associated with people who are making fair l y substantial profits. The honourable member for Capricornia, backed up by the honourable member for Dampier in very temperate but convincing language, has made out a good case for the Commonwealth Government exercising more control over these contracts, and if we are to do our duty to the taxpayers, we. should agree to the amendment.",73
347,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Illawarra ) [10.18] - The proposition of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) is not as innocent as it might appear to be on the face of it. Whether the Wool Committee was right or wrong in making the agreement with these wool-top manufacturers, and in inserting in it certain provisions for auditing, Parliament would be entirely wrong, the - agreement having been made,' in legislating with the object of breaking it . It is singular that from the time when the Hon. J. C Watson became a member of the board of directors of this company it has been subjected to a constant and relentless fire from the' Opposition in this chamber. Time after time the most serious charges have been made against the persons responsible for the management of the comagreement? pany, only to be refuted in the most solemn way a few days afterwards, and then to be followed by equally grave charges, equally unfounded. had another instance of this to-night. The honourable member for few days ago came down with a statement regarding the reasons for the comcontract? pany being reformed. He was met by the sworn affidavit of the oflicial liquidathe tor of the company, which refuted his statement at every point. To-night he comes along with an explanation of the rumours and circumstances that created in his mind the belief that this thing been done. When he is challenged read the affidavit, he reads a couple of portions of it , and omits any reference to the fact that these contracts have been full y performed to the satisfaction Japanese firms concerned. seen the original letters from those firms in Japan, expressing the utmost satisfaction with the. way in which the contracts have been carried out; yet the honourable member would have us believe that people who had to pay more than twice as much for their wool are still satisfied to deal with the person who worked that swindle on them - I know nothing of the circumstances beyond what is in the affidavit, and I know little about the internal management of P. W. Hughes L t d . But what I reseut about the whole business-and in this I am in accord with the objection to some of the methods .of the chairman of the Central Wool Committee-is that the firm has been singled out for treatment that has not been attempted towards any other firm in the Commonwealth. I am not here to j u s t if y the profits made by this concern; but if the Government are prepared to take the profits made by the firm during war time, because they are excessive, their duty is"" to take the profits of every other firm in the Commonwealth made in similar circumstances. They have no right to do to this firm anything they are not prepared to do to others.",74
348,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Do not the Government get half the profits under the,74
349,Mr HECTORLAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Yes ; they have taken half the profits. From what other industry in the country have they We have taken so much? Why are they entitled to take half the profits of this firm, and Capricornia a not of any other?",74
350,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,-Is - not that part of the ,74
351,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"r-Yes; but contract was forced upon them by the refusal of the Central Wool .Committee to allow them to carry on their business unless they agreed to it . Here is an i m portant part, that must not be forgotten. had Early in the development of this matter to . the carcass butchers of Sydney sent over to the Wool - Committee a special legal representative to argue for them against the first contract. In the course of his of the statement to the Committee, he said I have and this is interesting to the Labour members who have been supporting the persecution of this firm-that ment was most unfair, because it placed P. W. Hughes L t d . in a position to go into the market, purchase stock, and then sell the carcasses in the markets at rates which made it impossible for the carcass butchers to compete with it . he had beeu assured by people in Melbourne and Sydney that the effect of these operations in the market by F . W . Hughes L t d . was to bring down the price of meat to a level at which the firm's competitors could not continue to compete with it .",74
352,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,The effect ivas exactly the opposite here.,75
353,Mr HECTOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,LAMOND - That is a statement of the paid legal representative of the carcass butchers.,75
354,Mr TDDOH,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"I have the word of Reynolds, one of the leading wholesale butchers in Melbourne, that, through F . W. 'Hughes L t d . coming to Melbourne to buy, the price of mutton was raised at least I d . per lb. to the consumers in V i c -, toria.",75
355,Mr HECTORLAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,We can make our choice between the two statements. I prefer to believe that of the gentleman who was paid high fees to' come over here and put the case of the carcass butchers to Sir John Higgins.,75
356,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"W j h at did F. W. Hughes L t d . buy here? ' Mr HECTORLAMOND - Stock. That is the whole cause of the trouble, in this House and outside, in regard to F . W. Hughes L t d . This is an Australian industry. That is why I am interested in it . I have no other interest in the concern. I did not know Mr Hughes until these matters came up, and I have no interest in his enterprise, except that it is an Australian attempt to establish an industry which ought to be established here. If I had my way, not one pound of wool would go out of this country until it was manufactured at least into tops. But what sort of encouragement has this mail received to pioneer the industry? honourable member for Wakefield (Mr . Richard Foster) suggests, that he has made a fair amount of money. the agree- Mr RICHARD FOSTER - A fair amount, do you call it? What about all these' accusations of profiteering?",75
357,Mr HECTORLAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"From whom has he made the money? The honourable member for Capricornia talks He said about furnishing the Japanese with a means of meeting British competition. He must be very hard up for arguments when he comes to an intelligent Parliament with such a story, even with his carefully phrased sentence, which creates the impression that the Japanese are going into the English market, and beating the English manufacturers there. What the Central Wool Committee has done for the British manufacturer has been by refusing this company the right to export its wool tops to Japan at a critical time, to force the Japanese manu- facturers to put spinning machinery into their factories, and today the work that was previously done by Australians in Australia is being done in Japan by the cheap labour of Japan, with the support of the honourable member for Capricornia.",75
358,Mr RILEY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Quite true. The Wool Committee has been a great friend, of Japan. i",75
359,Mr HECTORLAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The. Japanese are now attempting to develop the manufacture, not only of wool, but of many other things. The profits made by Mr F. AV. Hughes have been made out of the Japanese, who have been prepared to pay him highly for the work which he employed our people to do. Ls that such a crime that this industry should be singled out for this special treatment, because the company sells to another nation, and brings into this country money from abroad ? If that is the treatment which industries are to get which are living, not upon us, but upon other countries, and bringing money from other countries to be spent here, I do not wonder that w.e hear of Australian workers being unemployed, who ought t.o be engaged in developing our in dustries. So far as I can understand it , the "" head and front "" of I admit, as the the offending of this firm is that it saw a way of avoiding some of the processes in the manufacture of tops from wool, and, in doing so, came into conflict with some of the big parasitical interests of this country. The man who takes the skins WalesJ and sells them, and obtains a commission for doing so, was cut out under Mr. W. 'Hughes' scheme. Mr Hughes wanted to go direct to the carcass butchers and the firms who killed stock, obtain the older. skins from them, fake them direct to factory, and convert the wool into wool tops.. He was able to do that for some time; but suddenly some of the brokers, on. who are. so strongly represented on Wool Committee, discovered that were not getting a commission on the sales of sheepskins. They set themselves, as they were entitled to do, to devise ways to prevent Mr Hughes from getting the skins, and succeeded' in forming combination that prevented him getting skins without paying comniission to Mr Hughes, however, is a man of somo resource, as those who met him on the Wool Gommittee know, and he set himCommittee; self to keep his business if he could. formed a company, and went into the market as a purchaser of live stock.",75
360,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,He heat the Wool Committee and the whole lot of them.,76
361,Mr TUDOR,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,This business goes back some years before the Wool Committee. Mr Hughes used to kill stock before ever there was a Wool Committee in this country.,76
362,Mr HECTOE LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,Who said conduct he did not? If the honourable member would listen he would not make such terjections. .,76
363,Mr EICHABD FOSTEB,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The interjecstock market tion of the honourable member for Yarra was very relevant to your statement. - Mr HECTOE LAMOND - So far as I can see, it is no more relevant than that of the honourable member now interjecting. I have not said anything as about the Central Wool Committee. The position of the industry was that it established in the manner I have described; and it met with the opposition which I have indicated. Thus it forced into the market to buy stock, as the honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Tudor) tells us that an interested butcher of tyranny. in Victoria told him something different, I beg leave to remind honourable members that Victoria is not Australia. [4101 M-r. TUDOB - Neithe r is New South Mr HECTOR LAMOND, - New ' F. South Wales is rapidly becoming a mere suburbof Victoria; but we shall alter that before this Parliament is very much Mr Hughes established his in his dustry in the manner I have described, and he operated in the markets of Sydney and Melbourne, and got his skins, and so Then the war broke out and the the Central Wool .Committee was formed. they The first document which I saw in connection with that Committee is most interesting. It had to do with the occasion when a representative of the carcass butchers came to Melbourne to object a to the agreement then existing. In the interview between that representative and them. Sir John Higgins, as Chairman of the Committee, the latter laid down the principles which he held should guide' the and he defended that first He agreement to the last ditch. That is to say, he defended the agreement against the carcass butchers and in favour of the wool-tops people. Then came a sudden reversion. Mr Hughes must have offended somebody, and we all know that to offend persons, having autocratic powers sometimes costs one a great deal of money. Thereafter followed the decision that Mr Hughes would have to his business in an entirely difr ferent manner from that which had been in his custom! He would not he allowed to derive any advantage from going into the  cluded from sending his skins away? Every one else in the community was.",76
364,Mr EILEY,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,No .,76
365,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"The honyet orable member is right and wrong. The position which, the honourable member for  which has been voiced already today. Undoubtedly, they did close up the woolwas scourers in the country, and I have seen and no justification for that.",76
366,Mr LYNCH,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,It ' was a monstrous act,76
367,Mr HEOTOR LAMOND,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"That was so; and' I voiced my objection to such a proceeding,- and, indeed, in regard to similar activities of all the Committees. We have certain powers because of the war; hut the exercise of those powers should have heen confined to the objects of the war. These Committees have no right to impose their will on any industry. As the hour is'late, I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. EXPEDITION OF BUSINESS.",76
368,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"Darling Downs-^Minister for Works and Railways and Acting Attorney-General) [10.37] - I move That the House do now adjourn. I ask honourable members to assist me in expediting the passage of the measure which has just been discussed. A good deal of latitude has been permitted today to enable honourable members to express themselves on the general principles involved, and I think I am now entitled to ask that they shall restrict their further remarks as far as possible so that the Bill may be passed tomorrow.",77
369,Mr HIGGS,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,You have no other business.,77
370,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTION OF ARTHUR,"There are important Bills waiting. There is one dealing with the moratorium, and another relating to science and industry; and there are still others which are quite ready to he submitted. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.30 p.m.",77
