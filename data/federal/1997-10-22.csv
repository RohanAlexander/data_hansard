1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA AMENDMENT .BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Vaile, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
2,Mr VAILE,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959, the Civil Aviation Act 1988, and other aviationrelated legislation. The amendments to the Carriers' Liability Act and the Civil Aviation Act mainly relate to the Commonwealth's initiative in introducing a national scheme requiring air carriers to carry mandatory nonvoidable passenger liability insurance. This requirement means that, in the event of an air accident, passengers, or their relatives, are assured as far as possible of receivments ing compensation to the amount of $500,000 per passenger for their death or injury. The Commonwealth requirements are reflected in complementary state legislation, so that a mandatory passenger liability insurance scheme will operate nationally to cover all commercial flights in Australia. Uniform application of state legislation will not come into effect until these Commonwealth amendments are enacted. The principal amendments proposed to the two acts are of a minor nature and are intended to make the administration of the national scheme simpler, and thereby ensure the full and effective implementation of the Commonwealth's initiative. The amendments to the Carriers' Liability Act will authorise the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA, to directly administer both the Commonwealth Carriers' Liability Act and the complementary state legislation, rather than under delegation from the Commonwealth and state ministers responsible for transport. This will clarify the position on State-Commonwealth delegation of powers, and powers of enforcement. In addition, to assist the Civil Aviation Safety Authority further with the enforcement of the national requirements, offences under the state acts must be regarded as Commonwealth offences. To this end, the Carriers' Liability Act will also be amended to enable Commonwealth authorities to investigate and prosecute offences under the state acts as if they were Commonwealth offences. A further minor amendment to the Carriers' Liability Act will allow Australian governments to self-insure their risks under the act, instead of requiring them to take out commercial insurance. At this stage, Commonwealth and state government agencies are required to insure any passengers that they occasionally carry for reward, in accordance with the Carriers' Liability Act requirements. However, it is not the practice of Australian governments to carry commercial insurance. The bill therefore provides that, where both carrier and insurer are the Crown, the carrier need not have a stipulated contract of insurance to satisfy the technical requirements of the act, but must still satisfy CAS A that the arrangeit puts in place for coverage of passengers satisfies those requirements of the act. The amendments to the Carriers' Liability Act and the Civil Aviation Act will also impose conditions upon air operators' certificates, AOCs, which will require that operators continuously hold the mandatory passenger liability insurance required by the Carriers' Liability Act. Therefore, these amendments will give CASA the authority under legislation to more effectively prevent an operator carrying passengers without the mandatory insurance. CASA will be empowered to cancel, suspend or vary an AOC where an operator allows that insurance to lapse, but continues to carry passengers. The bill also makes a number of minor corrections to other aviation related legislation. The 'corrections, of a formal or typographical nature, in the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Act 1995 have retrospective effect, in order to ensure that they have effect from the original date of commencement of the provisions being corrected. The retrospective repeal of certain amendments in the Civil Aviation Act 1988 is purely to remove them, as they are no longer necessary. The corrections and the repeal have no effect on the rights, duties and obligations of any person. The prindpal amendments in this bill will ensure effective protection of an aviation consumer's entitlement to adequate compensation in the event of an air accident, anywhere in Australia. This will fully implement the original intention of the Commonwealth's initiative, in reforming this aspect of consumer protection in the aviation sector. I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Bruce Scott, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
3,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, Australia owes a significant debt to the men and women who have served in defence of Australia. The purpose of this bill is to protect and preserve one of their long standing compensatory benefits, a subsidised housing loan under the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. This government has been very pleased with the reduction in interest rates. This is continuing good news for the economy in general. However, the reduction in the market rates for housing loans has significantly reduced the value of the beneficial interest rates that have traditionally been available to borrowers under the defence service home loan scheme. This bill introduces a guaranteed minimum subsidy that will ensure defence service home borrowers retain an interest rate advantage of at least 1.5 per cent lower than the benchmark rate, regardless of future changes in the market interest rates. These changes will take effect from 5 January 1998. The benchmark rate is the average unregulated standard annual rate of interest applied to the largest number of owner occupied housing loans provided by the five largest banking group providers of housing finance in Australia. This guaranteed minimum subsidy provides a simple means for responding to and accommodating future fluctuations in interest rates. This bill also introduces a single rate of interest for those many borrowers whose loans may comprise two or even three different rates linked to different levels of borrowings. Each of these multi-tiered loan rates will be collapsed into a single interest rate. The effective new interest rate will depend on the current mix of interest rates on a particular loan. This arrangement will benefit many borrowers and means the abolition of the 10 per cent interest rate which has been an issue of some concern to the veteran community. Until now they have been prevented from repaying their 10 per cent tier faster than the lower tiers. Its introduction is part of this government's continuing commitment to providing and improving justly deserved compensation measures to the veterans and war widows of our nation. Continuing this rationalisation of the defence service home interest rates, this bill will reduce the interest rate on additional advances and on advances made for essential repairs. In reducing the interest rate on these advances, the government completes its reform of these rates which it began during the 1996-97 budget when a lower interest rate was introduced for certain new additional advances. All advances will now have an interest rate of 6.85 per cent or less. The defence service home scheme is administered jointly by the Commonwealth and the Westpac Banking Corporation. The administrative arrangements are set by agreement between the Commonwealth and Westpac. Following any legislative change some consequent amendments need to be made to the agreement. In addition to those implementing lower interest rates, these amendments will reflect changes in business and banking practice since the original agreement in 1988 and the need to simplify administrative procedures. In conclusion, this bill once again demonstrates the determination of this government to preserve and protect the benefits of veterans and their families. The bill not only benefits many people by direct interest reductions, but the guaranteed minimum subsidy provides an important, continuing protection of the benefits under the defence service home scheme. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. NA (REFORM AND SEPARATION OF FUNCTIONS) BILL 1997 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendments(1) Clause 21, page 18 (line 14), omit ""12"", substitute ""18"". (2) Clause 28, page 21 (line 4), omit ""12"", substitute ""18"".",14
4,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (9.42 a.m.)I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The other place has passed these amendments to allow staff to transfer between the two organisations, the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private, for a period of 18 months from fund transfer day, which will be in the first half of next year. This means there will be a two-year effective period for staff to transfer from September until fund transfer day and then 18 months after that date. The government considers this is a fair and reasonable period and supports the amendments. The passage of this legislation will position the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private to take advantage of new opportunities in their respective fields; The Health Insurance Commission is a world leader in data collection and processing. A new dedicated board and administration will allow the commission to realise its vision to be recognised as the best health service support agency in the world. Medibank Private will also have a dedicated board and administration to allow it to continue to be a leader in the industry. Without the constraints of the Health Insurance Commission, Medibank Private will be free to develop a range of products, and service delivery methods to better serve its customers. It is an exciting time to be involved in these fields and I am confident the Health Insurance ' Commission and Medibank Private will both rise to the challenge. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT (MALE TOTAL NA BENCHMARK) BILL 1997 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendments(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 4 (after line 31), after subsection (3), insert: (3A) If at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this section), the Australian Statistician publishes the amount referred to in subsection (3): (a) under differently described headings (the new headings); or (b) in a document entitled otherwise than as described in subsection (3) (the new document); then the annualised MTA WE figure is to be calculated' in accordance with subsection (3) as if the references to: (c) ""Average Weekly Earnings of Employees, Australia-Males-All males-Total earnings-ORIGINAL""; or (d) ""Average Weekly Earnings, States and Australia""; were references to the new headings and/or the new document, as the case requires. (2) Schedule 1, item 4, page 7 (after line 2), after subsection (3), insert: (3A) If at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this section), the Australian Statistician publishes the amount referred to in subsection (3): (a) under differently described headings (the new headings); or (b) in a document entitled otherwise than as described in subsection (3) (the new document); then the annualised MTA WE figure is to be calculated in accordance with subsection (3) as if the references to: (c) ""Average Weekly Earnings of Employees, Australia-Males-All males-Total earnings-ORIGINAL""; or (d) ""Average Weekly Earnings, States and Australia""; were references to the new headings and/or the new document, as the case requires.",15
5,Mr RUDDOCK,AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. These amendments are of a technical nature only, dealing with the hypothetical situation that the Australian Bureau of Statistics ceases publication of data on male total average weekly earnings. While we think that they are unnecessary, they are entirely noncontroversial and the government is prepared to accept them for the sake of passing some historic legislation. This is legislation which for the first time ever locks in continued increases in pension levels in line with community living standards. Labor talked about it a lot and claimed to be doing something about it but they never put one cent forward in the estimates to pay for it. They never once proposed legislation to lock it in, to give pensioners confidence and certainty of real pension increases. This government has promised to benchmark the pension at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. This bill delivers that commitment in full. It is very important legislation. Obviously, this amendment will ensure that it is able to be put in place promptly. Question resolved in the affirmative. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND· NA BILL 1997 Consideration of Senate Message",16
6,Mr SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"I have received a message from the Senate returning the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997 without amendment. The message also includes the text of a resolution agreed to by the Senate relating to technical and further education funding, in which the Senate requests the concurrence of the House. Senate standing order 131 provides for a bill originating in the House of Representatives and agreed to by the Senate to be returned to the House by message. Senate standing order 154 allows a motion to be moved at any time to communicate a Senate resolution to the House, the House's similar standing orders for communication with the Senate. These are necessary and sensible provisions in a bicameral legislature. However, the message seeks to include in the formal legislative process on a bill other matters not necessary for the enactment of the measure. House standing order 372 provides for a time to be named for consideration of a Senate message. However, it has never been the practice of the House for a time to be named for consideration of a Senate message returning a bill without amendment and I do not propose to call for a motion to do so in this instance. NA 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 21 October, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Gareth Evans moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that: (1) .native title rights, including on pastoral leases, are fundamental legal property rights, acknowledged and upheld as such by the High Court, and entitled to the same respect and protection as the property rights of non-Indigenous Australians: any amendment of the Native Title Act in response to the Wik decision or for any other reason must fully reflect that reality; (2) it is in the national interest that the Act balance and reconcile to the maximum possible extent the interests and reasonable expectations of both Indigenous Australians and other major stakeholders-farmers, miners and Australian taxpayers generally; (3) it is both in the national interest, and in the interests of Indigenous Australians, farmers and miners, that there be the maximum possible predictability and certainty about the status of the Act and its practical operation; (4) there is a need, in particular, to guarantee the constitutional validity of the legislation, by ensuring that legislation operates for the net benefit of Indigenous Australians; (5) it is also in everyone's interest that the processes established by this legislation to deal with the registration and determination of claims, and the reconciliation of competing interests, be as effective and expeditious as possible; (6) there are aspects of the Bill which may advance these objectives, in particular by aging and assisting the entering into of agreements, and by setting a stricter regime for the registration of claims; (7) nonetheless, the Bill is seriously deficient, and requires substantial amendment, in many respects, including: (i) the reach of the validation provisions beyond that which is necessary for the practical redress of post-Wik problems; (ii) the manifestly unacceptable over-reach of the provisions purporting to confirm the extinguishment of native title where exclusive tenure has previously been involved; (iii) the unnecessarily broad application, in relation to coexistence on pastoral leases, of the statutory authorisation of non-pastoral activities; (iv) the unnecessarily broad application of extinguishment in 'relation to the provision of government services and public works; (v) the indefensibly limited test for allowing statutory access rights for registered ants; (vi) the dramatic limitation of the right to negotiate, and in particular its effective elimination in relation to mining on pastoral leases, which (along with the provisions amounting to direct or de facto extinguishment) significantly tilts the balance of the legislation against Indigenous Australians; (vii) the unacceptable limitation on the effective enjoyment of the right to negotiate which is involved in powers of early ministerial intervention; (viii) the absurd and counterproductive sunset clause, which will simply ensure a proliferation of ambit claims under the Act, and the pursuit of future claims through expensive and complex common law processes; (ix) the inappropriately rigid and legalistic constraints on Registrars in the management of claims; and (x) the inappropriate introduction of formal rules of evidence, and limitations on the extent to which cultural and customary concerns can be taken into account, in the Federal Court claims process"".",16
7,Mr ROBERT BROWN,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I introduced my comments on the Native Title Amendment Bill last night and I take this opportunity to complete my contribution to the discussion of this bill. The first thing I want to do is refer to comments that encour- I heard from the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) on Canberra radio this morning. The member for O'Connor, in response to a protest being conducted around Parliament House at present, made the claim that these amendments to the Native Title Act make no provision at all for the extinguishment of native title. He challenged anyone to identify areas of this bill where native title is extinguished. Let me indicate at least two areas of this amending legislation where that quite clearly occurs. Proposed new section 23G of the bill says that prior grants of non-exclusive pastoral or agricultural leases will have extinguished native title to the extent of any inconsistency and any such extinguishment will be permanent. I also draw attention to that first area of the bill which quite clearly makes provision for the extinguishment of native title, despite the claims by the member for O'Connor to the claim- contrary. Let me draw the House's attention to proposed new section 24MD. It provides for the extinguishment of native title through compulsory acquisition by government of such title as the means by which 'nonexclusive' leases are upgraded to 'exclusive' leases. This section also provides for compensation to the native title holders. What I am concerned about is that the member for O'Connor would make the claim that this legislation does not extinguish native title when, quite clearly, it does. The question I raise is this: if, in the face of the fact that this legislation quite clearly extinguishes native title, the member for O'Connor, who has a responsibility to the government in this area of public policy, makes the claim that it does not, why does he make that claim? There is only one explanation for that-that is, the provisions to extinguish native title provided for and contained within this legislation are completely unconscionable. So what the government does and what government spokesmen attempt to do is deny that extinguishment is contained within the legislation when, quite clearly, it is. This consideration of amendments to the Native Title Act that we are undertaking at the moment comes at the end of a number of very significant developments which have taken place in the last 30 years in connection with the rights of Aboriginal people as citizens of Australia and as the original owners of this whole continent. Firstly, there was the 1967 referendum. The amendment to the race provision of the constitution is one of the points which is under some dispute concerning its legal implications and whether or not that provision of the constitution can be used by any government against any racial group. I participated in the debates at that time. I voted and I have no doubt, nor would anyone else who participated at that time have any doubt, that the Australian people amended that section of the constitution to ensure that the Commonwealth government would be able to legislate in favour of Aboriginal people and not to their detriment. There is no question that any single person who voted in that referendum in 1967 believed that they were empowering the Commonwealth government to legislate prejudicially against Aborigines. The next development was the Mabo judgment which repudiated forever that absurd concept of terra nullius-the idea that this Australian continent was unoccupied prior to European settlement and, for that reason, was unowned. We then had the Native Title Act 1993. I want to emphasise that, at that time, negotiations between the Labor government, which was responsible for that legislation, and Aboriginal Australians were conducted. Agreements and understandings were reached. Concessions and compromises were made and the general principles of that Native Title Act emerged from those discussions, from those honourable agreements which this government is now attempting to set aside and to repudiate. I said last evening that I acknowledge that there are parts of the native title legislation which need to be streamlined and which need to be clarified, but I am aghast that members of the government would use that fact to condemn the whole of the native title legislation. I have never seen a more cynical approach to any piece of legislation-or for the purposes of any amendment in this chamberthan the attitudes which have been expressed by members on the government side. For example, they have made the observations that, since Aboriginal people are more concerned about employment, education, health, housing and sanitation, we should forget native title. Aboriginal Australians are in need of many things, including an honourable and an honest recognition by all Australians of the principle of native title, which is a common law rightand there should not be any attempt made by and legislation moving through this parliament to deny that common law right. The Wik decision is again based on the common law rights of Aboriginal people. The decision made it perfectly clear that pastoral rights of leaseholders and the native title rights of Aboriginals do coexist but, in cases where they are in conflict, the rights of the pastoral leaseholders will prevail. Graziers in Australia wanted certainty; they were given certainty in that decision: in cases of conflict, their interests will prevail. And that is not enough. It is not enough for the government and for those forces behind the government which are forcing their hand, I believe, at the present time. I have got some serious doubts about there whether the government really want this the legislation to go through. That might sound surprising but I do have genuine doubts about that. They know that it is very likely that the Senate will not pass the legislation. They know that, if the Senate were to pass the legislation, litigation would hold it up in courts forever. There would be multiple claims and there would be continuing litigaists-the tion before the High Court, so it would all delayed. It would be confusing; it would expensive. There would be massive compenwhole sation involved. But what does this attempt, or alleged attempt, on the part of the government to enact this amending legislation allow them to ly. do? It allows them to go back to their constituents-to those people who have misrepresented the impact of the principle native title-and say, 'We fought the good fight. We took all of those opposition forces right to the line. We did our best but we were rolled.' So I do have very serious reservations about the purposes of the government in pursuing this legislation. I said that the pastoralists and the miners wanted certainty and the Native Title Act particularly the Wik decision gave them certainty. We do not hear so much about certainty any more. What we hear about now is security, but security for whom-for the dispossessed or for the expropriators? Let me say-and I am interrupting myself on this matter, Mr SPEAKER - that I recognise myself as a receiver of stolen goods, as a receiver stolen property, because Australia was settled by Europeans but we now accept that terra nullius was an unsound concept. Aboriginal Australians occupied and owned this continent, but now I own pieces of it. I did not buy it from them. It was expropriated from them and transferred to me, and every person with any prope'rty rights in Australia is in exactly the same position. The pastoral rights have been confirmed as being supreme. As far as mining and exploration are conthan cerned, the arrangements should be negotiat ated, but this amending legislation also attempts to upset that. We should not lose sight of the fact that ""are very, very serious legal doubts about legitimacy of the changes proposed in this legislation-whether it is contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act and whether the constitution itself will allow this legislation to be effected, even if it goes become part of the law. I have indicated that there will be masthe sive litigation and massive compensation. And will it improve the position of the pastoralleaseholders? The answer, quite be clearly, is no. In fact it will disadvantage be them; it will be prejudicial to them. The question of their right and their capacity to utilise the land for pastoral purposes will be placed in very serious jeopardy and it surprises me that they are not aware of that. It surprises me that they do not act accordingSo the two particular provisions in the of constitution are the race power, section 51(xxvi), and the external affairs power, section 51(xxix), under which this legislation almost certainly will be challenged and very likely will be successfully challenged if in fact it is passed by this parliament. (Time expired)",17
8,Mr SINCLAIR,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I want to say a few words about the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, because in my mind there is no more significant area of concern for Australia than trying to overcome the tragic divisions that have emerged in the treatment of the original inhabitants of Australia, or those who came here 50,000 years ago or whenever it was, and those who of came only 200 years ago. It is an extraordinarily difficult and challenging time. As a member of successive governments and oppositions, I do not think any government the whole of has yet got it right. There are enormous problems in trying to identify ways by which we can give Aboriginal Australians the same hope and the same opportunities as every other Australian. I do not believe you can achieve it by isolating them. I have not beeri to South Africa, other to pass very briefly through the airport Johannesburg, but I would not want anything parallel to apartheid to be introduced into this country. I think we have to find ways, therefore, by which we can learn to live with all Australians. I totally reject the views of the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). It is very important for today's Australians and future Australians that they learn to live with people whatever their racial or religious origins. We do not want to introduce into this country divisions, whether they be based on race, religion or origin. We certainly do not want to introduce divisions on the basis of the colour of a person's skin. We have to find a way by which we can accommodate the views of those who make up modem Australia and who, to my mind, have enriched our culture simply because of their diverse backgrounds. I suspect those of us who are of Anglo Saxon stock are no different in our belief of where we want Australia to go than those who come from other cultures. I am delighted that in this parliament over the course of time we have had representation-sadly too few from Aboriginal Australia-from many people who are not of Anglo-Saxon stock. So we start from the basis of looking at a multicultural Australia, although I confess that I was one of those who preferred the one Australia tag to that of multicultural Australia. But they both mean the same thing. They are both directed towards ensuring that people, whatever their origins, learn to live in and identify themselves with Australia. Having taken that stance, I think there have been a few milestones which, tragically, have left some traumas which have emerged in the legislation that we are now addressing. While I know that the then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam believed it was very much in the interests of Australia and in the direction that he would like to see Australia taken, he took two decisions which I believe did not sufficiently address or concern themselves with outcomes. Without doubt both his decisions were fundamentally ones that all of us would accept. One had nothing to do with this billthat is, giving the people of PNG their independence without giving them the capacity to develop the infrastructures that they so sadly needed. This is not the time to talk about PNG, but I believe we should have given them their independence but allowed them to develop not just people at a higher academic level but also the plant operatorS', the skilled foremen, the people who enable a society to work. If we had done this, many of the problems in PNG might not be as acute as they are today. That is another issue, but it is related to the second decision that Gough Whitlam took, which was to give equal pay to Aborigines. Obviously they had to have equal pay; there is no question about that. They had to be brought into Australia. I think it is a condemnation of our constitutional forebears that they did not recognise that Aborigines were equal Australians at the time the constitution was adopted. What should have happened was that, instead of bringing them straight in and giving them equal pay, we should have looked at the consequences. Part of the flow-on-and it is not a direct flow-on; nobody can attribute it directly but it worries me greatly-is that so many Aborigines today are dependent on social welfare. Instead of being able to live their own lives and retaining the culture of their people and their past, they depend in one form or another on getting help from the government. This has not overcome the problems identified by the honourable member who preceded me, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), concerning health, education, housing and employment. Those issues alone are not predominant, but it is a damnation of our society that we have such incredibly high mortality rates among Aboriginal females. It is quite appalling that in childbirth they still do not have the facilities that every other Australian enjoys. It is quite pathetic to see children out in the outback-and I know the outback pretty well-with flies around them and without appropriate standards of health and hygiene. It is not a matter of blaming the Aboriginal as a person, but payday in some of the Aboriginal settlements is social service day. The way in which, regrettably, so much of that income is spent on alcohol is quite appalling. Alcoholism is a very acute health and social problem for Aborigines. It is something have to identify, and it is something we have to address. I do not think you can divorce any of those issues from this particular legislation, because it is important that we look not just at one aspect of caring for Aboriginal Australians. We have to set goals. My first goal is that want to try to make all Australians, wherever contribution. they come from, equal. I am one of those people who do not believe that it is any some longer practical to expect that Aborigines able to really become equal by getting land alone. I think there are fundamental worries in the way we have addressed the whole question of land title. I am one of those people who would have far preferred us to have identified something like the soldier settlement schemes WorId War II. I know the Aborigines believe that collective ownership is the way to go, the sad part is that the structure of our riginal people is changing. They no longer have the relationship to their elders that they once enjoyed. At one stage there used to be a trihal custom and tribal law. The elders, male or female, were able to set the discipreferable pline, the tribe administered the discipline people complied with societal patterns. But the cultural attitudes that their forebears held have changed as much as our forebears' I attitudes. I know that there is no excusing much of the abuse of the past. But I am not talking about the past, I am talking about the future. Part of my worry in addressing the problem we have, to which this legislation and the Mabo legislation took an approach, is that essentially we are addressing High Court decision what is said to be a revocation of a past legal misconception-that is, that terra nullius was wrong. As far am concerned, that today is of historical significance, it is of legal consequence but is not of future relevance. We ought not to be looking backwards, other than to learn from the lessons of the past. I can tell all of you today who are members of the House that, when one has Aboriginal been around here for a while, it is amazing how many occasions people seek to reinvent we the wheel. But, putting that aside, looking prospectively, we have to find ways to allow us to meet-I think this is reflected on both sides of this chamber-those common goals: allowing the incorporation of the future Australia as a place where people, wherever they might have originated, can feel at home, I can feel they belong and can make a positive It is in that light that I want to address of the particularity of the legislation. In are relation to the Mabo legislation, instead of looking at just giving common title-perhaps in some areas common title is the answer-I would have liked also to have seen a way by which we could have given something like the individual title that soldier settlers enjoyed. People ,say, 'What exactly do you after mean?' I can tell you. Torrens title, essentially an Australian land but title system, is a remarkable way by which Aboland is identified in Australia. It has been replicated in many countries because of its simplicity of form. It avoids all the problems of old system titles, without going into the legalities of it. In my view it would have been had we looked at ways by which and around the suburbs of our major cities and our towns we could have allocated land similar to the way soldier settlement land was allocated. do not think it is a good idea to have Abo. riginal people just living in isolation. I think it would be far better if they were allowed to become part of other communities. I know that to a degree our housing commission people have tried to address this, but what they are still doing is looking at housing commission land as being rented instead of by virtue of a being Aboriginal. If you are going to satisfy the problem, I do not believe you ought to look only at those as I Aborigines who now no longer have a relationship with a particular area of land. We all it know that the Aborigines, like most other Australians, have intermarried. The percentage of what one might call full-blood Aborigines is now much less than it once was, other than in some parts of Australia. Those who have blood rightly could feel disentitled on from legislation such as this. I would have liked to have seen a way by which we could have allocated land on a fee simple basis, much as they are in soldier settlements. You can put a particular type of title on it and allow an incorporation of the land, and all Aborigines can benefit from it. But what I am concerned about is that we do not just address the land issue. I want to look at the legalities of it briefly because I think the land issue is important, and this legislation only refers to the land. When we were making some amendments to Mabo and when we were looking at the question of where we were going with Wik, I would have preferred to have got a package. In that total package I would have liked us to have been able to say, 'This is the way we are going to help you back into becoming part of tomorrow's Australia.' I regret that this legislation, like the Mabo legislation, if I can give it that generic term, really has not done anything to bring Aborigines into tomorrow's Australia; rather, each of them has left marked divisions and a good deal of anxiety. Regrettably, when I was coming into the House this morning I did not have time to stop and speak to those Aborigines outside. Some of those Aborigines were outside the House when most of us arrived today. They were all there with good intent and good purpose. I understand their concerns. The fact that I do not agree with some of them is incidental. As a politician, you find that there are many people in this place that you do not agree with; but at least you can listen. They have a concern and they would like to find a way by which their concerns could be overcome. I would have liked the Mabo and the Wik legislation to have been brought together and I would have liked to have looked at a compact by which we might have been able to offer hopes in each of these areas that many of us feel are critical for the future. Part of is educational and part of it is going to be societal. I, as one who has lived and worked with Aborigines, can tell you that the real difficulty in my community comes once children reach puberty. They are equal to every other child up until puberty, but by then some of the societal patterns make it difficult for them. Without wishing to judge those societal patterns-for who are we to judge others and their mores and patterns if you are advocating freedom of choice in those areas, as we do in Australia-it is important to register that they do bear down on equal opportunity for those Aboriginal children as they go into the future. Where does this legislation fit into that pattern? I would have preferred a broader pattern and I would have liked there to have been some type of soldier settlement equivalent of allocation of land in the Torrens title system which would have allowed all Aboriginals to benefit so we could go forward into the future. That has not been the case. So let us look at where we are. There are a couple of aspects that concern me. Some of the interpretation of the position following the introduction by Prime Minister Keating of the Native Title Bill of 1993 has been picked up in the Wik 10-point plan, but I do not necessarily accept that the conclusion there is the only answer. People need to remember that in Prime Minister Keating's second reading speech to the Native Title Bill he said that the government's view is that 'under the common law past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title'. He specifically referred to the fact that this was recorded in the preamble of the bill. He also said that there is, therefore, no obstacle or hindrance to renewal of pastoral leases in the future, whether validated or already valid. In looking at that, let me go back to a fundamental that people need to understand. Nobody questions that, whether or not terra nullius existed, the sovereignty of Australia rests in this parliament, that the colonial transfer of power in 1901, that the constitution of Australia as a Commonwealth of Australia, as a federation, is valid. Nobody questions that in this parliament we have a it capacity to legislate. Indeed, if there were a question about it-and people need to reflect on this-it would apply equally to the High Court as it would to this parliament. In other words, if we did not have authority to legislate, no more would the High Court have authority, because the High Court was constituted as a product of exactly the same process as we in this place were constituted. Having been thus constituted, we therefore have a capacity to legislate. To my mind, therefore, the previous Prime Minister having written into the preamble of the Native Title Bill 1993 and having stated in his second reading speech that under common law past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title, that is the valid position of the law today. I do not accept that there is any way by which native title should apply to pastoral leasehold land. In the High Court's judgment in Wik, Justice Toohey said: It is apparent that at one end of the spectrum native title rights may ""approach the rights flowing from full ownership at common law"". That essentially was the position looked at with respect to crown land under the Mabo decision and under the Native Title Act 1993. Although that perspective might, in Toohey's words, 'approach the rights flowing from full ownership at common law', it does not necessarily say it has to be only by collective ownership. Hence the reference I made a while ago to the alternative. But if I can pick up Mr Justice Toohey again: On the other hand they may be an entitlement'they' being the spectrum native title rights""to come on to land for ceremonial purposes, all other rights in the land belonging to another group"". It is that area essentially to which this legislation refers. For some time there has been a capacity to recognise ceremonial rights in some areas in some states of Australia. There has certainly been a recognition of sacred sites. We need to identify the difference between sacred sites and 'ceremonial purposes' . But within this legislation the product of where' we now are is that there is still concern-in spite of the attempt to resolve the whole question of certainty-and doubt about some areas within the application of this act. I have mentioned one, that is, the question of pastoral lessees. The second area that concerns me regards the uses and application of land by Aboriginals themselves. I think there is confusion by many of them, and that worries me. That is something which I would have preferred was not resolved only by the courts. Yet I suspect that might be so. I see that my time has nearly expired. In very difficult circumstances the government had little choice other than to legislate. Legislation is essential. I believe we have the power to legislate. I suggest that, because of the preamble to the Mabo legislation, the Native Title Bill, native title has already been extinguished on pastoral lease land. That has not been accepted. Therefore, in this bill it has been only for the period up to the introduction of this legislation or the time when it was first foreshadowed, the High Court decision on the Wik case, that that exemption has been given. I believe that should continue and that on balance the lO-point plan is the best alternative we have available. For that reason, while I am apprehensive about the future, I will support the legislation. (Time expired)",19
9,Mr CREAN,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"This debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 reflects the inability of the Howard government to come to terms with its responsibility to the whole of the Australian community. On top of that, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made this issue one of his top priorities. He has within his own portfolio of responsibility carriage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs but has not chosen to enter this debate, is not prepared in this House to back his own legislation. We have clear evidence of a government that is prepared in the most cynical and divisive way to ignore, suppress or remove the rights of indigenous Australians to their land-rights which are inherent in our constitution and which have been confirmed in successive decisions of this country's High Court. The government has sought to reward those state and territory governments which have acted with forethought in issuing titles over land that may be subject to native title and, therefore, invalid. Not only have they put these titles at risk; they have flouted their responsibility under the Native Title Act. They have spumed the opportunity to at last give indigenous Australians the proper recognition which this nation's history and body of law demands. Instead, the Prime Minister has proposed a lO-point plan, a plan which is deficient, a plan which lacks vision and which seeks in the most underhanded way to extinguish native title and roll time when the rights of indigenous Australians were subservient to those demands of non-indigenous Australians, a subservience that saw indigenous Australians shot, poisoned and moved off their land and their children stolen. Not only does the lO-point plan and its package demonstrate yet again the Prime Minister's lack of compassion or understanding and the depths of his mean-spiritedness; it is wrong-headed. It lacks common sense. A most obvious flaw in this lO-point plan and the legislation is the arrogant attempt in this bill to legislate away the common law rights of indigenous Australians. The Howard government has gone well beyond the High Court's determination in relation to native title. In the Wik judgment the court left open the question of suppression or extinguishment. His own Attorney-General (Mr Williams) fessed up in this chamber when he said on 4 September: The government recognises that the permanency issue was left unresolved ... The Prime Minister, however, has taken the decision to accept the risk that his own legislation extinguishes native title. And he has compounded the sin by proposing to allow the upgrading of pastoral leases at the expense of native title holders. If there is upgrade then Commonwealth and state governments must contribute to the cost of that upgrade. Under this bill the constitutional rights of Aboriginal people are potentially capable of being stripped away while previous entitlements for pastoral leases and activity can in fact be enhanced for private purposes but paid for through the public purse. It is perverse. The constitutional questions raised by this legislation have already been the subject of much public discussion and are to be considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. We have already been witness to this government's shameful attempt to suppress advice to it from the Australian Law Reform Commission. Despite whatever efforts the government might make, it cannot wish away any unwelcome views back the clock to a and opinions. It is not my intention in the time. I have available to detail all of the legal argument against the legislation. My colleagues have covered that field over and over. It was also very pleasing last night to see the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), a member of the government, have the courage to get up in this place and say that the lO-point plan and the legislation are flawed. There ought to be more conscience on that side of the House. Suffice it to say that the issues in question go to matters as diverse as questions related to 'just terms' as well as to our international obligations under various United Nations' instruments. The fact that there are so many points on which it is possible to challenge the bill demonstrates the irresponsibility of the Howard government in pursuing this as its chosen course. A focal point of the Prime Minister's rhetoric is the need for certainty and workability. Yet almost by definition this bill would have the opposite impact: it will entrench uncertainty, it will be disruptive and it will cause unnecessary division in the community. It will cost this nation dearly. It will become a barrister's banquet. What comfort does this prospect bring to any of us-not just indigenous Australians but the farmers, the miners and the rest of the community? And, more an particularly, what comfort does it bring to those Australians who live in regional Australia and who have to deal with these issues on a daily basis? Elements of this bill that do warrant our particular attention are those which deal with indigenous land use agreements, principally sections 24BA and 24EC of the amending legislation. These are elements that provide a framework for the development of negotiated agreements on a regional basis. If there is anything good about the Howard government's lO-point plan, it is only the 10th point dealing with regional agreements. But, even with the commitment to go down the route of regional agreements, aspects of this bill have neutered that approach as a result of the cumulative effect of the other provisions which provide for massive-not bucketloads but truckloads-extinguishment and the indigenous reduction in the procedural rights afforded indigenous people, particularly the right to negotiate. The extinguishment of native title and the attack on these procedural rights removes any incentive to negotiate. There essentially nothing left to negotiate about. In pursuing this. course the Howard government has picked the quinella. It has not only taken every possible step to limit the opportable. tunities under the Native Title Act for indigenous Australians to be active and equal participants in the economic mainstream but. also sold out on regional Australia. If the Howard way becomes the only way it will become a case of an opportunity lost-an dependent opportunity to truly explore the creative capacity for coexistence of indigenous rights with those of non-indigenous Australians the benefit of all of us. After all, a central element of the High Court's decision in Wik was the assertion of the coexistence of native title with other interests in land. The negotiation of regional agreements based on the acceptance of the existence legitimacy of native title does provide platform for the development of regional between economies more broadly. A comprehensive approach to regional development and regionthis al planning has been missing from the Howservices ard government's agenda since the day it office. Negotiating regional agreements can a means to recognise and respect indigenous rights and needs while simultaneously adconsideration dressing many of the deep-seated problems faced by regional economies across Australia. In this respect, regional agreements can be Act. about regional growth for the benefit of the entire community. In this context I am using the term 'regional agreement' to mean negotithe ated financial and administrative arrangepotential ments-including resource management mise arrangements-between indigenous Australtheir ians and government and third parties within the regional context. But in this approach it is important be prescriptive. We need to be flexible, as the arrangements will differ from place to place depending upon the circumstances. However, it is crucial for the process to be driven the local or the regional level, with maximum participation. Basic to the concept to of regional agreements is the understanding that all Australians have rights. The challenge for indigenous Australians is to be able to harness the economic impact of investment is spending within their local communities and regions. This bill diminishes the potential for indigenous Australians to have a place at the It diminishes their ability to exert some . control over what happens in their region. It may come as a surprise to the Prime Minister, but the reality is that native title holders are not going away. Their future is tied to their regions and to regional development. They are ·for their livelihood on these regional economies and they share this dependency with many non-indigenous Australians who to have made Australia their home. The Century Zinc and the MCArthur River Mine are two recent examples where taxpayers have provided or are providing infrastructure or services which are either central to or associated with mine development. For examand pIe, in the Northern Territory at MCArthur a River the haulage road has been paid for the mine site and its port facilities at Bing Bong Station. What was missing from deal was any agreement to address the and infrastructure shortfalls of the took Aboriginal people on whose land the mine be had been developed. On the other hand, the subsequent deal over Century did include of these issues. That agreement was arrived at under the provisions of the current Native Title Act-Labor's Native Title The ability of indigenous Australians to negotiate regional or site agreements under Native Title Act does give them the to harness available capital to maxiits benefit for their communities and for local and regional economies. Without this capacity to influence, the direct benefit from major developments to local and regionnot to al economies will be minimal. From experience both in this country and overseas it is clear that without local intervention in infrastructure investment-whether from public or private-it is likely that local multipliers will diminish because of the nature of corporate practice. Companies are becoming increasingly national and/or global so that purchasing and procurement rely less and less on local suppliers and skilled labour is invariland ably imported. We have also seen an increase in the use of 'fly in fly out' operations in extractive industries, which further highlights this point. Even when local economies speed up as a result of dramatic increases in infrastructure expenditure, the derived benefits flow, increasingly, to firms and individuals from outside the local area-including overseas-as they move to take advantage of the growing economy. Both the acknowledgment of native title and the existence of the Native Title Act provide a unique and vital platform for indigenous Australians to pursue a regional agreements approach. Regional agreements are an important element in the historic reconciliation process, a process which is now clearly at risk because of this government's stubbornness and lack of vision and understanding. Tragically, the Prime Minister is unable to grasp the moment. He is unable to fathom the benefits that would flow from such a regional approach not only to the regions themselves but to the nation as a whole. Regional agreements do have the potential to rearrange political and economic power in this country-to provide Australians in it geographical community of interest with the possibility of exerting some control over what happens in their communities, giving them ownership of the local agenda rather than imposing it upon them or expecting them to take what is left over. Unlike this government, Labor is committed to treating all Australians equally and to ensuring that they are all given a fair go. We will not sit by as the government emasculates the Native Title Act and tramples on the rights and opportunities that Australia's indigenous peoples have won and have entitlement to. We will not only seek to ensure that the right to negotiate remains strong but do everything possible to support processes developed to facilitate indigenous involvement in agreements over developments on their land.",23
10,Mr MAREK,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Capricornia) (10.36 a.m.)As a member of this parliament I represent thousands of land-holders in central Queensand hundreds of business people who are caught up in this massive land claim by the Aboriginal community. The people on land in my electorate want certainty, security and ascendancy of land tenure within Australia, and they should have it. The lO-point plan provides a large degree of that certainty, but the legislation is still a maze of confusion and it will continue to be a thorn in the side of the process of workability. I have heard a lot of debate from both sides of the House on native title. We are all individuals and we all have the right to put our point of view forward, and that is why I should have the right to put mine, which is only the view of many of the people within my electorate, projected by me. I am concerned that legitimate land-holders will be forced to fight for their rights, possibly without financial support from the government, unlike the indigenous community which has been funded to make these claims, some of which are absolutely ludicrous. In central Queensland, native title claims engulf the whole area, regardless of whether or not native title can reasonably be established. Claims lodged by indigenous groups stretch from Wide Bay to Mackay and beyond, including the shires of Belyando, Broadsound, Fitzroy, Calliope, Mount Morgan, Livingstone, Duaringa Peak Downs and Rockhampton. The claimants, which include the Wiri, Yuwiburra, Jangga, Wacca, Darumbal and Birria people, have lodged claims for land, water, air, resources, flora and fauna in these shires. Yet it would appear that claims overlap from one area to another, and even the indigenous people cannot agree on the area they are claiming. The people are also seeking to gain environmental control and toplace restrictions on the economic use of resources under the claims. If the indigenous people cannot agree on their own boundaries, what chance has the pastoralist got? Some pastoralists have two, three, four and sometimes five claims on their property, and I am concerned that they will be tied up in legal wrangles for the next 10 years trying to sort out the mess. It is unfair and poses an enormous burden on the rural sector. It appears to me that every area that can be claimed is being claimed, regardless of whether or not native title can reasonably be established. On the subject of compensation, I have to ask this question: why is this generation of people in Al,lstralia the one which will have to subsidise the legal, administrative and compensation costs associated with native title claims? Australians who lived here over the past 200 years and theoretically were responsible for taking land from the indigenous people have not paid a thing. Future generations of Australians will not have to pay a cent towards the compensation of native title. Why is this generation responsible for the costs that will be incurred? Why is it that taxes have to be used to compensate the indigenous people for some of these claims? And why is the current generation of rural producers and miners held to ransom for these claims? Pastoralists and mining companies Minister, cannot make a move without the fear that somewhere down the line they may be guilty of some indiscretion and be made to pay a premium for compensation. I grew up in the towns of Murgon, Chercontext. bourg and Winton, and I have lived with Aboriginal people for a long time. I underpowers stand their plight and a lot of the concerns that they have. Fair is fair: as far as the is concerned, they have been here for a long time, but so have the pastoralists-probably not as long but, let us be very clear, we another generation of people. I can see no reason why the people who currently have the land in pastoral leases-the graziers and so forth-cannot continue to operate. They have got their land and they should be able to keep control of that land and use it the way they see fit. On the other side of the fence, there is a lot of Crown out there, and I can see no reason why it cannot be made available. If everybody put culture their heads together on this thing and were happy to put forward the best point of view to ensure that everybody had a win, and if were not such a politically debated money grab, I think this country would be a lot better off. We must have a fair go for all Australians. We should be able to put together a one-off package that covers education, health, employment and better living standards for Aboriginal people so that we all live as one within Australia. I look at communities like Woorabinda up in my electorate of Capricornia. People look for employment opportunities there, but it is possible that major employment regimes, industry and those sorts of things at W oorabinda would not work. People who need to get employment need to be brought into live with the rest of the community, and !hat is how I feel on that. In closing, the legislation does not go far enough to fix the problems that many of the our graziers and pastoralists are going to have, particularly up in Queensland, but I concede that it is a long way better than this country would have if we worked on what Labor was to introduce. Mr Keating, the previous Prime said that native title would be extinguished by pastoral leases. I can see no found reason why this should not happen.",26
11,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I want to speak to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 in a slightly different I think we need to cast our minds the back a few centuries to when the major in the world were in the process of colonising all of the world. The fact is that land most countries in the world were once colonies. Whether they were colonies of Britain, France, Belgium, Germany or Holland, the are fact is that the majority of countries were colonies. The South American countries, the African countries, Australia and most Asian countries were colonies. Under the attitudes of the day, that seemed to be appropriate. The colonisation was not simply physical; it was cultural, religious and very materialistic. Ever since then there has been an .attempt land to reconcile that process, and we have seen the emancipation of country after country, after culture and religion after religion as countries were given recognition and the right to determine their own affairs. That has it not always been easy, because the so-called civilised world imposed on the so-called uncivilised world frameworks which were often inappropriate and incredibly paternalistic. In many of those colonising processes, there was a recognition of indigenous people, and I think New Zealand stands out as one of the stark examples. It is also the fact that, for hundreds of years, there were rebellions, revolts and struggles by people throughout the world to assert their rights over their own territory. I can recall being in Guatemala in the late 1980s as part of an international conference, talking to the indigenous people there and recognising the struggle that they were still having. It became obvious that people of 14 and 15 were being killed to try to establish that they had equal rights as citizens. I can recall being in Dili in 1991, talking to East Timorese people and Bishop Belo, and looking at and trying to understand what they were trying to assert in terms of what they felt as indigenous people with the right to express their own cultural identity and with some sovereignty over what had been their country pre-colonisation by, firstly, the guese and, secondly, the Indonesians. What happened in Australia was very unusual because the British colonisers of Australia introduced a legal fiction. They pretended there was no-one here, so the terra nullius doctrine, for hundreds of years, gave a legal fiction to what was going on. This effectively meant that there was neither the need nor the compulsion nor the demand to reconcile the colon ising culture with the indigenous culture. It has fallen to this generation to address that. I find those people who keep talking about judge-made laws absolutely hypocritical because the same people have vaunted, and have spoken with great gusto about, the British common law system being the world's best legal system. We have talked about that for centuries. We have extolled it around the world. The fact is that the British common law system started to recognise native title in Africa in particular a long, long time ago. So native title did not start in Australia with communities; it started in Africa last century and was identified and defined then; After colonisation over 200 years ago, our indigenous people finally went to court and tested the British common law system. The Mabo decision was the first time ever that the Australian High Court was asked to arbitrate and to rule on the basis of British common law as to whether or not the indigenous people of Australia had any legal rights of title. I notice some of the Independent members shaking their heads. The fact is that that was the first time ever. The British common law said, in the High Court judgment, that they have rights and the rights are under native title, which is different to Torres title and different to all other kinds of titles. It was a concept recognised a century before and more. It was a concept recognised by the British colonial officers but not recognised by Australian administrators. After us extolling our legal basis for so long, then having it tested in the High Court and our indigenous people being given, for the first time in over 200 years, some legal rights of title to land-and a very limited Portutitle-we have decided that somehow this cannot be true. What we are engaged in right now, if you like, is a 20th century colonisation. The first colonisation was with guns, with power, with disease and with deprivation; the new wave of colonisation is wiping out British common law. It is no different. We took away their rights, as colonisers, and pretended they did not exist. But hundreds of years laterit was established, with incredible patience and stamina, that they do have rights. The new wave colonisers are us, right now in this parliament. This parliament is engaged in an act right now of recolonising Australia, by doing with this parliament and this legislation what the early colonisers failed to do. This issue has ramifications way beyond that. When people want to start looking at Australia's stature in the world and how the world sees us, just keep in mind that most of the world's countries were ex-colonies-and most ex-colonisers have got out of the business. You do not see Germany colonising countries any more and you do not see Britain our colonising countries any more; we are the only ones. We are now leading the charge for new style colonising. Mr Rocher-What about Wales? The Brits colonised Wales.",27
12,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"They are decolonising Scotland and they are decolonising Wales right now . We are recolonising our indigenous people. That is what is so interesting. We are going absolutely against the rest of the world. If you are looking at all for any standing in the world, what we are doing is putting ourselves in the company of the original colonisers around the world. Sure, we do not go out and kill people as they did in the past. But there is not much difference between killing them with guns or poison or by starvation and killing them by destroying their culture and their self-respect, and taking away their legal rights. This issue has ramifications for decades to come and way beyond Australia. We fail to understand what we are doing. We as parliamentarians do visit other countries. We engage in dialogue with parliamentarians from around the world and you all know--every single one of you know-that the No.1 topic for discussion when we visit anybody is: what are you doing to indigenous people? Mr Rocher-Rubbish, absolute rubbish!",29
13,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"It is; don't pretend. We see Japan, after centuries, passing legislation to recognise their indigenous people. And we are doing the opposite. It has taken Japan literally thousands of years to recognise its indigenous people. We are seeing people around the world-the Canadians, the Americans-recognising their indigenous peoples. We have seen the events in South Africa. We are going against every world trend. We will be seen as the pariahs of the world. And what for? I do not know what for. The fact is that this issue has given this generation an incredibly difficult problem. We did not choose to get it. I do not think our forbearers passed this on to us deliberately or consciously, but the fact is that we have it. is an incredible challenge; it is an incredibly difficult challenge. There are no rights and wrongs. There is no moral high ground in that sense. There is simply an enormously difficult problem to resolve. We will not resolve this problem by doing with legislation what the colonisers failed to do with extermination-because what we are talking about here is exterminating a culture. When Ronald Wilson talks about genocide, he means it, and it is true. Whichever way you go about destroying a people, it is still genocide-and you cannot get away from that. Mr Filing interjecting",29
14,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"This is not overdramatising. In modem day terms, 'legislative extinguishment' of an indigenous people is no different. It is simply a modem form of poisoning their waterholes. It is simply a modem form of destroying their religions and destroying their culture. . This legislation is confrontationist, it is divisive and it is bound to fail. There is no doubt that the High Court will not uphold this legislation. This legislation will not give certainty. The only way we can progress is if we firstly recognise and respect both the rights and the needs of indigenous people. We must deal with that as a society. These people are part of our society. They have rights within our society. Any difficulties with how their rights and the rights of other people intercept need to be reconciled. Reconciliation is not simply saying that we will all talk to each other and start to change the way we treat each other. Reconciliation has to incorporate, fundamentally, recognition of the rights of each. The fact is that British common law determinations in two cases-first, Mabo and, secondly, Wik-said that our indigenous people have substantial rights. Those rights are now defined and need to be reconciled. Those who talk about reconciliation on one hand and extinguishment on the other are playing some kind of mind game, and it will not work. As I have said, around the world Australia will be seen as a pariah. This is not to say It that we should do in Australia what other countries want us to do. But, just remember, we are putting ourselves in the same league as the colonisers of centuries ago. We are now the modern colonisers of the world, and we are probably the only ones-apart from the occasional American venture into various parts of South America or Asia, and even they have stopped. We are now the only country in the world which is colonising, but in a very sophisticated form, with all the glib words that the highest priced wordsmiths can muster in an attempt to obfuscate, obscure and pretend. We are doing it by divisive and emotive tactics in pitting Australian against Australian, indigenous against non-indigenous. What is taking place, I think, is an absolute national tragedy. But I do not think the majority of Australians will fall for it. People talk about the Mabo legislation, its preamble and the comments made by the previous Prime Minister. The fact is that they have been borne out. The Wik judgment said that, if there is any conflict, that a lease has priority. That is absolutely clear. The idea somehow that there is uncertainty is nonsense. There is no uncertainty because the pastoral lease takes precedence over native title-and that is what was expected. What we are seeing here is a political charade of sinister magnitude. It is a pretence that, firstly, the common law is somehow judge made. It is not. It never has been before. We have never seen in England a campaign against their judges for making common law decisions as we are seeing here. We then vaunt this common law concept as being the world's best system. We are pretending that certainty requires ownership only, and nothing else. We are pretending that, to do that, we will not be involved in massive cost and massive disenfranchisement or massive loss of legal rights. This whole exercise is aimed at polarising and dividing. The only answer is for a negotiated outcome to be arrived at by those of us with responsibility for legislation and those people with rights-a negotiated outcome with which we can allIive with dignity. This is not dignified; it is despotic. It is a parliathe ment overriding common law judgment in two judgments. I have no doubt that, when this goes back to the High Court, it will be rejected again. The whole thing is a charade, and that is reinforced absolutely by the government's actions with the Law Reform Commission. If they are so confident that their legal grounds are unshakeable, why gag the Law Reform Commission? If they are so confident that the High Court has made a mistake, why not allow into the public arena every bit of legal advice available? Why not allow a committee to discuss and question officers of the Law Reform Commission? If they are so confident that we are acting within the British common law system and doing it properly, why not allow really full debate on the stolen generation, and why not have a detailed response? What we are doing in this parliament at this point in time is creating a massive problem not just for ourselves but for generations ahead. The world is watching us with interest as a country that talked with some right, if you like, about events in other countries. We fought in two world wars in the cause of freedom and civil rights. We speak on these issues constantly as a country. And what are we actually doing? We are removing civil rights, we are removing legal rights, because it does not suit us. I think Australia's status in the world is important to all of us. We are a small but incredibly fair country historically. What is happening here is not fair. It will not stand up in court. It will lead to more uncertainty, to more division and to more hostility, and at the end of all that someone is going to have to sit down and negotiate a solution. Some time in the future someone is going to have to sit down with parliamentarians, with executive government, with indigenous people, and negotiate a solution which is compatible. This legislation does the opposite. It says, 'We know what is best. We will override the laws.' It will do a whole range of things which, quite frankly, most of us find incomprehensible. There are pages and pages of schedules of lease after lease. I suppose the fact that the leaseholders include Sultan of Brunei and God knows who else makes a sham of it all. We try to get a list of how many leases there are, how many leaseholders there are, who they are, and we do not know. In amongst all of this there is one interestmining ing po-nt. The leases in South Australia in so many cases enshrine within them the right for indigenous people to access that land. In other words, our forefathers were actually reasonably aware in some cases. I think the contrast between the British Colonial Office and the Australian administrations in treatment of Aboriginal land rights and access to land is an incredible one. We are taking the side of the early administrators in Australia. We are denying centuries of history of British common law and British common practice. We chose a model which no-one else has. What is more, what we are doing today in this legislation is taking it a step further. It is dark step, it is a nasty step, and it will not succeed in creating certainty and correctness. An incident having occurred in the gallery",29
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I do appreciate and understand that there are some people in the gallery who have a significant interest in the legislation before the chamber. I also am aware that people in the gallery have already been warned about the need to observe the courtesies and the standing orders of this House. For your information, I would like to advise you that admission to the galleries is a privilege extended by the House, and people attending must conform with established forms of behaviour. People visiting the House are presumed to do so to listen to debates, and it is considered discourteous for them not to give their full attention to proceedings. Thus visitors are required to be silent and to refrain from attempting to address the House, interjecting, applauding, conversing and so on. So I do advise you of that for your information, and suggest to you that it would be much more appropriate if for the remainder of this debate you observed the normal courtesies.",31

The issue of the existence of native title has been of concern to all those with an interest in land use in Australia, in particular indigenous Australians, pastoralists and graziers and the and resources industry. In June 1992' in the Mabo case the High Court held that the common law recognised native title rights and that those rights could survive white settlement. Native title was described by reference to the traditional laws and customs of indigenous people. However, the court said that native title is susceptible to extinguishment. This could occur, for example, by way of laws or acts giving rights to third parties inconsistent with the continuation of native title rights and by laws or acts by which the Crown obtains full' beneficial ownership of land previously subject to native title. Native title can also be lost if indigenous people fail a to maintain their traditional connection with the land. Then in late 1993 the parliament enacted the Native Title Act. One of the premises on which that act was based, recorded in the preamble to the act, was parliament's understanding that native title is extinguished by valid government acts inconsistent with its continuing existence, such as the grant of freehold or leasehold title. However, the act did not expressly extinguish native title over all pastoral leases. In June 1993, before the Native Title Bill was introduced into the parliament, the Wik peoples began, by proceeding in the Federal Court, a claim for title over 35,000 square kilometres of land on western Cape York. Their case was sent to the High Court and a decision was handed down on 23 December 1996. One of the the major questions in the Wik case was whether the grant of the particular pastoral leases in question gave the lessees exclusive possession of the land, a right inconsistent with the continuation of native title. At the risk of oversimplifying a complex and detailed decision, I briefly say that the majority of the court concluded that the leases in question did not confer exclusive possession on the lessees. The court confined its attention to the particular leases at issue and held that they did not necessarily extinguish native title. The importance of the Wik decision lies in the fact that an estimated 42 per cent of the Australian land mass is under pastoral lease. In some states, the percentage is estimated to be as high as 70 per cent to 80 per cent. Since it came into force in 1994, the act has placed a burden on resource development without benefiting indigenous people. As the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) said in his second reading speech, this is of concern because, as a result of the unresolved uncertainties left by the act, community relations in many parts of rural and remote Australia have been strained. It is salutary to look closely at the impact of native title on the mining and exploration industry to understand the problems with the current act. The risks for mining companies arising from native title are greater in my home state of Western Australia than in any other state or territory. This is because Western Australia produces 36 per cent of Australia's mineral resources, and 82 per cent of the state is subject to native title claims. The difficulty for the mining industry arises from what is known as the right to negotiate. The right to negotiate is a right given by the act to registered native title holders and to those who have registered but not proven a claim to native title. It entitles them to negotiate about certain actions that are proposed by governments that may affect their native title, or claim to native title, on land or waters. My colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) is going to deal with claims on waters. Actions that attract the right to negotiate include the creation or variation of a right to mine. In an article in the September 1997 issue of Australia's Mining Monthly, the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies Inc., otherwise known as AMEC, described the right to negotiate as 'the most criticised and demonstrably biggest problem wi th the current act'. It said: It enables exploration and mining companies to be held to ransom before native title has been awarded to any applicant. It went on to say that the right to negotiate is 'the single biggest impediment in the act to any type of development in Australia and nothing is doing more to constrain employment opportunities, delay projects or inflate costs'. AMEC claims that the effect on the mining industry is an escalating flight of mining capital offshore. This claim appears to be borne out by the facts. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released in January 1997 showed that Australian resident companies spent $486 million on exploration for minerals and petroleum overseas in 1995-96. That represents an increase of 12.8 per cent on the previous financial year. A recent Minerals Council of Australia minerals industry survey showed that the overseas portion of the respondents' exploration spending had grown steadily over the years, from 30.1 per cent of total exploration in 1988-89 to 40.5 per cent in 1995-96. I am told by AMEC that offshore operation, which formerly was not economically viable for the smaller mining companies, is now being seen by those companies as increasingly attractive. It should be of concern that, according to AMEC, a large proportion of the exploration that is going offshore is so-called 'green fields' exploration. This term refers to exploration of areas not previously mined or explored to any large extent and where the mineral potential is unknown. It is designed to initiate new mining operations. Previous Minerals Council surveys reveal that the impact of the movement in investment overseas is already being felt on green fields exploration activity in Australia. Australian mining companies are choosing to spend a larger proportion of their domestic exploration budget on 'brown fields' exploration. Brown fields exploration, as you probably know, Mr Deputy Speaker, is designed to feed existing mining infrastructure and usually occurs in an area adjacent to existing explored or mined reserves. The full impact of this trend will not become evident for several years, when the overseas green fields exploration begins to bear fruit. Since the metal produced overseas is the product of that country, that metal will compete with the Australian product if traded in the same market. Clearly, something must be done to reverse this alarming trend. In its analysis of the minerals industry survey, the authors noted that various factors contributed to the driving of minerals exploration investment offshore. These factors include environmental requirements, overall costs and fiscal settings. Changing geopolitical conditions and the opening up of various countries in South America, Asia and Africa to foreign investment are additional factors. The authors of the survey reiterated the industry's firm view that the Native Title Act has introduced significant uncertainty to exploration approvals process in Australia and, in doing so, has encouraged this movement overseas. The industry pleads for a working legislative system that recognises the realities of the commercial and competitive environment in which mineral companies operate. This need is by no means inconsistent with the right of indigenous people to have their interest in land recognised appropriately and protected. After all, the mining industry has always worked within a legal framework that recognises the interests in land held by nonindigenous Australians. While native title is a unique type of interconfirms est in land, quite different from freehold and leasehold interests, it should be possible to establish a fair and practicable way to balance the need to maintain a competitive mining and exploration industry, with the need for indigenous people to enjoy their rights to land. The government has introduced this bill to amend the act in the light of its serious defects and in response to the Wik judgment. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in this place on 4 September this year that the government seeks with these amendments to give security and predictability to the farmers of Australia and to the mining industry and to preserve the 'basic fabric of the rights conferred by the High Court of Australia on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community in the historic Mabo decision'. Senator Nick Minchin, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, with responsibility for native title, has described this amendment bill as fulfilling four objec-' tives: to reduce uncertainty; to improve the workability of native title processes; to find a balance among the interests of all parties; and to maintain respect for native title. Senator Minchin has said that the proposed legislation comprises amendments formulated in 1996 to improve the workability of the act, together with amendments developed this year under the government's 10-point plan to deal with the uncertainty arising from the Wik decision. The question before the parliament is whether or not this bill will make the native title procedure more workable and provide greater certainty to all parties while recognising the concerns of indigenous people. The government proposes in the bill what it asserts to be a more efficient management of native title claims. In a move aimed at reducing division and litigation, the amendment bill provides for more flexibility in agreements involving native title claimants. The amendment bill provides for the validation of acts or grants on pastoral leases and other coexisting tenures between 1 January 1994, when the Native Title Bill came into effect, and the date of the Wik decision. It the extinguishment of native title on exclusive tenures. It provides what is intended as a more effective and efficient regime for the consideration of mining applications on land where native title may exist. The amendment bill ensures the supply of government services on land on which native title may exist. Addressing the major concern of miners, the bill tightens the test for the registration of a native title claim requiring indigenous people to first establish that they have a prima facie claim to native title. That will ensure that mining companies are only required to negotiate in cases in which native title is most likely or probable to be found. In the words of the Attorney-General, that will provide more of a balance between the interests of native title holders and the need to ensure that economic development is not unduly impeded. In the case of mining on leasehold land where native title may exist, the states and territories will be able to replace the right to negotiate with state based systems that give equivalent procedural rights to native title holders, claimants and leaseholders. The amendment bill removes the right to negotiate from those small scale mining operations which would become unviable if required to comply with the negotiation procedures. Examples of such operations are opal, gem and alluvial gold mining. I am pleased to see that the bill will go some way towards assisting the competitiveness of the mining industry and encouraging investment to remain in Australia by reducing some of the obstacles to resolving native title issues. The amendment bill also contains . benefits designed for pastoralists. The bill confirms the High Court ruling that the statutory rights of pastoral lessees prevail over any surviving native title rights. In so doing, the amendment bill ensures that the work of a pastoralist will not be disrupted by native title issues. Importantly, by guaranteeing that governments can manage and regulate water supplies, notwithstanding any coexisting native title rights, the bill will protect the pastoral industry's access to water. Provisions in the bill before the House ensure that lessees can be granted additional primary production rights such as farmstay tourism. Our primary producers must be encouraged to diversify in order to meet the changing needs of Australian and international markets and to help with the viability of farming enterprises and rural communities. If this bill assists to prevent native title issues from discouraging diversification on pastoral lease land, it will be most welcome. As part of the balance sought to be struck by the bill, the proposed legislation will provide specific benefits, which I listed earlier, for indigenous people. The amendment bill also confirms the existing access to pastoral leases for registered native title claimants. This bill, if enacted, will give equivalent treatment for native title claimants and pastoralists in relation to mining and other development on pastoral leases. The amendment bill also sets out appropriate powers and functions for indigenous representative bodies, with the aim of ensuring that they perform properly and are accountable. I support the government's view that the parties to a native title claim should be encouraged to negotiate a land use agreement. An agreement, which by definition is consensual, is preferable to litigation, which is potentially divisive and always costly. While the comprehensive framework set out in the bill for reaching agreements is of benefit to all parties, I expect it will be particularly useful for indigenous people. It appears unlikely that the parliament will produce a legislative solution to the question of the use of land over which native title exists that pleases all parties. A strength of this bill is its emphasis on encouraging parties to reach negotiated agreements. It is a mature approach to an issue that, to date, has unfortunately been characterised by its use by some parties as a platform for various political agendas. While confirming and securing the rights of native title holders, the government has sought to accommodate the competing interests of other Australians who also hold titles to land. This reconciliation-I use word advisedly-of competing land use interests is important not just for Australian industry but also for the improvement of relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. I commend the government for what it has done with this bill.",31
17,Mr FILING,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I would like to respond to some of the comments that have been made in earlier speeches on this Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. Some of them have been quite extraordinary. For instance, the allegation that somehow British common law should prevail over Australian statute law is quite an extraordinary assertion by a Labor member, particularly after he sat there for years while the former Prime Minister used to deride the coalition for tugging their forelocks to the British-and I will come to the British in a minute because there are a couple of other comments I would like to make in response to these British MPs who feel they have an interest in interfering in Australian domestic matters. They have got a lot of baggage that they carry and I want to talk about that in a moment. I just want to differentiate between what I consider to be two different approaches. Mr Martin Ferguson-The Prime Minister can tell Tony Blair tomorrow. Mr Rocher-If you asked Tony to apologise, he would.",34
18,Mr FILING,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The trouble is it would not mean anything more than that. But I want to make this assertion: there must be, in the interests of Australian people, a differentiation between laws or, let us say, sentiments that are designed to make some people feel better or feel good versus what is, in essence, good government. We have seen in recent times just how emotive the issue of property rights can become. I use the example-I am not trying to offend the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), who is at the table, because it is not her particular portfolio-of the nursing homes rules changes where people who have homes or properties who have faced the prospect of paying an accommodation bond become very emotionally involved in these changes. We can see where for instance what might be presented as an example of good government can suddenly get out of hand because there is a very strong emotional bond between citizens and their property. As a person who supports property rights, as I am sure the coalition philosophically supports property rights-or at least it used to in the past-I think there is an obvious requirement for any legislation that intends to deal with property rights to take into account the wishes of the vast majority of Australian citizens because, clearly, it is a matter that impacts on all of us. I mentioned also that there was a very big cheek in the statements made by a delegation of British MPs relating to the government's Wik legislation. What an absolute cheek! And the fact that the Labor Party is taking comfort in comments made by British MPs is extraordinary. For instance, could one have asked the same MPs who made those statements whether they are going to kick in some money to clean up the mess at Maralinga? Will they compensate for the genocide wreaked on Tasmanian Aborigines by British colonial troops? Will they compensate the descendants of the Tolpuddle Martyrs? What about the children who were sent to Australia, as evidenced in the program dramatisation The Leaving of Liverpool? For that matter, we know that still in the UK there are parts of Britain owned by some families whose forebears were not much better than brigands. Mr Rocher-Rapers and pillagers.",35
19,Mr FILING,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Rapers and pillagersparticularly, I would say, in the lowlands of Scotland. Some were descended from the Norman invaders who dispossessed the Britons who were there in the first place. If I were a British visiting MP, I would keep pretty quiet about land rights. The other, more sinister, threat that they were making was about interfering in the enjoyment of many citizens around the world-not only Australian citizens-of the Sydney Olympics. I think it is something that we really ought to look at a little more seriously because, quite clearly, they are designing to destabilise the efforts Australia is making to present itself in the best light at the Sydney 2000 Olympics. I might also say that the question of property rights is something that I think fits hand in hand with some of the recent articles in the Sydney Morning Herald relating to this sense of insecurity that is becoming more and more prevalent in our community, particularly in relation to job security but also in the case of the connection or identification of people with their property rights and the way in which business is transacted by commercial and government interests. So when they see this type of debate over legislation, which is conducted in some cases in an atmosphere of almost near hysteria, then there is in some of what I consider mainstream Australians a growing sense of despair and despondency about the way in which their country is being run. I have to say that when you consider other circumstances relating to recent events following the Mabo and the Wik decisions-and I look back to those days; I am going to talk about this in a second-about the days following the Mabo decision and then the native title legislation and the Aboriginal Land Fund Bill, you have to see where people can become exasperated and frustrated with the way in which they see their government behaving. I also might add at the same time the fact that, in the same sort of atmosphere, we have seen that landmark report launched by the Governor General in relation to Aboriginal health outcomes. This is something that I think many Australians really look at and wonder and scratch their heads as to why we have allowed this particular situation to continue to exist. It exists even now, notwithstanding the best efforts of people who have endeavoured to solve or to try to ameliorate these sorts of problems. We have a problem in many remote and, for that matter according to the health outcomes report, rural towns with the fringe dwellers and also in the metropolitan areas. The health outcomes were equally unsatisfactory or disgraceful in all three areas, and is after substantial amounts of Australian taxpayers' money have been spent. And the question has to be asked: should those people who were responsible for the administration of those policies, those people who were the stewards of the policies that consumed those vast amounts of resources have to accept responsibility for the failure of the outcomes? They must do; that is a normal thing. The previous Labor administration-and, I might say, the previous coalition administration before that-obviously shunned and tried to avoid the responsibility that they must suffer for these particular matters remaining the same as they were over such a long period of time. The question is, in trying to overcome the dilemma posed by the Wik decision and by the failure of the Keating native title legislation, whether or not the Howard government's legislation or amendments will in fact work. I want to make it clear that I reject the opposition claims that the kind of legislation that we have before us is not needed to remedy the situation in regard to native title. That is an absolutely extraordinary assertion on the part of legislators when you consider the legal maze or minefield-using an analogy of recent note-of problems in resolving the question of land title, the question of access and the use of that particular land. The High Court in its Mabo decisions made legislation necessary to ensure that fairness applied to native title claimants and to other interested parties alike. In other words, there was a need for a legislative response but, unfortunately, the Native Title Bill was the wrong response. It has exacerbated the problem. The Labor government believed, when they proposed their act, that pastoral leases extinguished native title. They advised the community that this was the case. I was going to make some direct quotations in response to the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), but the point was that there was an agreement between the various parties concerned at the time based on the assumption that native title was extinguished in the case of leasehold property. These statements were unequivocal. Gareth Evans, the now Deputy that Leader of the Labor Party and then Attorney General, said: . . . the High Court will confirm that properly granted pastoral leases . . . do in fact extinguish native title. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said as much. That is our legal judgement, that is our belief ... That is the sort of contribution that he has made. In the first instance they predicated their legislation on the basis that leasehold grants had extinguished native title. Clearly, one would have assumed that they accepted that to be reasonable. Mr Rocher-Oh, no.",35
20,Mr FILING,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Not now, of course. They have changed their minds now. Mr Andren interjecting",36
21,Mr FILING,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The point was that, at the time the legislation was being debated, it was predicated on this basis. Whether or not the High Court accepted it, it is a fact that this parliament has a responsibility to legislate. It should not sit back and idly wait for judges to make law. We should be legislating to ensure that the laws are clear, unequivocal and in black and white for the benefit of all Australians. Former minister Collins, speaking two days later about Queensland pastoral leases, added, 'If those titles are valid, they extinguish native title.' The real problem as we know it is that the High Court did not confirm the previous government's view, and in the Wik decision decided that pastoral leases did not necessarily extinguish native title. As a result, a great deal of further uncertainty and confusion have clouded the concept of land use and the issue of rights. Action has to be taken by the parliament to remedy the situation. We are charged with that responsibility. This is the place where the people's representatives make the laws. It is our responsibility to respond, not merely to stand back and wait for the next High Court decision. In my view, action is essential if we are to maintain our nation's parliamentary tradition where the parliament makes laws and not the judiciary. One of the previous members in this debate kept going on and on about attacks on the High Court judiciary. It is not an attack on the High Court. The High Court has its role to play in our constitutional system of government, but so do we. We abrogate our responsibility if we do not act. As far as I can see, the real· decision to be made is not whether we should change the Native Title Bill 1993 but how far we ought to go. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has advised us in his second reading speech that, after four years and over 600 claims lodged under the act, there has been only one determination of native title on the mainland of Australia. That is an absolute disgrace. Clearly this is not an example of legislation which is working, and it must change. We have an absolute responsibility to ensure this is the case. I have heard it said that the issue of native title is now like a train which has built up momentum and is out of control. It seems inevitable that the train will crash, but the main priority of members of the Australian Democrats and some in the Labor Party seems to be to make sure that the public have the perception that they are not driving the train. Both the Labor Party and the Democrats were happy to allow pastoral leases to extinguish native title when it was predicated in the 1993 bill. Yet they claim that this new legislation, which does not even go that far, unfortunately, is flawed because it impinges on the rights of traditional owners or because it may breed more uncertainty. This is gross hypocrisy on the part of those who make that claim. I believe that a genuine attempt has been made in good faith by the government to resolve the issue of native title via the now famous lO-point plan. Unfortunately, the process is being captured by the key players or interest groups as determined by the government. I am not sure whether the government's legislation will solve the problems that it has attempted to solve. Those groups include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, mining companies, pastoralists and businesses such as professional fishermen. I do not intend going over the ground already covered by many government and non-government members on behalf of their own people other than to reiterate that there is an absolute need for fairness, transparency and equality in resolving the issue. I am interested, however, to note the facts introduced into this debate by the members for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly). Funds were made available largely by the Labor government to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to purchase land as compensation where native title was alleged to have been extinguished. From 1980 to 1989-prior to native title-the Aboriginal Development Commission bought 145 properties for Aboriginal communities at a cost of $32.2 million. From 1990 to 1996, ATSIC spent $89 million on the purchase of 196 properties. From 1993 to the year 2004, the Indigenous Land Fund has a target balance of $1.289 billion with an annual draw down of $45 million in perpetuity. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, who make up less than two per cent of the population, now own or control 15.3 per cent of Australia or 117 million hectares. This is an area greater than the size of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT combined. It is certainly greater than the area of the United Kingdom, Germany and France compined. This does not include private land tenures held by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This brings me to the point that the wider community have a right to be involved in the dispersal of land ownership and land rights in this country. They have not had the opportunity to be directly consulted, unless you consider some of the public opinion polls to be an adequate measure of the national view. This is unfortunate because one must recognise that there are broad public areas which must be considered. Take ownership and access to national parks and fishing rights as two examples. I have seen claims by a previous executive director of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Mr Jim Downey, that Aboriginal Australians could own 95 per cent of all national parks within 15 years. If this is to be arrived at through this legislation, we should be sure of what the broader community feel about this. They have a right to be involved in the allocation of ownership of national parks, which are an inseparable element of our national estate. They have been set up by various governments over many years with an expectation that they will guarantee public access and appreciation of the natural diversity of our nation. Private ownership of any such assets must be detrimental and will amount to nothing short of the needs of the many being subjugated to the needs of the few. My second example relates to fishing in Australia. As members are aware, native title claims exist for or have the potential to apply to much of our nation's coastline, estuaries, rivers, lakes and impoundments and to various offshore locations. I noted with interest that the Australian Seafood Industry Council was happy with and supportive of the government's legislation. The ASIC advised that it was content that its quiet lobbying had ensured that its interests had been included in the lO-point plan. It pointed particularly to point 8, which sought to guarantee that 'the ability of governments to regulate and manage surface and subsurface water, offshore resources and airspace and the rights of those with interests under any such regulatory or management regime, would be put beyond doubt'. What is less clear is how recreational fishermen will be affected by native title claims. I spoke on this way back in November 1993, when Labor introduced its Native Title Bill. I am forced to reiterate my concerns now, because I do not see the evidence that this bill will protect their more than the previous bill did. As I said then, native title legislation can only evoke the same kind of frustration from fishermen as it had from mining leaseholders and some pastoralists. Australians are just as passionate about the ocean-perhaps in some cases even more so-as they are about the land. It is as integral in our lifestyle as the great Australian dream of owning your own place. I do not just mean this in the context of a family trip to the beach, but also in relation to the ocean's riches. When the concept of claiming ownership of beaches and the seabed was raised at the time of the last bill, David Allen of the Northern Land Council was reported as saying: I believe that the response to such recognition will be even more aggressive than the response over native title to lands ... not only would commercial fishing interests be affected, but it would touch the hearts of all recreational fishermen. There is, in . . . Australia, a deep tradition that the sea and its resources belong to no-one and that, in a curious way the sea is the ultimately enduring terra nullius. Many Australians consider recreational fishing rights as their natural birth right and expect them to be guaranteed by the government. It is a legitimate expectation. I would hope that this native title legislation is capable of protecting those interests, but I am not so sure that is the case. I just want to briefly illustrate the potential by way of an example of another native title involving fishing rights. I would like to examine the history of the issue in Washington state, in the United States. Although the circumstances remain different from Australian native title, there are some clear lessons that can be drawn from the experience. I am indebted to American author Steve Raymond's research on this issue. It says: Salmon were the mainstay of the Indians' life. They returned to the rivers at predictable times each year and the Indians knew this and waited to catch them. Five of the six Pacific salmon species are found here and it seemed as though at least one of them was always running, from spring clear until the early days of winter ... The Indians fished with dip nets, crude gill nets, reef nets, spears and cleverly constructed traps; they caught fish in weirs and impoundments and they used jigging and interests any trolling methods. They fished mostly in the estuaries and rivers, but some ventured into Puget Sound or into the wild north Pacific Ocean. They learned not only the seasons but the locale in which the fish would run and returned there year after year . . . For centuries, the tribes lived in hannony with ... fish ... but in the1ate 18th century, they began; .. a series of brief encounters with ... white men who appeared off the coast ... And then the white men began to stay ... A treaty was signed in 1855 which moved the Indians onto reservations but allowed them to retain their fishing rights. The degradation of the environment saw the usefulness of these rights diminish and commercial fishing dramatically reduced the catch. Hatcheries were established to remedy the situation, but really only to benefit commercial fishermen. It also says: ... the Indians had little hope of obtaining relief in State courts. But federal courts were more friendly to their cause ... In a landmark decision in 1905 a settler was ordered to remove fish traps he had placed in traditional Indian fishing places. The US Supreme Court observed that the Indians' right to fish at their accustomed places was 'not much less necessary to the existence of the Indians than the atmosphere they breathed'. In 1970, 115 years after the treaty, their efforts paid off when the United States, acting as their trustee, represented their rights. But the courts took control of the state's fisheries management and fate then played a cruel trick on the non-Indian fishermen. It states: Most had fished all their lives, just as the Indians had once had; for many, fishing had become a way of life, just as it once was for the Indians. Nearly all considered that fishing was their natural right, just as the tribes had once believed. Suddenly, through circumstances beyond their control, that right had been wrenched away from them, just as it had been taken away from the Indians a hundred years before ... they felt the same bitter hurt and blind frustration that the Indians had felt ... The recognition of sea rights will involve a conceptual leap for Australians accustomed to the notion of the sea and its resources as a common property over which no-one has priority or exclusionary rights. There is a widely held belief that the ocean and its resources are there for the use and the enjoyment of all Australians. The real challenge for government is to meet these expectations within a fair plan that guarantees Aborigines are treated equitably in relation to all other Australians.",36
22,Mr ANDREN,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 may well tum out to be as futile an exercise as was the native title amendment bill of 1996. That bill of course was made redundant by the Wik ruling. This bill could well be invalidated by the outcome of the High Court's decision over the challenge to the Hindmarsh Island act. The problem we all face and which this bill does not address is defining the concept of native title. It does not fit neatly into white man's law. It is rather a label for a bundle of rights over land-many of which are alien to our system of tenure. I cannot define it, white lawyers cannot define it and this parliament, without one Aboriginal member, tries to speak on behalf of Aborigines or at least to define what it believes to be native title. The four majority judges in Wik concluded that undue emphasis should not be placed on notions of leasehold known to the English common law, such as the automatic right of exclusive possession. Rather, said the judges, pastoral leases should be seen as creatures of statutes designed for uniquely Australian conditions. That fact was recognised way back in 1848, when Colonial Secretary Earl Gray stated: I think it is essentiai that it should be generally understood that leases granted give the grantees only an exclusive right for the pasturage of their cattle as they may require within the large limits assigned to them. But these leases are not intended to deprive the natives of their former right to hunt over those districts or to wander over them in their search for subsistence in the manner to which they have been accustomed. So said Earl Gray in 1848. But if 150 years later we are about to upgrade these pastoral leases, which have evolved beyond just cattle grazing to include anything incidental to primary production, no-one could fairly argue that we should at the same time freeze native title holders in a subsistence time warp. They too should enjoy the commercial advantages of their title. They too should, to borrow a phrase from the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), be allowed to diversify their current limited options, even more limited by this bill. We certainly should not limit one title to advantage another. As Michael Warby of the Tasman Institute says in Past wrongs, future rights: If indigenous Australians are to build a better then their legal interest in land should not be in a form 'snap-frozen' by legislative fiat. They should be in forms that allow the titleholders themselves the widest possible range of options. Those options can only be determined through consultation and negotiation at a local level. Because native title is not something indigenous people own, native title rights cannot be bought or sold as freehold can, though the loss of native title can be compensated. Since the Wik case, Senator Bill O'Chee and others have been peddling the myth that native title tenure is the same as freehold title when, if they bothered to look, the courts have repeatedly stated this is not the case. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has insinuated, waving a shaded map of Australia about, that 80 per cent of Australia is up for grabs'under threat'. Read 'under freehold threat' in that. The NFF's Donald MCGauchie says that coexistence of different forms of land tenure is a concept totally alien to our system of law. What about landlords and leaseholders all over the country? What is so difficult about native title and pastoral rights coexisting? The Australian Law Reform Commission, which has had the apparent temerity, according to some, to comment on this most controversial piece of proposed legislation, has amply highlighted what a legal minefield the bill is. The commission, which the government wants to muzzle because it does not want to hear the message, believes: ... not only are the declared objectives of the bill mutually inconsistent but the proposed means by which they are to be achieved are inadequate and counterproductive. The bill, says the commission, will yield 'more, not less, litigation and compound uncertainty and lack of confidence in Australian real property law'. The commission also says that there is little doubt that these amendments do not advantage indigenous people, and so bring into play the race power and the intent of the 1967 referendum. This brought Aboriginal people within the head of legislative authority whereby, according to Justice Brennan: The odious policies of oppression and neglect of Aboriginal citizens were to be at an end, and that the primary object of the power is beneficial. future In fact, Australia's international obligations insist that any legislation enacted which impinges upon indigenous people should not disadvantage them. As I suggested in a question in this House on 16 June this year, every point bar to of the Prime Minister's 10point plan, upon which this bill is largely based, disadvantages the Aboriginal people. As the Australian Law Reform Commission points out, by expressly distinguishing potential native title holders from holders of other types of real property title and, on the basis of that distinction, treating them differently, the 'formal equality' imperative under sections 9 and 10 of the Racial Discrimination Act is contradicted. The to-point plan and the bill bear no relationship to the common law rights inherent in the Mabo and Wik judgments and will fundamentally restrict the legal rights of native title claimants. In fact, the commission argues-and I agree: It could reasonably be argued that, taken together, the ;voluminous provisions of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 should be characterised as a pastoral lease enhancement measure. As former NFF executive director Rick Farley points out: The government is faced with a gradual realisation by the community and the world of the tragedy of the stolen generation and this government's totally inadequate response. In this climate the government will have to argue that taxpayers' funds should be used to pay for the acquisition of indigenous native title rights in order to increase pastoralists' rights. Pastoralists will win from this bill because they will have their leases upgraded to allow any activities incidental to primary production as defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act. Other speakers have pointed out that many of these pastoralists are wealthy foreigners, such as the Sultan of Brunei. I ask: why should ordinary Australian taxpayers foot the bill to upgrade their investments by giving them virtual freehold title? Why should ordinary farmers in my Calare electorate who have worked hard and invested in freehold land foot the bill to upgrade the title for those people who have paid comparatively minimal amounts for their leases? Pastoralists will also benefit by having the taxpayer fund the just terms compensation which will be needed to compensate for the permanent extinguishment of any native title interests where its continuation is inconsistent with any acts incidental to primary production. However, this permanent extinguishment provision, according to the Law Reform Commission, is legally flawed. The commission says-and it can hardly be more clearly expressed: The proposed amendments seeking to extinguish permanently native title rights are, therefore, unjustifiable. There appears to be considerable doubt as to the validity of either of the available sources of constitutional authority for the Bill. the very least, should the Bill be enacted in its present form, there will be substantial grounds upon which it could, and likely will, be challenged before the courts. So not only is this bill morally and politically flawed; it is legally flawed. Let us look at some of the other weaknesses highlight by experts with far more learning than I. It is inconsistent with the requirements of the Racial Discrimination Act. The sunset clause may unknowingly deprive potential native title holders of their rights and be subsequently ruled unjust. It would breach Australia's obligations under international law, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I know the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and others would question the conspiratorial nature of these covenants under our United Nations obligations, but so too would such withdrawal from these obligations enable us to ignore the atrocities of East Timor and elsewhere. The compensation ramifications of this bill, too, are so huge that the taxpayers of Australia should be very alarmed at the likely cost of extinguishment of not only the property but the cultural rights of indigenous Australians. In my question to the Prime Minister on 16 June I said that only in part 10 of his lO-point plan was there a suggestion of a conciliatory mutual agreement avenue to establish native title. Only in this virtual add-on to the bill is there room to facilitate agreement between parties outside the court and the tribunal structures, for in all other aspects the bill provides for widespread extinguishment, which will remove incentives for industry and government to come to any sort of consensual resolution of native title issues. While the government could have shown the type of leadership required on this issue by drafting a bill based on recognition, acceptance and negotiation, it has instead opted for one based on denial, conflict and preferential treatment of the land interests of one group over another. But in so doing it has not delivered the sort of certainty it allegedly craves. It certainly delivered a certainty-the certainty of a lawyers' feast for years ahead At as native claimants seek common law recognition of their title rights. I must recount a conversation with a local Koori leader in my electorate in the last couple of days. He said to me, 'It is a bit like the days of Poseidon when there were nouveau riche created in St Ives and suburbs of Sydney on the boom of the s-ock market back in the 1960s. The question then was, ""Where did you make your money?"" ""I made it on Poseidon."" There will be a heap of lawyers down the track in 20 years and they will gather and say, ""Where did you make your money?"" ""I made it on native title.'"" Indigenous people have custodial responsibility for their own land and the general law applying to all Australians. As Rick Parley points out, the key to any resolution of native title claims is negotiation through processes that are flexible and regionally oriented. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) detailed the economic values of adopting this regional approach. Native title rights will vary from one area to another as indigenous customary law varies. This has been recognised in deliberations around the country where local negotiations are the most likely to achieve settlement. I sensed on a recent trip to north-western Australia a preference for local negotiation and settlement rather than imposed advice from 'suits from the south'. In closer settled areas, like that of Calare where the relocated or separated Kooris now live, there will obviously need to be a consensus among local elders. They are not fragmented to that degree-they are there; they still have influence and power despite the infiltration of the diseases and social ills that have served to even more fragment those people. There will need to be at least a recognition of the prior occupation by Aborigines of that now closely settled land-a tangible recognition-and a social justice package to compensate for the lack of opportunity, the deprivation of land and the forced relocation and disruption of families that that has caused to these people. As Farley says, any single white fella solution is a pipedream. As we debate this bill let us remember the words of Queensland pastoralist Ms Camilla Cowley which were quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald last week. She said: Months ago I was angry and confused when a native title claim was made over land which included my property. I immediately looked into what it meant and what could be done. But the deeper I investigated the more I realised that the property that had been in my family for over two decades was not actually under threat. There's too much confusion and misunderstanding around the whole debate. Ms Cowley goes on: As a landholder I am confident co-existence is not only possible, it's the only decent way forward the stakeholders and Nation as a whole. I, like others, listened closely to the courageous words of the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), a government member, in this place and on this bill last night. Among many eloquent points he made from his well-documented perspective as a champion of human rights, he stressed that this debate comes down to a legal versus moral judgment. The Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund will table its majority and minority reports to this parliament next week and they will canvass the legal and moral arguments. The member for New England (Mr Sinclair) says that we cannot look back, that we must account for the fact that the traditional links between the Aborigine and the land have been fractured-so they may have in many casesand it is only through the restoration of those links, not through freehold but through genuine coexisting native title, that we can restore the dignity of Aborigines. Only then, to use the words of the member for New England, can we 'bring Aborigines into tomorrow's Australia' - although I would rather suggest that they would find their own way. One fact that we cannot deny as we debate the need for certainty of title is that 30,000, 40,000 or perhaps 120,000 years of native title is an absolute certainty. Terra nullius was, as Mabo decreed, a nonsense-225 years of very unequal coexistence puts that original title into some sort of perspective. This bill does not provide for genuine coexistence. It is a gross overreaction which misses the point of just what native title is. Not only does it wrongly react to a feared land grab; it also provides for an air grab, for heaven's sake. Why? It dramatically sets back the reconciliation process, it risks enormous and justifiable scorn and for those reasons will not have my support.",39
23,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Many of the earlier speakers would have made far more incisive and informed contributions in this debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill. I have not had the opportunity to focus on it and to play an active role in some of the committees within for the various parties in the parliament that have dealt with it over a very long period. I do, however, want to make a few brief comments on some of the earlier contributions. As usual, the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) dished up the simplistic, easy, facile answers to these measures. Her contribution was rhetoric about 'one people emerging as one nation', et cetera. In reality, if we look around the world we see that there is always the facility and the possibility of causing dissension and division without any of the characteristics of the multicultural in this country that she so despises and attacks. If, for instance, we look at Europe we find in Spain the nationalist cravings of Basques and Catalans; over the last five to 10 years we have seen moves by northern Italy, under Mr Bossi leading a political party, that seek to divide Italy; in Scandinavia in recent weeks we have seen in the Norwegian elections a party which has had as one of its essential measures an attempt to decrease the rights of Laplanders-it has emerged as a very tangible and strong political force in Norway. Despite the member for Oxley'S rhetoric, despite the fact that this country has been populated by many peoples with many backgrounds, we still see throughout Europe-in cultures where the division lines and the dissension are not around the introduction of new races or around immigration-the distinct possibility that people who wish to use racial and ethnic differences may be able to exploit them politically. The member for Oxley's contribution to this debate is in line with those same politicians in Europe who seek to divide nations. In this country the situation is exacerbated by the deep uncertainty amongst people in the Australian electorate about their job security: uncertainty about the employment prospects for their children after they complete TAPE courses or high school and insecurity for themselves, when they are thrown onto the retrenchment scrap heap at 45 years of age, about whether they will ever be employed again. But native title is an issue the nation must face up to, and it should not be faced up to with contributions such as the characteristipoliticians cally divisive one made by the member for Oxley. I welcome the member for Oxley's recent statements about her intention to broaden her political base with a new emphasis in regard to the needs of ex-servicemen, the defence forces, et c.etera. Nevertheless, I would mention once again that, despite her newfound emphasis on this policy area, in regard to defence home loans last night, once againfor the third consecutive time-we found her unable to vote on a measure in this House. If that is her contribution in an area she wants to put a new emphasis on, I would hate to see the legislative role she might play on measures in those areas in which she has less interest. In one of his contributions the member for Moore (Mr Filing) expressed disdain for the intervention of British MPs. He referred to what the British had done centuries ago, suggesting they might have some debt because of the Tolpuddle Martyrs and questioning whether they have a contribution to make because of what happened in Van Dtemen's Land. It came as a bit of a surprise to me that the member for Moore made that contribution: I seem to recall that, in regard to the internal affairs of the then Yugoslavian state, no-one was as forthright and public as the member for Moore. I seem to recall that he rushed onto planes to be there, under shelling, during the initial outburst of disputes in that country. At that stage no-one asked the member for Moore whether, given his country's previous practices against Aboriginals, he had a right to comment on the division of Yugoslavia or to make a point in regard to Croatia's future. He is just making a hypocritical contribution, in order to undermine a number of people from all political parties in the United Kingdom who question this attempt to undermine Aboriginal rights in Australia. The member for Moore is a man who has taken a very noteworthy and strong role in human rights around the world-in Timor and in a number of other countries. It is a bit cynical or a bit hypocritical of him today to be somehow disdainful and to find something wrong with from another country commenting on our internal affairs. All of us have a degree of survival instinct, but I was a bit disillusioned by the member for Moore's reference, again, to the fact that Aboriginals constitute only two per cent of Australia's population and currently hold, by various means; an area, as he said, 'greater than New South Wales, Victoria, the ACT and Tasmania combined', and by his claim that they might, according to the ACF, control 90 per cent of national parks in this country in future generations or years. He well knows that the value of the vast majority of this land is insignificant compared to the actual value of this country. To start saying that commercially useless tracts of land in the middle of nowhere should be put on a comparative basis with Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane is absolutely ridiculous. The opposition comes to this debate determined to try to ensure that a degree of certainty does come to this area. It is not here to obstruct the interests of pastoralists just for the sake of it. It is here to make sure that we do have legislation which will get judicial approval. What this poll-driven government is doing, essentially, is kowtowing to what they perceive as the instincts of the Australian electorate. Although I must concede that significant numbers of the members of this House do, because of the nature of the areas they represent, have a fundamental and very deep concern with the interests of landowners or of pastoralists, their interest is not fundamentally with those matters. We have this Native Title Bill here today because this country's Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, time after time, that his interest and his policies are driven by the Daily Telegraph and a few radio commentators. That is why we are here today, not because of any real concern with pastoralists. Labor's alternative, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) announced on 25 September, is based around certain fundamental principles. Those principles include the principle that the legislation should balance and reconcile, to the maximum possible extent, the interests and reasonable expectations of both indigenous Australians and other major stakeholders; the principle that there be the maximum possible predictability and certainty about the status of the act and its practical operation; the principle that it should further guarantee the constitutional validity of the legislation; and the principle that the processes established by the legislation to deal with the registration and determination of claims and the reconciliation of competing interests be as effective and expeditious as possible. The opposition's amendment goes on to say, essentially, that Labor has concerns that the reach of the validation provisions in the bill are beyond those necessary for the practical redress of post-Wik problems-that there is manifestly unacceptable overreach in regard to the provisions purporting to confirm the extinguishment of native title. Labor comes to this debate determined to get a measure of consensus and to try to get measures which will, as I said earlier, get through the court systems of this country. That should be the fundamental desire of all of us. The genesis of this process was Mabo No. 2 in 1993, which repudiated the doctrine of terra nullius. It is all right for the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, (Mr Tim Fischer) to carry on every second day of the week about whether that judgment was carried by a majority of one, two or three. The fact of life is that the High Court of this country made a determination. The Deputy Prime Minister talks about the legitimacy of particular decisions, as if any rational person would question the doctrine of terra nullius more than the size of the majority in regard to this measure. To assume in 1997 that the basis for decades and centuries of ignoring of Aboriginal indigenous rights in this country-the basis being that there was no established society here and, therefore, the white colonialists had a right to push people off their land and tum it over to another people-was neither intelligent nor rational is more intelligent and rational than discussing whether or not in 1993 the decision to make that assumption was agreed to by a majority of only one. If we go through the court decisions of this country over the last century, we find that similar quibbling and whingeing could have occurred over a variety of fairly crucial cases. The fact is that the court decided in that manner, and to try to discredit that decision on the basis of how many were for or against is absolutely preposterous. The process then went to the then government's legislation, and no-one on this side of politics has disputed that there is a need for remedial action. There is a need for improvement in regard to its operation- But what we are going to see here, whether it is under section 51(xxvi), the race power, or whether it is under section 51 (xxix), the external affairs power, is this legislation having difficulties. This legislation has no certainty. This legislation is going to be attacked in a legal fashion because there is no benefit in it to the Aboriginal people. It is essentially a taking away of rights and an undermining of their condition. If it is based on the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, it certainly discriminates against a racial group. What we have here is an attempt to undermine the legislation of the previous government, which set up an Indigenous Land Fund, an Indigenous Land Corporation and a social justice package to try to do something about the disadvantages of Aboriginals in this country. It involved something that is not present here today and that has certainly not been a facet of what has happened in the government's process to get here today, that is, a degree of goodwill and trust on both sides of this contentious issue. The Aboriginal leadership in this country has had far greater difficulties than either the major political parties in regard to this measure. It has had to go out into a community that tends to operate on consensus and show a degree of leadership and a willingness to compromise and to give up rights in regard to the. validation of acts that it would regret and dispute. It has had to sell these propositions to a diverse community ranging through a very different set of living and housing patterns around this country-people dispersed from their lands and not connected to where they come from. It has had to go out and sell this kind of negotiating process. It has had to go out there and basically repudiate a lot of the political demands it has been making over many decades. So it has been a very difficult process for the Aboriginal leadership of this country to even get up to the Labor government's proposals. What we have seen since the election of the new government is an attempt to ignore, isolate and ridicule the leadership of the Aboriginal community. They have joined with the opposition in very grave concerns about where the government is going in this legislation. On 24 September this year, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission made a number of points of concern about where the government eventually arrived. It saw the legislation which the government proposes as follows: 1. The extensive extinguishment of native title contained in the Bill. 2. The attack on the right to negotiate contained in the Bill. 3. The problem of only those native title holders who currently have access being given interim statutory access rights under this Bill, and thus potentially denying this opportunity to a whole generation of Aboriginal people who were denied access in the past through no fault of their own. 4. Serious doubts that exist over significant parts of these amendments in terms of conflict with the Racial Discrimination Act and their potential to be invalid on constitutional grounds. Previous speakers have gone through what they see as a number of erosions of rights and a significant plethora of ways in which this legislation denies Aboriginals rights that were integral to the previous act. The bill is convoluted and complex. We :::>f know that there have been cascades of additional memoranda and we know the size of this bill. It is, as stated by a large number of speakers, not aimed at reconciliation, not aimed at trying to ensure a balance and not aimed at any certainty .to make sure that both mining and pastoral interests know where they are going. It is, as indicated on television in the last few weeks, politically driven. There is a hope that the degree of uncertainty and the lack of knowledge on the part of the broad electorate of the issues involved can be manipulated by maps of Australia being held up on national television by the Prime Minister of this country, with extremist projections of what Aboriginals will possibly receive. That is what is driving this. Many speakers and many experts have indicated that there is no fundamental threat to the traditional farming practices of people involved and that the building of dams and roads will still be able to be undertaken without any real problems. However, it has been indicated-and I think it is quite reasonable-that, if people do want to undertake major structural changes to the farm as it has been for decades, there should be some oversight as to whether that is reasonable. What we are seeing here today is an attempt to undermine the Wik decision and to erode Aboriginal rights. We should recognise what is happening in this country and we should understand that it is a continuing process internationally. Many people decry the condition of Aboracist riginals in this country: their health problems, their housing difficulties,their failure to gain tertiary education, their inability .in cases to finish secondary school and the fact that they are· condemned to the worse labourlerying jobs in this country. They decry the fact that in previous decades their children were taken from them and, in many cases, told their parents were deceased or not interested chamber. in them. The fact is that, still in 1997, families try to pretend that relatives of theirs are not Aboriginal because of the degree embarrassment, the disdain and the discrimicomments nation against them. This is not a tenet necessarily associated with Aboriginality; it is an international ph{!nomenon we are seeing today. If we look at South America we see right now, as we speak in this parliament, the removal of people in Amazonia as Brazil expands its economy, destroying forests and putting roads through for petrol. We have seen articles recent weeks in Colombia of isolated commuwith nities that have had minimal contact previousthis ly with Western society forced off their land because of the desire by international petrol companies for profits. If we look at Canada we see the condition of the Inuits. We see the way in which the Canadian government has taken a more active role in trying to accomplish reconciliation. As the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) indicated, this was not a fiveminute process; it took 16 years of negotiations to create the state of Nunavut in northdeception, ern Canada. We must, in 1997, face the reality of what has happened in this country: that it was expropriation by force, that it was supported by illegitimate legal pretension in regard terra nullius and that these people were essentially put into a condition which we see today around the world. As I said, it is novel; it is essentially part of what is ing in large parts of South and Central Ameriseize ca, to which another speaker referred earlier. The Japanese government has, in recent months, woken up to the need to recognise the rights of the Ainu, their indigenous people. This legislation is a continuation of those processes. It is a failure to really move towards reconciliation. It is an attempt to exploit uncertainty and racism in this country. many I commend the amendment to the House. An incident having occurred in the gal",42
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! Participation from the gallery that is not, by convention, undertaken in this  of p.m.)- Mr Deputy Speaker, I hear your to those people in the gallery but I put it to you that there has been no issue of greater emotion before this parliament than the issue now before it. I recall on numerous occasions there has been loud clapping from the gallery when there have been blatantly political matters before this chamber, and the people involved in that clapping and cheering were essentially political apparatchiks of the now government. I know that in your indulin gence and in your generosity you recognise, your legal background, just how much legislation means to so many Australians, not only indigenous Australians but those who understand and feel for them. I would like to think that you are amongst that group. I find it beyond comprehension that on an Issue like this, clarifying the rights of indigenous Australians to the access and use of land on a shared basis, which is something they have been doing almost since time of settlement, there has been such a campaign of of misrepresentation, of alarm and of setting Australian against Australian in trying to promote the belief that that small segment of our population-who suffer the lowest incomes in the nation, who have the to shortest life expectancies, who have the greatest period of incarceration on a proportionate basis and who have the poorest stannot dard of health in the nation-are somehow happenogres, monsters almost, who are going to our lands, defile our women, steal our children and otherwise expel most Australians from this continent. That is the nature of some of the claims, exaggerations and representations I have seen over the months that this legislation has been around and has been talked about. The most despicable thing of all that I have seen in the discussion thus far was that mentioned by the earlier speaker, the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), in his reference to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The role of a Prime Minister and the· role of a government is to lead and to unite, particularand lyon an issue like this. On the night I just happened to have glimpsed the television news bulletin, the Prime Minister of Australia was holding up a map drawn and coloured in a way that led people to believe that somehow the vast majority of land in our nation was to be at risk of seizure by indigenous Australians-those infidels! Mr O'Connor-Disgraceful! He ought to get out of the gutter. The Prime Minister ought to get out of the gutter.  despicable and disgraceful act I have ever seen of any Prime Minister. He may have to climb up into the gutter, my dear friend. A Prime Minister's role is to lead and to uniteto bring Australians together-particularly on an issue like this, where emotions can run so high and misunderstandings and misrepresentations can be so easily manufactured, which is very much what has been happening. This legislation is extremely sensitive to many Australians of all origins, from diverse backgrounds and of differing periods of presence in this land. I am here as a result my'father arriving here from Greece in 1916. Many other members of this parliament in years gone by have a similar background. Some of the animosity and abuse that is extended towards indigenous Australians today is similar to that extended towards my father and towards us as children. We coped with that; we had to cope with that. We are not black, so we did not stand out as indigenous Australians stand .out, but that same behaviour of fear, of ignorance and of prejudice, and the generation of those prejudices and animosities between Australians, is what is being utilised by so many on the government side of this parliament today and by supporters of the government's side. Most of all, this legislation· goes to the root and foundation of today' s Australia and to the rights and interests of our indigenous people. Australia will be judged by the rest of the world on the manner in which we handle this legislation; on the manner in which we handle the rights, the interests, the culture and the beliefs of the original inhabitants of our land their descendants. Australia will be judged on the fairness we extend to our indigenous peoples and their descendants. The legislation before us today is not the result of some great statesmanlike process to set, as a model for the rest of the world, how we should accord and deal with the rights of our indigenous peoples and their descendants; it is the result of a political fix. It is the result of a brawl within the National Party over how to get some form of words before the parliament. Again despicable is the claim of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) that the language of the provisions of the bill leads one to believe there will be 'bucketloads of extinguishment' . What the Deputy Prime Minister is really saying is, 'Have no fear, we'll get rid of the rights of indigenous Australians; don't you worry about that.' I can almost hear old Sir Joh saying, 'Don't you worry about that' when I see the Deputy Prime Minister saying 'bucketloads of extinguishment'. The code language is, 'Don't you worry about that, those of you who are concerned as landholders and supporters of the National Party; of we'll fix the indigenous Australians because we intend that the meanings within the provisions of that bill will achieve the objectives you want.' That is not leadership. This country deserves something better from a Prime Minister and a Deputy Prime Minister on an issue like this. This bill has the potential to rip asunder the fragile fabric that is our national character, our Australia. It has the potential to set Australian against Australian for years to come. Once Australia has been ripped asunder, it will take decades to heal the divisions, the hurt and the sheer animosity that I see in and hear from those who cannot accept, cannot tolerate that indigenous Australians do have rights and are entitled to equality of entitlements and opportunities. The Native Title Act 1993 is complex legislation because it deals with a complex range of issues that have remained unaddressed for so long. But the legislation, by the very nature of the problem, has to be complex if we are to find a solution. That complexity will be exacerbated by this bill, should it be passed in its existing form. Instead of bringing greater clarity, predictability and certainty to native title matters, it will massively increase the uncertainty surrounding them. It will set Australian against indigenous Australian for decades to come, and it will demean Australia in the eyes of the world. The Native Title Act 1993 was arrived at through extensive consultation of the people it most affects-the indigenous people of our country, as well as farmers and miners. In arriving at this decision, all concerned had to compromise. But they should not be expected to give up more. The Native Title Act 1993 was 127 pages; and, despite all the government's complaints that it is an act which is far too complex and complicated, the Native Title Amendment Bill before us now runs for 293 pages, with an explanatory memorandum that runs for 385 pages. In this complex national discussion of native title, Mabo and the Wik decision of the High Court, the most deplorable development has been the incredible efforts of the Queensland government and the Queensland Premier, Rob Borbidge, to misrepresent the implications of native title. What Rob Borbidge was really about was a different agenda altogether; with a hung parliament, he was about trying to create an issue for an election campaign in Queensland. It had nowt to do with the merits of the native title legislation. It had to do setting black against white, Aborigine or indigenous Australian against non-indigenous Australian; to create an election issue to divide Queensland leading to an election. Fortunately, Mr Borbidge has failed. He did not get the election he wanted, and he will not get it now. Again, it was a political fix for the National Party in country Australia involving fear, exaggeration, and anti-Aboriginal campaigns that will only damage the fabric of the nation that these people purport to protect. The member for Moore (Mr Filing), who spoke earlier, may not like the criticism of Australia from abroad. But I want to say to him also tlrat the manner in which we treat our indigenous Australians is of interest to the rest of the world. They will comment upon us and our performance in a similar way to when we commented upon South Africa and its treatment of its native peoples during its period of apartheid. In the discussion leading to the Native Title Act 1993, I said that everybody had to compromise-and we do not expect that people should have to give up more. But the emphasis in this bill appears to have changed from certainty for all those concerned to the security of pastoral leaseholders, never mind the indigenous Australians. The Australian Labor Party, the federal opposition, is interested in delivering justice to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and genuine certainty and predictability for all stakeholders, especially farmers and miners. Effectively, this bill is about the extinction of native title-as I referred earlier to the continued statements of the Deputy Prime Minister, 'bucket loads of extinguishment' in that bragging fashion in which he puts it. The 1993 act accepted the concept of native title, and set out to address the attendant problems. It confirmed the validity of every previously issued title, and set down a process for the expeditious and cost effective handling of native title claims. The negotiations that the government of the day went through were genuine. They were not simply a crude sales exercise for a prewith determined government position. It was not legislation dressing up in clothes a decision that has already been taken which actually seeks to attain an objective different from that of the legislation that is now before us. The goal was to deliver certainty, clarity, workability and practicability from a position of respecting everyone's rights, and the conviction that certainty for any of the interest groups could only come from consensus. At the time, the now government, as the then opposition, showed no respect for the existence of native title; this legislation and their behaviour since and as a government exhibit that same attitude still. In the end, indigenous people were given the right to negotiate. But what this government is about now is taking away the right to negotiate in any meaningful form. The courts were yet to rule on critical issues, such as the continued existence of native title on pastoral leases; and, in 1993, the decision was to leave that to the courts to decide. The High Court has now decided that it was obvious that the act would need to be amended at a relatively early stage. With cases already being in the court, such amendments would have to ensure that existing cases were not compromised and would have to constitute a measured response rather than an overreaction to sectional pressures-and, particularly, sectional party political pressures. The coalition went to the polls in 1996 as enthusiastic converts to the concept of native title. They said, in effect, 'Elect us, trust us, and we will not change a thing.' The Wik proposition is that native title might, in theory, persist on some pastoral leases but that any such title was emphatically extinguished or suppressed to the extent that it was in any way inconsistent with a pastoralist's enjoying of his or her title. Wik confirmed the pastoralists' title-yet, with the hysteria that followed the decision, one would, in the general community, come to think the opposite. This bill is a gross overreaction to the Wik decision on behalf of the government, an overreaction that ignores the rights of indigenous Australians. It asks that massive schedules provided by state governments of purportedly exclusive possession acts should be incorporated in this bill without a shred of corroborating evidence that this is indeed the case. It winds back the right to negotiate that Aboriginals gained as part of the 1993 package. It winds it back to such an extent that it may as well not exist at all. This amendment is effectively about the mass extinguishment of native title. As I said, the Deputy Prime Minister bragged about bucketloads of extinguishment. This amendment, far from being about certainty, is a recipe for uncertainty for pastoralists, uncertainty for miners and uncertainty for indigenous interests. The amendment massively increases the complexity and volume of work for court and tribunal registrars, but it is silent on the resources for doing the job-again, a recipe for bottlenecks and delays. The amendment ignores the Racial Discrimination Act and invites legal challenge under the constitution. The bill must be improved to offer greater certainty, real workability and real equity for all stakeholders. Such certainty was washed away when this government came to power. From that moment they have walked away from the agreement and the compromise that was reached between indigenous Australians, the government of the day, miners and farmers. The 1993 act was implemented with certain core principles: ungrudging and unambiguous recognition and protection of native title; provision for clear and certain validation of past acts, including grants and laws, if they have been invalidated because of the existence of native title; a just and practical regime governing future grants and acts affecting native title; and rigorous, specialised and accessible tribunal and court processes for determining claims to native title and for negotiation and decisions on proposed grants over native title land. The government's current proposals in this legislation change each and every one of these core principles to the detriment of indigenous Australians. The previous agreement meant sacrifice on the part of all of the parties that participated in those discussions that led up to the framing and passage of the legislation of 1993. The previous agreement meant sacrifice but it was an agreement which respected the rights of pastoralists, miners, indigenous Australians and others with an interest in the land. It is clear from the legislation that the government has no such respect for that legislation or for those rights. Last night I was greatly impressed to hear the words of the member for Aston (Mr Nugent). I understand that as a member of the government it is extremely difficult for him to put the views that he put, but he will go down in the history of this parliament as a man of great principle, a man who, given his background in Aboriginal affairs as shadow minister and his service in this parliament, had a greater ambit of understanding of all Australians, but particularly indigenous Australians, than other members of the government. I would like to quote him in reference to Australia. I quote from page 9343 where he is talking about multiculturalism: By any standards, Australia has been one of the most cohesive, peaceful and harmonious. nations on earth. Multiculturalism has enriched the state. I want to endorse those remarks. Multiculturalism means we are a nation drawn from many different cultures-more than 160 different cultures drawn from more than 100 nations. We are a model for the rest of the world, or we have been until just recently, and we want to resume that role of being a model of how those peoples drawn from those nations, of so many different cultures, have welded a stronger sense of independence, of freedom, of compassion, of tolerance, of understanding and of recognising the rights of other Australians, all those races and groups that go to make up this nation. I want to conclude with some other words of his. He said: We need to note that native title is a form of title within the nation state, as is freehold or leasehold title. And yet native title is a very different form of title from the usual understanding of property ownership inherent in freehold or even leasehold. It must coexist with leasehold and, where there is a conflict, the rights of the leaseholder prevail. Native title holders are in no sense the sole property owners of the land over which they have been granted title. They must share it with the Crown or with the leaseholder, having only traditional rights and limited negotiation rights over what happens on that land. I commend his words to the parliament. I strongly endorse what he said on those matters I have quoted, and I commend him as a member of this parliament for the contribution he has made to this issue, the most important issue this parliament has seen for many decades. And I commend the amendments that have been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to the parliament.",46
25,Mr WILLIAMS,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I thank all the many members of the House who. have participated in this lengthy debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. Native title is a difficult issue for Australia. It is complex, it evokes passion and it is novel. It is clearly an issue which will require long-term consideration by this parliament and the nation as its characteristics become more apparent. This bill is another step in the process. The government believes the bill is a balanced and practical response to the challenging issues which have emerged since the Native Title Act was passed at the end of 1993. Certainly it goes much further along the way towards certainty than the current act. In summing up, I want to focus on a number of issues where, judging from the comments of some speakers, clarification is necessary about what the amendments actually do so that further debate is better informed. Few opponents of the bill appear to understand, or are willing to concede, that there are substantial deficiencies in the act which must be remedied if the coexistence of native title with other interests is to be accommodated in our legal system. By way of example, the current act could mean that holders of pastoral leases where native title may coexist may not be able to continue activities that are legal under the terms of their leases and essential to their businesses or to diversify their activities without extinguishing native title. This is because the conventional wisdom in 1993 was that native title would be found to exist in some fairly limited and remote parts of Australia and it would not be interacting with other interests. As a consequence, the act was not designed to deal with coexisting rights and interests. We now know that this perceived wisdom is false. The act needs to be changed to put in place a more appropriate future act regime, in particular for pastoral lease land. The bill does this. A constant refrain from the opposition is that the bill lacks a proper constitutional foundation. The government has obtained formal constitutional advice from the Solicitor-General to the effect that the bill is entirely supported as a special law under the races power of the constitution. Nevertheless, the government recognises that the constitutional validity of the bill is likely to be challenged, just as the Native Title Act itself was challenged, on the basis that the races power does not support detrimental laws. The view of the government is that the bill is not detrimental, but even if it were it would, on existing authority, be supported by the races power. Assertions about constitutional validity should not prevent passage of the bill any more than they prevented passage of the Native Title Act in 1993. It has been alleged by some that the bill overrides or overturns the decisions of the High Court in Mabo No. 2 and Wik. The government rejects these suggestions. On the contrary, the act, as amended by the bill, will recognise and protect native title in Australia, including coexisting native title on pastoral lease land. The bill allows native title to continue to exist on pastoral lease land and land subject to other lessor interests and mining leases and for it to be claimed over such land. The bill adopts the very test in Wik that native title has been extinguished to the extent that the grant of rights and interests to lessees are inconsistent with native title rights and interests, but the bill leaves it to the courts to assess the level of this inconsistency. The bill provides-again as the court held in Wikthat the lessees' rights prevail. It implements this principle in the practical real world of primary production activities. It is argued by some that the validation provisions are not justified because governments wilfully ignored the possibility that native title existed on pastoral leases. The acts to be validated were done on the assumption that governments were free to do various acts over pastoral lease and other leasehold land without following the processes of the Native Title Act. This was an assumption supported by the decision of the High Court in Mabo No.2, by many statements of the former government, by the Native Title Act itself, by the practice of the National Native Title Tribunal and by decisions of the Federal Court. It is clear that the assumption that pastoral leases had extinguished native title was one which legitimately could have been held and one which was encouraged by the previous government. The government believes that grants made on the basis of this assumption should be validated by legislation. It is not possible to provide the necessary validity through agreements. The confirmation provisions are vital to ensuring certainty in areas of Australia where, on any reasonable assessment, native title has been extinguished. The .act currently leaves these issues to be determined by the common law. The bill will allow confirmation of the extinguishment of native title in line with Mabo No. 2 and Wik. The government has released schedule 4 of the bill which, as previously foreshadowed, I will be seeking to move as a government amendment to the bill. The schedule includes types of agricultural, residential, commercial and community purpose leases which the Commonwealth and the relevant state or territory believe with reasonable certainty have conferred exclusive possession and have therefore extinguished native title. The schedule does not contain any pastoral leases or other lessor interests, and mining leases are specifically excluded. The parliamentary joint committee has heard evidence from the states that the Commonwealth has taken a particularly conservative approach to the inclusion of tenures in the schedule. The argument has been made that this approach pre-empts the common law. But to leave these issues to be determined on a case by case basis by the courts would create an enormous cost and leave enormous uncertainty. From the government's point of view, such a massive expenditure for no, or very little, tangible benefit to Aboriginal peoples cannot be justified. Expenditure should be directed to . determining where native title exists and protecting the rights of the holders, not to confirming on a case by case basis where it has been extinguished. The ope;ration of the proposed amendments relating to primary production have been widely misunderstood. That was evident from some of the contributions to the debate by members of the opposition. The fact is that the current act contains very limited mechanisms for managing future acts on pastoral leases. The bill makes explicit for the first time: that pastoralists are able to carry on primary production activities on the pastoral lease and that those activities prevail; state and territory governments are able to continue to authorise primary production activities; state and territory governments are able to continue to .authorise pastoralists who carry on activities outside the farm area which are directly related to the primary production activities on the lease; and State and territory governments can continue to authorise the taking of natural resources from pastoral leases. These acts will be subject to the nonextinguishment principle. These provisions in the bill do not confer on the pastoralist or any other person any additional rights to do the activities in question and say nothing about the validity or lawfulness of pastoralists' activities under state or territory law. The management of pastoral leases remains a matter for the relevant state or territory government, as it always has been. The same applies in relation to environmental controls. It is wholly inappropriate that it should be suggested that native title legislation should now be used as an instrument of environmental regulation. Moreover, contrary to some of the grossly inaccurate reporting over the past six months, it is not the case that the amendments 'Yill result in a windfall for foreign pastoral leaseholders. In relation to future development on pastoral leases, the policy of the government is to ensure that futurelegitimate land management needs for native title and non-native title such as suburban developments, public infrastructure and agricultural developments, can be accommodated. It is hoped that this can be by way of agreement with native title holders and others, and the agreement provisions in the bill facilitate this. There may, however, be occasions when agreements cannot be reached. The protections in the current act against non-consensual extinguishment of native title on pastoral lease land or elsewhere are maintained and, indeed, strengthened. They will ensure that the only way native title can be extinguished in the future is by agreement or by way of non-discriminatory compulsory acquisition. Contradictory views have been expressed about the efficacy of the right to negotiate provisions. The facts are these: in Western Australia, of the 1,910 acts which have been subject to the full right to negotiate process, only 148 have been cleared for grant as at 10 October 1997, a clearance rate of about 7.7 per cent. The greater than 90 per cent clearance rate often quoted is for exploration licences which have not gone through the right to negotiate processes and for which there is no protection under the act. It is argued, however, that it is essential to retain the right to negotiate on both exploration and mining in order to protect native title. The fact is that the alternatives in the bill for this double right to negotiate provide for the first time appropriate protection through conjunctive agreements and through a regime which requires consultation on access and site protection and recognises the need to establish contact between the miners and indigenous peoples at an early stage. So far as ministerial intervention in the right to negotiate process is concerned, the power is constrained by strict criteria. The minister cannot intervene in the right to negotiate processes at will. There has been some criticism of the proposal to allow the states and territories to apply their own regime on coexisting tenures in place of the right to negotiate. These are areas where, if native title exists, the native title holders do not enjoy a right to exclude others and have, at best, only coexisting rights. In the land, government's view, it is inappropriate to equate native title rights in these areas to full ownership rights. The government's position is that the states and territories should be able to replace the right to negotiate provided that significant procedural protections for native title holders are provided. There is widespread support for the enhanced agreements process in the bill. Most interest groups recognise the potential for such agreements to provide lasting and workable resolution to native title land use and coexistent issues at a local or regional level either with or without government participation. Together with the enhanced representative body scheme and the increased availability of funding to develop local or regional agreements, the new agreement provisions provide an attractive alternative to the more formal and adversarial processes for resolving native title related issues. There is general agreement that the Native Title Act needs to have an effective registragroups. tion test which can ensure that only claims. with merit are registered and bring an the problem of overlapping and multiple claims. The changes to the legal aid scheme recognise the importance of agreements resolving native title issues. They also recogand nise that native title is a new area of the confronting a variety of interest holders in the tralia. land. Amendments to section 183 deliver greater parity of access to government assistothers ance for respondent parties in native title matters by replacing the hardship test with a reasonableness test to widen the range of persons who can receive such assistance. Allegations have been made government failed to consult on the bill and, in particular, to negotiate on its contents with indigenous groups. It is true that the governDeputy ment did not make the same mistake as the former government and negotiate with particuwith lar groups to the exclusion of others with legitimate interests in the outcome. What the table. government did do was to follow an open and consultative process, from its ment of the lO-point plan, the development of the working draft bill and the bill's subsequent refinement for introduction into parliament to the'development of the schedule of exclusive tenures attached to the bill. It had significant discussions with indigenous representatives and the bill includes proposals put forward by them. The government has continued this approach before the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. The Special Minister of State (Senator Minchin) is on the record as saying that serious consideration will be given to any proposals, consistent with the 10-point plan, which improve the bill. There has been too much exaggeration and posturing by some about this issue and too few people have done the hard work to look at it carefully. The government continues to believe that the bill is a fair balance. It substantially implements the Wik decision. It does not involve the wholesale extinguishment of native title on pastoral lease land. It meets many of the concerns of indigenous Of course, like all advocates for a cause, some indigenous leaders would like end to much more, but the government and the parliament are obliged to balance the aspirations of indigenous peoples with sensible and in workable solutions which meet those needs aspirations in concert with the needs and law aspirations of the whole community of AusThe government welcomes the views of about the bill. But critics and commentators have a responsibility to be properly informed and to take into account all interests, not just promote one group. They also need to provide practical, workable solutions. The government's bill is a practical, workable, that the balanced move forward.",50

30,Mr OKEEFE,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"The Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill 1997 is the first of a number of stages of legislation that the government will be introducing in the coming months to give effect to the rural package that was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) some months ago. I signal at the outset of this debate that the opposition is very happy to give passage to this legislation. We are supportive of measures to provide assistance to farm households during difficult circumstances, as we have always been, and that is a point I want to develop in this discussion. There are some PAIRS improvements to the existing situation which we support and which we see as a natural progression of this kind of legislation. However, I want to start my comments by perhaps substantiating a response that I made when this package was first announced, because those on the other side took some umbrage, which was particularly apparent in some of the public comments made by the minister, to my statement that this package represented little short of a rural hoax. What I meant by that was that, for a number of years whilst they were in opposition, some members of the current government, including the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), the Prime Minister and a number of members involved in the government's rural representation, spent almost every waking moment wandering around rural Australia talking about the Labor Party's complete disregard, lack of concern, lack of interest and lack of support for, particularly, farmers who were in difficulty. They said it so often that they came to believe it. When they came to government and they brought down their first budget, instead of having a new 'integrated rural support package', which was being proposed, there was simply a refunding of former Labor government programs but with the statement that this would all be pulled together into the new whizzbang integrated rural package. So, for the 15 months between their election to government and the bringirig down of this package, we continued to get more of the same. I refer, for instance, to comments made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in this place on 29 October last year, where he said: After 13 years of inactivity, the Labor Party have put the industry at risk ... He said, further, on 7 November 1996: Yes. Why is the Labor Party against that? They were responsible for a lot of this damage in the first place. It reflects the fact that total farm as a result of 13 years of your mismanagement ... And so on. It became part of the culture of members of the then opposition, and they continued it when they came into government, to routinely go out into rural Australia and bag the ALP's policies to assist and support farm households and propose at all times that they would be coming up with a new integrated package that would be the solution to all these things. What have we got? We have got the first tranche of legislation. These particular components include the farm family restart scheme. Do you know what that is? It is a $45,000 lump sum that assists those farmers who may feel that the time and economic circumstances are such that they should move off the farm and go and do something else. It is a $45,000 lump sum accompanied by access to the news tart allowance, or the unemployment benefit. It is wage assistance accompanied by some retraining packages. And, guess what? It is a fabulous new package! What was Labor's package? It was a $45,000 lump sum package called 're-establishment'; theirs is called 'farm family restart', for God's sake. This is what I am talking about as being a rural hoax. As this legislation comes in, piece by piece and component by component, I am going to show the House and everybody out there who is listening how just about every single piece of this package is simply Labor's former program which has been repackaged, rebadged and claimed as some great innovation for rural Australia, and sold and marketed by a Prime Minister who has made the same claim. There are some minor changes and, as I said, of course there will be. Of course, during our 13 years, we came through the evolution of these programs to finetune them and change them and develop them. So, too, that will continue. I would not have the slightest complaint if anyone on the other side of the House had been straight enough or decent enough to stand up and say, 'The household support packages that Labor had in place are the way to deal with the problems, and the government intends to continue those but to finetune debt and improve them.' If that is what they had had the decency to say, I would not have a single reason to stand here and complain at this dispatch box. But we are unfolding here the evidence of the hoax, because they have actually gone out and tried to tell people in rural Australia that this is some brand new $500 million package. The day after the package was launched, all the farm organisations lauded it-even the National Farmers Federation. Everybody lauded it. The only person in Australia saying, 'Hey, I wonder if this is so spectacular,' was me. Twenty-four hours after the euphoria, even the National Farmers Federation came out conceding that, of the $517 million involved in the budget, at most $30 million was new money. What we are actually getting is a very significant vote of confidence by the government in Labor's former farm household support programs. And that is the point I want to make: if they had the decency to say that, I would not have a complaint, but if they continue to go around and try to market themselves as the experts who have suddenly arrived with a brand new package for the farm sector, then this is the response in every bit of its detail that we will get. Looking at the specific components here, yes, we see the farm family restart lump sum of $45,000 as an amount that can be continued with. We note that the assets test limits which had applied under the previous government have actually been increased from $45,000 I think it is to $90,000 under this provision. As Labor's spokesman on primary industry issues, I am very happy with that. I have presented that to our shadow ministry and we have all agreed that we support this measure to make it easier for farm families to access this restart benefit. We note that, if a family under this legislation chooses not to leave straight away but to try to work it through for a year or so while they try to sell the property, they do have immediate access to - the newstart income support package. Again, there is nothing new in that; that is exactly the way it was and we agree with that. We are happy to support it. I note that if families do draw on some newstart support-for example, if it were $200 a week for a year, that would be about $lO,OOO-that amount of $10,000 would come off the $45,000 lump sum at the end. Again, there is nothing very new in that. It is a measure that we are happy to support. There is an easing of the requirement to demonstrate that the farm is no longer viable for the particular. family involved. Under our previous measures it was actually a requirement that the farm be put on the market. Under this provision it is no longer necessary for the farm to be actually placed on the market, but there are some specific measures in there that mean that the farm owners need to go into a business support program and they need to actually be given an assessment that does demonstrate that the farm is not viable in order to qualify for the lump sum, and it will in fact lead to the farm being placed on the market. So we are quite relaxed about the relaxing of that provision. But nobody on the government side should try to purport to anyone in the rural sector that applying for this farm family restart lump sum does not mean that their farm is not going on the market and does not mean that they are not really being expected to move themselves off. So, basically, there is no change except for some minor liberalisation of the assets test which we are happy enough to support. The bill also contains a provision to change the drought relief payment scheme so that it more broadly encompasses the exceptional circumstances relief payment. Again, from our point of view, we are completely relaxed with that. I have said on a number of occasions, when we were looking specifically at the situation of Gippsland dairy farmers where it was next to impossible to demonstrate that a climate event was a drought in terms of the normal criteria that are applied by the federal and state governments when they are assessing these things yet it was very clear to everybody that this was quite possibly an 80to 100-year climate event that nobody could have been reasonably expected to plan for, that we need to rethink the shape of some of these guidelines. Of course, this bill does that with the embracing of the term 'exceptional circumstances'. And, again, we are very relaxed about that. I again return to the point that, as these measures come through, there will be some measures in the rural package that we will have some serious questions about, and more of these points will be made. But we are quite relaxed about the components of the Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill which we are dealing with today. Let me emphasise, on the part of all members of this House, the reasons why there is, in fact, bipartisan support for the need for farm household support programs of this kind. We are all aware-and we, from our experience in government. were well aware-that there are many families, as producers in the rural sector, who are receiving income from their production which, in many cases, is either at a loss or is so close to the cost of production and the cost of ownership of the business that they make very little profits as far as the tax office statistics go. I think the last figures I saw were that 67 per cent of Australia's farming enterprises either make no profit or are producing a negative return at the tax office. That tells you that many of these families are living in very tight circumstances. ""1 know that when we were deliberating, pa:rticularly about the situation of Gippsland dairy farmers, it raised a whole social question-not that I am fixated on Gippsland in any way in this sense; there have been a number of climate events that have taken place on the east coast of Australia where the circumstances are very similar. But what we are looking at here is a concentration of something like 2,500 to 3,000 dairy farm families. By any economic rationalist, sensible, hard criteria, you would look at that say , 'Well, for at least the bottom 20 per cent-the 20 per cent who are making a loss and do not have the capital to survive-the best thing they could do is apply for the farm family restart $45,000 lump sum and move off their f-rms.' But that creates a little problem. If 20 per cent of 2,500 to 3,000 families move off their farms-we are talking about 500 to 600 families vacating their properties or businesses-then what do we do? Do they become part of the unemployment statistics in other towns in the region? Do we watch them move to Melbourne and become part of the housing problem in Melbourne? Do we care if the rural communities that they are part of suddenly lose a teacher, a policeman or some nursing home beds because the population is diminished because these people have moved out? These are immensely serious social questions to be answered in Australia at the moment. The decline in jobs and profitability in the rural sector is not only leading to the issue of farm families facing these difficulties but also leading to much broader flow-ons in Qur whole social planning. That takes us to the question of what a government can do, and, by definition, it has to have these sorts of programs in place. Let me say, as Labor's spokesman for primary industry, that there are a number of measures in this support package which treat farm families differently to other families in Australia. I do not have any objection to that. In fact, what I am saying to the government is: if you have seen the light for farm families in difficulty, then let us put that in place and let us ask you to then have a look at a number of other families. But it is certainly. not sustainable-and I hope every member of the government understands this-for farmers and farm families as businesses to be given special treatment which does not flow on in policy development to other parts of Australian society, because that case cannot be mounted. Not even I would try to mount it. Within my own party I argue that this is the way the government has chosen to deal with this particular sector. I support these measures and the view that improvements made in the and social treatment of farm families should apply equally to ordinary workers' families or small business wherever they might be. I do not know whether the government have thought through not only the policy issues that develop, for instance, from the special tax treatment that is built into this package but also the gifting provisions-which will come up in some other topics we will be dealing withwhich will enable older farm families to pass on the farm and the house to the younger. If they have not thought about these things, they ought to. I draw people's attention to an article published in yesterday'S Australian under the heading 'Farm families miss out on aid payments'. We have been aware of this for a long time. A government with the best of intentions-obviously, the Labor government must have had the best of intentions because, despite all the rhetoric, the government has picked up our former programs and put them back again or maintained them-has provided these packages for many years. The evidence is showing us that about a third of farm families that would be eligible for family support payments have not applied. We know that there is a psychological question there. They are hugely independent, self-determined people who do not want to apply for welfare. Farm organisations have to do more to get their people to understand that running around bagging dole bludgers-as they have so often been encouraged to do by their political leadership over the years-creates a mentality where, when you are in a desperate situation yourself, you do not want to apply for support because someone will call you a dole bludger, possibly even your neighbour. You have to think through a few of these things. It is all right to go on with the political rhetoric, but we have a serious problem in the farm sector. We have created a culture where the men, in particular, refuse to accept the support that is available to them or they are not well informed about it. I am saying to the government that, just as we had to put a lot of effort into trying to break this cycle by making sure that they at least understood that support was available, so, too, behind the package that is involved in this legislation and its improvements, effort should be put into making sure that farm families not only understand it but are encouraged to apply for it. I repeat very strongly: change the rhetoric of attacking waterside workers or whoever it might be who is popularly blamed in the country for your problems; certainly change the rhetoric of blaming the welfare sector for the nation's budget ills, whatever they may be. In many cases, that rhetoric creates its own psychology that creates this very problem. We have a responsibility, as national politicians, to put these support programs in and to encourage our people to qualify and use them. There is another aspect of this that is not specifically covered in the legislation today, and we will see how it unfolds with the rest of the package as the legislation comes forward. A continuing problem, particularly in this area of income support benefits, is that farmers are self-employed business people in their own right. They are not like somebody who is perhaps retrenched, loses their job or does not have and is applying for a job. In many cases, they are surviving on minimal income but still trying to work their property. So an unemployment benefit is not the appropriate term. We wrestled for many years to try to find ways to open up what people generally know as an unemployment benefit and actually pay it as income support to a family that is working hard but not making enough money to live-and it does not just apply to farms. There are many small and micro businesses in the same situation, and this is the point I am flagging. As the government wrestles with ways to find that cross-dialogue between social security provisions and farm household support, it is not only necessary to have the pathway but also necessary to have a simple system of application so that people are not turned away by the bureaucracy, the red tape and sheer intimidation of going in when you do not really fit the box. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have advocated on these things many times in our own caucus. I think it is incumbent on the government to be working more on these guidelines so that those cross pathways work easily. We do not have an activity test, which is what it is called. A person who is not a farmer or a business person applying for unemployment benefits has to actually satisfy what they call an activity test-they have to demonstrate that they are looking for work. Under our program, this activity test was waived for the farm household support provisions. I note that the government has also maintained that waiver in this legislation, and I welcome that. But I make the point that there are still many farm families out there who have not actually applied for these benefits because they still think that some of those guidelines apply to them or that it is all too hard. Of course, part of this $517 million hoax is to provide estimates in the budget for how much you think is actually going to be spent and used up without appreciating that it is so difficult to apply for or, for many people, so difficult to understand that they do not even apply. We have not seen the estimates yet. It is going to be very interesting to see what the take-up rates of some of the components of this package are. In this particular case, we very much agree that this legislation needed to be maintained. I am aware that, in the transition from the former household support scheme to what is now the farm family restart scheme, there has been a decision taken to waive the outstanding obligation of people who had previously taken it as a loan. That means that, under the former provisions, people actually took it as a loan to help them through a period and then repaid it. In many cases there were no repayments, and they were waived. Under this legislation, in winding up the old program, the government is waiving $5 million of outstanding debt from the old program. I actually count that as genuine new expenditure. I am very happy to acknowledge that as genuine new expenditure, and'l welcome it. The new payments that will now be made under this program are not in the form of a loan; they are in the form of a grant, which, effectively, is how it finished up anyway. It is a piece of finetuning that we are quite happy to move with. The government could have had the decency-and that is the term I use-to say to rural Australia, 'Look, Labor had a raft of programs in place. They were all too complex, not enough people applied for them and there really should have been more money allocated to them. But the basic framework was okay and what we will be doing is trying to improve it.' Had they had the decency to go out and market it as that, I would not have a complaint here at the box. I would simply be saying, 'This is a non-controversial piece of legislation. We support it. Let's put it through.' Instead, they went out and deceived people into thinking that, first of all, Labor had made such a mess of the whole range of low income farm family support programs that they were going to get rid of it all and replace it with some new whizzbang integrated rural package. That is all we heard for the first 15 months of the new government: 'Wait till you see our new package.' Well, we have seen it, and what is it? It is a re-presentation-and piece by piece I am going to show this-of Labor's former programs. In some cases the programs have not changed even one bit, but in this case it has been changed by what I would call some marginal finetuning, that we all agree with, that is a logical consequence. It certainly ain't a' grand new piece of vision for rural Austral.is. As I said before, the claim about $517 million in new farm support is what I call very close to a hoax, because even the National Farmers Federation came out within 24 hours of sitting down and actually studying it and agreed with me that the most they could find was $30 million of new money. I am calling on those opposite to have some decency in the way they go about presenting this package that has been brought together. There is very little evidence of their having streamlined anything much at all. The particular programs are all still in their individual boxes. As for the circumstances which led to yesterday's Australian article about farm families missing out on support payments for all the reasons, which we understand, that are outlined in it, as far as I can see there will be very little change in that situation unless members of the government change their rhetoric and put some real effort into genuinely explaining the role of support payments, or what they call 'welfare'. They must genuinely explain to the farm sector and to others in small business that the purpose of this is to assist people who are in work but who are on minimal incomes and struggling to survive. With those comments, I indicate that those on this side of the House are happy to give passage to this legislation.",55
31,Mr BROADBENT,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"It is a pleasure to rise in the House to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill 1997 and to hear the shadow minister, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), generally support in a bipartisan way the thrust of the government's endeavours on behalf of rural and regional Australia, particularly farm families. This legislation, which is part of the government's integrated rural policy, Agriculture-Advancing Australia, will help to build a competitive, sustainable and profitable rural sector. The measures introduced in the bill will ensure farm families experiencing financial hardship will have equitable, reasonable and fair access to welfare support. The rural sector accounts for a major share of Australia's exports and provides the basis for much of the nation's value adding in the fibre processing industries. The legislation before the House today will actually make a difference in local and regional communities across Australia. The shadow minister mentioned finetuning the former Labor policies. I would like to debunk some of the issues that he raised before I conclude today, but first I will move on to the facts of the matter. The rural sector in Australia has faced unprecedented challenges. Consider these important remarks from the minister's second reading speech: While the top 20 per cent of farm businesses are performing wellas are most businesses in Australiadata collected by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics show the sector, as a whole, has endured a long period of negative profitability. Severe drought, low commodity prices and cost pressures, particularly in the farm finance market, have created a very difficult operating environment for farm businesses. When you come from an electorate like MCMillan in eastern Victoria, you know your community has experienced rural decline. But that is not confined to my community, or to yours in Tasmania, Mr Deputy Speaker; it extends to the whole of Australia. I was interested when the shadow minister remarked that this package was important. In Gippsland's situation, which I will expand on, you have 3,500 farmers particularly affected by a one in a hundred years experience that we called a drought. But it was not really a drought, it was a green drought. We could not establish ourselves as being in exceptional circumstances compared with the rest of Australia. I might add that we did not get a lot of sympathy from the rest of the farm community around Australia for the difficulties that we had with a one in a hundred years situation of too much rainfall, on the one hand, and lack of rainfall, on the other. We had to argue over a three-year period that we had a drought situation on our hands. It was a complicated arrangement, and it was hard to explain to the general public that a place like Gippsland, which is the garden of the dairy industry-although other members of this House would argue about their particular electorates-and is a cow to the acre area and has been for generations of farmers in the dairy industry, was faced with the problem of not having enough water. There was not enough to grow grass or fill our tanks. We just did not have water after a time when we had had too much water. So we had a very unusual circumstance. This package, whose development has been so important to advance agriculture in Aus.,. tralia, has actually addressed the issues that were raised in Gippsland. Whilst I can see no benefit whatsoever from the crisis that we have gone through, and are still going through to a degree, in Gippsland-its effects on those farm families and households will continue for the next five years-to be granted 'excep"" tional circumstances' was a very good, positive outcome and enhances the legislation we are putting through today, because it can be established with absolutely no doubt that the problems that we faced in Gippsland were considered in the consultations and have been driven into the legislation. So, for the first time in the history of this nation, people's situations will be considered in the merits of the argument. The shadow minister, the member for Burke, said there has been some finetuning. This is fairly massive finetuning. For the first time, we have the opportunity to address the issues that people are facing in their areas and we are not being struck down by a rigid set of rules that we were unable to pass to get to the stage of saying, 'Let these families start again.' It is important that, as we come to look to a time 10, 15 or 30 years ahead as to where our farm families will be, we remember that they have not been forgotten in this. This legislation enhances our opportunity to give certainty and give direction to rural communities in Australia in the same way that the Howard government has done with the timber industry,. I want to say-and I think this is the time to bring it up-that one of the events that made a difference to the argument over 'exceptional circumstances' in Gippsland goes back to the former season when a local farmer, Bill Pyle, came to me. Rather than saying, 'I can see the storm clouds on the horizon,' he said, 'I cannot see the storm clouds on the horizon, and we could be facing a problem.' That was way back in October last year. There did not seem to be a problem, but obviously the shortage of rainfall was beginning to be a concern. And who was it going to hit? It was not going to hit the established farmers, it was not going to hit those people who have been through tough times, but we were seeing and going through a one in a hundred year event.  talked that through with him, and whilst there was not an immediate crisis, we looked at families who actually lived on the land and their enti tlemen ts to soci al security. Yesterday's report from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, talks about on-farm families not accessing what governments provide for them. This is not confined to Gippsland; this is absolutely all about the people who live on farms. They do not want to be welfare recipients-they have a proud heritage and they like to be given an opportunity to go on-but if they are faced with circumstances that are totally out of their control then we as a government have to respond. I call on the farmers out there today who are having a tough time to accept the assistance. There would still be people in Gippsland in that situation, even though the government has said, 'Look, we want to help you. We have got a handout. Please take this hand and come in and talk to us.' There will still be people out there who will refuse to take the opportunities that the government is presenting to them. A couple of months ago Mr John Bennett came to my Moe office. He walked in and said, 'We've got a problem: a whole lot of share farmers can no longer afford to feed their families. They are buying hay with the money, and they are going to need some support.' We began in earnest not only to find ways in which the government could give information about what was available to such people at the time but also to look at whether we could do the job on drought exceptional circumstances. We did the research, we did the work and we committed ourselves through the state government to finding a way to address 'exceptional circumstances' - in an area where this had not been heard of in 100 years. We have had droughts, floods and fires but we have not faced a situation like this before. With the help of the state government, well- we had to mount a fairly major argument to the federal government, to be presented to the RASAC committee which was in Canberra at that time. John Bennett was seriously concerned. At that time. I took advice from other people who have greater knowledge than I on these issues-John Mulvaney; Wally Shaw from the Victorian Farmers Federation; Clay Manners; Mick Irwin, a farmer who let me know that there was a problem; Gary Owen, a share farmer; Glen Geoghegan, who took up the fight and badgered people about the crisis that we were facing and I do not use the word 'crisis' lightly; Bill Brown from Murray Goulburn; and Michael Kearney. These people eventually all came together to talk to the minister. They made a difference in how we presented our argument. The RASAC committee, which did the assessments, went right across Gippsland and talked to people and there was a clear understanding from this government. What happened? We did not get a response from the committee. We did not have a position that could make it simple for the minister to make a decision. I commend the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, who played a hand in delivering on 'exceptional circumstances'. Peter MCGauran, the member for Gippsland, stood with us through this whole process to ensure that the message from Gippsland was clear: that is, that we needed support. With this legislation, we are not only investing in resources or farms, keeping these people on farms, but also investing in the future of the young people who will be supplying our milk. A number of people still think milk comes in cartons. It does not; it comes from the beautiful beasts in the fields today. The people who work seven days a week on these farms deserve our support and our help. We are looking to those young people. The household support legislation gives older people an opportunity to get off the farms that are not making money and to hand them on to the next generation, so that we can get on with the show. But, at the same time, with this legislation we are going to assess your farm and decide whether you should go on or whether you should assess the situation. The information which farmers need is available from all local members from both sides of the House. I encourage farmers who are listening today to get this information from their local member or from the department. If they are in that category and are struggling, there are opportunities for them to be helped through the new Centrelink. The hand is out; there is no need. There are incentives for ongoing farm adjustment. We want to encourage social and economic development in rural areas and, importantly, to ensure the farm sector has access to an adequate welfare safety net. We are not offering them a free gift. It is a welfare safety net that this government and this nation has decided we should deliver to our people, whatever sector they are from. As the minister said, the bill has been carefully designed to meet the coalition's long standing commitment to address important welfare issues and, at the same time, take into account the uniqueness of family farm business structures and the vulnerability of farming families to unnatural events. The opportunities presented to us may be once in a lifetime opportunities. This is a tremendous $517 million package supplied by the people of Australia to make a difference to farm families. It is not to give them a loan which goes against the farm, as the former government gave them. I wish to comment on a couple of things the shadow minister said. The former government's scheme was a loan based scheme. It left farm families with loans that they could not pay back. The shadow minister said, 'We waived those.' No, this is a system that gives some certainty and credibility. The shadow minister seemed lost when he said, 'This is very close to a hoax,' and then he said, 'This is a hoax.' He has to decide which way he is going to go. In his opinion, is it close to a hoax or is it a very good package? He talked about being relaxed and comfortable with the package all the way through: He talked about Gippsland and the important role it had played in the formation of the policy and the legislation. State members of parliament supported us  MLC, the member for Gippsland Province, who went out of his way to express to his colleagues what was happening in our area of Gippsland. That was also raised by the shadow minister, and I thank him for that. It is good that the people of Australia see both sides of the House supporting a package of legislation that is going to make a real difference to families across Australia, particularly in my electorate of MCMillan. This bill liberalises the assets test. It gives farm families further opportunities to consider their futures and how they will go into the next millennium. Certainty and confidence has been delivered in this package to people in the rural sectors of Australia. It will be a great opportunity to take them into the new millennium. There is special tax treatment, yes, and should it cross into other portfolios there should be reasonable consideration for those other portfolios, but we talk about the uniqueness of the farm family and it is important for a government to address that uniqueness. It is important for a government to look at the decline in rural communities right across Australia and say, 'Hey, this can make a difference to a town; this can make a difference as to whether they've got a bank; this can make a difference as to whether they've got a local store.' Throughout this whole process of the problems of farm families we should remember that we are losing many of the small operators. A tragedy of farm families going down is that the overdrafts of those small operators go up and their businesses. go down. It is not just the farm families who struggle. This is a package for the whole of regional Australia. It is an important package that makes a difference outside the cities-and this package does not start very far outside those cities. Just outside those cities we have farms that are not an opportunity to subdivide but certainly provide opportunities for people to do well in agriculture. It covers the whole agriculture. Great store was set by the fact that farm families will not access the opportunities given them by the federal government. Yes, you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make that horse drink, and that is what is happening with many of our farm families out there. It has happened to the point where the minister has had to come forward with a press release saying that we are providing a service for them and to please come along and avail themselves of the opportunities that the government has to give. The welfare is there. The social security net is there. The farm household support is there. There has been a continuing debate as to what is farm household support. What are we going to do in addressing the social security? expired) How can we give farmers the same benefits that we give to those in the cities as far as social security is concerned? There will always be a balancing act in good governance, and in this package the government has considered good governance. Minister Anderson took the time to come to Gippsland. He talked with my farmers and saw first hand exactly what was going on. On his own initiative he said that he would send the RASAC committee down there to assess the problem. After receiving reports from RASAC and his department on the issues, he then had to make a very difficult decision as to what he would take to cabinet. He laid on the table the problems of the people of Gippsdrought land. Governance works when you can have a local member from the backbench go to a minister and tell him of a problem, have the minister go to cabinet and lay that problem the table, and receive a response that has made a difference not only in this case to farmers of Gippsland but also to the policy development of this government. The bill has been supported by the Labor opposition, it has Peninsula. been supported by the whole of the parliament, and it has been broadly supported by the community that we all serve. After all, whether it be aged care or any of the problems that confront a government at any time, we are here for the people that we serve. We of have had the opportunity in this package to deliver to the people in regional areas of Australia an opportunity to put their problems on the table and to have those problems addressed in legislation, and they are seeing the result of that now. .J This $517 million package has been put down and supported certainly by the National Farmers Federation and it has received consideration from all other farmers groups. It has been sold as a rescue package for the bush. I did not see this as a rescue package. I saw it as a package in which the Howard government was looking to the strategic future of regional Australia. I, for one, as the member for MCMillan, want to be part of that strategic future. This package enables us to be part of the strategic future of Australia. (Time",60
32,Mr WAKELIN,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"I rise to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill 1997. There are striking comparisons between this bill and the experiences in the late 1980s in the region of the Eyre Peninsula, in the electorate of Grey, when the then state and federal Labor governments were bringing forward some fairly radical policies for the farm sector. It was a time when interest rates were between 18 and 20 per cent and the then Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, had abolished the income equalisation deposits scheme. It was a time of low world commodity prices and when the aid measures were withdrawn by the Bannon state government and the Hawke federal government. The comparisons between those experiences and this bill are very stark. I also note that these circumstances followed on on from the mid-1980s assets test which applied to farmers in a very harsh way-at a the time when we had the trifecta of low commodity prices, 18 to 20 per cent interest rates and a very long-standing drought on the Eyre",64

34,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Does the Acting Prime Minister recall that he wrote on 9 August 1995: I have to say that I am totally opposed ing retrospective detriments. Is he aware that gifts over $10,000 made by the elderly to their children or their grandchildren in the previous five years, which may have already reduced their pension, are caught up in the new assets test for nursing homes? Is this not an example of a retrospective detriment? Will the government's finetuning of its nursing home arrangements eliminate retrospectivity?",65
35,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Much of what the Leader of the Opposition's question was about was developed under rules by the previous Labor government. The coalition government's aged care residential policy is based on three principles: fairness, capacity to contribute and access based on needs, not means. The validity of these principle elements are well recognised and will remain in place. We are taking initiatives to further explain all of the nursing home changes which are envisaged and are standing up to your scaremongering. The Minister for Family Services has been asked by the Prime Minister to closely monitor implementation and any finetuning that may be required and the matter of retrospectivity falls in that category. Let's get down to the nitty-gritty in relation to this debate. That side over there stands for allowing the aged battlers of this country to remain in substandard accommodation, much of it involving four people or more having to share a room. Forty per cent of the aged accommodation is in that area and 13 per cent of it is substandard with regard to fire safety. That is the situation you left. This side, the coalition, has taken a number of steps to boost the aged care circumstance and the aged accommodation circumstance. We have locked in a pension value to total average male weekly earnings. Secondly, we have announced new gifting arrangements for farm families as a fair step forward. Thirdly, the coalition has increased payments to carers of older Australians. Fourthly, the coalition has provided a pension bonus plan. Fifthly, the coalition has boosted the tax rebate for retirees and, sixthly, the coalition is introducto legislating a new savings rebate.",65

This is what you stand for-the right of millionaires to go to nursing homes and make no contribution to the capital upgrading of those nursing homes.

45,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer explain to the House the significance of the latest inflation results? Is it a fact that the government ha- for the first time in over a generation sustained· growth without fuelling higher inflation and higher interest rates?,66
46,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Today's quarterly inflation result-which I believe will be welcomed by all Australians-which show an underlying inflation of 1.5 per cent over the course of the year to September of this year is the best figures since the measure commenced in 1972. And the consumer price index over the year to September 1997 showed the best results since 1962; the best results since a band by the name of the Beatles came out of the Merseyside. All Australians, with the exception of the Australian Labor Party, will welcome those wonderful figures. It is the best result in 35 years and all Australians will welcome them, apart from people who have no commitment to the national interest; people on the Labor Party side who are downcast about the best inflation result since 1962. What has led to that great inflation result? What led to that great inflation result was the fact that over the course of this year home mortgage interest charges contributed negative 26 per cent to the consumer price index. The price of a mortgage in relation to consumer prices went down by 26 per cent. Home buyers got the benefit of a price reduction in relation to their mortgage interest rates, the biggest expense of Australian households, as a consequence of low inflation and this government's commitment to the economic fundamentals. With the exception of the Australian Labor Party, all Australians will rejoice in that news today and all Australians will share in the benefits. If you happen to be a pensioner, because of this inflation outcome you will know that you are protected against price rises. In fact in relation to the consumer price index a dollar would actually buy you more at the end of the year than it did at the beginning of the year. If you happened to be a self-funded retiree, what you knew was that the value of your savings for the first time in decades had not been eaten away by inflation. The value of your savings at the end of the year was the value of your savings at the beginning of the year. If you happen to be a wage earner, you know that your wage would buy as much, if not more, at the end of the year than it did at the beginning of the year. This sets Australia up to base its wages system on productivity rather than on inflation. This is an important point in relation to wage claims. Wage claims do not have to chase prices, because prices for the first time in decades in Australia are now under control. In the 1980s, when Australia was locked into high inflation, when that was a bar on growth in our economy, we saw the average of consumer prices in the 1980s at 8.5 per cent. That was the legacy of Keating Labor. In the major industrialised nations it was 2.8 per cent. We were nearly four times worse than the developed nations of the world. But Australia can hold its head high now. Australia has an inflation performance which is, if not the best, certainly one of the best in the world. Australia has now returned decisively to the world club of low inflation nations. The inflation barrier on growth no longer exists. As a result of this, pensioners, home buyers, self-funded retirees, but most of all the Australian nation, will be a great winner. Nursing Homes",66
47,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No pension rise; that is what it means. My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Mr Costello--- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Of course that is complete misinformation that the member puts out. She would think it appropriate to take money ·off pensioners through inflation; pensioners do not.",66
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,66
49,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Minister, I refer to reports that you informed representatives of the Catholic Church last night that 'slashing the care subsidies of nursing home residents is a completely different and untenable situation' and that you have conceded that taking $80 million out of the aged care sector is untenable. Minister, have you agreed to restore the $80 million which the government was expecting to save as a result of the duction of the new daily fee for nursing home residents? If so, who among your colleagues did you consult about doing so?",67
50,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have actually seen reports from Francis Sullivan who represents one of the largest providers of aged care facilities in this country and who came to see me for the first time last evening. I have a detailed discussion with him which was very fruitful because I started the process of consultation and monitoring the policy in the terms that the Acting Prime Minister has just said. But it indeed was interesting. Mr Sullivan's fundamental point, and I made a note of it, was that he believed personal responsibility and community contribution were the way for this policy to develop into the 1990s, and that is exactly what this policy is about. This policy is about people who have the capacity to contribute to their care needs making that contribution and that there be a continued contribution from the Commonwealth. I will continue to monitor the policy and discuss the matters with people such as Francis Sullivan and others in the sector. Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The minister has not answered the question. Will he put the $80 million back in?",67
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The point of order is disallowed. The minister has concluded his remarks. Small Business: Unfair Dismissal Laws,67
52,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Given the rejection last night by the Labor Party and the Democrats in the Senate of the unfair dismissal exemptions, what sort of message does this send to the small business community and to the thousands of people it would have employed had the bill passed?",67
53,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The message that the Democrats' rejection sends to the smail business community is that the Labor Party and the Democrats are opposed to the small intro- business community. They are opposed to what the small business community is trying to do. It shows you the incredible hypocrisy of these people. They created the problems of the unfair dismissal law, they were responsible for the problems of the unfair dismissal law and now they use their numbers in the Senate to prevent the further reforms to fix up did the mess that they created. You ought to hang your heads in shame that you should oppose sensible measures to give a decent deal to the small business community and to those people who today are unemployed as a result of your economic mismanagement for years and years. There is a lot of evidence-whether it is the Morgan and Banks survey, whether it is the Bell committee report, whether it is Recruitment Solutions-which show that if you could give a better system to the small business community then they would go out and give people jobs. This is the party that says, 'Job insecurity is a problem in Australia.' You are the cause of job insecurity because you are opposed to a measure that will create jobs in the dynamic small business sector. The idea that we should treat small business separately and distinctly to take account of the differences of small business is not a new idea. Whether it is the parole tax exemptions for small business, whether it is affirmative action, whether it is employment protection legislation in New South Wales supported by the Labor Party, it has been commonplace on both sides of politics in Australia to understand the particular needs of small business. All that that measure says, in effect, is that small business needs to have a system that encourages them to go out and give people jobs. We say that any such system needs to properly take into account the interests of employers and the interests of employees. So this measure is directed to new employees, it does not affect apprenticeships and it retains all of the anti-discriminatory provisions of the federal law. Any reasonable person would have to agree that that is a balanced approach-balanced in the interests of employers, balanced in the interests of employees, and balanced in the interests of ensuring that people can get a job. Those on the other side are worried about the next election. A lot of people have said to me: 'Will we have a double dissolution on this issue?' My answer to that is to say: 'We want to fix up this problem.' We do not want an election over it. We want to see this problem fixed. We will present this bill in three months if you continue in your refusal. But our objective is to do the right thing by the small business community. We would like to see this bill through. We believe that there are a lot of people who today are unemployed who ought to have the chance of a job between now and Christmas. That would be real job security, instead of the hypocrisy we have from the Labor Party and the Democrats on this matter. Nursing Homes",67
54,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minster for Family Services. Minister, yesterday you said that one option for paying the nursing home entry fee is for people to 'agree that the retention amount and the interest be taken from their estate'. Is it not a fact that the retention amount and the interest at 8.863 per cent on a $100,000 bond after five years would be $56,150? What is the difference, minister, between the estate having to pay that and a death duty?",68
55,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, you can be so lucky! Here is the party that is defending death duties. You want death duties. At the beginning of the week you went on the radio and you said: 'We are going to get rid of this fair system that the government is putting in place, that the industry and consumer groups agreed was appropriate for the long-term needs of nursing care in this country.' You are going to impose taxes on the whole community, and increased taxes. That is what you are going to do. Ms Macklin-I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. The minister knows that I did not say anything about new taxes or increased taxes.",68
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. Mr Reith-I take a point of order. My point of order, Mr Speaker, is that you have powers under the standing orders to deal with vexatious points of order.",68
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am well aware of my powers. Mr Reith-This shadow minister, on repeated questions-we are only 19 minutes into question time-has brazenly breached the standing orders, and you ought to deal with her.",68
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whilst I am not prepared to uphold the point of order, I would remind both shadow ministers and ministers of the conventions of the House. I would encourage you all to respect the conventions.",68
59,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Implicit in the question is the defence of death duties. You said the other day-and I will quote it to you again: 'Labor is saying that it should be raised through the tax system.' The new tax that you want to impose to cover this area is a death tax. That's what you want. You have always wanted it.,68
60,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take a point of order. This is the question, Mr Speaker: what is the different between the estate having to pay that $56,000 and a death duty? That is the question. That is not a relevant answer.",68
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. I am listening very carefully to the minister's response.,68
62,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is germane to this whole issue, Opposition Leader. You know that at the beginning of the week when your shadow spokesperson went on the radio and said: 'Labor is saying that it should be raised through the tax system', she made a fundamental error and she exposed your party. You did nothing about the capital needs of nursing homes for 13 years and now you are trying to shift attention by way of a scare campaign and inundating the community with irrelevant misinformation.",68
63,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. It is time we had this answer to various different questions but this question was specific: what is the difference between that and a death duty? We have had no answer, only irrelevant answers.",69
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,69
65,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No amount of points of order can disguise the error that you have made here. You have exposed the Labor Party's true agenda. The answer to your question is, and I say this again: lump sums are the way that you can pay the bond. You have the choice. The choice is for the person who is going into the home. You can enter into a periodic payment. You can take it out of the estate. If you take it out of the estate, the agreed maximum interest rate is the 8.86 that you quoted, which was agreed by all consumer groups and all those who were invol ved in the preparation of this legislation. I take this opportunity to say that yesterday I invited all of those people who were involved, the consumer groups and all the nursing home interests throughout this country, to continue their work on the six or seven committees that were utilised to put this policy together. Nursing Homes",69
66,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Given the fact that Australians are blessed with the sixth longest life span of any nation in the world, would you please outline what the government is doing to help the increasing number of elderly in Australia, including those in my electorate of Lilley?",69
67,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The pathway of reform on a range of issues in this nation is not easy. One of those was the hostel issue, and I remind the House that it was the previous Labor government that brought in the principle which is replicated in part in what we are proposing to do with reform in nursing homes and aged care. I have a quote here from yesterday-s The World Today. It is from a senator whom I am not normally given to quoting, but I think It IS relevant to the deliberations on the question asked. The senator said: I've got to say to you I think what Jenny Macklin's been doing is reprehensible, because she has not, at any stage, come up with any alternatives ... She's never taken part in any positive contribution in this debate. She's simply scaremongered and she has really put a lot of fear into aged people; and I don't think that's the kind of ... politics I want to see in this country. The senator went on to say: I'm very angry about what the Labor Party is doing. It was not a coalition senator. He went on to say: And I think that what they ought to do is play a constructive role so that we can get reforms in place that the elderly people in our community will benefit from. Who was the senator? It was none other than Senator John Woodley of the Democrats in the other place. The government will stay on a course of fair reform. In answer to the member for Lilley, I want to add that what the coalition has been about is fairness at every stage. Our lock-in of male total average weekly earnings is the right thing for the moment. Later on, next century, female total average weekly earnings could well exceed those for males, and I look forward to that. But right now we have locked in that pension value. Secondly, as I said, we have announced a new gifting arrangement for farm families which breaks the generational log jam. Thirdly, we have increased payments to carers of older Australians. Fourthly, we have provided a pension bonus plan for these people in need. Fifthly, the coalition has boosted the tax rebate for retirees. The coalition is introducing a new savings rebate. We have provided an improved provisional tax uplift factor. We have boosted the capital gains tax relief. We have improved superannuation arrangements, and we have simplified social security provisions for older Australians. We are also improving service delivery for retirees, and the coalition has enhanced work opportunities for older Australians. There is a range of activities that we have undertaken to give the aged of this country a fair go and a safer go and an upgraded go with regard to their nursing home accommodation. We have had the courage to take a number of initiatives to remove the circumstance where 40 per cent of the aged in nursing home accommodation have to, in 1997, share accommodation with four or more to a room, and where 13 per cent are at risk in substandard circumstances with regard to their fire conditions. We are taking action, we are embarked on reform, we are representing the Aussie battlers in aged care-and you are representing the millionaires squatting in nursing homes and paying next to nothing for that privilege. Nursing Homes",69
68,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Following on from the answer just given by the Deputy Prime Minister, are you aware, Minister, that the farm family support package recently announced by the Prime Minister will allow elderly farm owners under certain conditions to gift up to $500,000 of the value of their properties to their children and qualify for pension? Minister, given that the government is encouraging these farmers to gift their properties, can you assure the House that any property so gifted will be exempt from the nursing home bond test?",70
69,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the package and the benefits that flow to farmers in those situations, and they deserve every assistance that they can get. I congratulate the government for doing what they do. Under the arrangements that apply for nursing homes there are hardship provisions which take into account the impact of drought. We are already in a situation where, if you write to the secretary to the department, there are multiple circumstances where we can exercise discretion. And the discretion to grant hardship has already been granted in a number of cases. Mr O'Keefe-Is that an answer or not, Mr Speaker?",70
70,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, it is an answer. Mr O'Keefe-Now answer the question!",70
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Burke will resume his seat.,70
72,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There are hardship provisions that have a multiple of applicationsMr O'Keefe interjecting,70
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Burke!,70
74,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you make the application and satisfy the criteria, then, at the secretary's discretion, you get the benefit of the hardship. It is quite clear. And you know it is quite clear. Meningococcal Disease",70
75,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister advise the House of accurate facts in _relation to meningococcal disease? What is the recommended effective antibiotic treatment if a medical practitioner suspects that a patient may have this disease?,70
76,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. There has been the very great publicity in the last week about meningococcal disease and I would like to take the opportunity to inform the House of the situation relating to it. The first thing I should say is that the meningococcal organism is a bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis and it is very common. Probably 25 per cent of the population-one of every four of us in this chamber-have it in their throats at the moment. Normally it does not cause any difficulty, but in a very small proportion of people, and rarely, it can cause very horrific consequences. That does lead to a degree of fear in the community that is out of all proportion to the frequency with which this occurs. Last year in Australia there were 426 cases of meningococcal disease. At that level it would mean that the average GP could expect to see this once in a lifetime. Half the cases occur in late winter and early spring-from the middle of July to the middle of October-so it is normal that there is an increase at this time of the year. So far this year we have had 359 reported cases Australia-wide, so there is no greater rate this year than is normal. It does have a seven per cent death rate, so it is a serious disease but, I stress, it is very, very rare. There is a vaccine, but the vaccine has serious limitations. Because there is such a low risk in the general population, because the vaccine is not particularly effective in children under two years of age, because of the time it takes to achieve immunity, because the vaccine does not cover 60 per cent of the neisseria that cause this and because of the need for frequent booster doses, vaccines are not recommended as being particularly effective. However, there are three groups of people who may require vaccines. They are travellers to high risk areas, people over two years of age who have compromised immunity because of medical or surgical conditions and, finally, the people in a relatively closed community where an outbreak has occurred, where it has been identified that the subgroup causing the outbreak is one of the 40 per cent of cases that is susceptible to 'the vaccine. All this is broom? spelt out in the sixth Handbook of Immunisation that was distributed to every general practitioner in Australia earlier this year. There has been some comment in the papers about the availability of vaccines in Australia. There are two vaccines, one by Smith, Kline and Beecham and the second by CSL. Smith Kline and Beecham currently has adequate stocks and is recalling army stocks just to be safe. CSL has run out of stocks and is expecting new stocks to arrive from Canada by the weekend. However, I stress that the role of the vaccine is limited and the public has no need, except in those very narrow circumstances, to go and get it. Finally, there was comment yesterday on the radio and television about which antibiotics to use and about whether or not appropriate antibiotics were being provided to doctors. I can only say that these comments must have arisen out of a misreading of the National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines which were released in April this year. The NHMRC, the country's peak scientific body, made it very clear that it was not appropriate to carry third generation cephalosporins in a doctor's bag and that benzylpenicillin, the tried and true drug to which these organisms are still susceptible in Australia,.is the drug of choice for a doctor's bag. It is completely incorrect to suggest that doctors are not provided with the most appropriate antibiotic, and it is completely incorrect to suggest that the NHMRC has said otherwise. Sadly, these reports have only led to increased concern in the community and are highly irresponsible. If people·are concerned, they should consult their general practitioners, but, I stress again, what has happened this year is absolutely normal. We have no more cases than normal. We can expect existing cases to drop off now that the peak period is over, and the disease poses very, very little risk to the average Australian. Nursing Homes",70

79,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,71
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for O'Connor!,71
81,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday you indicated that you thought it was reasonable for a person who owned a home in Rose Bay to pay a $250,000 bond to enter a nursing home, because this would only be about a quarter of the value of their home. Is it also reasonable for elderly people in Launceston to pay a $20,000 bond, given their homes are valued at around $80,000? Are you planning to finetune the nursing home arrangements, to ensure that nobody has to pay more than 25 per cent of the value of their home?",71
82,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It does not surprise me to see them trying to dig themselves out of the hole that they got into yesterday. The example you gave yesterday is an exempt home, as you well know, which is a category that you put in place. When you had the hostels policy, some of the bonds went up to $180,000-and entry fee arrangements. What we have done, as the Prime Minister said on Monday, is to take the policy you had in hostels further, to nursing homes. The fundamental requirement of the bond is that you get back everything other than the $13,000, if you stay there for five years, with $2,600 drawn down each year. To try to run the line you are running now ignores the facts and tries to again further the issue with regard to scaremongering, which you have now become the world's experts on. Vocational Training",71
83,Mr ROSS CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Has the minister read reports of concern that the government may be overly preoccupied with vocational training? Can the minister respond to suggestions that job skills acquired under recently announced industry accreditation measures may not be sufficiently portable?",72
84,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. I am aware of comments on the government's programs to increase vocational education offerings in schools. This government is determined to increase opportunities for schoolleavers who do not go on to university. On ABC Radio in South Australia on 15 October, the member for Werriwa, the shadow minister for education, commenting on the accreditation by the Victorian Board of Studies of MCDonald's training, said, 'I really fear, particularly under this federal government, that the balance is tipping towards the vocational end.' How out of touch can you get? Under the policies of the last Labor government, there was a total fixation on the 30 per cent of young people going on to universities. This government has now started to correct this situation. On 3AW on 14 October, the member for Werriwa was reported to have called for the MCDonald's accreditation to be stopped immediately. You wonder what he does not like. Is it that these certificates might get young people jobs? You never did anything to get young people jobs. The member for Werriwa is more concerned about multinational companies than he is about getting young people jobs. It is pretty clear that Chardonnay Cheryl has come to the right political party. You could see her and the member for Werriwa out there on the patio sipping their wine, complaining about the excesses of capitalism and not having the slightest idea about doing anything positive to help young people get jobs. As David Anderson, the managing director of Bell Personnel, said: To suggest that such a certificate would not be portable-as claimed by the member for Werriwabecause it included the name MCDonald's is ludicrous in the extreme. He went on to say: If only he put asidethat is the member for Werriwathe emotive, multinational and exploitative tags that he was no doubt recalling and asked the personnel industry, he would have found that young jobseekers with MCDonald's or similar training have been preferred candidates for many years. And the member for Werriwa wants the scheme abandoned immediately because these young people might get jobs! This government is about giving young Australians decent opportunities. This government's commitment to lifting literacy standards and expanding vocational education in schools is a fundamental equity and social justice program of this government. It is this side of the House that is concerned with increasing opportunities for young Australians who do not have them. It is that side of the House which is hung up on its traditional ideology and has completely neglected the interests of the battlers of this country. Literacy and vocational education are two big equity issues and it is for equity and for fairness in education that this side of the House stands. NA",72

86,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Minister, now that the Minister for Family Services has indicated that he planning to finetune the new nursing home arrangements? and noting your previous press release assurances, will you now give undertaking to ensure that war widows and veterans will be exempt from the accommodaprovision tion bond and new daily fee?",72
87,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have waited a long time for the maiden question, too. What we have got now, coming from the opposiber tion, is a scare campaign aimed at the most vulnerable in our community: our veterans, our prisoners of war and the war widows. That is what we have got. Yop should be the condemned for that action, and I am surprised that the Leader of the Opposition would allow such a question.",73
88,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question was very simple. Will he give an undertaking to ensure that war widstructure. ows and veterans are exempt? Full stop, end of story, nothing more and no embellishment. ments",73
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I uphold the point of order and I do ask the minister to address the substance of the question.,73
90,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can inform the House that this government does acknowledge the very special circumstances of our veteran community, and we have made special provisions for the ex-service community. Let me outline to the House the special provisions and acknowledgment we have for those in ex-service community. Those specific arrangeNewcastle ments are that ex-prisoners of nursing home-level care will pay no daily fees. The government will pay those on their behalf. Disability pension will not be counted as income for service pensioners or for self-funded retirees with qualifying service. This means that these veterans will pay less in daily fees. War widows' assessed income be specifically adjusted to ensure they pay no more than other pensioners. We care for our veteran community and if you think you are going to use the veterans and, the prisoners war in a scaremongering campaign, you ought to think again. Public Infrastructure",73
91,Mr BOB BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is adit dressed to the Minister for Transport and about? is Regional Development, and may I congratulate my electoral neighbour on his appointment to the cabinet. Will the minister assure an the House of the government's continued support for private sector involvement in the of public infrastructure? In particular, can you detail the very real benefits to the people of the Hunter?",73
92,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable memfor Paterson for his question and his very keen concern in regional infrastructure in Australia. I would like to confirm that this government remains absolutely committed to private sector's involvement in the provision of regional infrastructure in Australia. The Treasurer will shortly introduce amendments to the Australian taxation laws to deliver on a coalition election promise to encourage private investment in public infraFour major infrastructure projects will qualify under the transitional arrangeMr Wilton interjecting-··,73
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Isaacs!,73
94,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will say it again. Four major projects will qualify under the transitional arrangements for our new infrastructure borrowings rebate scheme. The Prime Minister announced on 15 September 1997 the that the Redbank power station project in would receive assistance under the war receiving new rebate schemeMr Crean-It was already.,73
95,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But you might not have announced it. The Prime Minister announced it last year. Mr Fitzgibbon-And so it should. It will should never have been in doubt. Mr Allan Morris-That is right.,73
96,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Hunter and of the member for Newcastle are interjecting as well. This is a $300 million project which will generate 1,200 jobs during construction and inject $10 million into the local economy annually after construction. It is in Newcastle; is in the Hunter. What are you complaining I can inform the House that three other projects in regional Australia will also qualify for assistance under the transitional arrangements of the new scheme. The Oakey power station, west of Toowoomba, is a $150 million project employing 100 people during construction which has been strongly supported by the member for Groom. Opposition members-Page two.",73
97,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Okay, you can count too. That is good. We were not sure whether the Labor Party could still count. The Parkes ton power station in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, is a $45 million project employing 50 people during construction. Of great interest obviously to the member for Paterson and the other members who are representing the Hunter area, the Port Stephens sewerage processing facility north of Newcastle in New South Wales is a $10 million project employing 50 people during construction. Obviously the member for Paterson, who asked the question, has played an active role in promoting this scheme. Together with the Redbank power station, these projects account for private capital expenditure of over $500 million. These three additional projects will provide 400 on-site construction jobs and at least 70 permanent jobs. Other jobs will also be created indirectly due to the boost these ongoing projects will provide to local economies. These projects were issued certificates under the coalition government's previous infrastructure borrowings scheme. As you will remember, the old scheme was closed because it was not meeting its objectives. The new scheme shows the government, unlike Labor, is committed to continued support for private sector involvement in the provision of public infrastructure, particularly in regional Australdegree is. Labor abolished the infrastructure bond scheme. Under Labor, this form of federal assistance would not be available for regional infrastructure development. The people of Newcastle, Kalgoorlie, Oakey and particularly Port Stephens, and the workers who will get secure jobs as a result of these new projects, will be the winners. The Hunter region is getting another real commitment from this coalition government. Under Labor they would have got nothing. These projects are real projects providing real jobs in regional Australia, unlike the programs that Labor ran, which did not provide the real outcomes that they promised that they were going to provide. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I ask that the minister table the document from which he was so clearly reading his maiden question.",74

103,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Given the urgency to implement a Johne's Disease eradication program from this summer, or else lose another crucial 12 months, will the government commit its share of the cost's of the program in the interests of the entire Australian wool industry or will those producers on affected studs and properties bear the costs of preventing the spread of OJD to the rest of the industry?",74
104,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know it is of concern to many people in rural areas, particularly in Johne's Disease affected regions of New South Wales, where the problem stems back many years as a result of some of inactivity of state governments in that state. I have made it quite plain-and I am on the public record on it, so I am not sure why we need to waste the House's time on this particular point-that we have a working party set up by the states and the governments to examine this matter. I will consider the outcome of the deliberations of that working committee when they have completed their work at the end of this month. Domestic Violence Summit Miss JACKIE KELLY-My question is addressed to the Minister for the Status of Women. As reducing domestic violence is a priority of the government, what is the government doing to combat domestic violence in Australian families?",74
105,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for her question because each year half a million women in Australia experience either physical or sexual violence. This has a profound effect on the lives of women and children, and indeed on family life. Thirty-eight per cent of women experiencing violent episodes at home have stated that their children have witnessed these incidents. The devastating long-term effects of such violence on the lives of children may never be fully quantified. The Prime Minister has expressed a strong personal commitment to women's safety and is determined to take a united stand against this abhorrent crime, which shatters the lives and the well-being of thousands of Australian women and their children. The Prime Minister, in this respect, has written to the premiers and the chief ministers, inviting them to a national domestic violence summit. The summit will be held on Friday, 7 November at Parliament House here in Canberra, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. This will be the first time ever that the heads of government will meet to discuss domestic violence as a key national issue. Despite considerable resources being committed every year by the state and territory governments to shelter support services and the criminal justice system and by the Commonwealth to income support, accommodation and health services, domestic violence continues to affect the lives of a great many Australian families. To further strengthen the Commonwealth's commitment, we will be announcing significant initiatives at next month's summit and this will be the beginning of a process for developing innovative strategies to stop domestic violence. I believe it is vital that we all make-and I hope that there will be bipartisan support for this-a concerted effort to put into place effective measures to prevent domestic violence and to change community attitudes about this crime. The potential of a unified statement by the heads of government condemning domestic violence and committing to a national approach is a very significant step. It should send an extremely powerful signal to the community that domestic violence will not be tolerated in this country. Nursing Homes",75
106,Ms ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, is it not a fact that today, because of difficulty associated with the introduction of new childcare arrangements, you announced a delay to allow proper implementation of those changes? In light of the massive anxiety and confusion in the community about the government's new nursing home daily fees, will you also delay introduction of those fees?",75
107,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was yesterday, in fact, that I announced the deferral of the start of the child-care fees to commence on or about 27 April, which is after Easterwhich is a more preferable date than 1 January-to allow further preparation of the necessary forms and arrangements with Centrelink. That deferral was as a result of extensive representations that were made both to my former colleague in this ministry and to me. I am pleased to be able to do that because the changes in child care are, of course, designed to benefit the families of Australia. . With regard to the other matter that you raise, that start date, 1 November, for the nursing home and hostel fees has been the product of legislation passed in this place and in the Senate. That legislation will be proceeding. Repatriation Benefits",75
108,Mr BRADFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Is the minister aware that Australian naval personnel who served in a logistic support capacity during the Vietnam War do not have the same access to repatriation benefits as other Vietnam veterans? How did this inequity arise; and does the government have any plans to'resolve it?,75
109,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I acknowledge the member for MCPherson's service in VietnamMr Sercomb-That is probably why we lost the war.,76
110,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and his interest in issues of those particularly who served in Vietnam. I am aware that around 10,000 Vietnam naval veterans who served with a logistic support group have, until now, only had access to repatriation benefits in respect of the time that they actually spent in operational waters. This contrasts ments made available to other veterans of the Vietnam War who also have coverage from the time they spent travelling to and from the operational area. It was, quite clearly, an unfair situation, which this government has fixed. Naval logistic support personnel who served in Vietnam are now eligible for veterans' benefits for port to port operational service",76
111,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You sent them but you will not give them repatriation benefits.,76
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition!,76
113,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"rather than just the time they spent in the waters off Vietnam. In answer to the honourable member's question-and I notice the sensitivity of the Leader of the Opposition-this came about because of an instrument signed in 1986 by the then Minister for Defence, today's Leader of the Opposition, denying naval logistic support personnel eligibility for port to port coverage.",76
114,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order which goes to relevance. The point of relevance is this: the question that was asked the minister was what he intended to do about this contemporary situation. That particular situation was a product of my extending rep at benefits to them when you gave them nothing!",76
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.,76
116,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This inequity came about by the instrument signed by the then Minister for Defence, the now Leader of the Opposition, back in 1986. By resolving this unfair situation created by the Leader of the Opposition, 10,000 naval Vietnam veterans now have greater access to benefits, including disability pension and health care. This fulfils a commitment that we gave to the people of Australia before the last election.",76
117,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You gave them nothing.,76
118,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Big Bopper cannot take a little bit of his own back.,76
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will conwith the entitleclude his answer.,76
120,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would also like to particularly thank my colleague the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel for her role in restoring fairness to the veterans' entitlements. This is on the back of the recently announced initiative of the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel of the extension of the Australian active service medal with clasp to these very same veterans. Mr Bradford- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. My colleagues inform me that, after I asked that question, a derogatory remark about my war service was made by the member for Maribyrnong which was not only offensive to me but would have been offensive to all Vietnam veterans. Mr Speaker, I ask that you to ask him to withdraw the comment that he made.",76
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! In the general hubbub of conversation in the chamber, the alleged words were not heard by the Chair. But I invite the honourable member for Maribyrnong to reflect on any comments that he may have made. Mr Sercombe- Mr Speaker, the words were intended to add a small element of humour. If the honourable member took offence, I withdraw them.",76
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Maribyrnong. A-cellular DTPa Vaccine,76
123,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health. If the minister quite rightly argues that the government has an obligation to follow the National Health and Medical Research Council's advice on the availability of vaccines and antibiotics for dealing with meningicoccal cases, will the minister now reconsider his decision to ignore the advice of the National Health and Medical Research Council that the government fund the improved A-cellular DTPa vaccine for vaccinations for babies at ages two, four and six months; or will the minister continue to maintain that he knows better than the nation's premier national medical research organisation?",76
124,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Quite clearly, you know nothing. The NHMRC made their decision in May this year. The additional information I have referred to was not available at that time, and the head of the National Health Advisory Committee, Professor Stephen Leeder, has said to me that it was absolutely the correct decision to make. It is nice to see you are in there barracking for one multinational over another.",77
125,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. If the minister believes he has scientific information which makes the previous decision of the National Health and Medical Research Council redundant, will he refer that information to the council for the council to decide, rather than for the minister to think he knows more than the national medical research council?",77
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The substance of the question is in order. I invite the minister to respond.,77
127,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My job is to try to protect the community interest, and my job is to balance competing interests. The fact is that one of the companies involved in this has behaved in such a way that they approached people who have subsequently come to me and said that they were offered to be paid to get out and put a particular point of view. This is a fight between two large drug companies and, quite frankly, you are Stupid to get in the middle of it. Immigration",77
128,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-:-My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The government has made significant changes to the structure and size of the immigration program. Can the minister inform the House what impact these changes have made on the profile of settlers arriving in Australia, especially in the important area of skilled migration?",77
129,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to have this question from the honourable member for Kooyong. As members know, I have commented before on the nature of the program we inherited when we came into office-the lack of balance and the fact that immigration was growing very rapidly and we had lost very significant public support for it. The government made a number of important decisions. The first was to reduce the overall size of the program and the second was to restore balance by bringing the huge growth in family migration back into a situation of relationship with skilled migration.",77
130,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,People cannot bring their spouses to Australia. That is the result. That is your idea of balance!,77
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Calwell!,77
132,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These decisions are beginning to show results and that will assist in restoring public confidence in the immigration program. The latest edition of my department's publication Immigration Update has just been released and it shows that there were 85,752 settler arrivals in 1996-97. That is a 13 per cent reduction compared with the previous year. The net outcome was 55,895, and that shows a decrease of 20.7 per cent. This reflects the changes in the program announced by the government immediately after it came to office, so we can expect, I think, further shifts to occur in the further reported figures that will come in time. The other benefits that members will see when they read Immigration Update is that there has been a significant reduction in the spouse and fiancee category in particular.",77
133,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Family reunion.,77
134,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Calwell!,77
135,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It had reached, as the honourable member knows, 70 per cent of the non-humanitarian program. The government has not in any way used capping measures or restricted the growth in that category",77
136,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, you have. You have a whole queuing system and people cannot get in.",78
137,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"but we are intent on bona fides testing. The honourable member might like to know that that bona fides testing has yielded very significant results. We have seen a very significant decrease in the number of applications. For some months it has decreased by something of the order of 25 per cent. We have seen a very significant increase in the number of rejections, and I might say we have seen next to no increase in the number of appeals. That would suggest to me that we are getting it right in terms of the impact that bona fides testing is having.",78
138,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about the people waiting in queues?,78
139,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There have always been queues necessary while you consider applications and require people to embark upon appropriate assessment of their entitlement to come to Australia. But we are in a situation where the announced program for this year will have family reunion at 50 per cent and skilled migration at 50 per cent. We have already seen in the settler arrivals a significant increase in the number of people coming into Australia through the skill streams, and I would expect that to increase. The only observation I would make is that that is important for Australia's economic development. The business skills category particularly provides significant economic benefit to Australia. It brings in human and financial capital, and research shows that it brings significant numbers of jobs and enhances our export potential. These changes, of course, along with the very much higher entry standards in the independent category, which are at historically high levels, are producing a significant benefit for Australia. The point I would make is that in this smaller program with a far better balance in it I think we have gone a considerable way towards restoring public confidence in the way in which the immigration program is being conducted, and I think that is good news for all Australians. Nursing Homes: Therapeutical Services",78
140,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Does the minister agree that many occupants of nursing homes, once they have paid their compulsory entry fee, will have very low disposable incomes, some as low as $25 a week? How does the minister expect these nursing home residents to be able to afford to stay on their essential medicines once his therapeutic group premium policy forces patients to pay more? Does the minister also agree that these frail and elderly patients, who. might need to use medication for high blood pressure, cholesterol or ulcers, will experience confusion if they are forced to switch to medications which may be less effective and have different side effects? Minister, on financial, health and compassionate grounds, will you consider exempting nursing home patients from your dangerous and unfair policy?",78
141,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We had actually heard that the honourable member was doing the rounds of the Sydney business community seeing if there might be a job available, but you do not actually have to be a lobbyist for the multinational drug companies. Quite. frankly, this is ridiculous. You didn't know that, Kim? Sorry to let the cat out of the bag.",78
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will address the question.,78
143,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The answer is that the premise of the question is utterly wrong. Why it is wrong is that there is in every case an option where a person will not have to pay a cent more. Trade: Malaysia,78
144,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. Could the Acting Prime Minister advise the House of the economic benefits that will result from the signing of a new trade and economic cooperation agreement with Malaysia? What will be the business opportunities for Australian exporters and investment within the region? In addition, can the Acting Prime Minister provide details on the announcement that the federal government will provide Malaysia with assistance to conduct an air quality study within the region?",78
145,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Page for his question. I advise the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has approved a $300,000 allocation from the Au sAID budget to help facilitate research, involving the CSIRO and the Malaysian department of the environment, with regard to the horrific haze which has descended on a very large part of Malaysia, parts of southern Thailand and parts of Indonesia.",79
146,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,79
147,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You might think it is a light-hearted matter; it is not. It is ously affecting the health of many children throughout the area. It is affecting the tourist industry throughout the area. It is affecting the operations of aviation, and the safe operations of aviation, throughout the area. You have to go there to see first-hand how horrific this problem is. So it is that the federal government is helping on a range of fronts. The most recent of these was to give $300,000, as part of a package of research, to help on that equation as well as in the actual fire fighting, which continues to take place in the area of Sumatra and other parts of Indonesia. It reflects the positive, practical engagement Australia has with Malaysia and with Asia. I am very proud of that part of the coalition government's ongoing approach. It is true that I have signed a new trade agreement with Malaysia on behalf of the government, negotiated over a period of time. It provides a modem framework for the $4 billion trading relationship. It provides mechanisms to explore opportunities for collaboration in new areas such as industry, science, technology-including information technology-and trade and investment. I was able to take a number of business men and women through to have further specific talks about that and about the multimedia super corridor unfolding in Kuala Lumpur. I point out to the member for the Northern Territory that, at my behest, we were also able to use the Internet on location, as an example of electronic commerce, and call up Mix Whips from the Northern Territory, located down the track from Darwin. This operator, a small businessman, makes a leather whipOpposition members-Oh!",79
148,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"which you might laugh about. He had the initiative to open a web site about a year ago, helped by our communications package. And what happened? He has had a 700 per cent increase in his business in exporting mixed whips. Mr Crean-Well!",79
149,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is an aspect of this which may be of concern to 'Bordeaux'. seriTwenty-five per cent of the whips are being exported to the USA-I am not sure whether for honourable or dishonourable purposes. Good luck to mixed whips! It is a practical example of boosting our export efforts. I invite members to use their Internet skills-I know the member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, is always extolling the virtues of the Internet-and look up Mix Whips on the Internet, and more orders will be placed. The agreement also formalises joint trade commissions at ministerial level, enshrines MFN treatment for Australia's exports to Malaysia and will provide for further diversification of our trade between Australia and Malaysia. I also visited Thailand and helped the promotion of our trade efforts in that regard. The matter of our trade with Thailand and with Malaysia has a very serious aspect to it. I inform the House of a matter which will unfold next month, on 27 November, near Bangkok. At that location, a new high-tech export factory will open, involving one-third Malaysia, one-third Thailand and one-third Australian interests. . The Thailand dairy joint venture will take Australian dairy product from the electorate of Page, the north-coast of New South Wales and many other parts of Australia. It will then be processed by high-tech, packaged, combined with local product and exported from that location near Bangkok to Asian countries and to the Thai domestic market, reflecting the one and a half billion dollar dairy export now flowing to Asia and beyond, to the rest of the world. The coalition government is getting on with boosting our trade effort at every stage. The most recent visitto Malaysia and Thailand helped in that regard. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. COOKS RIVER: COLLAPSE OF DAM",79
150,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will take a moment of the House to speak on a matter advised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). I advise the House that at about 12.30 p.m. today in Sydney a coffer dam wall, holding back parts of the Cooks River, let go. As a result, there was flooding of the Sydney airport railway tunnel, which is under construction. There were 21 workers on the work site at the time. Two were swept some 50 metres or 60 metres along the tunnel and are noW in a serious but stable condition, following extraordinary rescue efforts by their workmates at the site. They are now in St George Hospital. It is to be hoped that their condition is improving. I am further advised that there is no disruption or effect with regard to the neighbouring Sydney Mascot airport. I know that members then said: will join with me in wishing a full and speedy recovery to the two workers who have been seriously injured in the course of this collapse of the coffer dam. I also commend who were involved with the rescue of those two workers. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",80
151,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker, I appreciate the statement of Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) in that regard. While that is terribly sad news and I associate myself with the remarks that he made and the wishes that he extended to the injured in their recovery and the thanks the people who were involved in the rescue, the early news on that was that 14 people were missing and people were uncertain what their situation was. Sad is, it is a heck of a lot better than it started out. NA",80
152,Mr REITH,SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS," Mr Speaker, I wanted to raise with you on indulgence a practice of the House with respect to supplementary questions. As you will appreciate, when Labor was in office there were basically no supplementary questions. We had two or three suppleWALL mentary questions in our 13 years in opposition. As the opposition had had a rough trot for those 13 years, it was decided that the opposition should have a fairer go after March 1996. Two things have been said about this in your directions about the conditions of supplementary questions. Firstly, you said that they should be in precise and direct terms without preamble. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that we are now seeing the habit of the opposition to simply make debating points. That is constantly the case. The second thing you said was in a letter of June 1996. You said: However, I do not see a situation arising where I will permit a supplementary question to be asked after every original question. You did say that; that is fair enough. You It will be a more irregular occurrence. For example, today I think we had three all those supplementary questions. Mr Crean-How many did we have today?",80
153,Mr REITH,SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS,"You had three today. One got up and two were rejected. You had three questions. Mr Speaker, when you said it would be a more irregular occurthe rence, I would not have thought that you would have meant that one in three would be supplementary questions. I raise the matter now. I could have raised it as a point of order during question time. I did not do that beto cause, quite frankly, any questions that lot ask, we are more than happy to provide a fulsome response to, as we saw the Minister as to for Health and Family Services (Dr though the news Wooldridge) do. My point to· you, Mr Speaker, is that the practice as it has evolved has now departed from what you put to the House as being the practice. When we were in opposition we had two or three supplementary questions in 13 years. Now we are getting two or three every day of the week. Mr Speaker, that is not in accordance with your own directions. I ask you to reflect on it.",80
154,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS,"I thank the Leader of the House. I will do exactly as invited-I will reflect on the matter. At the moment, without divulging my hand, I am quite happy with the way supplementary questions are going.",81
155,Mr CREAN,SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS,"On indulgence, this is an attempt to intimidate you, Mr Speaker. Let me remind the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) of what you said in this regard. It is contained on page 504 of House of Representatives Practice. You said in this place in 1996: I have allowed and will continue to allow supplementary questions at the discretion of the chair subject to the following conditions: the supplementary question should arise from the Minister's response and will be regarded as part of the one question; the supplementary questions will be restricted to the person who asked the original question; and the supplementary question is to be put in precise and direct terms without preamble. I would also expect the Minister's response to be brief. I do not expect to permit a supplementary question on all occasions. If what we are being told now is that you have to read that down by some quantification, when this is your ruling and your discretion and when it has already been admitted by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) that today there were three supplementary questions and you ruled two of them out of order and somehow one out of 20 supplementary questions is supposed to be a breach of your ruling, it is an outrage. It is just another attempt by the Leader of the House-because he cannot control that side and because his ministers will not answer any question that we ask-to thug you, and I am delighted that you are rejecting that approach.",81
156,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS,"I thank the honourable member for Hotham. As I indicated earlier, I will reflect on the matter. NA",81
157,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",81
158,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,81
159,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I do, indeed.",81
160,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Proceed.,81
161,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Before doing so, I wish you a happy birthday.",81
162,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"That is why I have been so incredibly tolerant today.,",81
163,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am delighted to see that you had such a good question time for your birthday. That is not where I have been misrepresented. I was misrepresented by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who implied that I had imposed an injustice upon the naval logistics support personnel associated with the Vietnam War. In 1986, as the minister said, I did bring and down a decision in that regard. That decision reversed a position which had been put in place under the Menzies government and persisted through five Liberal-National Party administrations, which denied them any benefits at all-none whatsoever for those naval logistics personnel. I reversed that position and gave them that benefit. Far from imposing the injustice that he indicates, it rectified a Liberal injustice. Given the relationship of the particular government to their war service, it was a most inappropriate one.",81
164,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",81
165,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the minister claim to have been misrepresented?,81
166,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I have just been misrepresented.",81

177,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,82
178,Mr LEE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes.,82
179,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Proceed.,82
180,Mr LEE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"-'-During question time the Minister for Health and Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith), who seems to have scurried out of the House once again, made the claim that he had heard that I had been doing the rounds of the Sydney business community looking for a job. For the record, this sleazy allegation is completely untrue and the minister has either fabricated an untruth or repeated falsehoods told to him. Either way he has misled the House. NA",82
181,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"As members would be aware, I have a number of privileges cases under consideration and today I intend to report to the House on two of them. On Thursday, 2 October the honourable member for Banks raised, as a matter of privilege, allegations to the effect that the Attorney General had interfered improperly in connection with an inquiry by the parliamentary joint committee on native title. The honourable member for Banks presented a number of documents on the matter and made certain comments. Subsequently, the Attorney-General spoke by indulgence and presented a number of other documents. I have now had an opportunity to examine all of the documents and the remarks of the two members. The following aspects are not in dispute: first, that the Law ReformCommission or its officers had been willing to give evidence to the parliamentary committee; secondly, that the Law Reform Commission officers later indicated that they did not intend to proceed with the giving of evidence; and, thirdly, that the Attorney-General had certain views on the proposed giving of evidence or making of a submission to the committee by the commission and that his views were conveyed to the commission. The dispute seems to centre on the nature and character of the actions taken by or on behalf of the Attorney-General. It is evident that the Attorney had formed certain views on the role of the commission, that these were conveyed to the commission and that particular views were expressed in connection with the parliamentary committee's inquiry. As I see it, it is not claimed that the Attorney directed the commission not to give evidence. The member for Banks has characterised the relevant actions as a 'determined effort by the government to frighten off the commission. Clearly, different emphases can be, and have been, put on the matters asserted or claimed thus far. Under our current law if a contempt or breach of privilege has been committed, it would be because an action or actions amounted to or were intended or likely to amount to an improper interference with the free performance by the committee of its authority or functions. I refer there to section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. In this case, if an offence had been committed, it could be constituted only by actions in respect of prospective witnesses. The statutory provisions of section 12 of the act are also relevant. It can certainly be argued that an action which interferes with the giving or proposed giving of evidence is a contempt, even if the action is otherwise lawful. I note, however, that in both sections 4 and 12 of the act the word 'improper' is used with reference to actions which constitute contempts. My task is not to make a judgment as to whether a breach of privilege or a contempt has occurred. Rather, my duty is to form a view as to whether a prima facie case has been established. Having examined all of the material available to me, I am unable to form the opinion that a prima facie case of contempt has been made out and I do not consider the papers presented to the House constitute evidence of improper interference. On the second complaint: the honourable member for Banks also raised the matter of the alleged unauthorised publication of certain documents presented by the Attorney-General. As I understand it, these were a copy of a fax from the parliamentary committee to an officer of the Law Reform Commission and a letter from the committee secretary to the committee chair. It is not clear to me that in fact either document would be covered by the provisions of relevant standing orders dealing with the unauthorised disclosure of documents. Accordingly, in my opinion, a prima facie case has not been made out on this issue. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS",82

Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adin journed. MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE can just Nursing Homes",83
184,Mr SPEAKER,PAPERS,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The concern and insecurity amongst aged Australians caused by the Federal government's unfair changes to nursing home funding and in particular the imposition of the new daily fee on nursing home residents on 1 November. I call upon those members who approve the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",84
185,Mr LEE,PAPERS,I want to begin today's discussion of the matter of public importance by explaining why the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith) is sitting at the table this afternoon. Why is the member for Bass the Minister for Health and Family Services? Opposition members-He's unlucky.,84
186,Mr LEE,PAPERS,"Lucky or unlucky, let us try to think about why he is the man sitting at the table today, especially given that you can imagine the member for Bass four weeks ago sitting in his ministerial office, waiting for the 1996call from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to let him know what the impact would be for of the cabinet reshuffle. There had been all the press speculation that he was about to be elevated to cabinet; a candidate for Attorney-General; a possible minister for communigiven his experience in that areaand especially when you think back that in opposition he had been a very senior figure. He had been the manager of opposition business. He had had the responsibility under John Hewson for explaining to the Australian people why there should be a 10 per cent cut in the ABC's budget, losing his seat in the process. He was written up as one of the leaders, one of the great white hopes of for the Liberal Party. But what went wrong? He was sitting there his ministerial office waiting for the call from the Prime Minister four weeks ago. You imagine it: the phone rings, 'It's John Howard here, Warwick. I have good news for you. You are the new Minister for Family Services.' Some of you might be wondering why the member for Bass is sitting in the outer ministry being Minister for Family Services, being handed the poison chalice for implementing this government's cutbacks in funding for aged care and being handed the poison chalice with the second poison pill of being responsible for child-care fee increases. The reason for the Prime Minister's call can be found in this book, The End of Certainty, of a famous book written by Paul Kelly. If members tum to page 469, they will find that almost 10 years ago the member for Bass was conspiring with people like the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in trying to undo John Howard, the member for Bennelong, as the Leader of the Opposition. Many of us on this side would have thought that after 10 years John Howard would have forgiven Warwick Smith for his treachery. After 10 years you would have thought that John Howard, the Prime Minister, might have forgiven you, Warwick, for what you did on page 469 of The End of Certainty. But when that call came through the member for Bass knew that John Howard never forgets. As a result, we have this minister losing responsibility for sport and territories and the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Today he is sitting at the table trying to explain to elderly Australians why they should pay more for their essential aged care. The House had a chance to put the minister on the spot today . We had a series of questions very ably put by my colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), who has been on almost every radio station program in the last 24 hours seeking to debate the Minister for Family Services and pleading with him to come out and explain the government's position. Ms Macklin-Where is he?",84
187,Mr LEE,PAPERS,"It is not, 'Where's Wally?' It is, 'Where's Warwick?' Why is he not out there trying to explain how the government intends to make changes at the edges and make some finetuning as announced by the Prime Minister? We would like him to get out there and explain what he is going to do. The only person who has had an opportunity to find out what the minister intends to do is Francis Sullivan from the Catholic Health Care Association. Mr Sullivan gave quite an interesting explanation about what the minister said to him last night. Mr Sullivan spoke on AM this morning. Mr Sullivan claimed to explain to the Australian public what the member for Bass and Minister for Family Services said to him last night. This is what he said: He also conceded that $80 million a year out of aged care sector is untenable. That is what Francis Sullivan said that the minister said last night. When we put to the minister this afternoon at question time, 'Do you deny that you told Francis Sullivan that it was untenable to take $80 million a year out of aged care?' the mInIster refused to deny it. It was quite clear to every member in this House that, when the member for Jagajaga put this minister on the spot as to whether he did concede to Francis Sullivan that he thought it was wrong or untenable to withdraw that $80 million, the minister refused to deny it. He also refused to deny that he told Francis Sullivan: ... that capital funding was one thing but slashing the care subsidies of residents is a completely different and untenable situation and hethe ministerconcurred with that. Those are two statements made by Francis Sullivan on two occasions and this minister refused to deny that he said the things that have been alleged by Francis Sullivan. That is the first matter. Isn't it interesting that on the very day the Prime Minister walks up the stairs of his jet to fly off to the mother country this minister is within hours briefing Francis Sullivan and telling him there should be at least a $80 million a year backdown. He waits until the Prime Minister is leaving the country before he starts trying undermine the Prime Minister's position on these issues. Mr Latham-Like the old days. Ms Macklin-Just like the old days.",85
188,Mr LEE,PAPERS,"Just like the old days. I thank my colleagues for the interjection. Just like the good old days of 1988 and 1989 working with John Elliott and Andrew Peacock to undermine the member for Bennelong. One of the other difficulties this minister has is that yesterday he made a major error. He referred to the problems that the government has in convincing elderly people that they should pay up-front accommodation bonds and said that the Liberal Party and the government can overcome this problem by telling people, 'It is easy, you can pay for it the out of your estate.' That was the minister's new answer yesterday to the Liberal Party's public relations problem. We put to the minister today, 'Well, what does that mean?' For example, what does it mean to a pensioner who lives in the electorate of Dobell who is being asked to pay $100,000 as an up-front accommodation bond in for-profit nursing home on the Central Coast? We asked the minister, 'Doesn't it mean that they will be up for at least 8.863 per cent in compound interest on the amount that will be deducted from their estate and that after a very short period, if they die after five years, of that $100,000, $56,150 will be kept or taken from their estate?' I db not know a lot about the death duties that used to apply a decade or two ago, but I do not think death duties were anywhere near as high as 56 per cent of the inheritance of younger children. Yet this minister is arguing that this is the answer for the accommodation bond. This is the real alternative to part pensioners who live in the electorates of Jagajaga or Dobell-part pensioners who are being asked to put $100,000. This minister says they should put that off and, instead, be up for $56,000 from their estates. It is just. quite ridiculous. Yesterday the minister also told us that it is okay for Doug Moran to charge people who live in Rose Bay $250,000 as an up-front accommodation bond because that was only 25 per cent of the value of a home in Rose Bay. If the minister is saying that his finetuning will impose a new 25 per cent cap on the value of housing in an area, how does he explain to the part pensioners in his electorate, the part pensioners who live in Launceston, that they should pay up to 100 per cent of the value of their homes? If it is all right for a 25 per cent cap for the residents of Rose Bay, why will he not impose a 25 per cent cap on the value of a home in Launceston, which would put the cap at $20,000? ",85
189,Mr LEE,PAPERS,"-For the battlers in Launcestonnot the $250,000 cap that you refused to endorse here yesterday. This government is bouncing and lurching from crisis to crisis as it tries to explain these unfair, unjust and retrospective changes. They are unfair because they start to hit part pensioners when their non-pension income exceeds $50 a week. This is not simply something that hits people who are very well off. Pensioners are starting now to work out that it starts to hit them as part pensioners once their non-pension income exceeds only $50 a week in interest. These measures are also unjust because those who can afford to pay more will get better aged care treatment, they will get the better nursing homes, they will get the better rooms in each of the for-profit nursing homes. Those part pensioners who cannot afford the large up-front bonds will be receiving aged care of a much lower quality. What it means is that wealth and not health is going to determine the level of aged care and treatment that people will get for many years to come. So it is unfair, it is unjust and it is retrospective. The changes are retrospective because there are quite a few elderly people out there, retirees, who a few years ago sought out information on what the rules were so that they could perhaps give some money to their children. They might have given $30,000 to their kids to help them with a home deposit for a block of land. They would have contacted the Department of Social Security three years ago to find out what the impact would be on their pension if they did gift some money to their kids for a deposit. This minister and this government, with their retrospective changes, have said, 'In addition to the changes to their pension, because they helped their kids with a home deposit, we are going to make them pay more in higher daily fees because they took the trouble of being generous to their kids, to help their kids out with a deposit on their home.' Quite clearly we have a minister and a government that are trying to introduce unfair, unjust and retrospective changes. This is coming from a government led by a Prime Minister who a few weeks ago in Hobart described the changes in these words: 'These changes are fair, defensible and equitable.' Changes that force part pensioners to pay a higher daily fee when they earn only $50 a week are, according to the Prime Minister, 'fair, defensible and equitable'. The Sydney Morning Herald summed it up quite clearly on the front page today. It said: But Mr Howard made it clearto the party roomthe policy would be a test of his political resolve, declaring in the joint party room that the Government could not afford to back down because it would appear to be weak. What is driving this is the Prime Minister's self-image. Mr Beazley interjecting",86
190,Mr LEE,PAPERS,"As the Leader of the Opposition interjects, it is because we have a weak Prime Minister. He does not have the strength to face up to the fact that he has made a mistake. He is not man enough to admit that the government has done the wrong thing in aged care. He is not prepared to instruct this minister to scrap the changes. As a result, Warwick is here, beavering away, undermining the Prime Minister, trying to box the Prime Minister into a humiliating backdown. Yet, if we had a Prime Minister who had the strength, we might have actually had these measures scrapped some time ago. But is it any wonder that the Prime Minister is unable or unwilling to act? We have a Prime Minister who has seen his mandate evaporate before his· eyes in less than 18 months. We have resignations from ministers because of their share dealings and their travel arrangements. We have businessmen attacking the government because there is no national vision. There is cowardice in the response to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). We have pleas from Liberal Party Premiers calling for leadership from the Prime Minister on any issue. 'Any issue, please,' Jeff Kennett says. 'Just give us some leadership on anything so we can see that we have a Prime Minister who is trying to do the best by the country.' The fact is that we have a Prime Minister who, with a dismissive flick of his hand as he walks up the stairs of the jet plane, breathes a sigh of relief that he is leaving behind all these problems with nursing homes, the problems with the implementation of the cutbacks that he has been responsible for. Last time, his great achievement on that overseas trip was to be seen in his big white shoes and shorts like Mickey Mouse walking around international capitals. Let us hope he is not quite as embarrassing this time. But, no matter what he does on his overseas trip, what we want him to do is to come back with a bit of strength; to come back as a Prime Minister who is willing to instruct the Minister for Family Services, the man whom he handed the poison chalice, to scrap these changes, to say to part pensioners, 'We think that it is wrong to charge you more once you earn $50 a week.' Let me give the minister a warning: if he cannot box the Prime Minister in and embarrass the Prime Minister into a backdown before 1 November, then it will be this minister who will be dead meat, not the Prime Minister, because come 1 November the new higher daily fees will take effect. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of part pensioners out there who have not yet been assessed by this minister's department. What the nursing homes and the hostels are telling the part pensioners today in the lead-up to 1 November is that, if the department cannot get their act together and cannot complete the assessments by 1 November, people who are earning as little as $50 a week will be charged $420 a week until the department and the minister can sort out their own difficulties. Quite clearly we have a government that has been prepared to try to introduce unfair, unjust and retrospective changes that are going to hurt large numbers of elderly Australians. These changes are going to mean that the level of aged care and the quality of aged care that elderly Australians receive will be determined by their wealth and not their health. These measures should be scrapped. We know they are going to be scrapped. The question is: will this minister pay with his head before this government finally backs down? That is the answer we want to know, Minister. Is this going to cost you your political career as well as your place in cabinet?",87
191,Mr WARWICK SMITH,PAPERS,"The contribution from the member for Dobell and shadow minister for health (Mr Lee) is intriguing in several respects, not the least of which is that he is the one who is actually leading the debate. I would have thought that on this issue it would have been the relevant shadow minister, the member for J agajaga (Ms Macklin). But I am not surprised that the member for Dobell is in here, because he has not been sighted for quite a long time and the need to have some factional balance on the other side of the chamber. is an absolute political essential for the current Leader of Opposition (Mr Beazley). As we have seen over recent times with the young and the restless over there, poor old Kim has to play to each of them and give them each a go. It is the old Machiavellian principle: if you have a few contenders looking for your job, keep as many of them active as you possibly can. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I know the minister is under terrible stress here, but can'the at least address the MPI rather than his own flights of fancy?",87
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,Mr Nehl)Order! I suggest to the member for Watson that this is No Stress Day. There is no point of order.,88
193,Mr WARWICK SMITH,PAPERS,"Thanks for your protection, Mr Deputy Speaker. The first 10 minutes of the speech by the shado,w minister for health-I was just saying that it is odd that he should be leading this debate-was a detailed analysis of my political career, details that I did not know myself from somewhere in The End of Certainty, the book by Paul Kelly. I have tremendous respect for Paul Kelly, but I do not ever remember Paul Kelly asking me what my views were about matters back in the early 1980s. But it is interesting, I guess, to go back to the 1980s. In 1988 the member for Dobell, in a debate concerning assets tests and social security issues, made some very interesting points. At that stage he was on the other side of the fence, arguing for responsible policy outcomes. That is what we are arguing for: responsible policy outcomes. He said this on 23 November 1988, quite a time ago: Having sat through debates in this chamber when members of the opposition sought to inflame fear in the community about the assets test, I wonder who is to blame for causing fear in the pensioner community. How the times have changed. Over the last several weeks it has been you who have been out there scaring the community. Today we heard the first question from the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, trying.to act concerned. We heard a question from the shadow minister for health trying to raise concerns about pharmaceutical benefits, which the the Minster for Health (Dr Wooldridge) was able to put down straight away. That was the reason why yesterday, for the first time, as I understand it, in this parliament since we took office, a censure motion was passed against the opposition. I would like to read it into the record again for the benefit of my colleagues and the benefit of those who are listening to this debate. We censured the opposition for four basic reasons yesterday. The first reason was for conducting a deliberate policy of misinformation in an effort to scare the aged in Australia. The second reason was for massively underfunding nursing homes and failing to introduce any mechanism to improve capital funding and improve standards in nursing homes. The third reason was for failing to disclose the tax it proposes to introduce to fund the nursing home sector. The fourth reason was for attempting to prey on the vulnerable for political advantage. That motion was passed yesterday. In proceeding that debate I put into the Hansard a quote from Senator Woodley from the Democrats. Remember that Senator Woodley, along with former Senator Kernot, supported the aged care legislation which has now been passed through the parliament, is an act and is the subject of this debate. They said that they were also disgusted at the scare campaign that was being conducted by the opposition. Responsible commentators in this country give you no credit for what you are doing in walking away from the fundamental requirements of addressing that 75 per cent-I had the graph in here the other dayreduction over the 13 years of the Hawke and Keating era in support for the capital requirements of nursing homes. That is a legacy this government now has to address. But it is a little more than that. It is about standards in nursing homes. It is about affording aged Australians a quality of care now and into the future. It is about dealing with the age demographic, which I have so often talked about, positively and constructively. It is about making sure that the aged in our community have facilities that are at a standard that we can be proud of as a nation. As I said yesterday, we ought to be proud of a nation that venerates the aged, that gives them the standards which they deserve, which they have worked for. I do not think it is wrong, and neither do responsible commentators think it is wrong, to ask for some contribution towards the cost of nursing home care from those who can pay. There was some mention of Francis Sullivan. Indeed, I talked with him. I respect his contribution. I will not always agree with him and he will not always agree with me, but what he said to me last night, I thought, was quite telling. He said that personal responsibility and community contribution are the way ahead for the 1990s. That is the fundamental approach this government is taking. We are saying that those who can demonstratedly pay should make some contribution and that the government should make some contribution. I quoted the figures. By the year 2001 over $3 billion will go into residential aged care in this country. I am advised that the average amount paid in support of residential aged care for the 135,000-odd people who are currently in nursing homes and hostels is about $15,000. That is the contribution that is continuing from this government, and that is a massive amount of money. If you look at the graph, you will see that the increase in the outlays by this government for residential care facilities averages about three per cent in real terms. That is a significant amount of funds. We have 3,000 nursing homes and hostels in this country and we desperately want to provide them with a policy that recognises that the demand for entry will increase over time. We know that there will be a 50 per cent increase in the over-80s age bracket between 1991 and the year 2000, many of whom will need to go into nursing homes. This is an issue that is fundamental and that must be addressed. It requires some policy changes. In pursuing policy changes, this government undertook a detailed period of consultation with consumer groups, with the industry and with a whole range of <;>thers to try to come together with a policy. That policy was passed earlier in the year and has already started. The fee increases that start on 1 November relate to a means testing in a very fair way of those who are in homes. We have to make sure that people understand the facts-that 65 per cent of the people in nursing homes and hostels are not affected by the fees because they are pensioners and that 10 per cent of the remainder are not pensioners at all. We have in place a means test which is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. It follows closely on what has been done in the social security area where people . are asked to make a contribution. If there are hardships we will deal with them. There are hardship provisions there. We will deal with those hardships. Referring back to Mr Sullivan, I understand the view that he is putting forward and I will consider it. Indeed, I have seen comments from others who have different views and I will consider those as well. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, I am charged with considering all these matters in a sensible way. I have been minister for two weeks; I am not going to rush headlong into proposing changes that I know will not be good for the development of the long-term needs of the elderly in this country. So I will consult. I saw today in the Newcastle Herald a letter from Ralph Watson, the chief executive officer from the Catholic Centre for the Aged. He makes some interesting points. It is a very positive letter setting out the detail of the policy and expressing the view that this is a requirement for the long-term needs of the people in this country. He says: It does not seem unreasonable that the frail aged are provided with a higher standard of accommodation and service through a relatively modest levy on the assets they own. Precisely. And Francis Sullivan also agrees with that fundamental principle. The distortion of the arguments being put by responsible commentators and by a responsible government possessed of a desire to deliver fair outcomes for all Australians leads to the conclusion that the purpose of the opposition's stance on these matters is purely and completely political. If you want any demonstration of that then you only have to see what has taken place in this MPI today. Yesterday they moved a censure motion and it was reversed on them and we were able to censure them-first time ever. Today we had to have a balancing of the factional outcomes in the Labor Party to give the poor shadow minister for health a bit of a run. He talks about me being given a difficult job. He has been given a job that makes him invisible. He knows, and the leader knows, that if he does not get a bit of a run nobody up in the seat of Dobell will know whether he is still here or not. So he has to get a bit of a run. The member for Jagajaga launched into declaring various things today in question time, but implicit in her question to me was, 'We think that death duties are not a bad thing.' 1\1s Macklin- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I ask the minister to withdraw that statement. He knows that it is untrue.",88
194,Mr WARWICK SMITH,PAPERS,"I actually do not know whether it is untrue. As I quoted in question time, the shadow minister did say that Labor is",90
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,"The member for Jagajaga, would you please tell me and the House precisely what you found offensive? Ms Macklin-I find it offensive that he says that I said something which I did not say. I did not say that.",90
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,That does not necessarily come within the ambit of unparliamentary language. If you claim to have been misrepresented you will have the opportunity later to make a personal explanation.,90
197,Mr WARWICK SMITH,PAPERS,"To put it beyond doubt I can quote what the shadow minister said on radio. This is about dealing with the needs of the aged in this country. She has been on a lot of radio programs all over the country whipping up a scare campaign in a very irresponsible way. You did not see me go on radio and talk about suicides like you did, you totally irresponsible person. What you said was this: Labor is saying that it should be raised through the tax system. How you do it obviously is something that we will work out in the°'lead up to the election. They do not even know what they are going to do. They are going to put a new tax in place. It is not going to be fair to the rest of Australia. What we are putting in place is a long-term sustainable policy for the benefit of the aged in this country. For the opposition, the ones who have long supported the concept of death taxes, we wait with interest to see what form this new tax will take. How will it be imposed? Who will pay it? What else will they come up with? They are the sorts of things that we are certainly extremely concerned about. Finally, I might reiterate what I said in question time about the interest rate. I know the shadow minister made mention of this 8.68 per cent interest rate. The matter is part of the legislation. The rate was agreed between all the parties-not the Labor Party, as I understand it-that were part of the consultation process to be a rate that is described in the legislation as a 'maximum rate' that can be applied. It does nothing to detract from the opportunity for people to exercise choice as to how they might meet their bond application. As I have said already, bonds will vary from $6,000 through to, as you said the other day, $250,000. The point is that you can only draw down $2,500 and at the end of five years the maximum that can come out of your bond is $13,000. I have taken steps to require that all the bonds that are going to be charged by homes be made broadly publicly available so that the community can have a good look at what nursing homes are doing. I would be interested in doing that too. That was part of the consultation process and that was agreed to by the nursing home sector during the long and detailed consultation process. All in all we reject totally this MPI, this desperate attempt to continue this scare campaign that does nothing to contribute in any positive way to dealing with the needs and the demands of the aged in this country. We totally reject what the shadow minister has put forward. (Time expired)",90
198,Mr MCCLELLAND,PAPERS,"Barton) (3.59 p.m.)The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is fond of using the expression 'forelock tugging'. All I can say is that the Prime Minister must have two forelocks if he is silly enough to think that this policy is fair, defensible and equitable. It is far from that indeed. What is annoying sitting here is that, as members of the opposition, we are asking questions which are coming through to all of our electoral offices-and let us be honest, they are coming through to all of our electoral offices; questions are questions are questions-and it is the answers or the lack thereof that is causing fear. We are asking the questions and you are failing to clarify, and you are failing to dispel those fears because of the facts. The facts of the matter are as follows. Firstly, the government is charging a bond for which there is no ceiling, no maximum. That is the first fact. If the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) is right in saying that this funding is urgently needed for capital improvement and in saying that the draw down is $2,600 a year over five years, to a maximum of $13,000, why isn't that $13,000 the ceiling or the cap? The reason $13,000 is not the cap is that capping it would not suit those people who have assisted in drafting this legislation. One person who admits that he had a part in drafting this is Doug Moran. In my former life as a lawyer, I had cause to take legal action against one of the Moran companies. It is very interesting to go down to the Moran corporate premises just below Darlinghurst. You find there the premises of the Moran Health Group, the premises of the Moran aged care facilities, a shopfront real estate agency, the name of which is the Moran Real Estate Pty Ltd, and the premises of Moran Rental Properties Pty Ltd. The Moran companies are doing very well in this equation. Not only is a $250,000 bond being paid, of which they get the benefit of 8.68 per cent interest which they can apply to their business activities, but also they are getting the benefit of selling people's properties or, through the rental company, renting them out, if they are substantial enough properties to attract sufficient rent to pay the bond. Moran, who is a multimillionaire, is laughing. He has drafted this policy. He is a massive contributor to the Liberal Party. He was, effectively, Senator Woods's power base, because of the financial contributions he made to the Liberal Party, and they have opened the door for him and said, 'Here you are, this is your policy.' This is the Doug Moran policy. There is no reason for any more than a $13,000 bond, if it is the $13,000 that is being applied to the upgrading of the capital of nursing homes. As I have said, the reason that $13,000 is not set as the cap or the ceiling is that people in the industry could not profiteer with 8.68 per cent interest bearing deposits coming into their resources. On the other side of the equation, even if the bond is less than half what Doug Moran is charging, even if it is $100,000, what happens to the relatives of the person who has to be admitted to the nursing home? Effectively they have to pay a death duty of $56,000-or 56 per cent-on that $100,000. That is a death duty which does not apply across the board. It is a death duty which strikes the very frail, the very ill or the demented. That, quite simply, is wrong. It is only those who are lucky enough to die in their own homes who are going to escape that death duty. The second fact of the matter is that the government says that no-one is worse off as a result of the changed daily fee arrangements. On 20 October the Minister for Family Services said in respect of the abolition of rent assistance that the changes would not significantly affect disposable incomes. The minister should look at what is happening. One case, referred to in the Sydney Morning Herald on 2 October is that of a pensioner called Eileen Dwyer. She was previously getting $31.50 a week. Under the new regime she will get $26 a week. That is a reduction of $5.50 per week. As she said: Even ringing the family once a week is a luxury now. Instead of ringing them every week or every fortnight, I will have to think about doing it less because it will be impossible for me to cut down on medicines. She is an evil person, isn't she? She is a terrible human being. She is part of this scare campaign. What an atrocious thing that people are presenting the facts to the Australian people. As the Chief Executive Officer of Baptist Community Services said: These people have to pay for their incidentals such as soap, toiletries, clothes, phone bills, any social activities or even family presents out of this $26 a week. Five dollars, thank you very much, minister, on that level of income, is a very substantial whack. The third fact is that anyone who earns in excess of the pension-free amount of $50 is going to have to pay an extra 25 per cent in every dollar they earn above that pension free area. That, effectively, is a 25 per cent additional tax. It is a tax windfall of $80 million obtained from those people. Mr Lee-On top of their current tax.",90
199,Mr MCCLELLAND,PAPERS,"On top of the current tax they are already paying, as the shadow minister points out. Fortunately there may be some decency. It is being suggested that the minister acknowledges the immorality of that situation, and we trust he is going to change that. But the government says that the position is not harsh, because people have six months to pay the bond-if they do not die within that time. I suppose that is an escape for them, but we do not want that escape. The reality, which the minister does not talk about, is that they are accruing that interest of 8.68 per cent on their arrears all the time and that they will have to cough up with that after the six months period. The minister next says that people do not have to sell their homes; they can pay their bonds by instalments. It is not only a question, as we pointed out, of finding the $2,600 per year; they also have to find the money to pay the $100,000 bond or, in the case of the Doug Moran group of companies, the $250,000 bond. But, in the case of a bond of $100,000, the instalments equate to about $400 per week. The minister would acknowledge, I trust, that you would have to have a very substantial property to be able to raise that amount of money through rental. Firstly, you would pay tax on that, and then any .income would affect your pension status, so it is very likely that that pension would completely fall away if the person was able to obtain that sort of income. The reality is that money talks. The government is not about improving health care at all; it is about pursuing this philosophically driven, user-pays concept. It is only the frail, the ill and the demented-the users-who will have to pay. There is no question that money talks. If you are poor, you are going to be able to obtain only substandard service. Those who are very wealthy and who have the spare cash will no doubt be able to buy $250,000 accommodation at Rose Bay which will be, needless to say, quite pleasant. But the vast bulk of ordinary Australians who have met with misfortune are going to come butt-up against this government's policy. If they are struck by misfortune, this government will latch on to them like parasites. That is entirely wrong and the government is going to pay dearly at the next election. If you will not listen to us in opposition, sit down and listen honestly to the reports that are coming in from your own backbenchers, and do something about it. (Time expired)",92
200,Mr TUCKEY,PAPERS,"We have heard a bit about literacy and numeracy in this place recently, and of course we had a wonderful piece of numeracy presented during question time. We were told that if someone takes one of the three options for establishing their bond arrangements-that of retaining their family home and having any charges that accumulate during their occupancy of a nursing home charged against their estate, which of course went on for decades under the previous Labor government in terms of rent rebates and was never referred to as a death duty-they will, in the extreme example of $100,000 over the absolute maximum of five years, be up for $56,000. But apparently for that whole five years the house they have chosen to retain remains vacant. They do not rent it out. They leave it there and let it fall to pieces. But if they rent it out for $200 a week they get $50,000 back. That leaves them losing $6,000, which is less than $13,000. As the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) just said, there will be Mr Lee-Have you heard of tax?",92
201,Mr TUCKEY,PAPERS,"Oh, yes, I know all about that. But why didn't you bring that fact to the notice of the parliament? Because you wanted to scare another group of very vulnerable people. Of course there are other costs. Wasn't it interesting that the member for Barton talked about the 85 per cent who are lucky enough to die in their own home? What do you think it costs them to live in their own home? Do you think they don't pay rates? Do you think they don't pay corporate body charges? Do you think they don't pay all those things while they are in their own family home? Do you think it is not $2,600 a year? Mr Andrew-Get the old folks cleaning the gutters now.",93
202,Mr TUCKEY,PAPERS,"Yes. Who repairs and maintains the house? They are worse off. The 85 per cent who, as the member for Barton says, are lucky enough to die in their own home are financially worse off than the pensioners you are crying crocodile tears about in the hope of getting re-elected. And you talk about fairness. Clearly, fairness goes to the side of those who do not go into a nursing home. They are the ones who are worse off. You might be up here talking about them. And you carryon, 'It's their family home!' A typical Australian family sells their house every seven years. Which was the family one? You talk about being kind, fair and reasonable. I do not follow New South Wales politics closely, but I remember a picture of an old person in their old house that just happens to have harbour views. And Bob Carr has just revalued it at $2 million or $3 million and slapped property taxes on it. That is fair, you say. They are going to die in that house, but you say that is fair. Why? Because Labor did it. I do not know what it is costing those people to be lucky to die in their own house. But isn't it amazing? Yesterday, did we hear one thing about the battlers? No, the only case that you wanted to run was for the chardonnay set. Rose Bay! Why don't you put another one in for Toorak, or Peppermint Grove in my state? I know why you did it. You wanted to point out that a $250,000 bond has got absolutely no relevance whatsoever out in the western suburbs of Sydney, but you wanted to scare those people out there. What about the other people who live in the western suburbs? I rang up today, to make sure. They are the ones who are paying a mortgage, paying the rates and taxes, trying to educate three kids and, if they are earning somewhere between $400 and $500 a week, they are already paying $80 a week in income tax out of that amount of money. And what is your solution? When you talk about tax I just say to myself, 'Why would you believe them ?' You have never ever kept a promise on tax in your life, but this one you might keep. What are you going to do? Are you going to add to the 47 per cent, the maximum marginal tax rate at the moment? I can tell you that, if you do, you will not get very much money anyway. I know what you will do: you will go and add to the middle level rates and you will add to that $80 out of $450, and that bloke might just decide to give up and go on the dole because you have left him with so little. But what is fair for them? The fundamental fact of this matter is that the nursing home industry is in diabolical trouble in terms of its capitalisation, its maintenance and its development. Someone has to find some money; you say it is the government, we say it is those amongst the aged community that have the ability to pay. Let us talk about the options. You can put up income tax. We have the great triumvirate for death duties: the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), who are both on the record, and the third one, who does not have a seat yet, is ex-Senator Kernot. She is now, according to her own claims in the media, your tax policy adviser. That is why you are going to pay her for the next 12 months-so she can write policy for you. Have you ever read any of her wacky tax policies? Death duties is at the head of the list, and there are some other pretty tough ones too. Which tax are you going to raise? Are you going to raise company tax and further deteriorate the ability of our companies to employ people? Or are you going to get back to the old faithful of borrowing some money and leaving it to the kids of Australia. What effect does that have on our capacity to help. the elderly? I brought it here. With regard to budget outlays, by function, it says $8,900 million. We are paying $9,321 million of interest this year. That is three times what we spend on aged persons. If you take it in portions, like what Fraser left behind$20,000 million-and what you added to it, you could double or even treble, taking what we are spending now, the amount of money being spent on aged persons if you had not left them with that interest bill. It is your interest bill. Mr Brough-Your debt.",93
203,Mr TUCKEY,PAPERS,"Yes. And you tell us what we should do. The fundamentals of fairness are: who should pay? I got so annoyed when I heard the platitudes of people on the other side there. Let me get a couple of these facts on the record. Firstly, there is an entry process this matter which puts total emphasis on needs, not means. Secondly, 27 per cent of nursing home places must be reserved for people whose assets are less than $22,500. They will pay no bond. Thirdly, there is no requirement that anyone pays a bond because they have the various choices we have mentioned. Clearly, those people who take the opportunity to take it out of their estate have got an estate and they make that decision because they know it will earn them good money. Yes, they will pay taxes and they may lose their pension-and they may be the bloke in Sydney who got $14 million for his house the other day. I think he will struggle along without the pension. You are standing up here crying crocodile tears for people like that. Where is your constituency? They are bluecollar battlers. Why are you not standing up to defend them rather than say you are going to tax them? What are you going to do? Are you going to do another l-a-w job on them? Are you going to put another 6c a litre on their petrol or two per cent on the wholesale sales tax for everything they buy? You tell us they are the ones who consume the greatest percentage of their income. They are the questions you should be asking. You should not be putting your political advantage ahead of the people who have put their faith in you for years. They are not people with substantial assets in nursing homes; they are working class people trying to raise their kids and that is the most important thing. Get to it, but remember your arithmetic when you stand up in this place next time and give us one half of the argument. (Time expired)",94

NA BILL (No.5) 1997 [No.2] First Reading Bill presented by Mr Truss, and read a first time. Second Reading",94
206,Mr TRUSS,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Wide Bay-Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs) (4.20 p.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the first of two bills whose purpose is to introduce a new method of calculating the safety net surcharge component of the customs and excise duty on certain tobacco products. . On 5 August 1997, the High Court held that the New South Wales tobacco business franchise fees were invalid. This decision also cast considerable doubt upon the constitutional validity of other state and territory business franchise fees on tobacco, alcohol and some petroleum products. In order to protect state and territory revenues following this decision, the Commonwealth agreed to a safety net, part of which involved increases in customs and excise duties on certain tobacco products of $167 per kilogram. At the time these increases were implemented, the Commonwealth government was aware of the effect that changing from a value based franchise fee system to a weight based system would have on the tobacco industry. Following the High Court decision, the states and territories held discussions with the industry and have agreed to a revised level of taxation and new arrangements for the levying of the surcharge. These arrangements will shift from a solely weighted based surcharge to one based on both weight and value. They will ensure that the effect of the safety net on the manufacturers of the different tobacco products is as close as possible to effect of the business franchise fees which applied prior to the High Court decision. All of the states and territories have requested the Commonwealth to implement these new arrangements. This bill will introduce the new arrangements in relation to customs duty on tobacco products. Identical changes to the method of calculating excise duty on tobacco products are proposed in the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.5) 1997. All of the revenues collected under this Amendment Act and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.5) 1997 will continue to be returned to the states and territories under the provisions of the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994. The states and territories have also asked that the Commonwealth adjust the shares for tobacco products being returned to the states and territories under that act and these amendments are being made by the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. NA (No.5) 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Truss, and read a first time. Second Reading",94

208,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,"-On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works"" I present the 11th report of the committee for 1997 entitled Extension of the National Film and Sound Archive, Acton, ACT. Ordered that the report be printed.",95
209,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report which I have tabled concerns the proposed extension of the National Film and Sound Archive, Acton, ACT. The archive is housed in a historic building, formerly the Australian Institute of Anatomy. In passing, I should mention that this building was the subject of an inquiry by a previous Public Works Committee, in 1929. It cost just over £96,000. The proposal is substantially similar to one examined by the committee in December 1995. Although a public hearing was held into the proposal, the committee was unable to report on the reference due to the calling of the election. The proposal was re-referred to the committee in August and, because of the substantial body of evidence taken by the previous committee, it was not considered necessary to conduct further hearings. The scope of the proposal examined by the committee involved the construction of: a new two-storey building to house the archi ve' s administrative and technical functions, and refurbishment of the existing headquarters-including public galleries-to house the public functions of the National Film and Sound Archive; refurbishment of the existing residence building to house corporate affairs staff; demolition or removal for sale of the existing demountable buildings, metal-clad storage structures and nitrate vault-; redevelopment of the character of the site and buildings within a landscape setting; and retention of the existing permanent car park with minor modifications. Additional on-site parking will be provided for approximately 25 cars and five tourist coaches. When referred to the committee, the estimated outturn cost of the proposal was $14.85 million. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed. The National Film and Sound Archive was established in 1984 and has as its charter the development, preservation and promotion of the national collection of recorded moving images and sound materials. The archive's collection consists of more than one million items including discs, audio and video tapes, films, phonograph cylinders, piano rolls and artefacts, and a further million items of documentation such as photographs, scripts, publicity items and newspaper clippings. After inspecting the buildings housing the archive at Acton, the committee found that the main historic headquarters building is suitable for the public functions of the archive but is inadequate for its administrative and specialist technical functions. Existing deficiencies are: the basement specialist technical facilities are inefficient and do not satisfy current occupational health and safety standards, including in particular fire safety, the Building Code of Australia and Australian standards relating to current use; the use of gallery space for office and specialist technical accommodation is at odds with the building's heritage significance and limits the space available for public exhibitions; and the construction of demountable buildings has substantially compromised the site's heritage significance and is not consistent with the intentions of the national capital plan. After inspecting the specialist technical facilities in the basement and registration and accession areas housed in demountable buildings, the committee came away with a strong perception that the archive is indeed served by a dedicated staff. The staff have displayed stoic forbearance in very difficult working conditions. It was obvious that the major concern of staff has been to keep the facilities operating despite potential safety risks. Anybody who has had anything to do with nitrate film would know that it is extremely volatile and should only be handled in the safest places. The committee concluded that the archive's administrative and technical accommodation is of very low quality, functionally unsuitable and inefficient and does not comply with current fire safety and occupational health and safety standards. After examining a range of options which would overcome these problems, the committee concluded that the construction of a new administrative and technical support building contiguous with the existing headquarters building at Acton would be the least expensive and more practical solution. The major element of the proposal examined by the committee will involve the construction of a new two-storey building of 4,230 square metres along the north-west of the existing headquarters building to house the archive's administrative and technical functions. The site occupied by the archive's buildings is within designated areas of the national capital plan. As well, the site and the headquarters building are listed on the Register the National Estate. For these reasons, planning and design of the extensions required a sensitive approach. The extension has been designed to respect, but not to mimic, the existing building. The committee concluded that the heritage importance of the site and the existing headquarters building are reflected in planning principles adopted for the design. The materials and finishes to be used will complement the existing headquarters building. In terms of the scope of the proposal, the committee concluded that the extent of the proposed new building will meet the requirements of the National Film and Sound Archive for at least the next 10 years. It will improve efficiency, enable display areas to be increased and will attract more visitors. I commend the report to the House. NA AMENDMENT (RESTART AND EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",96
210,Mr WAKELIN,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"I take pleasure in resuming the debate on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill 1997. Before I was interrupted, I was making the point that this legislation recognises the plight of the long-suffering agricultural sector. I was reminding the House, and I hope those in the nation who can recall, of the issues of the late 1980s with 18 to 20 per cent interest rates and the assets test for pensioners, and how people became locked into pretty unfortunate circumstances in transferring the farm from generation to generation. The income equalisation deposits which had been introduced by the Fraser government had effectively been abolished by the Labor government, as had the drought support, which I guess had become almost a part of the institution of agriculture in recognising that there were difficulties that could arise from time to time where it was beyond the reasonable expectation of farmers to manage by themselves. To have this measure brought before the parliaof ment gives me particular pleasure. I must acknowledge the contribution of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and his untiring efforts in the interests of the people of agriculture throughout Australia. What does the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 1997 do? Put simply, the bill establishes the farm family restart scheme and the exceptional circumstances relief payment. It endeavours to focus on those under greatest pressure in the agriculture sector and allows that light on the hill, if you like, which can allow them to move on from agriculture where the circumstances have become just too difficult. It is not compUlsory. It is done in a particular way which I think is very humane and compassionate, but it does recognise that there has been a very large backlog of many families in agriculture in intergenerational transfer and in their very economic survival. That comes on top of a very commendable reform process by the new government over the last 18 months. This government has been in power for just on 18 months and its achievements particularly in the agricultural sector, but also I think right across the nation, are quite remarkable. We are looking at somewhere near a $2 billion surplus after a $10 billion deficit. That now is seen to be of not much account; it is yesterday's news. It is something that the government just did, which really did not take very much effort-after all, it really was not that bad anyway. Mr Andrew-Short memories.",97
211,Mr W AKELIN,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Very short memories, as the member for Wakefield reminds me. To achieve that sort of turnaround takes a strong effort day by day and hour by hour by all members, particularly the senior executivethe Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the cabinetsupported by a very united coalition team. It is with great pleasure and pride that I serve in this government. The effect of managing the $10 billion deficit has been five interest rate cuts in a row. They currently are worth about $500 million in savings to Australian farmers. It is quite remarkable that, just as a result of that, the average farm income has increased by $6,000 per farm. In fact, each one per cent cut in interest rates can boost net farm income by about $2,400. I have to constantly remind the House that, contrary to the perception of years gone by that there is great individual wealth in agriculture, we now see a situation where the regional sectors of Australia, particularly the farm sector, are very much at the lower income spectrum as far as average incomes go across Australia. So it is with pleasure and heartfelt gratitude that I see the efforts of the government coming into practical effect for the purposes of people on the land. The people on the land do not ask for handouts. They ask for an opportunity to contribute. They ask that they be recognised for their historical place in laying the foundations of our nation. They also ask, I believe, that the export income that is still being produced be a significant contributor to the overall well-being of our standard of living. The other very good initiative that the government has embarked upon is the Natural Heritage Trust grant, and I was very pleased to announce to the electorate of Grey last week a grant of $1 million. As we know, the $1.2 billion contribution from the one-third sale of Telstra is for the restoration and improvement of the environment. There are the improvements in quarantine laws, industrial relations reform, reforms to the Australian Wheat Board, the supermarket to Asia strategy and the improvements in respect of rural doctors. We now are particularly looking at the departments of rural health and at the health issues of the rural sector. There is also the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund, which I must say my electorate has taken to with great enthusiasm. They see some very positive outcomes in the telecommunications area and would like to access that fund. Of course, there is also capital gains tax reform. Coming back to the bill, the advancing agriculture package draws together various rural policies into a coordinated and integrated plan for agriculture based on wide industry consultation and support. It is pleasing to see the rural media endorsing the package with some enthusiasm after many years of neglect. It is not surprising that many people in regional areas feel that they are very often the forgotten people. I will mention some components of the bill. The farm family restart scheme, which has $120.4 million and is to start on 1 December 1997, provides a maximum of one year of incom,e support, which is available without the need to put the farm on the market, and no activity test will apply. There is an obligation to obtain financial advice, and there will be government support to do that. That advice will seek to determine the future viability of the farm and alternative employment options. As sad as that situation appears at the time, I know the great relief that people feel when facing up to that hard option, making the decision and moving on. It is a great release and relief to many once they have made those decisions. I know that no-one does it easily. I come from a community where it is always with a heavy heart that you see someone leave the land. But, when that decision comes, it is always inspirational to see the community gathered around in support of that person, helping them through a very difficult time. Re-establishment grants, which have been there before but this extends it and makes it a stronger component of the farm family restart scheme, of up to $45,000 will be available to those who choose to leave farming in the first two years of the scheme and payable on the farm sale. The income support years will be deducted from the grant. The grant will be subject to an assets test, where it will be phased down by $2 in every $3 above $90,000. The farm household support scheme is $5.1 million component. The grant measure was chosen in preference to a loan because the abysmal failure of the previous program. That scheme was terminated last year, and the $5 million owed by low income farmers will be written off. The small amount repaid will be reimbursed. The drought relief payment extension, involving $40.5 million, provides a safety net for farmers losing the drought relief payment recovery period. It was extended to 10 Septhe tember and will now be extended to 30 November to allow for the start of the farm family restart scheme. The new exceptional circumstances relief payment will be estabgoing lished for those in financial hardship as result of exceptional circumstances, including drought. Duration will be determined on case by case basis. I warmly applaud this bill. It will advance Australia. agriculture, as well as Australia. As I said in my earlier comments, it comes in stark contrast to the disappointing performance of my political opponents, who never came to terms with the reality of working the soil and the variation that is always present in agriculture. I have never been so disappointed than when the previous government abolished the income equalisation deposit scheme. It epitomised what was one of the great positives of this country-people endeavouring to make generation. progress by themselves. Mr Andrew-They are self-reliant.",98
212,Mr WAKELIN,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Exactly. That is the selfand longer term. reliant attitude of agriculture. The income equalisation deposit scheme of the Fraser government epitomised that great variation agriculture where you can get a variation 10. It is very difficult to explain to a salary earner the great variation. When the good years come, the tax man cometh as well which very much weakened the capacity tcater for the more difficult years that you always knew were there. When that income equalisation deposit scheme was abolished, I never quite forgave the government of the day. It recognised that absolute determination by so many in agriculture and so many within Australia who a w-shed not to be on government support, who WIshed to remain self-reliant and pay their of own way. If you can give people a mechanism whereby they can do that, it is a great step forward for the nation at large. I record in the chamber today with great feeling that it was a great disappointment to me to see the previous government do that. It was quite ironic to see the subsequent ministers who came and went. It was eventually Sen-tor Collins who, in the latter part of Keatmg government, reinstated the income equalisation deposits almost to what they were in the Fraser years. It took only 10 or 15 years to complete the full circle. Now we are on and reforming and improving that a program again by working with the banks and making it very much more an integral part of a the farm management program. Whilst it is not directly related to this bill, it is part of the overall package, Agriculture-Advancing In summing up, it is with great pride that I stand here, and, in all humility, I think this bill is a recognition of the contribution of agriculture and of those who stay in agriculture. The more I listen to the comments about the up-and-coming generation in agriculture, the more encouraged I am because we have some e-tremely talented and capable managers commg through, supported by the previous This legislation will allow agriculture to look forward to its future in the next century with great confidence and contribute to the well-being of all of us over the medium . Mr ANDREW (Wakefield) (4.49 p.m-)-I am pleased to have an opportunity to particiin pate in this debate on the Farm Household of Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional CPI Circumstances) Bill 1997and to follow the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), an electoral neighbour of mine in boundary terms. While I am on my feet, I recognise that there is probably no-one in this House more familiar - ith the role and importance of this legislatIon than the member for Grey. There will be those in the gallery and many in the House who will not be aware of the fact that the member for Grey's electorate takes up 92 per cent of the surface area of the state of South Australia. It includes all of the vast Eyre Peninsula, stretching, as his electorate does, from the fertile valley of Clare across the Eyre Peninsula to Western Australia and north to the Northern Territory border. It is scarcely surprising then that he should have a certain passion for this debate, particularly as much of his Eyre Peninsula area includes some of the marginal grain farming areas of South Australia. As he has indicated, he has witnessed people leaving the farm with little more than that in which they stand up. This government, recognising that farming families frequently find themse!""es in difficulty through no fault of their own and frequently find themselves being chased by the banker simply because unpredictable seasonal conditions have moved against them, has endeavoured to find a way to allow farming families to stop, reassess their farming situation and, if necessary, leave the land with a level of dignity that was not possible before. I join the member for Grey and the recently appointed Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), the member for Wide Bay, and the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), all of whom are familiar with farming in Australia, to celebrate what has been done by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), in this legislation. There is sadly a popular view abroad in the community that Australia is teetering on the brink of economic collapse, as if all was wrong with the nation and the parliament was to blame, not the Liberal Party, the National Party or the Labor Party. The reality is quite different. The perception of economic disaster hangs so gloomily over this chamber largely because of the sort of nonsense that has been advanced by people such as the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), suggesting that the major thrust of the government and of the opposition when it was in government has been in the wrong direction and has been to the disadvantage of Australian farmers and Australian farming families. It has been tough on the land. It has been tough on the land for reasons of international trade. It has been tough on the land because in parts of Australia, particularly in Queensland, there have been major environmental and climatic situations which have been quite unpredictable. What needs to be recognised is that in a portion of Australia's manufacturing area-that is not in primary industry or mining, but in our manufacturing basethings have been heading in the right direction. Australians seem to believe that everything that is happening in this country right now is simply the result of imports coming in and of exports being thwarted, but the facts are that Australia's export performance is on the mend. The fastest growing area of Australian exports has astonishingly not been the agricultural goods directly referred to in this legislation but manufactured goods. I ask you: how many Australians, if you stop them in Collins Street, could tell you that among the dramatic improvements that have occurred in the Australian economy over the last 10 years-I am not being political, let me hasten to add-has been the level of export manufactured goods leaving our shores, to the point at which Australian manufacturing exports now rival both primary industry and mining in their volume? Australian manufactured exports now sit as I understand it at approximately $30 billion of all that we export. The figure for both primary industry and mining is a comparable one. So not all that has been done by this parliament has been in error, in spite of the popular opinion outside this place. Our performance in manufacturing has been dramatically different. The area that has been most frustrating for the parliament has been the area of primary industry because the reforms that occurred in international trade that allowed us to so effectively improve our manufacturing sales overseas were not running hand in glove with similar reforms in agricultural trade. It has been difficult for farmers under the terms of trade that existed to penetrate the grain markets that they wanted and to succeed in the wool markets that they would have sought. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has joined us. In an electorate like his he will be even more familiar with the difficulties that many farming families have faced. As a result of these difficulties and as a result of the terms of trade largely being dictated by corrupted trading arrangements overseas in agricultural product, many Australian farmers and many Australian farming families have found it difficult to remain in farming production. It is not that they have been poor farmers. In some cases they have been farmers on tracts of land that have proven progressively to be too small to be viable. In many cases they have found themselves with farming equipment that has been ageing. For those reasons they have not been able to be as efficient as they would wish and they have found themselves caught in a vicious cycle because they were unable to replace the farm equipment since the production was too low to service the debt that would be incurred with new farm equipment being purchased. I pick up the comments of the. member for Grey. Briefly, but in a sustained way over the last 18 months, it has been possible for farmers to be both more productive and more profitable. This is partially because the government's economic management has been such that interest rates have been down and, as the member for Grey has indicated, up to $6,000 per farm has been saved as a result of sustained lower interest rates kept in place by this government. In fact it takes a fall of only one per cent in interest rates to produce a saving of $2,400 per annum for a farm. So the government has taken action by setting the economic parameters where they ought to be. But that is not the only action we have taken. The government can also proudly claim to have built on the trade reforms that the former government had initiated to the advantage of Australian farming families. As I indicated in my opening remarks, manufacturing exports had improved because of the trade reforms that had been initiated. Now we are in a situation where Australian agricultural exports are improving as well. While we are here in this chamber, our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is on his way to, or has arrived at, CHOGM, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, where in fact the focus of the meeting will be on trade liberalisation, principally in agriculture, and where the Prime Minister will be putting the case for Australian farmers to ensure that the same sort of trade liberalisation that has advantaged manufactured goods can be used to advantage our farmers as well. Trade liberalisation, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you understand from your period in government, has a great deal to do with market access. Australian farmers have been denied access to those markets in which they could have most effectively sold their goods because the markets were being filled by agricultural product produced in countries that subsidised their farmers, making it impossible for us to compete. There have been those who have suggested that Australia ought to subsidise its farmers as well. But the grim economic reality is that Australia with some 12 million taxpayers cannot hope to match the subsidy base of Europe or the United States of America with over 200 million taxpayers. Here we have a bill before the House which allows those farmers who find it difficult to compete in international terms to leave the land with dignity. I am not here suggesting that bigger is better. I am not here suggesting that, in some strange way, farmers should simply work from larger farming bases in order to be effective and efficient farmers. In fact, in my own area of Wakefield, among the irrigation areas there are those in intensive crops who have moved out of one form of farming into another, who have moved for example from horticulture into floriculture and who have found that small areas can in fact be very viable if they select the crop that is most appropriate to the area. But for the Mallee farmers represented by the member for Grey and for the farmers who are part of the electorate of O'Connor, the reality is that, unless they are on a large enough area to be economical, it is hard to find a way out of the continuing spiral downwards that catches them in terms of their economic management because, as I said earlier, they find themselves unable to produce enough to replace the machinery that is needed to be efficient in Australian farming. They are, as we all know, the classic case of people who are asset rich but cash poor because they have an asset that is valuable but not generating sufficient income for them to maintain a viable farming base. They are also the people who, in spite of their financial difficulties, are least likely to go broke. They will ultimately use up all of their capacity to borrow money from the bank. They will ultimately find themselves in a situation in which the bank is no longer prepared to use the farm as part of the collateral against which the banker lends them money. But it takes time. If they are in a comer store and are not generating income, they find themselves rapidly pushed out of business by costs, rates and taxes. But many farmers on small farms simply contract. They refuse to replace the truck; they refuse to replace the header or the tractor. They choose to do all sorts of extraordinary things like keeping a cow to minimise the cost of buying milk and starting a farm garden. Slowly they find that their asset base contracts, but their capacity to generate money also contracts. Finally, they are forced into a position of sale. The government is proposing that farmers in that situation should be able to access the farm family restart scheme through this legislation. Under the farm family restart scheme, it should be possible for them to qualify for the newstart allowance and for the partner allowance and to get that form of income support for at least 12 months while they determine what the future of the family farm ought to be. That is a very useful step because it means that they are not forced off the land, but in that 12-month period they have an obligation to seek advice from a professional financial adviser on the future viability of the land. In counselling with somebody else, they can make a decision about what will suit them best. The government proposes that they should be able to access a maximum under this legislation of $45,000 of re-establishment grant so that they can leave the land with some sort of dignity. If their assets have run down to the point at which they sell the farm for a cleared price of $90,000 or less, it should be possible to top up that money with $45,000 and re-establish themselves somewhere else without feeling that they have in any sense been a failure. Frankly, they have not. What has caught them is circumstantial arrangements rather than any failure on their part to run an efficient and effective business. The truth is that this bill gives Australian farming families the opportunity to make a decision to stay on the land, to enter into a partnership with a neighbour, to enter into a share farming agreement, to enter into a leasing agreement, or, if they wish to leave but not be financially disadvantaged by so doing, to decide to leave before they are at the point at which all of their assets have been exhausted. As the member for Grey said, the bill that we are currently considering deals with the question of exceptional circumstances and drought relief and the way in which we go about offering farmers support where some change in the weather conditions, some prolonged period of drought or some exceptional circumstance has forced them into a situation in which they would otherwise be viable. The bill offers more generous exceptional circumstances grants to allow them to make a decision on what their future will be. The exceptional circumstance grants apply where the normal farm risk management-that is, the normal risks that you would expect if you were farming an area that is marginalhas been exceeded and where prolonged drought-a drought such as would not be a part of the normal cyclical drought of Australian farming-triggers the exceptional circumstances provisions in this bill. Let me conclude where I began. There is not really a reason for a great deal of despondency about either the nation or its farming viability. Because this nation has farmers and primary producers that have not been subsidised, that have not been subject to all sorts of insulation from the reality of world markets, we find ourselves producing agricultural product that can be sold overseas· into any non-corrupted market at a profit. That is something every Australian primary producer should be proud of. The changed trading arrangements have meant that our dairy industry, our grain industry and our viticultural industries have been enjoying relatively buoyant times. The buoyancy of the grain industry is largely conditioned by the seasonal arrangements in which it finds itself. It is fair to say that some horticultural industries, the wool industry and, until about six weeks ago, the beef industry have been having an exceedingly difficult time because of changed marketing arrangements. Nonetheless, the access that we as primary producers in this nation now enjoy to markets that were once closed to us is a very promising sign. As the member for Wakefield, I will be hosting a Supermarket to Asia conference in my electorate in two days time, on Friday, to allow some of my farmers and their processors to look at ways in which they can maximise the inroads they can make with primary products into the Asian market. The Supermarket to Asia Council, as the House is well aware, has been a creature of this government. It is chaired by the Prime Minister and includes a number of front bench members. The purpose of the Supermarket to Asia Council is to ensure that no stone is left unturned in the effort to maximise our penetration of the promising Asian market. As someone who represents South Australia's key viticultural area, I am very conscious of what has been done to improve the access of primary products into overseas markets, particularly wine, as a result of the present trading arrangements under which we operate. We confidently believe those trading arrangements will be further liberalised to the advantage of every Australian primary producer. Our role as a parliament is to ensure that those primary producers who do not want to move into the new era of agriculture that is emerging can leave the agricultural industries with dignity. This bill allows them to just that.",99
213,Mr TUCKEY,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"O'Connor) (5.07 p.m.)The Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill 1997 is part of a very substantial package announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) some time ago and it brings together a very appropriate and sensible package that will do much to guarantee the future of. Australia's agricultural sector, which is of course still one of the major contributors to our GDP and our export effort. I am extremely proud that I stand here today as the representative of one electorate that produces somewhere between 60 and 70 per cent of Australia's total wheat exports each year. That is something that any member of parliament could be proud of. It has been a long time since Australia had any bad farmers. Unfortunately the events of the last 20 or 30 years have wiped out bad farmers. You have had to have been an extremely good farmer to survive some of the natural and unnatural events, which would be presented by 20 per cent interest rates, the recession you had to have and those sorts of things. To survive all that and still be on the land, you are now a good farmer. Those people still face substantial difficulties,· of which this bill sets out to address one aspect, and that is with the farm family restart scheme. The farm family restart scheme would act as a catalyst to assist farmers in assessing their long-term future on the farm, providing professional advice to assist in this process. That is when a farm has got into difficulties. It might be in difficulties, as the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has just pointed out, purely and simply because as time has gone by it has got too small. As I drive around my electorate, I drive through town after town at roughly 50-kilometre spacings. They were constructed in that fashion because that was as far as you could go and back in a day with a horse and cart. Today of course, with good roads and high-speed vehicles, many of those towns are experiencing difficulty. Similarly, the early subdivisions were made do on the basis of what a farming family could handle with a team of horses. Clearly today much larger properties are required and sometimes their capital value is beyond the resources of the individual that seeks to expand their property. They are not bad farmers, but other circumstances are affecting their viability. This gives them that breathing space. Some are going to survive through that breathing space because they might be simply suffering from other factors and that bit of cash to keep their family going as provided through the newstart arrangements is sufficient to get them back on the road. In making a few notes for this particular address, I thought, 'What are the enemies of farmers today?' Naturally it has always been the weather. Strangely enough, that is not as bad a thing for many wheat growers, for instance, as it used to be. A farmer in the old days used to get an inch of rain, got out the team of horses and planted literally a few acres a day. Gradually the soil dried out and they had to stop until they got another shower of rain. People in my electorate-and one whom I can mention who had a property just outside my electorate, the late Senator John Panizza-have machinery that will plant one acre a minute. Panizza planted about 25,000 acres of wheat a year. The reality is that in using that, and using it 24 hours a day, it is amazing the extent to which a farming business can put a crop in with one shower of rain, be it the one that arrives somewhat late. That is the good side. That is what has happened. The weather is not the problem it used to be. It is still a problem if it does not rain at all, but you can do much better. Then I put down 'pestilence'. I did the farming industry a great favour this year; sold my farm. I am sure that I have always brought bad luck to them. Nevertheless, during my period of farm ownership I sufit. fered the second thing, which I call pestiAussie lence. That comes in all sorts of ways. A typical grain growing operation is probably spending $30,000 or $40,000 a year just addressing the red earth mite and the various grubs and things that one knows are going be there every year. I also experienced of locusts. I have also experienced a fullyfledged cyclone. If you want a nice frightening experience, just stand amongst these economists things that are bashing you in the face every second as they fly and just watch trees disapprice pear in front of your eyes as the locusts every leaf off them. They do not leave you much crop. You cannot spray them down, and you can get them as little fellas. That is the sort of thing that makes it very difficult for good farmer. Then there are things called international prices. The Australian agricultural industry is simply a price taker. But those prices are at both ends of the equation. It seems a great peculiarity that, as grain prices go down, many of our imported products-such as nitrogen based fertilisers and many of the herbicides and insecticides we import from other countries and the machinery that they manufacture that we invented-do not come down in price. But we often see fluctuations in prices. Then there are the two very interesting ones that I put together, and they are interest rates and currency movements. I have to say, as a representative of a rural electorate, I was pleased to hear today that the Australian dollar fell through the 73c barrier. I have always believed that at our stage of international indebtedness it is only worth about 70c anyway. I am pleased to think that the policies of this government economically have seen only a very gradual decline, not the sorts of effects that we are experiencing to our north in some Asian countries. The reality and the link is that, as interest rates decline, your currency declines-not because you are necessarily running a bad ship, but because those people who deal in I . bonds and are looking for the best possible margin are simply prepared to pay less for our money if we are paying them less interest for That is the reason. When we talk about the dollar, it is not trading in bundles of hundreds; it is trading in debt instruments. When they attract less interest, the international buyers are paying a lower price. That is how our dollar comes down. But the return to to people at home, our manufacturers and our a year agriculturalists, is improved. There is another interesting thing. The will tell you that, as your currency falls, inflation is absolutely certain and the of a lot of imported items will increase. eat Strangely enough, they frequently do not. I now argue that there is no such thing as an internationally stable price for a commodity; it is what a particular local market will bear. a With all the jostling that goes on these days, the loss is often taken by the exporter to our country. So a sensibly lower currency is most important. All of those things are what a good farmer struggles with, and they are all totally outside his or her control. When they come together they create great problems that require the sort of treatment we are proposing today-a short-term, one-year proposal which will give them some breathing space but which will ensure that their lifestyle is not less than that of anybody else who is unemployed. I am also pleased because as a package it is not promised forever. The part of this package that I am most proud of, and it links in with the other problem, is our new approach to IEDs, or income equalisation deposits. I sincerely hope that future governments of any political colour do not tinker with it. We have seen it in, we have seen it out. We stood here one day when it was thrown out because of a tax scam that had arisen. We did not fix the tax scam. We threw the baby out with the bath water. We then saw wool prices go through the roof, prices that were created only by borrowing money. We had farmers borrowing money through their wool corporation to buy their own wool and paying tax on the profits. We have seen the outcome of all that. Those arrangements have not been helpful. The IED was not there when those people earned all that money. They paid huge taxation and after that they had nothing because the country went into drought, the scheme collapsed, prices collapsed and they were in severe trouble. It has often been said that the best protection against all those things I have just mentioned, and more particularly drought and bad weather, is a haystack of money. The problem that has confronted Australia's farmers has been that whilst the income equalisation deposit, a means of depositing money that was not taxed-you paid tax on it, if you were taxable, when you used it in hard times-was on and off, most farmers never got enough surplus money in cash to make use of it. They had to lodge the money in a separate place and they usually found themselves with a potential surplus after two or three bad years when they had borrowed a lot of money. The bank, having seen their return to viability, wanted it back. But for every dollar they paid back to the bank they could be up for one or two dollars in taxation, depending on whether they had a responsibility to pay any provisional tax or whatever. Too frequently the tax man got there first. Too frequently there was too little money. Under the new proposals, where you can that create your IED with your own financial institution, it is my view that you can go along to them and say: 'I have had two bad years. I owe you $100,000. I am going to have a $50,000 disposable surplus in this first good year. I want to put that down as an IED with your bank and offset it against the $100,000 I owe you.' The bank will accept that because they will make a profit on the margin into the bargain. They are satisfied that they have cash guaranteeing cash. But the farmer has reduced his net liability to the bank by 50 per cent because he has not paid any tax on the money. If we go further into that it gets complex but it is an opportunity to start getting yourself back on your feet. It is a very good proposal and it means that over time the very scheme we are proposing today will not be needed. I am the first to say to my farmers that, if we have a proper transition period, all of the hand-out propositions-notwithstanding all the issues I have mentioned that are outside their control-should cease. If you are given reasonable time to get back on your feet and you access the IED component you should not have to be helped out in bad times. To their credit, they all agree with me. They say: 'Yes, that is fair enough.' I want to take the last seven minutes, having mentioned this scheme and said that it is a good scheme and that I support it wholeheartedly as part of the package, to talk a little more about the tax system. The income tax system has always hit farmers very hard because they have a cyclical income arrangement and in very good years their gross revenues are huge. If you are putting in 25,000 acres of wheat a week in country that averages five bags, but one year you get 10 or 12-and that is the way the average works; in another year you get one or two-you have a huge amount of money. But if the tax man just comes and rips it off you, what do you do in the year you get one or two? You cannot manage. That is why the lED fits that requirement. But we have to look at the rest of the tax system. I welcome the fact that the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), is taking some interest in my speech. I know he has a genuine concern and interest in it. I thank him for that. I hope I can get him to listen to my next little plea without thinking that I am playing politics. Our present indirect tax system is so damaging to anybody who tries to grow anything or make anything. I like to give the example-because we have had all our disputes-of payroll tax. Hardly any farmers pay payroll tax directly because the wages they pay are minimal and there is a threshold. Most of them would tell you they have an exemption for sales tax. And they have. But then, I would say in my electorate: 'Who pays these taxes?' 'No, I don't pay them.' 'How did you get to the meeting tonight?' 'I came in my car.' They certainly paid sales tax on that car unless they used the one tonne, four wheel drive ute, which is exempt. But it is worse than that and it applies to everything on their property. That car is made of iron ore, coal, oil and probably some bauxite, all mined, let us say, because it is a good Aussie vehicle, within Australia. Every one of those mining companies pays payroll tax. Every time the stuff moves between one place and another somebody pays fuel tax and if they are using trucks the sales tax composome nent is substantial-it is $40,000 on a new prime mover. If you annualise that it is a significant amount per annum. The last time. I did the sums as a trucking operator I identiorange fied about $2,000 a week of indirect taxes paid by a typical road train-that is annualiscally ing some of the fixed charges. When the iron ore mine, which is the place where the motor car starts its life, pays payroll tax, the cost accountant says, 'That is a cost of doing business out here at the iron ore mine'-or the coal mine-'and I will put a profit margin on it before I sell it off BHP or whoever.' When that stuff gets BHP it has gone across a railway line or something else where similar taxes are being paid and another profit margin is put on the product. BHP pays the payroll tax, and sales tax is so insidious that no-one knows when they are paying it-there are all the computers inside your business and the rubber tyres on the trolley that someone uses in the supermarket. It does not matter where you look; it is so insidious. They add a profit margin to that tax that BHP pays, but they also add a profit margin to the tax and the profit margin that was paid out at the iron ore mine. All we have at this stage is some billets of steel and we have eventually got to tum them into a motorcar. And it continues right until you get to the sales office where the larger car dealers pay payroll tax. And they all build it into the cost. If you are going to drive out on Sunday in the vehicle it is probably not a problem. The Bulletin said the other day that if you add it all up it is about $10,000 on a Falcon. They also said that if you reduced even the sales tax component from 22 per cent to 12 per cent, 60,000 additional Aussies could afford a car every year. That would be very good news in Geelong and Elizabeth. But all these costs are building up for the guy who is running his farm. He pays payroll tax all right-he pays it hundreds of times, but not directly. If we had a barbed wire fence around Australia and ate and used only what we produced, it would not be a problem. But we . are in a relatively open competing society and of these people covered by this do not grow wheat and export it; they grow oranges and have to fight with the Brazilians. We say to the people on the Murray, 'You send your juice about 700 kilometres to Melbourne or Sydney in a truck' - that is basithe only way to get it there-'and we will tax you $2,000 a week a truck load,' while the Brazilians arrive at the back door of Melbourne and Sydney on the cheapest travel in the world, international sea travel, and we say, 'Compete with them.' That is silly. We have to have a tax system that removes to the aggregating and the feeding of all those to taxes into the price-not because of what someone pays for the product in the end but because of what it is doing to our car manufacturers, our farmers and everybody else who is just trying to compete with the rest of the world, whether it is at home or abroad. It is now quite clear that we can make a motorcar that is as good a quality car as anybody makes but we put thousands of dollars of lead in the manufacturers' saddlebags through the tax system, as we do to farmers. They cannot carry the burden. And what do we do? We recycle some of the money and give them this sort of assistance. It would be much better to give them a decent tax system. I wish we could sit down as 146 people in this place to talk about it without trying to make a political point-just to see what is the best system. If we did we would go down in history; they would put up statues of all of us. In reality there is a best system and we will only get it if we all get together on the issue.",103
214,Mr CAUSLEY,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"It is with a great deal of pleasure that I join in this debate on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill, which has commonly become known as the AAA package. I would like to congratulate the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and his former parliamentary secretary, Senator David Brownhill, because I know that they have put a lot of work and time into this and have probably come in for some criticism at times because this was not coming through as quickly as some people might have liked. The origins of it go back some time. The original impetus for this change goes back to about 1989 when the ARMCANZ ministers decided that drought would no longer be a natural disaster. At that particular time the ministerial council said that there needed to be a package brought into place to overcome the problems that might occur having withdrawn the support that was in the old rural assistance scheme. State governments, in particular New South Wales, continued to support the subsidisation of the transport of stock for agistment and the subsidisation of fodder and water. There was some support for farmers through the state schemes for interest rates. However, the real issues that needed to be addressed were left in abeyance for some time and it was not until we had the very severe drought, which had most of eastern Australia in its grip during the early 1990s, that the problems associated with withdrawing drought as a natural disaster certainly came to the fore. I recall, as minister for agriculture in New South Wales at the time, approaching Senator Collins, who was the federal primary industries minister, about some action in this particular area and it was certainly discussed at an ARMCANZ meeting. The facts are that we eventually did get some household support, which I and, I think, a lot of rural producers were very appreciative of. It was rural support which meant that at least they could put some food on the table, because they were in such a situation that they did not have any money and were finding it very difficult to exist. We have to understand that these circumstances are going to recur fairly regularly in Australia, because it is the driest inhabited continent on earth and drought is certainly part of the continuing scene as far as regional and rural Australia is concerned. There is no doubt that over the years, as the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has said, there have been some very reasonable and helpful programs in place, even through the taxation system. I recall that a few years ago if a producer did have a good year they could write off the cost of upgrading fences and infrastructure in one year. That was removed. I think it was during the Fraser years that we had an IED scheme, whereby producers in years of good income could put away money and then bring it back into the system when they needed it in poor years, paying tax at that time. That was removed and it became very necessary to look closely at the system to see what could be put in place. I was never a great supporter of the old rural adjustment scheme. I did not believe it had incentives in place to reward good managers and people who were efficient producers. It tended to prop up those who were inefficient. Those who were in trouble through bad management or through not being as progressive as other producers would get the support first, and you would find that some producers who were very efficient and progressive fell just outside the guidelines were the ones who were disadvantaged. I have always been a very strong supporter of incentive-of encouraging people to look after themselves, and I believe this farm household support package goes a long way to doing that. The main thing you need to do in these circumstances is to encourage people to conserve fodder, water and money so that they can carry on in the bad years. I believe the package that has been put together attempts to address those issues, to try to encourage those efficient producers to do just that so that they will be able to carry themselves through in most instances-although we will always get the situation in Australia where you get to what is called an exceptional circumstance. The exceptional circumstance is where, through no fault of their own but through the fact that there has been a very poor rainfall pattern or whatever, people do get to the stage where they have used up all their reserves. The trick that has always been difficult has been defining what an exceptional circumstance is in many instances. Anyone who knows the rural areas will tell you that an exceptional circumstance varies right across the whole area. If you come from an area such as the one I come from on the north coast of New South Wales, where the rainfall is fairly regular, going without rain for nine or 10 months is pretty much an exceptional circumstance. If you go to the west of New South Wales, to the Broken Hill area, you can probably go 18 months without rain before you start to say that it is an exceptional circumstance. So that was always a very difficult definition and one that I know many people wrestled with. I have always believed that it is something which should be left in the hands of the rural lands protection boards in New South Wales-there are similar bodies in other states but they have other names. The local people who are genuine and who understand what an exceptional circumstance is are the best people to make that decision. The bill also looks very carefully at the need to help educate farmers. That is someand thing which is very important today. We do not have to describe again in this House the technological changes which have occurred right throughout the country, whether in farming or industry. Managing a farm today means managing a big business. Units, necessarily, have become bigger, because the only way you can get a reasonable income these days is to have economies of scale. That is something that has occurred in most industries and probably needs to occur further yet. By increasing the size of the units, you end up with a large gross income, although not necessarily a large net income. It is very important to keep a very close watch on a business such as that. In days gone by you might draw up a cashbook every 12 months. These days you have to keep a watch on your outgoings at least on a weekly basis and probably even more frequently than that, to make sure that you are on budget and that your expenses are not getting ahead of income. That need for planning and education is a very vital part of farming operations. The member for O'Connor mentioned the tax system and there is no doubt that what he says has a lot of relevance for farming communities-and, I dare say, for the whole community. The tax system needs to be addressed and this government has certainly made it very clear that it is prepared to have a close look at the tax system in this country, particularly at those taxes which make it more difficult to compete on world markets by adding costs onto goods that we are trying to export to world markets. The tax system we have at the present time can only be highlighted by an experience some years ago when there was a good year and, all of a sudden, an increase in price. Producers were smiling, I dare say, about their luck at getting a doubling in price-it was one of those windfalls at the time-until they went along to talk to their accountants. Then they found out that, coming off a very low income base and having this windfall gain, provisional tax was going to take everything they had, if not a bit more. That is what made it so difficult, when people had gone through these times. We must remember that in most areas of Australia, particularly in the grain industry, you get about one season in five, on average. So there are a number of years when you are on a low income, if not a negative income, and you depend on those very good years to upgrade the property or to do something about increasing your property if you are not an efficient unit, and the tax system does make it very hard. So it is not a matter of avoiding tax; I think it is a matter of trying to be a little bit fair and understanding in circumstances such as those. An area that is addressed in this legislation that is important to farmers is the fact that farmers tend to live in family units on farms. That has been a way of life in Australia for a long time, and it is not unusual to see three generations of a family on a farm, usually because the income is low and it is very difficult for the older members of the family to move off the farm. They do not have enough cash to move off the farm; they are more or less trapped there because they cannot break away from it. Something else that occurs which is rather unique is that the younger generations tend to work on those properties for much less than wages-in some instances, just for keepwith the understanding that the property might be passed on to them when the older generations pass away. That trap is one of the things that this government has recognised and is trying to overcome in this particular legislation, which will allow the older members of the family to at least get a pension-they will not be denied that-and allow the younger generations to take over the workings of the farm. I have heard it said today that this seems to be some great concession to the farming community. I do not believe it is. I think that the family farm in Australia has served this country very well and, if you look very carefully at it, you will find that most farmers-I do not say all farmers--over their lifetimes would average less than the basic wage if you average the income that they earn over the years. It is a way of life more than a business, and I think that the concessions that we give them are certainly not outrageous and certainly not more than you might expect other sections of the community to get. The overall package has been well thought through. It has looked at most areas where there have been some problems in the farming community. I believe that the incentives have been put in place, there is education available and there is the ability to get refinancing. Those types of packages are vital to the rural community. I know my area is very, gratified that the older members of the family can get some support. Coming from the North Coast of New South Wales, the units in that particular area are not large, and I think there is need for upgrading. There is no doubt that they need to be upgraded, and this will give them some chance of doing that and becoming economically viable units. Again, I would like to congratulate the minister and the parliamentary secretary .. I know that they put a lot of work into this, they have consulted widely and they should be congratulated on the package that they have come up with. I know very well that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has strongly supported this particular package, and that only goes to show again his support for the regional areas of Australia.",107
215,Mr NAIRN,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"It is certainly a pleasure for me to speak on this Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill 1997. This bill is just part of an overall package for the rural sector, the Agriculture-Advancing Australia package; I was very honoured to be part of the launch of that package on 14 September in my electorate. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) launched this very innovative package at Hoskinstown, not 30 minutes from Canberra but a very rural farming district, in my electorate of Eden Monaro. The package was launched on the property of Gr-g and Mary Walsh, and it has received . enormous accolades right across the board. The accolades have come not from people who are on the fringes-and a lot of people have been commenting from various fringesbut from people who understand just what it has been like in parts of rural Australia over the last half-a-dozen years or so. We really have had some exceptional circumstances in many parts of rural Australia in recent years. The accolades have come from the sorts of people who should know and the sorts of people who were very much involved in the development of the package. The package is not something that the government threw together in five minutes; it was developed, quite properly, over a long period of time because it is a very important package for the future of our rural industries. It was done with an enormous amount of consultation with relevant bodies. People who commented following the launch include the vice-president of the National Farmers Federation, Ian Donges, who s.aid: The Integrated Rural Policy Package was a well balanced series of measures which would set the framework for self reliance in Australia's rural industries. He went on to say: This innovative program should lay the foundation for building stronger business management to cope with the increasing demands and pressures of global markets. He also said: The Farm Family Restart Schemewhich we are dealing with here in this billwhich improves access to welfare payments was also a positive measure. Along with re-establishment grants, those farmers wanting to leave the industry will be able to do so with dignity. In another quote he said: The continuation of Exceptional Circumstances Drought Assistance was a vital element of the rural package because it provided help during extreme and prolonged situations. Finally, he said: This integrated rural policy package would allow the rural industry to become self reliant into the next century. Farm families would be able to take advantage of the available opportunities and have access to welfare similar to the rest of the community. There were also comments from other people in the industries. Queensland Farmers Federation President, Lex Buchanan, said: It is good to see there will be a smooth transition of drought aid programmes and that people are not going to be dropped over the edge. Queensland Grain Growers Association President, Ian MACFarlane, who has not exactly been an enormous out-there and upfront advocate for some of the areas that government have been working in recent years-I think he is often unfairly critical out of his depth-in this particular case made the comment: We now have a far better plan in place to provide tax incentives for farmers to put aside money in good years. It's also good to see that farmers handing their property on to the next generation will now be able to access social security. The United Graziers Association President, Larry Acton, said: There is a good balance between tax relief, training and social assistance and I am very positive about the package. Harry Bonanno from the Queensland cane growers said: It is good to see a broadening of criteria for access to exceptional circumstance payments. There are many more. The overall package was well received and for good reason. When you look at how this particular farm household support amendment bill is made up, it typifies the overall philosophy that we were putting into this new package. There was really a deep-seated philosophy of putting in place assistance and other programs to ensure that rural communities are able to help themselves in the future and can try to get away from the welfare handout mentality which was starting to creep in over the last decade. That started because of the sorts of policies that were in place and the lack of the types of policies that we have included in this AAA package. It is a basic philosophy in which we differ from the other side of politics. We are also implementing some of those changes in the education and training area. It is putting the emphasis back at what I would call the sharp end so that we will be helping farmers to be better trained, increase their skills and prepare themselves for those difficult years well in advance, rather than waiting for them to fall into difficulty and making them go through years of difficulty, as the former Labor government did in the late 1980s and early 1990s when they did not provide any relief at all. When it got to absolute· desperation you threw out a few bones to try to help them along. That builds up a culture of, 'We will just mosey along and do what we can and, hopefully, if we get into trouble the government will come along and help us out.' Our whole philosophy is very different and when you add to that many of the other economic changes that we have made since we have come to government, which have seen interest rates drop 2.5 per cent at least over the last 12 months, these have been of enormous benefit to most farmers. Most farmers, I would say, are travelling on fairly large debts and they have pretty big overdrafts. Even though those business overdrafts and debts are still running at interest rates are too high, they have come down at least 2.5 per cent in the last 12 to 15 months and that has had a big impact on the farming community. We are putting emphasis also on opening up markets. Since we have come to government, we have opened up markets in a whole variety of new areas throughout the world, and many farming groups are benefiting from that. That is one aspect of it in the overall picture which cannot be forgotten when you look at these sorts of initiatives within the Agriculture-Advancing Australia policy. We compare that with the former government which really has, as I said, this total welfare dependency attitude. I gave that example of the late 1980s and early 1990s. I am sure many farmers will never forget that they went through hell for many years during a very difficult drought and got no assistance at all until the situation was absolutely desperate. The bill itself covers a whole variety of areas. It basically allows for income support to be paid at the newstart allowance rate, and this payment will be available for a maximum period of 12 months. The recipients of that payment will not have to satisfy any activity test; also, quite importantly, they will not have to put their farm on the market to get that assistance. The opposition spokesperson for primary industries, in speaking to this bill earlier, made a big song and dance about that. He said, 'Well, really, no farmers should go into this thinking that they won't have to put their farm on the market; they really will.' Once again, that is the sort of approach that those on the other side of politics seem to makethey get great joy in throwing in those little scare comments every now and again. Quite clearly, we have put this particular provision in for a specific reason because, if you go on to the next part of the bill-and that is that the recipients will have a binding obligation to obtain professional advice on the future viability of their businesses-what we are saying is, 'Okay, you're in difficulty. We're going to help you get the right sort of advice. You don't have to put your farm on that the market straight away, you can get assistance, but let's work through the advice and see what can be done and see whether we can work out a way in which you can either trade your way out of the problems or whether the better idea is to move on, to move off the farm if it is not viable.' I think there is an expectation that we are going to look at the very positive side of it, before people get to the negative side of it and say, 'Well, we'll have to give away the farm.' That is the reason why we have included that in there-so that they do not have to put the farm on the market in the first instance. We want people to work through this with professional help to see whether a good result can be achieved. Another part of the legislation is access to a re-establishment grant of up to $45,000 on the sale of the farm. This will only be available to farmers who enter the scheme during its first two years of operation. We are saying that there is a window of opportunity there. We know there are many farms out there that are not viable; they really are too small in the current climate and for the types of markets we at.e dealing in. We are giving people an opportunity to say, 'Well, this isn't going to work. We can get help in this way and we can start afresh.' The value of any income support used by the recipient will be deducted from that re-establishment grant. I think that is fair. We are looking after taxpayer money, and we have to make sure that we use it in the most efficient way. The re-establishment grant is subject to an assets test. Farmers will be able to have up to $90,000 in assets and still be able to qualify for the maximum grant. That is a significant change in comparison with what was there before-the farm household support scheme. Once again, the opposition spokesperson on primary industries has said that all we have done is picked up their policy and tinkered around the edges. The previous scheme was an abject failure. For instance, in the year 1995-96 the number of families that were supported under that scheme was less than 50. It was terminated in May 1997 and is now being replaced by this new package. But in this new package there are some quite specific differences from that former policy. I have mentioned already that farmers will not have to put their farm on the market to gain assistance. It is a major difference; it is not tinkering around the edges. We have increased the amount of assets they can have from $45,000 to $90,000. That is a doubling of it-I do not think that is tinkering around the edges. Some of those opposite might think that $45,000 is not very much, but it is an enormous amount on a lot of the farming properties these days. We really have made some dramatic changes and put together a package which is far better focused for the needs of rural Australia today. The other aspect of the bill is that the 'drought exceptional circumstances payment' will become an 'exceptional circumstances payment'. I just want to speak briefly in support of that. We have discovered over the last few years that, sure, you can have droughts and you can put up all sorts of statistics, such as the detail of annual rainfall taken over many years, if you have that information. I have to say that in many parts of New South Wales, and particularly my area, the New South Wales government's statistical information in that regard is very poor and, because only that very poor data is available, it makes life very difficult to prove certain instances. You can have drought, but you can also have all sorts of other things happening. I know that the member for MCMillan (Mr Broadbent) spoke earlier in this debate and described the exceptional circumstances that occurred in his electorate in a very short period of time. It could not be shown as a drought exceptional circumstance, even though it was an exceptional circumstance. Therefore, I think this change we are making is very valid. That certainly applies in a part of my electorate: the Monaro. It is quite a unique part of the country where they have been in drought for the last four to five years. Because of the way in which rain has fallen in those four years, you cannot justify a drought exceptional circumstance claim, but everybody will accept that there really has been an exceptional circumstance occur. That is because several other things have been happening. You have had plagues of wingless grasshoppers; you have had real failure of grazing pastures. On Monday of last week I was down there with a member of the minister's office and an agronomist, looking at the trial of a variety of pastures that was undertaken in a few places in this area near Cooma. To see what has occurred in that threeor four-year period is quite incredible, and you can understand why they have had the difficulty they have had. In a controlled area where nothing has been able to get at these pastures, you have had complete failure of some native pastures that would normally flourish. There really has been a quite exceptional circumstance. An application, in fact, was lodged for that area quite some months ago. The New South Wales government took from May through to August to deal with that and, unfortunately, through much bureaucratic hold-up and other things, although the application was for exceptional circumstances, they then asked the Commonwealth to assess it on drought exceptional circumstances-and for what reason, we do not know. We then had to point that out. Finally, a couple of weeks later, they said, 'Yes, all right, you can look at it from an exceptional circumstance point of view.' That has been done. The RASAC committee visited there several weeks ago. As I have said, I visited there last Monday with a member of the minister's· staff, and I understand that we are getting close to receiving a report from RASAC so that the minister will be in a position to make a decision about that particular application. I think that application highlights a variety of things, particularly the incredible circumstances that can occur in an area over several years. Also it raises the other issue of the viability of farms and the size of farm holdings in particular areas. I think that is an aspect that will have to be looked at more closely in that region, because many of the problems that have been created do stem to some extent from the size of properties and viability as circumstances have changed. In summary, this bill is a very positive step forward and part of an incredibly positive, integrated rural policy of which we will be seeing other aspects introduced in the coming months. I, and certainly my constituents in the largely rural part of my electorate, will be looking forward to those. They include the training areas and the farm business areas and those sorts of things. These particular measures in the farm household support legislation are real safety net measures. We are talking about safety nets but at the same time allowing people to work things through in a way which can be positive for the future and for their future generations on that farm.",109
216,Mr TONY SMITH,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT," Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, it is good to see you in the chair for the first time when I have been speaking. I do have a number of farms in my electorate of Dickson, but as a result of the redistribution there will be another 400 square kilometres added to the seat of Dickson. The Labor Party should bear that in mind when they are trumpeting their newfound heroine around the seat of Dickson. There are a lot of farmers who have had a lot of tough times in the past who will be added to the electorate of Dickson when that additional 400 square kilometres is added. In fact, the boundaries are going to be moved from Cobbold Creek right through to the Pine Rivers Shire boundaries that extend almost to Mount Mee. It will include areas like Dayboro, Lacey's Creek and Mount Pleasant, which are beautiful areas of the Samford Valley and other stretches of the Pine Rivers Shire. It has not escaped my attention that those additional farms will form part of the extended electorate of Dickson. Let us hope that the electors in that part of the new electorate of Dickson will remember that the previous government did little, if anything, to assist people on the land and in fact regarded them always as people who did not need assistance in times of strife and trouble. It has been sad to notice, even in my own area of Mount Samson, that, as a result of a long and continuing drought and other matters, farms have closed down in recent times. I am speaking about the last 10 years. There has been a gradual decline in the dairy farming output in the area and in particular in my own street, Kundes Road, Mount Samson, the last dairy farm closed down in the last six months. That street used to have dairy farms right throughout the street. It is only a short street by rural standards but it was dotted with dairy farms all the way along. That particular farm has closed its dairying operations and that is a sad thing in many respects. But it is understandable because a number of problems have given rise to that, not the least being the prolonged and continuing drought. The adjacent farm to my property, which was also a dairy farm, closed something like three years ago because of a number of factors, including drought. The farmers concerned, the Schmidt family, have now diversified to running an emu farm and tourist facility. Although it has not been easy, it does show the initiative of John and Betty Schmidt, who have taken on board the fact that the climate has changed and the rural environment has changed, and they have moved into the area of emu farming, together with their tourist facility. They do cook some mean emu steaks' on that farm of theirs now. Mr Lee-Do you eat them?",113
217,Mr TONY SMITH,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"I have tried them and they are not too bad. I would not have them every Saturday night, though. Nonetheless, they are not a bad steak. The problem of drought is something that I am sure rural people understand. I know, having lived off the land myself as a farmer, which is a very difficult life, that the moment it does rain the tendency is to forget that there is going to be another drought. That is the inevitable cycle. Unfortunately, what has happened in recent years is that. there has been prolonged drought. Indeed, it is fair to say that in that area, the Samford Valley and the surrounds, there has been, I would say, a prolonged drought since 1988. The prolongation of that drought·unfortunately has caused a lot of farms to become unviable. Sadly, people have moved out of the area and farming in the area has given way to small hobby farm blocks. Many of the farmers in the area who have been successful have, of course, made allowances for the fact of drought. The pineapple farmers in particular, though they do not need the same rainfall that other farmers do, certainly have made a continuing go of their operations. The Henzell farm, which is just next to my mother's property, is a successful operation, and the farming operation stretches also into Dayboro. It is important that farmers bear in mind the notion that, even in an area like that, which is not terribly far from the coast-indeed, it is probably only a 35-minute drive to the coast from my place-drought is part of the cycle, and worse so in the more marginal areas of the countryside. Many farmers make provision for that, but other farmers unfortunately have fallen into the trap of believing that, once that rain comes and the green grass is growing, things will be right, and they do not make provision for the cycle. There has been a continuous drought in that area for a number of years now. Although it has been alleviated at times with some rainfall, generally the rain has been dumped on the area. There has been a major failure of wet season rains. Consequently, the illusory green is quickly replaced by the depressing brown. There is nothing more depressing than continuous drought in that area, as in every other area of Australia. This is why these measures have been very well received, not only in my electorate but right throughout Australia. That was outlined by the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn) in his speech to this House immediately before mine. I do not wish to canvass in any great detail many of the things he said. He comes from a much more concentrated rural electorate, naturally enough, and obviously has a very good understanding of the needs of his constituents in those areas. It is important to refer to a couple of elements of this scheme. The farm family restart scheme will act as a catalyst to assist farmers in assessing their long-term future on the farm and provides professional advice to assist in the process. It is not a loan scheme. All support will be provided as a grant, unlike the old farm household support scheme. Income support will be paid at newstart allowance rates, as will the partner component where applicable, and it will be available for a maximum period of one year. Farm family restart scheme-FFRSrecipients will not have to satisfy an activity test and will not have to put the farm on the market to obtain assistance. The FFRS provides a higher asset limit and a tapered phaseout of the grant to encourage farmers to leave before their assets are severely depleted. Under the old rural adjustment scheme, a farmer could walk away with a maximum $90,000-$45,000 in grants and $45,000 in assets. Under the FFRS, a farmer can walk away with a maximum of $135,000-an increased asset limit of $90,000, plus a grant of $45,000-without affecting the grant. For assets over $90,000, the grant reduces by $2 for every $3 in assets. No grant will be payable over $157,500. To qualify for the scheme, you must be a farmer of at .least 18 years of age; you must be an Australian resident in Australia; you must have been a farmer for a continuous period of two years before you apply; and you must have a certificate of inability to obtain finance. All people receiving restart income support have an obligation to obtain advice on the long-term prospects for their farm business and on their future options if they decide to leave the industry. Item 42 enables the secretary to direct the recipient to obtain certain advice and to assist the person in paying for the advice. That is an important aspect, which touches on what I said before about the need for farmers to be realistic. Sometimes it is very hard to be realistic when there is so much hanging on a farming property, particularly if there has been longevity of family tenure on that farm. There is an enormous amount that is bound up in a farming property. It is not just the work that has been done on that property over many years; it is the generational attachment to the land. I am the last speaker on this matter and will wind up now. All of these measures demonstrate the coalition's commitment to the rural areas and to the increasing sensitivity of this government to rural considerations and needs. It demonstrates that the farmers ate of Dickson, particularly in the expanded Dickson, will receive excellent service while they retain a member of the coalition.",114
218,Mr ANDERSON,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Gwydir-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (6.13 p.m.)in reply-There are a few points I want to make in summing up. I first go to those who have spoken on the package, and I thank them very much for their contribution. I want to make some observations about the opposition's position on this. Their spokesman seems to believe that Agriculture-Advancing Australia is little more than a tinkering at the edges of the former Labor government's rural policy. That simply is not true. At the very least, one need only look at the amount in the forward estimates for the old rural assistance scheme and compare it to the very much enhanced quantities of money being made available for this package to recognise that it is far more than simply a tinkering at the edges. Beyond that, the policy includes several major elements which were beyond the scope of the former Labor government to deliver. I could refer specifically, for example, to the three-year waiver of the gifting provisions that will allow many older farmers to gain access to the age pension and pass on the farm to the next generation. I could also refer to the introduction of a new commercially operated farm management deposit scheme. Having said that, I also need to point out that I have been prepared to give credit where credit is due. I understand that there was a charge to the effect that I had not been. I have, for example, on a number of occasions publicly acknowledged that the drought relief payment arrangements introduced by the previous government were a very important initiative in ensuring the survival of many farm families during the worse drought this century. I trust that the opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), would be gracious enough to acknowledge that we have improved further upon that scheme-for example, in doubling the recovery period and in allowing for greater recognition of the effectiveness of rainfall in drought of the elector- circumstances. In summing up, the new schemes, which will be established by these amendments to the Farm Household Support Act, represent a significant improvement in the access that farm families have to welfare assistance during times of hardship. They will also play an important role in farm adjustment. In both these respects, the new farm family restart scheme and the exceptional circumstances relief payment are important ingredients in a forward looking policy mix for Australia's vital farm sector. They are the first of several new initiatives to be implemented under the federal government's Agriculture-Advancing Australia package, which I am pleased to say has been widely welcomed by rural Australia. The government's objective through Agriculture-Advancing Australia and other initiatives such as the Natural Heritage Trust and supermarket to Asia is to boost the profitability, productivity, competitiveness and sustain ability of the farm sector working in partnership with it. The farm family restart scheme will begin operating on 1 December 1997 and will be available to low income farmers who are experiencing financial hardship and cannot borrow further against their assets. Recipients will need to satisfy income and off-farm assets tests and demonstrate that they are unable to borrow further against their assets. The farm family restart scheme will provide these farm families with access to income support at the same rate as the newstart allowance, with an additional partner component if applicable, payable for one year, without recipients having to satisfy an activity test or put their farm on the market. The scheme will also operate as a decision support system for farm families facing hardship and who are contemplating the very difficult question of whether they have a future in the industry. The great benefit of the income support payment is that it will remove the pressure of worrying about how farm families are going to meet their day-today living expenses. Recipients will also be required to obtain financial, business, career and personal support paid for by the government to assist them assess the viability of their businesses and their long-term prospects in the industry. For those who choose to leave the industry and have net assets of $90,000 or less, the government will be offering re-establishment grants of $45,000, less the value of any income support received under the scheme. The grant reduces by $2 for each $3 of assets and will be available only to those farm families which apply for it during the first two years of the scheme. The farm family restart scheme will provide the farm sector with an effective welfare safety net, as will the new exceptional circumstances relief payment, when the difficulties faced by farmers are more widespread. The exceptional circumstances relief payment gives recognition to the fact that there are exceptional circumstances which are beyond the scope of normal farm risk management. The ECRP will be available to farmers suffering hardship as a result of rare and severe events, not just exceptional drought. It will replace the current drought relief payment. Very importantly, it will be no different to the drought relief payment. The ECRP will be an income support payment equivalent to the newstart allowance. It will be subject to an income test and off-farm assets test and qualifies farm families for access to health care cards and family payments. The duration of the ECRP will be determined on a case-by-case basis according to the exceptional circumstances involved, as is the situation for current exceptional circumstances arrangements under the rural adjustment scheme. A 12-month recovery period will continue to apply in the case of drought exceptional circumstances. The farm family restart scheme and the exceptional circumstances relief payment represent significant positive new policy developments for the farm sector, and I commend them to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Anderson) read a third time. CIDLD CARE PAYMENTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 October, on motion by Mrs Moylan: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Ms Macklin moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for its cuts of $820 million to child care over two budgets, resulting in fee increases of up to $20 per child per week, lower quality child care, the closure of services and job losses--changes that are forcing some people to stop working, take their children out of child care, or rely on back-yard care; (2) calls on the Government to reverse its unfair decisions to cap childcare assistance at 50 hours, and to limit emergency childcare assistance to 4 weeks in any 12 month period; (3) deplores the Government's lack of consultation with the child care industry about implementation of the legislation and its failure to provide adequate information about regulations and guidelines to be made under the Act; (4) condemns the Government's attempts to rush this legislation through and implement its far-reaching changes by 1 January 1998 thus . causing chaos in the child care sector"".  p.m.)-The background to this child-care legislation is a continuation of the attacks by this government upon families. Earlier today we had some fierce exchanges in this chamber about the government's attacks upon aged care, the introduction of entry fees for nursing homes and the terrible trauma that is causing our senior citizens, the people in higher age groups. Mr Lee-Particularly Norah Head.  Head, as the member for Dobell mentions. Last Monday week I witnessed a spectacle I had never seen in my life before when some 150 people in their higher age years were seen pushing their tripods and walkers down the street, with placards they had written themselves above their heads and which staff from the Legacy Hostel and the Vietnam Veterans Hostel had prepared. They had the main road of Toukley closed. They marched down the main road of Toukley and around the comer, hobbling and shuffling along, taking up the full width of the roadway, demonstrating their protest and their fierce objections to what is being done to aged people, people who are at the most vulnerable stage of their life in respect of nursing home care in this country. I have never seen the like of it before in my life. I am so proud of those Australians, those men and women. They marched and shuffled down the street expressing their objections to the treatment that is now been accorded them. It was heartless, callous and ruthless. Then we go to the other end of the age spectrum--child care. It was said to me a long time ago in this life that you cost a lot of money when you arrive and you cost a lot of money when you leave. Obviously, the government's withdrawal of some $500 million in capital funding from aged care services has affected one end of the age spectrum. Here the savage reductions of $820 million from child care over two budgets by this government replicates the action they are taking in respect of aged Australians. Our second reading amendment, that I speak in support of as well as I can, refers to the fact that we have not declined to give the bill a second reading but, first, we condemn the government for its cuts of $820 million to child care over two budgets leading to fee increases of up to $20 per child per week, lower quality child care, the closure of services, and job losses-changes that are forcing some people to stop working and to take their children out of child care or to rely on backyard care. Secondly, it says the House deplores the government's lack of consultation with the child-care industry about implementation of the legislation and its failure to provide adequate information about regulations and guidelines to be made under the act. Thirdly, it calls on the government to reverse its unfair decisions to cap child-care assistance at 50 hours and to limit emergency child-care assistance to four weeks in any 12-month period. Fourthly, it condemns this government's attempts to rush this legislation through to implement its far-reaching changes by 1 January 1998, which will cause chaos in the child-care sector. The background to this legislation is that it comes directly from our Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The Prime Minister's vision of the future is his memory of the past. He marches forward fiercely gazing backwards, trying to recreate the Australia of the 1950s-trying to get women back into the kitchen and out of the work force. That is one of the direct effects of this legislation. We have seen it in the number of women who have been dropping out of the work force because they cannot afford now to pay for child-care services. Again, that is reflected in the participation rate. The participation rate goes down and so they look to reduce the unemployment rate by reducing the participation rate-or the proportion of people of working age looking for work or in work. If one reduces the participation rate and holds the number of jobs constant, then the unemployment rate goes down. But it is a cruel, negative approach to the problems this government has created of job insecurity and lack of confidence in the future-at both ends, child care and aged care. I looked at what is happening in my own electorate of Shortland at the northern end, Lake Macquarie. In the Lake Macquarie City Council area the impact has already been quite severe. I want to tum to a report that has been prepared by the council's own officers in respect of child care. It says that it has initiated nine long day care centres, one occasional care centre and a number of outside school hours services. That council alone administers services that cater for some 600 children per week. But the restructuring by this government of child-care assistance arrangements changes the face of children's services throughout the country with a move towards provision of private services. What the council officers are referring to here is the impact that it is going to have upon the services provided within our council area of Lake Macquarie. The report says: The 5 to 14 age group has a 4% growth which is well above the State growth of 1%. A number of small outside school hours services in the area only just maintain a viable service at the moment. With the withdrawal of operational funding in January 1998 many will not be able to sustain their service. The impact of the changes outlined in the Budget leaves Child Care Centres and Outside School Hours Services in a position of uncertainty in of their viability. As we read through all of the report that was prepared and submitted to council, we see the quite damaging impact that it is going to have come January 1998, which I understand is now being extended to April, and also the damage it has already caused as a result of the abolition of the subsidy for community day care centres. Before this government came into power, it gave an undertaking that it had no plans whatsoever to change the operational subsidy of the community based long day care centre. That was the undertaking it gave. That was the promise it gave. Yet, in its very first budget, in 1996-97, operational subsidies for community based long day care centres were abolished. That pushed fees up. That has caused a drop in attendance at child-care centres, and that has affected the viability of a number of community based child-care centres in my electorate and it has affected the lifestyle and the income of families as well because of the flow-on effect of the mother not being able to take work, not being able to afford to work. The effect of childcare cuts is that full child care is unaffordable for a large number of low income families. They are the people who are most affected. The Prime Minister seems to think that women go to work by choice. Some women pursue careers and do go to work by choice, but a large number of women-certainly in my electorate-work because the family needs the additional income. The household needs the additional income. It is supplementary to the husband's income. Most parents have to cut the present number of days they are sending their children to accredited child-care centres and then on the other days they are trying to find alternative minders. If they cannot do that through the extended family, if they have an extended family, then there is the risk of backyard child-care services being used. The government, with its ruthless action in respect of child care, is taking away the reassurance that the parent had that their child was in a safe care environment whilst the child was away from the parent, whilst the terms parent was at work or doing whatever else they had to do. Child-care centres are being forced to restructure. The cutbacks affect the proprietors of those child-care centres. They affect the staff members as well as the parents; and that adds to insecurity. It is more difficult for families where more than one child attends the centre. Those people have to pay an extra $40 each per week for each child. Fees have gone up by $4 per day, and this is the lowest increase, which still means that centres have to cut staff some days. What most proprietors in my electorate are saying is that the uncertainty that they are experiencing now has never been felt before. This uncertainty is causing an overload of misinformation on price fixing and other possible changes which this government is planning on bringing in. At the base of it, this action by the government-this destabilisation of families-is bringing insecurity and uncertainty. One quality child-care provider has told us that they are pricing themselves out of providing a high quality of service; a standard of service of which they have always been proud. That, in effect, reduces the standards. They have had to reduce their standards because they have had to reduce staff numbers. They have always had a long waiting list, but that is now changing. One parent who could not afford to pay for a full week's child care has had to reduce it to three days per week and send her child elsewhere for the other two days. Her child had been attending the same centre for a couple of years. This change has meant anxiety for the child as well as the mother. The mother says that she has a feeling of guilt not only for the child but also for the centre in which she has always had a lot of confidence. She knew that her child was happy and being well looked after. We are seeing money being stripped from the care of children. For this government, quality care of children is clearly not a priority. A similar case can be made with respect to aged care. Most child-care centres are run by community based parents, not big corporations who can afford big overheads. The priorities in the child-care system should be affordability, quality of care, safety and a healthy environment for the children. By cutting funding for these much needed services, the government are sending a message to the community that they do not consider our children's safety and welfare a priority. Children in those child-care centres who have been used to attending such centres are not only being disrupted and denied care; their progress is also being destabilised. By cutting funding for these much needed services, the government are sending a message to the community that they do not consider our children's safety and welfare a priority. As I said earlier, like our elderly citizens, our children cannot stand up for themselves and speak out as strongly as others in the community can in defence of their priorities. This, therefore, makes them an easy . target. Insecurity in our community is now endemic. There is job insecurity, a fear of losing jobs, and a fear of not retaining access to services. What is most hurtful of all is that the government promised to maintain child care and aged care. This government has broken so many of the promises it has made. The total result has been destabilisation and the generation of enormous feelings of anxiety, insecurity and fear. We branded 1 July 1997 as a black day for child care; a national day of action; a day to register in the public mind what this government was doing; a day to raise awareness of the drastic cuts being made by this government in the 1996-97 and 1997-98 budgets. In the 1996-97 budget, the cuts amounted to over $500 million. A further $345 million was cut from child care in this budget. But the bulk of the cuts in this budget come from limiting the number of new private long day care places to only 7,000 per year in 1998 and 1999 at a saving of $207 million. Some $81 million was slashed from child-care assistance for non work related care. From 1 January 1998, this is being limited to 20 hours per week. It is estimated that an average 30 places in before and after school care services will lose $18,000 per annum. This will have to be recouped through increased fees if the services are to remain open. In my electorate of Shortland-both on the Central Coast, from Toukley to Norah Head north, and in the northern end-the provision of child-care services by both the Wyong Shire Council and the Lake Macquarie City Council is suffering from the withdrawal of support by the federal government. It is very difficult to get the message across to members of the government. With ministers, it is impossible, but some backbenchers have some understanding of the harm that is being done. They pretend that it is not happening, but they know that it is because they are getting the same responses in their electorates that we are getting: public anger and family destabilisation of the services that are being provided. The amendment we have moved in respect of this bill is intended to drive home to the parliament the damage being caused by this government in its budgetary approach to child care. The government has failed to consult with the child-care industry about implementation of the legislation. We are asking the government to reverse its decisions in some respects, and we are attempting to push this legislation through. I commend the amendment to the House.",115
219,Mr MOSSFIELD,CIDLD CARE PAYMENTS,"Greenway) (6.36 p.m)The government's Child Care Payments Bill 1997 provides for a system of approved childcare services and is intended to simplify the paperwork associated with child care by using the Commonwealth Delivery Agency to process all applications and payments. The bill also increases the threshold for the assets test, introduces a cap of 20 hours for parents who are not working, training or studying and seeks to limit the number of child-care places. To the motion for the second reading the opposition has moved that: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for its cuts of $820 million to child care over two budgets, resulting in fee increases of up to $20 per child per week, lower quality child care, the closure of services and job losses--changes that are forcing some people to stop working, take their children out of child care, or rely on back-yard care; (2) calls on the Government to reverse its unfair decisions to cap childcare assistance at 50 hours, and to limit emergency childcare assistance to 4 weeks in any 12 month period; (3) deplores the Government's lack of consultation with the child care industry about implementation of the legislation and its failure to provide adequate information about regulations and guidelines to be made under the Act; (4) condemns the Government's attempts to rush this legislation through and implement its far-reaching changes by 1 January 1998 thus causing chaos in the child care sector"". In supporting the opposition's second reading amendment, I think the value of point 4 of the opposition's amendment has been clearly recognised already by the government in the changes that were announced by the minister yesterday. Just to place on record those changes as we understand them, I refer to an article that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning. It said 'Child care changes delayed'. I will read the article: The Federal Government has deferred changes to child-care payment arrangements until after Easter next year, prompting concerns by children's groups. The Government's new service agency, Centrelink, was to have taken over responsibility for the payments from the Department of Social Security from January l. But the Minister for Family Services, Mr Smith, said the handover would now be left until April 27, to enable more detailed consideration of the new legislation. However, the article goes on: The national convener of the National Association of Community-Based Children's Services, Ms Lynne Wannan, said she doubtedeven at this pointCentrelink would be ready to take over by April. She is quoted as saying: ""It's just all chaos. All the fuss that's going on with aged care will be going on with child care very soon."" That is a clear indication that even at this point the government is not into position to implement its new legislation. Speaking on the legislation itself, the Commonwealth government's involvement in child care commenced in the early 1970s with the introduction of the Child Care Act by the MCMahon government. I always like to recognise progressive legislation, irrespective of what side of the parliament introduces it. In hindsight, the MCMahon government's legislation was a very foresighted piece of legislation. It certainly showed a lot of vision in relation to the numbers of women who have entered the work force over that period. Over time the needs of working families have increased, women's desires to balance a career and raise a family have increased and the second partner in low income families has found it economically essential to seek either part-time or full-time work. This meant that family day care, occasional care, out of school hours care and preschool care have been either introduced or expanded. One of the major budget cutting decisions in the 1996 budget was to remove the oper-. ational subsidy. It was estimated that this move would save the Commonwealth $35.1 million in 1997-98, $40.5 million in 1998-99 and $41.7 million in 1999 to the year 2000. At this stage I will· refer to parts of an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 26 July 1997 by Adele Horan which was based on comments from the Network of Community Activities, which represents before and after school and vacation care providers. These are the important quotes: The federal government's allocation of more than $12 million over two years for consultants to outof-school care programs and for minor upgrading is a ""scandalous"" waste of money, the NSW peak body says. Network of Community Activities, which represents 600 providers of before and after school and vacation care, has written to the Minister for Family Services, Ms Moylan, urging her to reconsider the decision on consultants. In the latest budget, the government announced sweeping changes to its funding of services. Individual services will lose operational subsidies of between $24,000 and $41,000, but each will be eligible for a $3,000 government grant to pay a consultant. The article also noted: Network's co-ordinator, Ms Judy Finlayson, said it was scandalous that the money could not be used in a more cost-effective, collaborative way. It clearly indicates the government is wasting money on consultants while at the same time cutting funding for genuine child-care services. These reductions will have a considerable impact on working-class families in electorates such as Greenway where harsh economic circumstances are already causing family breakdowns. Affordable child-care services run by local councils and community and church organisations are in great demand in western Sydney. I quote from correspondence from one such organisation who have sought my support for special funding for their family service project: Quakers Hill Family Services is another project which operates from the complex providing family support, family counselling, multicultural programs and vocational care. This project is jointly sponsored by the Quakers Hill United Church parish and Wesley Mission's Dalmar Child and Family Care. Of the families currently utilising the premises, many are registered child at risk families, and over 70% are dealing with current or recent domestic violence issues. This area also has a high level of non-English speaking families (approx. 25%) many of whom are newly arrived migrants with minimal English skills. In seeking to provide a onestop shop to the high need/vulnerable families, it is essential that this centre is granted child care assistance in order to service these very needy families who have very limited financial and social resources. This would then enable the centre to provide a specialised child care program to begin to· address the impact the violence and abuse has had on their children's lives. The 1996-97 budget cuts are either forcing women out of work or forcing families to accept second-rate child care options. These options range from reducing the number of child-care days used each week, children being left unattended before and after school, older children being asked to look after younger children and neighbours and other family members being used as baby-sitters. While this may appear on the surface to be an ideal arrangement, in many cases reported to me this involves one of the parents travelling considerable distances to transport a child to a grandparent's home, adding to the stress of all concerned. The coalition fails to understand that they cannot reverse a trend by the MCMahon government 20 years ago without causing massive social disruption. Increased unemployment, drugs, crime and divorce have led to a breakdown in the family structure. This government's cuts to child-care funding will only add to these problems. A survey conducted by the Australian Services Union found that 71 per cent of 21 councils surveyed in Melbourne had increased child-care fees or plan to do so. In my own local government area, child-care fees were increased by $21.50 per week, or $4.30 per day, because of the removal of the operational subsidy. Another example of the increased cost of child care relates to a single parent who came into my office who is going to TAPE to improve her employment skills. Her child-care bill has increased by over $36 since May this year. To clarify this figure, which comes in two parts, firstly, as a result of changes to the child-care assistance the child-care fee for this parent went up from $28 per week to $43 per week, an increase of $15 per week, from 26 May this year. Secondly, as a result of the removal of the operational subsidy, which took effect from 1 July, her fee per week for one child went up from $43 per week to $64 per week. This is an increase over that period of some $36.40, which is outrageous. It is impossible for people in the circumstances that I am describing to keep their children in child care. I have received phone calls and requests for interviews from distressed parents who are being forced to reduce the number of days they use child-care facilities and use the other options that I have previously referred to. These parents are being asked to accept a decrease in income or a change of lifestyle to cope with the Howard government's budget changes. One of the things that will continue to haunt this government is this most peculiar quote from the previous minister during the second reading speech: The bill embodies the government's commitment to assist families with dependent children to participate in the work force and to assist the community by ensuring that child care is affordable for low and middle income families and by improving access to quality child care. What an appalling mismatch of words and outcomes. Rather than enabling families to participate in the work force, these very actions are reducing participation. Rather than ensuring that child care is affordable, these very actions have caused increases in fees, thus making it less affordable. Rather than ensuring and improving access to quality child care, these very actions are making it less accessible and in time will surely lead to a lowering of quality. Child-care centres are trying to trim what little icing is left in their groups to try to save money and make what is left spread even further across the cake. The overworked staff are all working closely with their client parents, trying desperately to maintain their services and their quality. Nothing could be further from the truth than that espoused by the previous minister. People in reality land know that what she has created is increased trauma, stress and concern. The need to cut back on work time so as to pay less child care is lowering the quality of life of low and middle income earners. So much for the concern for the battlers. It seems more like an attack by an uncaring economic rationalist minister. In my appropriation speech on 4 June this year I referred to the excellent record of the previous Labor government in providing child-care places for people in western Sydney.",120
220,Mr CADMAN,CIDLD CARE PAYMENTS,Hal It's just propaganda.,122
221,Mr MOSSFIELD,CIDLD CARE PAYMENTS,"I take great pride, as I have on many other occasions, in repeating these remarks. I am glad that the member for ,Mitchell has made some comments because he would know that what I am saying is correct. His electorate is in a similar part of western Sydney to mine. What I did say on that occasion, which I am very happy to repeat on this occasion, is that under the previous Labor government the Blacktown local government area was approved as a high need area for new community based long day care places and outside school hour places. Under Labor, western Sydney had 361 places for every 1,000 children compared with the New South Wales average of 326 places per 1,000. Blacktown also had the highest relative level of long day care supply in western Sydney. Under Labor, the availability and the afford ability of child-care facilities increased considerably. This good work has been undone by this government in just two budgets. The increase in child-care places under Labor in response to the rate of female participation in the work force, which increased from 40.6 per cent in 1972 to 53.4 per cent in 1996, has been particularly high in the 25to 59-year-old group. My own electorate contains a large, fast growing residential area where twoincome families reside and into which many young families are moving. There is, therefore, an urgent need for family support services, particularly child care, to allow both parents, if the economic need is there, to take part in either full-time or part-time work so that the family budget can be balanced. This view is supported by Sheryle Bagwell in an article in the Financial Review on 21 May of this year: Access to quality child-care is extremely important to women's participation in paid work. But instead· of acting on that, the federal government seems intent on fiddling around the edges to save money to satisfy the bean counters while ignoring the issues for parents with kids in child-care-quality, accessibility and affordability. The implementation of this pathetic bill leaves a great deal to be desired. There are some pieces of subordinate legislation which were subject to lengthy delays in their supply child-care industry. The industry is unaware of some of the changes that the government intends to introduce. The government intended that this legislaa tion should take effect initially from 1 ary 1998. This is an unrealistic time frame, many child-care services are closed over the December, January and Christmas break period. The government now appears to have recognised that in its legislation by in implementation it announced yesterday. I have received representations from childcare groups in my own area about this very issue of the time frame. Many of the workers in this area, particularly those in the OOSH part of the industry, are very concerned at the time frame being inflicted upon them. This legislation will inflict further job losses in an already distressed industry. Hopefully, a new minister may see this with a clearer view. make an appeal to the new Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) to agree to sufficient delay so that there will be ensurveyed ough time for child-care organisations to do their sums to see not only what the social consequences will be but also what the and industrial consequences of the legislation going to be on the mostly women workers in this industry. In conclusion, I draw to the attention of the new minister a summary of the problems that have been highlighted by the National Association of Community Based Children's Services. Firstly, fees in community owned centres have increased by up to $18 per child per week. This increase for the first six months of 1997 is double the annual increase for 1996. Secondly, in four states the weekly fee for one child in full-time care is $170 or more. Thirdly, more than 25 per cent of centres in each state and territory have reduced staffing levels in an attempt to keep the fees down. The biggest cuts to staffing have been in Western Australia. Fourthly, 73 per cent of parents exiting care showed increased big fees as the reason. The parent exit surveys in this study show that 67 per cent of families leaving centres are using informal care. Fifthly, 74 per cent of parent respondents 26 reported their fees were to increase again before the end of 1997. Finally, many centres to the have been forced to adopt measures which still seriously undermine service quality. As in aged care, the performance of this government is simply not good enough and is disaster for the parents and children. I urge Januthe new minister to urgently review the as government's treatment of Australia's parents in this important area of child care in all its various forms. I have much pleasure in once again indicating my support for the amend the delay ment moved by the opposition.",122
222,Dr LAWRENCE,CIDLD CARE PAYMENTS,"Fremantle) (6.55 p.m.)It is important to see the Child Care Payments Bill 1997 as part of a range of changes that have already been introduced by the current government resulting in reduced hours, reduced funding, higher charges and reduced eligibility for assistance for fee relief. I took the initiative of surveying my local I electorate in July and then again in October of this year following the implementation of some of those changes and asking those in some cases to anticipate what will . occur when the changes in this legislation are implemented. This is a survey of both private community based child-care centres. It is are clear in my own seat that there wifl be fee rises at 12 centres-right now there are fee rises of up to $21 a week and five centres expect to increase fees in the near future. Many of those are private centres. That means that parents may be paying up to $170 a week in child-care fees in my electorate. That is a huge expense in any family budget. The abolition of federal government operational subsidies for community based centres on 1 July placed a lot centres under intolerable financial pressures and most have responded by reducing either staff, as they have done in spades in my own state of Western Australia, or other costs in order to keep the fee increases to a bare minimum. Nonetheless, they have had to increase them substantially. Some parents are now being asked to supply things that they previously did not have to supply, like meals and nappies and so on, to try to keep costs down. If you look around Australia, some 80,000 families who use community based child care are being affected by the short sighted changes in this budget, not to mention the private centres which are also having to increase fees. I expect that we will see more of that in my electorate and right around the country. The previous speaker, the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield), referred to a survey that was released by the National Association of Community Based Children's Services, and there are similar results in private sector. That survey showed that more than 400 families have withdrawn their children from long day care or reduced their patronage over the three months of that survey. A survey of 1,084 community childcare centres revealed that fee increases-this is very important-are forcing many women to withdraw from the work force. This is a clear and direct result of government funding cuts. Others are remaining in the work force but taking their children out of long day care and placing them in informal and unregulated care. The losses, as we have heard, have been the greatest in Western Australia and South Australia, with some centres reporting a loss of more than 50 families. It means that they cannot be financially viable. The majority of the children who are being withdrawn, if their mothers or parents do not stop working, are being cared for by parents at home or by relatives, friends and neighbours. Ten per cent have moved to home based day care. I want to refer to a couple of important points. When I was minister in this area, we surveyed families around Australia in 1994. Remember, this was at a time when the number of places was increasing, there was of financial assistance and there was growth in the sector. This 1994 research showed a number of things very clearly. When parents-both men and women; all income levels, all occupations-were interviewed they pointed out that society has changed dramatically from that of their grandparents. This is something that the government does not seem to understand. Families, by and large, need two incomes to survive. There are greater materialistic expectations in the 1990s than our grandparents had. Importantly, work, they say-and I say too-is a source of satisfaction and fulfilment for women as well as for men, and the extended family has declined because of social change and greater mobility. They noted too, if it needs to be noted, that families are smaller and there are more sole parents. Because of those observations, child care has taken on a much more significant role because it allows parents, particularly women, to have more choices. It enables women to work. It is sad to say, in many respects, that the the responsibility for child care remains a woman's domain. We cannot ignore that. Child care also enables sole parents-sole head of household income earners-to work. It helps relieve what I call the 'supermother syndrome' - mothers do not have to juggle all those responsibilities quite so harshly. It provides a sanity break and time out for single parents-men and women alike. It allows parents to study, to retrain and to pursue interests so that they are saner parents. It also provides a facility when primary carers have other duties such as doctors' appointments. Importantly, in small families it also initiates the socialisation process. I was fortunate in coming from a large family, but many families today are small. Child care provides an opportunity for children to learn how to socialise with others. Very importantly too, it prepares under-fives for school. That survey shows that parents had concerns even then. Those concerns would be even greater now with these changes. Parents complained about the lack of places; the location of facilities and the relatively inflexfew ible nature of some child-care arrangements. They were concerned about the quality of care, particularly in family day care. We attempted to address those concerns systematically. We are now seeing them ignored. In 1994 parents already felt that they often had to compromise on the type of care they could get, on the days and times that the care was available and on its location and affordability. The effects of those inadequacies included things like increased stress on both parents or on a single parent; reduction in choices for work and training, especially for women; a deterioration, they believed, in the quality of life; and lost employment opportunities. If those were concerns then, imagine how great those concerns are now. All of us have had letters and representations from men and women right around the country. Parents prefer formal care because of its reliability and continuity and because of the fact that children can socialise, take part in activities and have access to facilities that assist in learning. In formal care they are taught a routine and a discipline, they are cared for by trained carers and the ratio of carers is adequate for them. There is a feeling of quality of care resulting from the impression of scrutiny, accreditation and regulation. They much prefer that formal care as opposed to informal care. They were concerned about informal care and even about family day care. They felt that sometimes, where there was only one person· looking after their children, there were no obvious checks. They do not always like the discipline that differs from their own ards. They sometimes felt that in family care there were less experienced and trained carers and there were not so many structured activities. There were concerns then, but this government is forcing more families into informal care, and there is a lack of places and costs have increased. These were all things parents were concerned about in 1994. In 1994, 38 per cynt of parents said that the hours and days available were too few and too inflexible. Multiply that manyfold, given this legislation. They felt that there were too places. Again, the growth in places is being reduced by this government and funding is being cut. In 1994, 37 per cent of parents were concerned about the cost. I would say that 100 per cent of parents would now be concerned about the cost of child care, if my own electorate is any indication. These things are important not just for themselves but because of the effect that they have on our community, particularly on women. I have had a chance to do some work on the effects on health-particularly health outcomes but there are other effects as wellof increasing inequality in our society. A lot of studies from many parts of the world have documented the very clear association between a person's wealth and their health. In any community, the poorer you are, the poorer your health is. This has been described by Kaplan as one of the most pervasive and enduring observations in public health. It has been observed for most diseases. If you have a look at recent work, though, you will find that the distribution of income is now very important. Recent cross-national and intra-nation studies have suggested a relationship not just between income levels and health and life expectancy but also between income distribution and health. The bigger the gap is between rich and poor in any community, the worse the health is. And, I might say, the lower the life expectancy is, the higher the crime rates are and the poorer the education outcomes are. The greater the gap in income is between the rich and the poor in any society, the poorer those outcomes are. For example, in his study of national instandcome inequality among 11 industrialised day· countries-and, as we sit roughly in the middle of that group, we do not have anything much to crow about-Wilkinson reported a correlation of 0.81: 1 between indices of inequality and life expectancy, and that is after controlling for the average level of wealth in the community. He illustrates this point with the contrasting experiences of Britain and Japan. In 1970 those two countries had similar income distributions and similar life expectancies. Their citizens lived for roughly the same length of time and the gap between rich and poor was roughly the same, although it has to be said Britain was, on average, the wealthier country. Since then there has been a wide divergence. Japan now has the highest life expectancy in the world and the most egalitarian distribution of any country on record-ever. Conversely, in Britain income distribution has widened since the Thatcher experiment-and we are seeing some of that in this legislation-in the mid-1980s and the mortality among men and women between 15 years old and 44 years old has actually increased. From having the same gap and the same health outcomes, Britain is now very much the poor relation. Similar research in the United States, comparing state with state, has also revealed very significant correlations between the percentage of the total household income received by the less well-off half in each state and mortality, for all sorts of illnesses. That is not affected by individual behaviours like smoking and drinking and so on. It is basically a function of the gap between rich and poor. Why am I talking about this in the context of child care? For a couple of reasons. We might ask why this matters in Australia, which we all regard, I think, as an egalitarian paradise. It matters principally because there is increasing evidence of growing inequality in the developed world and particularly in Australia over the last two years. I am not just saying that because I am a member of the Labor Party and we have just removed ourselves from government. I am saying it because it is happening. During our time in government we put a chock under the bottom end, and the evidence clearly shows that we did that. If you look at Australia, as I say, in terms of international comparisons we sit somewhere in the middle. But the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling calculated that in 1990 the richest 10 per cent of Australian families received 23 per cent of the national income while the poorest 10 per cent received less than three per cent. There has not been much change in that gap over an entire decade.",123
223,Mr CADMAN,CIDLD CARE PAYMENTS,It got worse under you.,126
224,Dr LAWRENCE,CIDLD CARE PAYMENTS,"There has not been change. Look at the data in Gregory and Hunter's analysis. The interjector needs to read the data from NATSEM. The gap between rich and poor did not increase to any significant extent. In fact, those at the bottom went down by 0.2 per cent. That is NATSEM's own work, and a lot of others have confirmed that. The point is that, when you look at the total income as opposed to market based incomes, you see a difference. If governments do not transfer cash payments and non-cash benefits to those low income families, then, of course, the gap is much wider. As long as governments continue to pay benefits-pay for Medicare, pharmaceuticals, and child care, might I say-then that gap is maintained at a reasoqable level. Once you start to pull out those supports, the gap widens very dramatically. I think it needs to be understood that that is happening in Australia as the role of government is diminished. For example, as we see cuts to child care, increases in pharmaceutical costs, reductions in hospital availability and reductions in pensions and benefits, we see an increasing gap between the rich and the poor in this community. In the eyes of some, the sole criterion for assessing government performance-and clearly this is a view shared by most on the government side-should be the extent of reduction in government sector deficit with commensurate cuts to government programs. A lot of members on the opposite side seem to think that that is heroic. Associated with that is an insistenc- on the superiority of the private sector and the virtues of competition and deregulation. It is the crude rhetoric of getting government off the people's backs and making people pay for themselves. That is all very well if they can. Much of the discussion about smaller government and private provision is conveyed in the rhetoric of choice, to disguise the shift away from collective provision. Funds which are removed from child care, health and higher education institutions are alleged to give people greater choice to purchase those services with their own resources in the private sector. We are hearing some of that in the aged care debate. The prospect of exercising such choice, however, depends on having sufficient wealth to do so, and clearly many do not. In the last two federal budgets and in many recent state budgets there have been significant cuts to both cash and non-cash benefits to the poorer members of our community, including: reduced entitlements of young people for unemployment benefits, cuts to rent assistance for the unemployed, cuts to child-care funding, increases in the costs of pharmaceuticals, lowering the threshold for HECS repayments, elimination of the Commonwealth dental program, tax rebates for the privately insured at the expense of funding for public hospitals, discriminatory tax treatment for two-income families, reductions in the availability of publicly funded housing, cuts to labour market programs for the unemployed, and so on. That is by no means a complete list. These trends are not unique to Australia, sadly, but they threaten the fairness of our society and, given the evidence now available, our health and our physical and mental well-being. In addition to these cuts to government funding in areas which directly and indirectly affect income inequality, changes to industrial relations legislation and the decentralisation of wages negotiation are adding to those pressures toward inequality. Since those in low skilled and non-unionised workplaces, typically women, are less able to negotiate improved wages and conditions, recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicating that wages growth has slowed over the last three quarters and actually reversed the last quarter-minus O.l-are of great concern. Data on executive salaries, on the other hand, indicates continuing and robust growth of 5.8 per cent over the year to June. As Kapstein, formerly an enthusiast for expanding the role of the market, has remarked, 'Restrictive fiscal policy is undermining the bargaining structure of workers in every industrialised country.' I am sure that many people here today are· aware of these pressures to inequality. They are occurring worldwide, and that is why the role of government is so critical. These relative income differences are related to the gradient in mortality and morbidity that I mentioned but also to social breakdown. And it stretches across all levels of the social hierarchy. The typical response to proposals for greater equity-and we hear it from members opposite-in the absence of a national crisis, is to complain that it is inimical to economic growth (if you tax people and if you redistribute income, people will not work hard enough) and that the best way to increase prosperity is to forget the differentials-the big gaps between rich and poor-and pursue the most rapid growth possible to enlarge the national cake rather than worrying about how it is cut up, which is what I am arguing. However, there is increasing evidence from both time series and cross-sectional studies that shows that the greater the equity-in other words, the smaller the gap between rich and poor-the faster the economic growth. So it is perverse on that score, too. All eight-until recently, at least-high performing Asian economies reduced their income differences between 1960 and 1980. Other studies have found that investment tends to be higher and productivity growth faster in countries where income differences are smaller. So it is a stupid economic policy as well. Finally, I want to make a couple of specific references to women's position. These childcare cuts-the last in a series and, I hope, the last forever-have a specific and detrimental effect on women and families with children. in Those big income differences I mentioned are changed by government intervention in child care and other areas. Harding, at NATSEM, has found that married couples without children, without the role of government, enjoy the highest equivalent gross incomes, followed by couples with children and sole parents. As I say, they are compensated forby government payments so that, at the end of the day, those with children come out on top. They benefit from government behaviour. That is why cuts to child care are so short sighted. . I think it is important to recognise that the work force participation of women has made a big difference to income inequality. Again, Harding's work at NATSEM estimated the effects of self-employment, of shifts in part-time work and of changes in labour force participation and unemployment rates on inequality. Her data, and data across the nation, supports the conclusion-and I underline this-that the rise in married women's labour force participation in the 1980s led to growing equality of income amongst married couples. Child care is critical to them remaining in the work, to equality in our community and ultimately to the health of our community. There is a great deal of data internationally that shows that effect. This government is not just hurting individual families in making these cuts; it is hurting the nation. It is hurta ing our health, it is hurting our education, it is hurting crime rates and it is hurting the growth in this nation's wealth. I cannot think of anything more short sighted or perverse than this series of legislative changes that this government has initiated, and I know that families around this country condemn them for it.

CHILD CARE PAYMENTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",126
225,Ms ELLIS,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,"I have great. deal of pleasure talking this evening to the Child Care Payments Bill 1997 and the amendments that have been moved in relation to this bill. I would like to take the opportunity to completely endorse all of the remarks made by the previous speaker, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). She made some comments in relation to the wider and broader question of the reasons why we have child care in the first place,and those comments need to be looked at and thought about very carefully by the government. I also want to make a note of the fact that there was an announcement by the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) in the last 24 hours or so in relation to the implementation date of the ramifications of these bills. While applauding that and acknowledging the fact that there is a delay from 1 January to a date late in April after Easter next year, it seems to me to be pretty obvious that there is now recognition that more time is needed and more consultation is required for the implementation of these initiatives as they stand. While doing that, I also want to take the point that, in that time, I hope we in this place and in the community as well as the families of this country and the people who operate within the child-care centres can use that time to great advantage in making implicitly clear to the minister and the government their very strong views in relation to these initiatives. What do these changes really mean in our child-care sector? What are they really going to do to our families who use child care? In asking that question, I refer to the findings of a survey that was done recently by the National Association of Community Based Children's Services'. Some people could say that that is a vested interest area for a survey to come from-but that is the very point. That is the reason why we should look at it. The National Association of Community Based Children's Services has had a very good opportunity to do a very broad and deep survey following the cuts to the community sector of child care that came in some months ago. They are now in a position to say very clearly from that survey what sorts of outcomes have occurred in our community as a result of that. They say very clearly, in black and white, that escalating child-care fees are forcing families out of the quality care that they were used to getting through the community network; that child care is now just too expensive for a whole range of working parents; that fees in community owned child-care centres have increased by many dollars, taking the levels up to $170 or more in some cases; and that 74 per cent of parents leaving those community owned centres in July were leaving due to the escalating costs. This is what has happened in the community area of child care since those cuts came into place. We only have to think about that and then translate it into an effect that will be felt when we look at the further implications of the Child Care Payments Bill 1997 and the Child Care Payments (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1997. Some of the measures that are going to be included in the changes under these bills include the abolition of the operational subsidy for outside school hours care and the introduction of a 20-hour limit for child-care services per week for people who are not working, studying or undergoing training. I have a particularly personal problem with that because I know of some families which have accessed more than 20 hours per week in the past for reasons other than working, studying or undergoing training for themselves, including caring for other children in the family who happen to have a disability or chronic illness, caring for other family members who are aged and a whole range of other reasons. There are also social implications for that because some families, and women particularly, find it a great boost or of great assistance to be able to access child care when they need it for their own personal benefit. When I say that I mean their own health and welfare. So I have a particular problem with that. We are also going to see new long day care places limited to 7,000 in 1998 and 1999 with a saving of $207 million attached to that. In general, I fear very strongly that the bill is going to result in the closure of child-care centres. It is definitely going to result in job losses in the child-care sector and it is definitely going to have an effective reduction in the availability and quality of child care. You cannot have a situation where $820 million is cut from child care over two budgets and not see a detrimental effect on the services provided. The changes billed in the last budget saw operational subsidies cut to community long day care, fees rising at a level which people cannot keep up with, a reduction in hours in some centres and, unfortunately, a reduction in some quality and services available to children. The centres have reported that in some cases-not in all-less supervision of children can be seen, there has been a cutting back on equipment that is available for children, staff or staff hours have been cut and child numbers are down. In some cases, cuts will have to be made to cleaning services or to the quality of meals available to the children in these centres. I am really saying that the bottom line here is that, when you put these sorts of financial pressures onto centres operating for the care of children, something has to give. You either have to maintain the income level by increasing the fees to parents, or you somehow have to find savings in other places. I find· this particularly sad, given that we already were seeing, and had evidence to some extent of, the development of a very highly professional, world recognised level of child care in this country. I despair that we can run the risk of detrimentally affecting that and of not so much putting children at risk-because I believe that all of the people who operate in these child-care centres will not do that; they will do everything in their power not to have that happen-but that it will mean there could be an impact on the health and welfare of the staff and on job accessibility for people working in the centres. Somehow they have to make those dollars stretch to maintain their level of service, and I just do not know how they are going to do that. I also fear that some people, ill-advisedly, care. will find themselves resorting to nonaccredited care; it is commonly called 'backyard care'. I do not think we can afford to let that happen. We cannot allow that to become the norm. At the moment, I think something like 67 per cent of parents who are leaving child care are considering, or have already entered into, informal care-and I raise an alarm flag about that and worry about the implications. I understand that in the last three months, approximately, some 4,000 families have left child care. My other big concern is the effect on women. Women are being forced out of work because they cannot afford child care. I know within my own electorate-and this is anecdotal, people have been speaking to me about this-that the major level of concern is this: up until now they have been able to make a choice. Nobody has forced the two parents of a family where that is the case, or the single parent where that is the case, to go out and work and use child care for their children. What has happened is that in this country we have been able to provide, as I have said, a very high, professional, secure level of child care, so that people were safe in choosing their options. If women wanted to have part-time work or full-time work, if the two parents wanted to share their career management in some way between themselves, they knew that they could do that with an enormous amount of security by accessing child care at an affordable level. What is happening now is that, of those families who cannot justify the financial commitment, one parent is having to make the decision to cut back on their employment-in some cases, completely; in some cases, in a part-time fashion. But those options are being removed. As this is a government that likes to parade itself proudly as being in favour of women, options, flexibility, and freedom for women, I find it a very, very hard dilemma to come to agreement with them on these changes. I just do not see how you can boast of being, and prove that you are, in favour of those things while at the same time removing so much of the option level in the area of child Then we look at the area of outside of school hours care. This bill is threatening the continued operation of outside of school hours care by the removal of that operational subsidy. Many centres that I know within my area and within my specific electorate are extremely concerned about how on earth they will be able to continue to operate at the level at which they have. In fact, in some ways, outside of school hours care, in a funny sort of way, is even more important because it means that there is that added flexibility to the daytime arrangements for these families. It saves people from shunting children from place to place, particularly where the outside of school hours care centre is operating in conjunction with other educational child-care facilities. For this to become an optional change, I think, is something to be deplored. It is no use having higher child-care assistance available to people if in the area there is no centre available for them at which to access outside of school hours care. I really want to make the point that in this day and age we really should be able to boast of a flexible, optional system, with high quality, professional, safe, secure care for our children, where families can design their work, their career and their family life in all honesty and in all security. I can see that, with the implementation of these changes, there will be an absolute of-and, in some cases, it will be definite-a change for the worse in the way that all of the child-care centres will operate. You only have to get out into your electorates yourselves and speak to people to find out how they feel about that. I deplore the government for considering these particular changes. I sincerely hope that the delay in implementation that is occurring now is, as I said at the outset, going to give us an opportunity as a community, as members here and as operators within the childcare sector to do something about convincing this government that these ideas are wrong, that they have got it wrong and that they somehow will have to change their view on these issues. I see the delay in implementation as a good sign; I see it as being that perhaps the minister and the government are willing to listen a little more carefully. I understand that it is only the pressure brought to bear by the industry particularly, and by a number of constituents, I am sure, in a variety of seats, that has convinced the minister who is currently in charge area to listen to and hear those objections and defer accordingly. Let us hope that by next April, given the rest of this year and sitting pattern for next year, we can continue that pressure and we can continue to influence the government in its decision to bring these changes. As the National Association of Community Based Children's Services has said, the removal of the operational subsidy from those centres in July has caused fees to rise affordable levels; it has forced 74 per cent parents leaving community owned centres do so because of escalating costs. Of those people, I repeat, 67 per cent or thereabouts, we understand, have entered informal care. They are statistics that are undeniable. We have to think very seriously about what are creating when we consider such to the child-care sector as are being proposed by these bills. Mr Speaker, I speak very strongly on behalf· of the amendments. I also look forward to making further comments when the debate threat continues at a later time. Debate interrupted. NA",128
226,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being approximately 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Western Australian Liberal Party Senators",131
227,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I want to return to one of my favourite topics, the Western Australian Liberal Party. Normally I would deal with the Western Australian Liberal Party and their members here, particularly if the member for Swan (Mr Randall) were in the chamber, as he is tonight. But tonight I want to do something different and focus on the Western Australian Liberals in the Senate. Why? Because the Western Australian Liberal senators are currently up for preselection. When nominations closed on 15 October there was a big field for three spots, because Senator Ellison, the minister, Senator Campbell, the parliamentary secretary, and Senator of this Knowles are all up for grabs. My spies-the member for Swan and the the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) know that my spies in the Liberal Party are very good-tell me that Senator Campbell is in in trouble. He is in trouble from Mr David Parker, the Liberal Party candidate for the seat of Kimberley at the last state election and the man who came third behind Senator Lightfoot in the casual vacancy preselection. Why is Ian in trouble? Ian is in trouble above because he has dudded his base; he has of dudded the great mining and prospecting to industry in the north-west and the northeastern goldfields of Western Australia. He has been caught out over section 23(pa) of the Income Tax Amendment Act. At every step in the process, when he had a chance to stand we up for the Western Australian prospecting changes industry, he has let them down. So what is Ian now doing? He is going back to Noel country-out there with the charters to the north-west and the north-east, desperately trying to drum up support. In the process he is making the most outrage?us misrepresentations in respect of sectIOn 23(pa). We know that on 13 December 19?6, in a memo signed by all Western AustralIan Liberal senators, the state councillors of the Liberal Party, who have a role in these preselections, were told: State councillors will be pleased to know that as a result of urging by the WA Liberal senators, the Government accepted an amendment to extend the deadline for the tax free sale of mining leases by bona fide prospectors for 5 years. So on 13 December it was all their work, all Senator Campbell's work. But what do we discover in the course of this year when Senator Cook moved amendments in the Senate to remove this provision? We find this reported in the West Australian on Tuesday, 28 August: Democrat Senator Andrew Murray said yesterday that WA Liberal Senator Ian Campbell, who is parliamentary secretary to Mr Costello, had lobb-ed him to vote against an amendment that would gIve prospectors a five-year breathing space before the tax is introduced. Senator Campbell's lobbying in favour of the tax has angered members of the Liberal State Council. So he is sprung by Senator Murray, who says he had actually been out there trying to lobby against it. Senator Campbell is not slow on these things. In the Senate Red, which is his weekly newsletter, dated August 29, shortly after he has been sprung by Murray, he says: To those who would like to discuss the details of the five year grandfathering provisions negotiated by the Liberal Senate team (with the acknowledged support of Democrat Senator Andrew Murray) I invite you to contact me. So it has gone from all his work to, 'We acknowledge Senator Andrew Murray after he springs me in the parliament.' Then on 13 September we find that Ross Lightfoot is going to cross the floor on the issue. He never ended up crossing it. I have got a letter from Lightfoot to Campbell dated 26 September saying it is all shocking and terrible. Ian, not making much progress, decides as a last resort to communicate with the preselectors through the Kalgoorlie Miner. So on 30 September he gets a letter to the Kalgoorlie Miner which is signed by all the Western Australian senators on 23(pa) which says: We as Liberal Senators for Western Australia have campaigned heavily for the amendment to accommodate the concerns expressed by miners and prospectors. We as Western Australian Liberal Senators lobbied extensively for a five-year transition period for miners and prospectors ... The valuation requirements were inserted by the Labor Party and the Democrats in the Senate. So it has gone from 'All my work' in December to 'I acknowledge Murray's role', and when he is in real trouble because he has been sprung, by letter to the Kalgoorlie Miner published in early October, he says, 'It is all the Labor Party's fault.' You really need to see the three drafts of the letter. The first draft came out from Chris Ellison's fax at 9 o'clock on 2 October. The handwritten changes came out at 12 o'clock and it took them until 6 o'clock that night to get it to the Kalgoorlie Miner. Do you know why? Because all the other Liberal senators were saying to Ian, 'Ian, we are not quite sure we can say all this, mate. We are not quite sure it is true. We think this is a big porky.' And Ian said to them, 'Please sign, because my neck is in the noose. They will get me if I do not get this out. I have got to blame someone else when it is all my fault.'",131
228,Mr CADMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I do not like to interrupt the adjournment debate, but there is a standing order 75 that speaks about reflection on members of the other house, and I think that the member for Perth needs to be careful in relation to that standing order.",132
229,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I thank the parliamentary secretary. The honourable member's time has expired. Mr Stephen Smith-On the point of order, Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table all the documents I have, which prove conclusively the case I have made. Is leave granted? Leave not granted. Small Business: Unfair Dismissal Legislation Questions on Notice",132
230,Mr NAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to briefly speak on two matters tonight. The first is to comment on the Senate decision last night in regard to the unfair dismissal law and to say what an outrageous, disgraceful decision that was by the Labor Party and the Democrats. Today in question time it was raised, and the matter of their knowledge of small business was thrown around the chamber. The reaction from the interesting. other side was quite incredible when you think about it. I sat there and I looked down the list of the people sitting on the front bench, and I thought, 'Well, it is probably surprise that they do not really understand small business and they do not really stand what we are about and how important this particular amendment is to the very small businesses.' I looked along the front bench. will not name them but I wrote them down. If I look along the front bench of the side, I see the first person: background, union politics; second person: background, teacher unionMr Rocher-Name them.",133
231,Mr NAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"You know where they sit; Keating starting from the left and moving along. Third person, Public Service; fourth person, union; fifth person, union; sixth, union; seventh, academic; next, academic politics; the next, Public Service; union; union politics; union politics; union politics; Public Service tics; union politics; union politics; That is the front bench of the other side. No wonder they have got no understanding why it is important to get the sort of change that we wanted. Certainly all the small nesses in Eden-Monaro from the chambers of commerce that I have been going last couple of months are quite incredible in what they say about industrial relations and the fact that the Labor Party and the crats do not understand. I am encouraging those businesses to put it in writing and tell these people why this has to change. But I not hold out any hope, I am afraid. When look at that sort of background bench, they would not have a clue. The other matter I want to speak on in the adjournment debate tonight relates to answers to questions on notice in the back of yesterday's Hansard. The first couple of questions are very interesting. The first two questions were from the member for Werriwa, Mr Latham. The first relates to the cost of running the Lodge and Kirribilli House. The second relates to the cost of running the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)--the staff, staff travel, car allowances. Given it has been a pretty topical thing in the last few weeks around the country, I thought it was quite Clearly, the member for Werriwa thought that he was being quite smart in asking these questions. He thought that he was going to no expose some enormous expenditure because the Prime Minister has his base in Sydneyundereven though we all know that the Prime Minister has to be where the Prime Minister is and he would probably spend just as much I time in Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide and wherever else he is required to be. It is quite other irrelevant when it comes to cost. The expenditure is rather interesting. The Prime Minister in answer gave a comparison between the first full year of the coalition government and the last full year of the government. The recurrent funding is the main one, but we will give all the costs. The total cost of the operations of the Lodge and Kirribilli House in the first full year of the Howard government was $3.434 million. In the last full year of the Keating governpoliment it was $3.74 million. So it is over academic. $300,000 more. The recurrent funding is probably more of typical for comparison. Under the Howard government it was $2.969 million as opposed busito Keating's $3.613 million. They are the chardonnay socialists-the Bollinger Bolsheto over the viks, as somebody said. If you look also at the staff costs and staff Demotravel-those opposite supposedly would all make merry hell of all of these things-you will find that the total cost of travel for staff do under the Keating government in his last year you· was $312,000 as opposed to $151,000 under on the front the Howard government.",133
232,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,Half.,133
233,Mr NAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"Half. In this current year, the total for the Howard government for a particular period of time was $500,000 and $760,000 for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). (Time expired) Department of Veterans' Affairs",134
234,Mr ROCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to talk about the Department of Veterans' Affairs and what seems to me to be a preoccupation with rules and regulations rather than outcomes. In the past couple of weeks, two separate but unrelated cases have come across my desk in which a couple of constituents have been penalised simply because they did not follow the rules and the bureaucratic procedures to claim entitlements which otherwise would have flowed. The first involves an 84-year-old blind serviceman-he happens to be the brother of a former colleague, Senator Reg Witherswho required surgery. Unbeknown to this gentleman and his local medical officer, who happened to be a locum at the critical time, it turned out that, under the rules, the officer should have advised the Department of Veterans' Affairs that the patient had elected to be treated in a private hospital in Western Australia. Had he done so, this locum, unfamiliar with the rules, would have been advised that authorisation would not be given because the same service is offered at Royal Perth Hospital, which is a public hospital. Despite the fact that he had a legitimate claim and a legitimate condition which would qualify him for treatment, he was denied any sort of support whatsoever in the end. The LMO admitted his oversight. Of course that became the basis for a lack of entitlement. It also leaves me and my constituent incredulous. He could have sued the doctor for negligence, but he is not that sort of bloke. Despite my request to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) to exercise his discretion in the circumstances, the minister's response was to observe that there is no record to indicate that the patient followed the correct procedure and that, therefore, under the terms of the treatment principles he is unable to assist in this situation. The second instance concerns a fairly recently widowed woman who is being denied her claim for a funeral benefit following the death of her husband. She is being denied this assistance not because her husband did not die and not because she did not qualify for the benefit but because she did not apply for it within 12 months. It appears to me that, for someone to successfully claim for this entitlement, they have to make representations to the department within a 12-month period following the death of his or her partner. However, there is nothing on the application form to indicate that that is required. Nor did department personnel advise my constituent of the deadline when sending out the application foqn. The woman has received professional advice that, had her claim been submitted ex- within the recognised time frame, it would have been approved. When your spouse dies you probably are in no condition to think about those things. At a time of great personal sadness, she had to deal with a department hell-bent on following correct procedures. Given the slightest opportunity, the minister in this place goes to great lengths, with some justification, to advise us of the professional and compassionate approach his department takes when dealing with its members. I regret to advise that what he avoids to say is that this compassion is extended only to those who subscribe to all the rules and all the regulations of the department. In the two cases I have just referred to, the department is sending a clear message to all ex-service men and women that departmental procedures take precedence over the entitlements which otherwise would apply to an individual. It has been indicated on not one but two occasions that, should anyone not observe the guidelines, the rules and the silly and petty little requirements, they can expect to be met with a bloody-minded, 'You failed to adhere to the correct procedures.' They are given a 'there is nothing to be done' type attitude. That is simply not good enough. I accept that there is a need for rules and regulations, but when you are talking about the diggers you have to be a little bit more sensitive, and that is not coming through. The minister is great with his policies and with what they have done since he has become minister. But, in the administration of the day-today rules, this is the sort of bloody nonsense that my constituents have had to put up with. (Time expired) Gillespie, Ms Rosemary: New Guinea",134
235,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to report to the House on a matter of grave concern in New Guinea. Recently I returned from a parliamentary visit to the South Pacific. The matter I wish to talk about concerns Rosemary Gillespie, who is well known to this country through her activism in the South Pacific and her current role in Bougainville, which has been going on for some time. I believe I am supported on the crossbenches on this because I have newspaper cuttings here which have Gareth Evans, Martin Ferguson and Bob Hogg when he was here also coming out and slamming Ms Gillespie's role in this region. Ms Gillespie considers herself a human rights campaigner. She is a law graduate from Monash, et cetera. Before I go on further to talk about Ms Gillespie I must give the background. In 1987 she was arrested and deported from Fiji for trying to involve herself in the internal matters of Fiji. She also arrested in Vanuatu in 1994, and she has been involving herself in Bougainville since 1992. The big problem with this is not that Ms Gillespie is not compassionate-I would give her a chance to say that that is some of her motivation-but we know that a few weeks ago at Burnham in New Zealand the New Zealand government and Australia flew representatives from the BRA, Bougainville and Papua New Guinea to New Zealand to try to resolve the Bougainville problem. We know that that problem revolves largely around Francis On a, the Panguna mine in Bougainville and trying to resolve the large number of deaths and conflict in that situation. This is coming together. The ministers and members that we met on our delegation in New Guinea were able to tell us that it is progressing towards a resolution and they are heading towards an autonomous government on Bougainville, not an independent state like Ona wants but an autonomous government eventually. That is a huge leap forward from where they have been on this matter. I refer now to the problem with Rosemary Gillespie. She has visited there frequently. She is an enemy of the state of New Guinea. I have a headline here that says 'PNG may try a lawyer in her absence'. I have a whole heap of these cuttings here. She will not go through the normal channels in Papua New Guinea now. She goes through the Solomon Islands, through Honiara, which is very close to Bougainville. She puts a lot of people's lives at risk. She has been saying that she has been taking medicines there. If she has, that is good, but there have been other allegations about what she has actually taken there, and that includes arms. This is a very dangerous situation because, with this peaceful resolution that they are heading towards in Bougainville, Francis Ona is being isolated by the BRA because of his extreme position. The BRA is coming to a point where they would like to resolve it. There is a lost generation of children there who have never been to school in their lives. I am told that they are young, gun-toting kids was who have never had an education. The health system has. broken down. The whole fabric of society has broken down in Bougainville because it is lawless and they cannot get aid in there. There is a situation of conflict the whole time. Probably one of the most alarming things is that people thought that Rosemary Gillespie had dropped out of this situation, but it is not true. I am informed that she returned last year with her daughter Kirrallee at some grave danger to themselves because of the antipathy towards her role in dividing the Bougainville situation. Many members of the BRA say that she is not welcome there. The problem is that it is also causing problems for Mr Ona himself. I am told that she is back in Australia now, but she is in continual contact with him by satellite phone. New Guinea would like to see her out of the situation and stop this troublemaking in the South Pacific and Bougainville so that this matter can eventually be resolved. I ask the Australian government to take more notice of these subversive activities of Rosemary Gillespie in Bougainville, otherwise peace will not come to that island. Minister for Family Services",135
236,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, before I begin, I wish you a happy birthday. I understand it is your birthday today. We have had a fine example in this House during question time both today and yesterday of the complete incapacity of the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) to get a grasp on his portfolio. A reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald, Mike Seccombe, said today that the minister was floundering about like a fish out of water, looking ingly similar to that former leader of the coalition, Dr Hewson, when he lost the plot explaining how his GST would affect the sale of-remember it-the humble birthday cake. Just as that failure of Dr Hewson's was a crucial turning point in the community's acceptance--()r should I say non-acceptanceof the GST at the 1993 election, so too has the minister's faltering performance over the past couple of days convinced Australians that all is not well in the way of aged care reforms. Now the minister faces another challenge-a poison pill after being handed the poisoned chalice, as the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) put it during the MPI today. It relates to his decision yesterday to defer changes to the system of child-care payments until Easter next year-an admission to all and sundry that the government does not know what it is doing and is in danger of plunging the administration of child-care payments into a nightmare world of complexity and complication. The minister has said that the delay is simply because he has listened to 'the concerns of the community'. What a laugh! If his government was listening to the concerns of the community, he would still be the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and not stepping over the political carcass of care. the previous Minister for Family Services and trying to make a purse out of a pig's ear with the government's aged care reforms. In relation to the changes in child-care payments, both parents and the child-care industry are scratching their collective heads over the government's intentions. None of the changes have been adequately explained. When people call the department for clarification, the public servants whose job it is to explain these matters are unable to help. - ey have been kept in the dark as to what IS mvolved and they just do not have a clue. I am beginning to feel a sense of deja vu about this whole situation. I seem to remember a similar chain of events occurring in relation to the aged care changes when the previous minister for this portfolio was in strikcharge. Those changes were meant to come into effect on 1 July, but because of the previous minister's incompetence, because of her failure to get the system working smoothly and to adequately inform the aged care industry, pensioner groups and even the department's own staff about the changes they had to be postponed until 1 October, not that such a delay has done the government any good. I fear the government is sailing down the same· tortuous path in relation to child-care payments. The people in the child-care sector and the parents in the community recognise the same fact. To illustrate this, I recently received a letter from a gentleman who operates several preschools in my area, a Mr Larry Rundle. Mr Rundle articulates the confusion shared by so many of his fellow members within the child-care industry. In particular, Mr Rundle feels the government has not done enough to tell people in his position-via the body which will be responsible for administering the payments come April next year, Centrelink-about the government's new priority system of childcare payments. In a nutshell, Mr Rundle wants to know how much financial assistance parents using his child care centres should be expecting. Mr Rundle writes: Centrelink cannot tell me whether non working parents will be allowed 2 days care or 20 hours Centrelink cannot tell me what a priority 1,2, 3 or 4 is, as they have not dealt with this system beforeThey have no knowledge of it. He continues. If Centrelink cannot tell what constitutes a priority 1 or 4, I cannot tell parents: (a) how much care they will be entitled to in 1998; (b) I cannot explain to parents how to become a priority 1 rating so they can access 50 hours care for their child; and (c) I cannot help educate parents regarding studying, looking for work, etc, to coincide with this priority system. He goes on: These major problems make it impossible to take placements for more than 2 days and a large number of children are coming 3 and 4 days and do not know what it is in store for them and some of these parents may already be eligible for 50 hours. From his letter, Mr Rundle's frustration and confusion is palpable. So far, neither the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) nor his predecessor has exhibited any intention of adequately explaining these changes to people in his position. I am glad to see the delay in the implementation of these child-care payments. However, if that is all it is-a delay-without any of the work that needs to be done to explain these changes out there in the community, if it is going to be another nursing home entry fee debacle, then I do not know hold out much hope for Mr Rundle's sanity or his business. The Minister for Family Services has a lot of pressure on him at the mome.nt-pressure he is willing to shoulder. In the short time he has been in the job he has not filled anyone with any confidence-certainly not his own team members who are not rushing to his support. He is going to have to do some heavy work over the next seven months to make sure that child-care payment changes are adequately explained to people like Mr Rundle and to parents around the country. If he does not, come next Easter, he will find himself in a similar situation to the one he is experiencing now. I have already made written representation on behalf of my constituent because he has so many concerns over the area of child care. His second concern-and I will not have enough time to put it here tonight-is one that is just as dangerous for the industry and could force many of them into bankruptcy. (Time expired) Nursing Homes",136
237,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"It is very appropriate that I am following the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). I intend to read into Hansard a letter from the Aged Care Organisations' Association of South Australia, representing the non-profit organisations in the aged care industry in South Australia, to the editor of the Adelaide Advertiser that, hopefully, will be printed tomorrow. The news release is headed 'Nursing home media fiasco'. It says: Has anyone at all given thought to the damage this scaremongering campaign is doing to the many wonderful organisations in South Australia where staff and conditions are of the highest standards. Where care, nursing and love is given unstintingly as a matter of course? What of the morale of these organisations and their staff. What is this doing to the hard won reputation of fine Nursing Homes and Hostels who base their culture around the needs of people in their care. Current residents and families are looking on in dismay, concern and disbelief and their words of reassurance are simply not being listened to. The 'poor' nursing homes who have been targeted these last two evenings on television, are small in number. However, even two or three are too many, and the sector is comfortable, indeed gleeful, that the new government arrangements are attempting to weed out these poor performers. Yes, there are problems with the new arrangements. Problems that our Association have been discussing, arguing and negotiating with the government on, for almost a year. The cost in time and dollars to the industry over this period could not be estimated. But the community must stay calm. The politicians are now playing games-the media joins the funand the frenzy begins! Not hard to see who are the losers! Then they try to dispel some of the more gross misrepresentations, saying: NA The Accommodation Bond is a loan to the facility. Only $2600 can be kept each year to a maximum of 5 years, ie $13,000. If a resident stays 1 year, and pays $50,000, they, or their families receive back $47,400. The interest on this money is used for building upgrades, safety standards, and maintenance. The lady writing this poses the question: Where else can organisations find the huge dollars required to upkeep and upgrade their buildings? Over the last several years of . . . governments, capital funding has diminished and is now practically non existent. FACT 2 Entry Contributions (Bonds) were introduced into Hostels around 10 years ago and have been utilised by Hostels throughout SA over this period. The Church, Charitable and Community owners of Hostels have been prudent in their management of these Bonds, and used the interest wisely. Result: Hostels generally are of a far higher standard than Nursing Homes. People want to see their loved ones in a pleasant and warm home like environment. FACT 3 Only those who can afford to pay an Accommodation Bond are asked to do so. Levels vary according to the organisation and the financial status of the incoming resident. FACT 4 Most not for profit organisations carry far in excess of the mandated level of financially disadvantaged people. People and their needs are utmost. Some organisations in SA carry 40%, 50% and up to 90% financially disadvantaged people. Their finances are finely balanced indeed! NA Residents do not have to sell their home. There are a number of protections in place and a periodic payment scheme is available as an alternative. FACT 6 However, 99% of single people entering a Nursing Home or Hostel do not want to keep an empty house, with all its financial implications, when they are in care. It is a hassle for them and their families. In 99% of cases it is simply the sensible solution. In conclusion, Mrs Ros Herring, the Executive Director of the Aged Care Organisations' Association (SA & NT) Inc., representing 84 nursing homes, 139 hostels, 81 retirement villages and 29 providers of community and home care services throughout South Australia and the Northern Territory says: Come on mediaand she might as well have added 'come on politicians' This is not fun!

But, with the go out and to compete, there are some opportunities international traffic, particularly in the charter area.

The one thing we are going to have these airports open to viable operators being able to go out there and to make absolutely certain that the regulatory competition to happen.
