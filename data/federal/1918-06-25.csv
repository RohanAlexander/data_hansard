3,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I know nothing of the matter, but I intimated to the House some time ago that the Censor's Department could not in future give answers regarding the fate of particular communications,' because to do so would open too wide a door.

5,Mr TTTDOR,Unknown,"Is it correct, as stated in the newspapers, that the Commonwealth publio servants i u Victoria will i u be deprived this year of the Show Day holiday which they have enjoyed since Federation wasinaugurated? If _ so, what is the reason for this deprivation?Is it uot a fact that the enjoyment of this holiday has been considered in the varia ous awards that have-been made in the Court affecting our public",21
6,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Having , by courtesy of the honourable member, received notice of his intention to ask. the question, I have been able to ascertain the facts of the case. Some time ago the Government considered whether the holidays of the public servants of Australia could not be put on a uniform footing. Hitherto State arrangements have largely dictated the holidays enjoyed by our public servants. The Cabinet approved of the introduction of a Bill to authorize the granting to the Commonwealth Public Service of twelve holidays in the year, eight of them being those named in the Public Service Act, section 72, sub-section 1, the four others to be chosen by the Acting Public Service Commissioner. Those four holidays have been chosen, and Show Day is not one of them, although Cup Day is. The Commissioner was about to give effect to the decision of the Cabinet, but when I heard of the matter, I said that until the law affecting the Public Service had been amended the existing arrangements should be observed.",22

11,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,I am tired of doing that. There are hundreds of such cases.,22

[230]- 2 SOLDIERS' DEPENDANTS' AND RENT:  last night's Melbourne Herald, under the heading "" Publicity Brings Stories from Soldiers' Dependants,"" in which there was the following:A case that came forward today is that of a widow who has had two sons killed in the war. Her house is one of a terrace, and every other house has had repairs made inside except that which she occupies. For eighteen years she has paid her rent regularly, and at the beginning of the war it was 14s. Other houses have been raised to 16s. This house has now been sold, and the new landlord demands 19s. 6d. a week. When a demur was made, the tenant was asked if she would take a lump sum to go out. The lump sum was to be the amount of removal expenses. The present landlord is said to be a prominent worker for the Red Cross. I need not say any more, because I know that I have the sympathy of all the members of the House, including the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt), when I urge that something should be done to pre' ' vent action of this kind, which, more than anything else, is interfering with recruiting.",22
13,Mr WATT,Unknown,"It is, perhaps, only natural that the honourable member's feelings are so strong that he should have forgotten to ask a question.

Particularly, in the case of daily-papers, it is stated, that they are generally out of date, .and therefore useless on arrival. "" It was decided by the Army Administration to enlist the aid of the Australian Comforts Fund and the Red Cross Society, and these bodies have for some time past been working in close co-operation wjth them, with a view to the bulk supply of Australian newspapers. The Minister is informed that they are.now sending forward large quantities of all weeklies to every unit of the A.I.F., including hospitals, and contributions of such papers would be welcomed by the patriotic bodies mentioned. "" It should further be explained that,, apart from the special consideration which is thus being shown 'to the natural desire of Aussoldiers to obtain their own newspapers, printed in their own country, the Army Adminhave made arrangements for the supply of various publications of interest. For example, the Anzao Bulletin, containing news specially cabled from Australia, and the a weekly issue of inregarding Australians. and Australian affairs generally, are being distributed widely to the Australian troops. As is well these papers contain copious extracts of matters of interest from papers in all the States. An organization known as the ' Camps Library' also supplies books and magazines to all Australian units. "" At the same time, if it is desired to send any particular news item to an individual soldier, this can, of course, be effected by making a cutting or extract from the newspaper and it by letter post, a course which, it may be remarked, will insure speedier delivery to the soldier.""

It will thus be seen that the arrangement entered into provides for the return of the men on the termination of their leave, and the Commonwealth Government, while yielding to none in recognition of the services these men have rendered, regret that they cannot, because of the terms of such arrangement, encourage any proposal for their wholesale discharge from the Army. At present, owing to the shortage of reinforcements, favourable consideration of individual applications for discharge is necessarily confined to cases possessing unusual features of financial and domestic hardship. principle will he maintained.

84,Mr WISE,TREATMENT OF VENEREA L,"On Friday last the honourable member for - South Sydney (Mr .

At the latter establishment there is an efficient and trained staff of sailmakcrs, and it is more in the interests of the Department to keep this staff together than to take on a large number of casual employees. In addition, it is not an easy matter to obtain sailmakers experienced in tentage repair, and the work was of an urgent nature in view of the approach of the Citizen Force training.

The prosperity 12,943,901 of Australia is remarkable, and at least we should arrange for the future that the . . 23,710,662 current expenses of the Australian armies shall be met by Australian money. That is the basis upon which the Estamates for ""this year have been framed, and there is reason to believe that the British Government will agree to f u n d the arrears of £38,345,000. The Estimates of Expenditure out of Revenue include a sum of £3,430,000 for payment to the British Government of interest for two years, from 1st July, 1917, to 30th June, 1919, upon the outstanding amount due. Hitherto no in terest has been paid to the British Government upon such balance The Seventh War Loan. The people are at present being asked to subscribe to the seventh war loan the sum of £40,000,000. When floating the sixth war loan, the Government announced that no more tax-free issues would be placed Before the public. The - present loan accordingly has been made subject to Commonwealth taxation, but owing chiefly to constitutional difficulty the loan is to be free of State income tax. It would no doubt be possible"" for the Commonwealth and States to agree that the loan issues of each shall be subject to the taxation of both, but arrangements have not proceeded so far as that. There are some dangers in permitting' a State"" to tax a loan of the Commonwealth, and it would probably be necessary to provide that the State should not tax interest on Commonwealth loans at a greater rate thai, the tax upon incomes of similar amounts from other sources. In any ' case, no action could safely be taken until reciprocal legislation had been passed by all the States and the Commonwealth. The freedom from both Commonwealth and State taxation was a great attraction to large investors, and in that respect the seventh war loan is at a disadvantage compared with its predecessors. Notwithstanding the disability the Government hoipes that the people will make very large voluntary subscriptions as on the last occasion. . Compulsory subscriptions if War Loans not fully taken up voluntarily. formation is in the possession pf the Treasury showing that there are many persons who have not subscribed to war loans or who have not subscribed as much as might reasonably be expected of them, and the Government has considered whether the burden of finding money to carry on the war shall be borne only by those whose sense of public duty or self-interest moves them to do so. It is clear that the immense sums required cannot; be proMT. Watt. vided by a section of the communitylarge as that section may be. The money must be found, and the help of all the people is required. The Government has, therefore, decided to introduce legislation requiring all persons to subscribe to war loans in proportion to their means. I have reason to believe that such a measure will meet with the approbation of the chief financial institutions of Australia. While relying, as in the past, upon the patriotic spirit of the people to furnish the major portion of our loan supplies voluntarily, it has been determined that in so far as subscriptions to any war loan fal l short of the amount required, resort must be made to compulsion. The neighbouring Dominion of New Zealand has passed legislation in this direction, which has had a stimulating effect on recent loan operations. The measure to be submitted will provide a penalty of twice the. annual average of income tax paid during the past three years upon those citizens who do not voluntarily contribute. The enforcement of the penalty, however, will not absolve the person subjected to it from the obligation to subscribe the amount demanded. The Bill will apply to the seventh war loan at present in course of flotation. A Board of Appeal will be created with power to exempt an appellant either wholly or in part. The Government is convinced that when the equity and necessity for such a measure are full y appreciated by the people it will meet with general support. Loans to the States. In August, 1918, the Commonwealth raised in London for the States (except New South Wales) a loan of £4,750,000 at 5.J per cent., the currency being 1922-1927. The price of issue was £ 9 9 10s The following is a summary of amounts loaned by or through the Commonwealth to the States for public works: Out Of Notes Pund (repayable be- £ tween 1919 and 1926) ..."" 2,634,000 InOut of Notes Fund (repayable five years after the war, but not later than 1925) .. .. 18,000,000 Borrowed by the Commonwealth for the States (except - New - South Wales) in LondonTo be repaid in 1920-1922 .. 4,000,000 To be repaid in 1922-1927, including loan raised in August, 1918 .. .. 12,750,000 Total for State public works . . f37,384,000 Advances for silos1917-18 .. ..

Total loaned or to be loaned to States up to 30th June, 1919 £40,937,109 There is still due to ' the States a balance of £410,000 which the Commonwealth undertook to raise for 1918. At the Conference held with the State Treasurers in July last it was agreed that the Commonwealth shall find loan moneys for the calendar year 1919 amounting to £2,580,000 for the public works of the States, except New South Wales. How the additional money for the States is to be found has not yet been decided, but an undertaking has been given to the British Government that during the war no further application will be made in London by the Commonwealth on behalf of the five States for moneys other than renewal loans. Co-ordination of Australian public borrowing. One of the objects of Federation was to secure better control of public loans, but no solution of the difficulties has yet been arrived at, notwithstanding numerous conferences and much discussion. Though the exigencies, of the war have brought the Commonwealth and the States into closer connection than they were before, the result is still far from what is desirable. The position is that(1) The Commonwealth is raising huge war loans. (2) The Commonwealth is raising money overseas-for five out of six States, but these States are themselves borrowing locally. (3) The conversion loans of the States, both in Australia and in London, are arranged by the State Governments. (4) The New South Wales Government raises its own loans in London as well as in Australia for all its requirements. (5) Municipalities and like bodies borrow separately. £ Under these conditions clashing in 33,109 evitably results, and will become more 1,500,000 noticeable as time goes on. During the next ten years something 20,000 like £390,000;000 of Australian loans 1,500,000 will have to be redeemed, being about £200,000,000 of State loans and £190,000^000 of war loans. Practically ' 500,000 the whole of this immense sum must be provided for by renewal flotations. Moreover, additional sums will be required for war, for repatriation, and for State public works. It will be seen that a herculean financial task is ahead. The rehabilitation of the world's suspended industries and the restoration of devastated provinces will absorb much r money when peace comes, and the finances of the nations will probably be in such a condition that there will be little opportunity for Australia to get new loans overseas for years to come. Australian loan requirements must therefore depend more than hitherto upon Australian resources. The Government has taken into consideration the difficulties of the present, and the immediate future, and has proposed to the State Governments that they 'should give to the Commonwealth full control of all .State and local government borrowing for the three years ending 3 Ist December, 1921. If this proposal is agreed to, conversion' operations overseas will be undertaken by the Commonwealth Government. The business ih Australia will also be conducted by the Commonwealth after conference with the State or States in terested. Transactions with the Savings ' Banks will be left to the States to deal with, but market operations will be managed by - the Commonwealth. I believe that the Commonwealth will be able to secure better terms than any State, but the chief and immediate advantage of placing all loans under one .management will lie in the avoidance of embarrassment and loss which must result from the jostling of seven competitive borrowers in so critical a period. The Commonwealth alone can co-ordinate control of the loan business, and make arrangements which will be satisfactory to all interests. These are the arguments which have been put before the States, and the Goernment is now awaiting their replies. P u b l i c D e b t of the Common w e a l t h .

Owing to the control and sale by the Governmeut of important .primary products, financial operations never before undertaken by a Government Department in Australia have to be managed by the Treasury. Without such an arrangement it is clear that these huge operations could not have been successfully undertaken by the producers. In the year 1917-18 it was necessary to arrange finance for £26,750,000 on account of wheat: £45,000,000 on account of wool; and £5,000,000 in respect of other primary products- a total of £76,750,000 After conferences with the banks it was agreed that they should carry a wheat overdraft at 5 per cent, per annum, and that they should bring to Australia money received by them in London in respect of wool, skins, wheat, rabbits, and butter. This was subject to the following conditions : 1. The Treasurer to advance in Australia up to £24,000,000 in Australian notes to the banks, if required, the shares of the several banks in the £24,000,00,0 to be based upon . the average deposits for the quarter ended 30th September, 1917. % 2. An y bank getting an« advance to furnish security by depositing 1 an equivalent amount in the Bank of England. 3. The interest earned by the deposit with the Bank of England to belong to the Commonwealth. 4. An y bank receiving an advance to have the right at any time to repay the amount in Australia, and the Commonwealth Treasurer simultaneously to return to the bank a corresponding amount in London. 5. In respect of wool and skins, the banks to pay out £99 15s. in Australia for every £100 received by them in London, but money received by them for other primary products to be transferred to Australia at par. All these transactions to be on telegraphic basis. 6. Advances by the Commonwealth to the banks not repaid in Australia by 31st December, 1918, and overdrafts granted by the banks in respect of wheat, but not then cleared off, to be subject to review and mutual arrangement as to their continuance or repayment; the banks to have the right in A p r i l , 1918, to reopen questions involved in this clause so far as they relate to overdraft on wheat. 7. The Treasurer to guarantee repayment of wheat overdrafts. The banks recently asked for an in crease of the rate payable on the wheat overdraft, but the Treasurer found him self unable to accede to the request. r The overdraft at present stands at £13,471,000. It was found that the banks did not require advances of the full amount of £24,000,000, the actual advances never exceeding £7,192,000. This amount has now been reduced to £1,729,000. The Treasury, in August, 1918, approached the banks with a request that they should transfer to Australia the wool money which will be payable in'Londo n for the clip of the season now begun. Theamount is estimated 'at about £50,000,000. Most of the banks have agreed to take their shares, and the Treasury is still in correspondence with the others. An y amount not taken by the banks will be .financed by the Treasury. The conditions of advances by the Treasury to the banks are similar to those of 1917-18, but the aggregate must not exceed £20,000,000. Shortly it will be necessary to determine how the wheat crop of 1918-19 is to be financed. Wool. On behalf of Australian wool growers, the Government has sold the Commonwealth wool clips for the period during the currency of the war and one full wool year commencing on the 1st July after the termination of hostilities.",34
89,Mr HIGGS,TREATMENT OF VENEREA L,How is that done under the Constitution!,38
90,Mr WATT,TREATMENT OF VENEREA L,"It is done under the powers conferred by the War Precautions Act, as are so many other far-reaching things. That question opens up a great number pf points that are of vital consequence, not only to us in this House, but also to the people with whose interests we are dealing. There are some phases of the War Precautions Regulations to which objection is taken, of course; but I do believe that the - business side of the War Precautions Act, and the Regulations made under it , will be unanimouslv approved by all parties in the House. It may be necessary, for purposes of that kind, to go further than the present Act allows in order to* safeguard these huge transactions. As new worded,' the Act operates only for the period of the war and six months thereafter. That, however, is a matter about which the Government will have something to say to the House at the proper time. The flat rate of Is. 3£d. per lb. for greasy wool is continued, but the rate for handling charges has been raised from f d . to | d . per lb. Such prices are final as regards wool for British Government purposes. Tn relation to wool sold for other purposes, wool-growers are to receive half of any excess which may be obtained over the basic price. Some time will elapse before the amount of the final dividend (if any) for 1916-17 can be determined. For the season 1917-18 the sum of £42,662,215 13s. 7d. has been paid to wool-growers. Appraisements for the season 1918-19 have commenced, and it is estimated that, before the end of the present calendar year, approximately 800,000 bales, valued at about £20,000,000, will be appraised and paid for, subject to the retention of 10 per cent. Probably the major portion of the balance of the clip, about 1,250,000 bales (of an approximate value of £29,500,000), will be appraised, and payment made for same, before the end of May. The total value of this year's wool is estimated at £49,500,000. An appraisement will take place towards the end of June next in all centres to clean up all odd parcels of wool and to close the 1918-19 wool season. The sum of £125,179, representing licence-fee payments by the Wool Tops Manufacturing Companies, has been credited to the Commonwealth Government Wool Tops Manufacturers' Account. A matter for congratulation is that the British Government has seen fit to arrange for these gigantic purchases, which guarantee stability to the important, pastoral industry during this time of crisis. Afr. Watt It is also fortunate that the Wool Committee, who have laboured so incessantly at this unpaid war service, have so efficiently and smoothly discharged their onerous responsibilities.

Prospects of sale. The Prime Minismiddle ter is at the present moment endeavouring to effect a satisfactory sale of the unsold balance of the 1916-17 and the 1917-18 wheat. His difficulties are aggravated by the fact that the price Imperial Government has such large stocks still in Australia, with little pect of early shipment. That Governchases ment apparently is not anxious to buy, and, from a commercial stand-point, this is natural. Growers, therefore, cannot look forward to a high price such as that suggested by some critics. Guarantees. In these circumstances, the guarantee for the coming season, which the Commonwealth Government has given in conjunction with the State Governments concerned, is of great value to wheat-growers, and, to the same extentauthorities that it is of value to growers, it prove to he a burden on the taxpayer.",38
91,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF VENEREA L,"Hear , hear! How much is it?",40
92,Mr WATT,TREATMENT OF VENEREA L,"It amounts to 4s. 4d. per bushel, less certain expenses. Construction of silos for wheat storage. The Commonwealth Wheat Storage Act 1917 provided for advances of £2,850,000 to States for silo construction. tory progress has been made in the State of New South Wales. The work in course, in that State' provides for tion. upwards of 19,000,000 bushels of wheat, and silos have already been completed in several country districts. In July, 1918, tenders were invited for the construction of certain country silos in Victoria, but no tender was accepted, The State Government is giving further attention to the subject.. In Western Aus£84,377,000 tralia a Silo Bill was rejected hy the Legislative Council, but it is understood that the Bill is to be re-submitted. Plans for the work have been prepared in anticipation of parliamentary approval. 10,996,000 South Australia has not yet expressed its intention of taking advantage of the CommonAvealth Wheat Storage Act. Purchase of cornsacks. A consideration of the circumstances of the jute trade £84,377,000 induced the Government to purchase our cornsack requirements for the coming seahave son ; 60,000,000 cornsacks have heen bought on contract at a cost of £2,400,000. The first shipments have been landed in Australia, and it is anticipated that by the of October 150,000 bales will have arrived. The price for these sacks to 1 the usual distributors .'is 9s. 8d. per dozen ci.f. The wholesale price has been fixed at 10s. Id . per dozen, and the maximum to the users 10s. 6d. per dozen, plus railway freight actually incurred from prosport of landing.

Taking the present price ruling, namely, 14s. I i i . per dozen c.i.f., the Government's transaction shows a saving of about £6 10s. per bale. This is equivalent to a saving of over £1,250,000 on the total quantity. Metals. The exportable output of zinc concentrates has been sold to the Imperial, for the period of the war and may ten years afterwards. This sale covers 300,000 tons of concentrates annually 1",40
93,Mr HIGGS,TREATMENT OF VENEREA L,Another matter affecting the Constitution.,40

96,Mr WATT,TREATMENT OF VENEREA L,We are taking risks in our endeavour to stableize the produc,40
97,Mr HIGGS,TREATMENT OF VENEREA L,That is all right as long as the producers are protected.,41
98,Mr WATT,TREATMENT OF VENEREA L,"They are parties to this contract. Our production of lead amounts to about 175,000 tons per annum, and the exportable output has been sold to the British Ministry of, Munitions, with the exception of lead for the markets of the East. The surplus output of copper has also beeu sold u n t i l the end of this year to the British Ministry of Munitions. The value of the output per annum is approximately £5,000,000. An embargo has been placed on. the exportation of t in ores and concentrates, aud in future all locally-produced t in ore and concentrates will be smelted in Australia. The formation of a Tin Producers' Association has been approved, which will protect the interests of all producers. Local requirements will be provided for. The Association will remain under British control, and the Commonwealth Government will be represented on the Board of Directors. The Australian output of wolfram, scheelite, and molybdenite has been acquired for the Imperial authorities, and it is gratifying that the production of these necessary ores has increased almost 100 per cent, compared with 1914. Considerable sums of money are being expended on - up-to-date plants for the treatment and purification of these minerals. Newcastle is becoming the centre of much activity in the production of iron and steel and manufactures thereof. On the whole, the base-metal industry of Australia is in a prosperous condition. So vital is the supply of iron and steel to' the Commonwealth, that the Government has taken an option of purchase over the' Blythe River leases, situated near Burnie, on the. North-west Coast of Tasmania. W it h the production of refined metals in the Commonwealth, subsidiary industries are being developed, such as the manufacture of plate and sheet i r o n ; wire; white and red lead; zinc pigments; and sheet zinc. Bluestone is being produced, and white arsenic production is steadily increasing"". The fabrication of arsenical compounds is important to the pastoral industry for sheep and cattle dips, also to orchardists for spraying compounds. The production of antimony has not advanced as it should have done, and plants for the treatment of auriferous antimonial ores must be installed in the near future. The production of. bismuth is well established, and there is every prospect that within the next year there will be ample capacity for the treatment of all bismuth concentrates recovered in Australia. Sugar. An agreement has been entered into with the Queensland Government . under which the entire crop of sugar in Queensland has been acquired for the seasons 1918 and 1919 by the Queensland Government, on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, at £|21 per ton of raw sugar of 94 nett titre. The price to the public will remain as at present. The agreement continues all existing condi tions, and gives some assurance to this important primary industry. The carry over of sugar from last year amounted to approximately 50,000 tons of refined sugar, which exceeds the normal season's surplus. Cyclones and bad winter conditions will mean shorter production, and it is expected that this surplus will be absorbed during the current year. Jam. For the 1917-18 season, the Commonwealth succeeded' in obtaining orders from the Imperial War Office for 12,000,000 lbs. of Australian jam, and from the Government of the United States for 38,000,000 lbs. Orders for 3,500,000 lbs. of jam .were also secured from the"" Indian Government. The price was fixed at 5s. 3d. per dozen lbs. f.o.b. A further order, totalling 22,000,000 lbs., has been received from the Imperial authorities, and is being allotted to manufacturers. These quantities were distributed amongst jam manufacturers in all States. For the purposes of the contracts, in 1917-18 arrangements were made to supply contractors with sugar at the reduced price of £ 2 4 per ton. The total quantity allotted at this price amounted to approximately 14,500 tons. As the ordinary price of sugar is £ 2 7 7s. 6d. per ton, it will be seen that its supply at the lower rate represents a substantial concession to manufacturers. Leather. For the purpose of regulating the supplies and prices of leather used in manufacture of military and civilian boots and shoes, a Commonwealth Leather Industries Board was constituted under the War Precautions Begulations in May, 1917. The Board's activities were at first mainly directed towards the regulation of prices charged hy tanners for the.various leathers used in the manufacture of ordinary boots and shoes. A complete schedule of prices for these leathers has ""been fixed. For the just enforcement of these .prices on the tanners, it was necessary to fix the price of hides, and a schedule of prices has heen determined which preserves the formerly existing relative values of hides and leathers. In order toconserve supplies, the export of both hides and leather has been prohibited, - permits to ship abroad being granted when the Department is assured that local requirements are fully met. In 1915, at the request of the Indian Government, the Commonwealth undertook the purchase and shipment to India of leather required by that Government. The first shipment was made in December, 1915. Since that date the value of leather shipped to India is £114,283 14s. 2d. A new order for 600,000 lbs., representing a value of approximately £70,000, has just heen given to suppliers, but no portion of the order has yet been shipped. In order to arrange for the export of surplus leather to the TJnited Kingdom the Government is endeavouring to secure the modification of a rule, established by the Imperial authorities, that preference in shipment is to be given to hides instead of leather. The Government appreciates the disabilities under which the leather manufacturers are labouring, and advices recently received from the Prime Minister indicate a prospect of early relief. Butter. During 1917-18 the total quantity of butter stored by the Federal Butter Committee of Australia for shipment to the TJnited Kingdom in connection with the Imperial contract for butter was 1,232,802 cases, the value being £4,488,621. For the 1918 Winter Butter Pool 35,460 boxes were placed in store for local consumption, the value of which was £129.800. . The total quantity of butter handled during. 1917-18 was 1,268,262 cases, valued at £4,618,421. Negotiations, which are not yet concluded, have been entered into for the sale to the Imperial Government of surplus butter and cheese during the year ending 30th June, 1919. The Prime Minister is doing his utmost to conclude the sale in London, and it is hoped that negotiations will be finalized shortly. All arrangements have been decided upon, contingent on the sale being made, to form and conduct a pool, the control of which it is intended to hand over to the producers? representatives under regulations which they will operate subject to the veto of the responsible Minister. During the period for which the Pool Committee is elected they will control the whole of Australia's output, except that of Western . Axistralia, and will make arfree rangements for winter provision. All the profits will he distributed amongst the producers. Board of Trade. A Board of Trade, consisting of three Ministers and two outside business men, has been created, the functions of which are:. 1. To investigate and report upon matters referred to it by the Minister. 2. Generally to consider and advise the Government upon matters affecting the trade and industry of the Commonwealth. Already the deliberations of this body have proved of the utmost value, and the' Government is hopeful that, as its work develops, its increasing usefulness will he generally recognised by the producing and mercantile community. Bureau of Commerce and Industry. There has been created a Bureau of Commerce and Industry whose functions are to organize commerce and industry throughout the Commonwealth. A Director has been appointed, and steps have been taken to invite the co-operation of those engaged in the great primary and secondary industries of the nation. The Government feels that this Bureau should be.free from political control, so that producers, manufacturers, and traders may be encouraged to voluntarily unite in preparatory organization for the important period of reconstruction that will follow the war. Institute of Science and Industry. Provision has been made in the Estimates for the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry, the Directorate of which will supersede the present Advisory Council. The Institute, which was formerly under the control of the Prinie Minister's Department, has been transferred to the Department of Trade and Customs.

The auxiliary schooners are each to have a dead-weight capacity of 2,300 tons. They will be propelled by two sets of engines of semi-diesel pattern, estimated to drive the vessels at about 7 knots. The barquentines will have a dead-weight capacity of 2,600 tons. The engines will be similar to those to be installed in the schooners. Each of the steel ships, it is estimated, will cost, complete, about £160,000, making a total expenditure for the present programme of £3,840,000. The wooden vessels complete are estimated to cost on the average about £64,000 each; the amount involved is therefore £1,536,000.

Of the fifteen steamers origiVictoria. nally purchased in 1916, it is regretted that two have been lost by enemy action, namely, the Australdaleon the 19th October, 1917, and the Australbush on the 13th November, 1917. In to attempt to cope with large amount of cargo offering for shipment, and which was urgently required for war purposes by Great Britain and the Allies, the Government purchased the sailing vessels John Murray, Speedway, and the hulk Shandon. The John Murray left Australia at the end of last year with a full cargo of wheat for the United States of America, but on her return voyage she was totally wrecked on Maiden Island on the 22nd May. The management of eighteen ex-enemy vessels was taken' over from the Navy Department by the Commonwealth Government Line during the early part of this year. Two of these vessels also have been sunk by the enemy. Contracts have been entered into with American shipbuilding firms for the construction of four wooden motor vessels and ten wooden steamers. All the motor vessels, namely, the Gethana, Gulburra, Gooleha, and Ghallamba have. been launched, and the first-the Gethanaarrived in Sydney recently with a cargo of steel plates, paper, and lumber. The second-the Gulburra-is now on the loading berth at an American port, and is expected to leave almost immediately for Australia. Of the ten steamers, the Bellata, Bundarra, Birriwa, Berringa, and Bethanga have been launched, and every effort is being made to expedite the' completion of the contract. It is at present intended that these vessels shall be employed in the Pacific trade, and carry wheat to America, returning with general cargo. Exclusive of the vessels building in Australia, the Commonwealth of Australia at an early date will have a fleet of forty-five cargo vessels, which, at such a time as this, must be considered satisfactory. Oversea Shipping. The scarcity of tonnage arising out of the heavy demand for transport in the Northern Hemisphere, and the destruction of ocean craft by enemy submarines, developed so many problems affecting the disposal of Australian products that it was thought desirable to place the whole overseas shipping business under the control of an impartial and capable authority. Consequently the Commonwealth Shipping Board was formed ih February, 1917. Under the direction of the Board, the Overseas Central Committee, with subcommittees at each of the principal ports, order attends to the loading of all overseas the steamers. The sub-committees send reports and recommendations as to space requirements and distribution to the Central Committee, which, 'in its turn , reports to the Commonwealth. Shipping Board.. In this way, equitable treatment of shippers and the most economic and effective use of space are secured. How essential it has become to make the utmost use of space available is illustrated by a comparison of the overseas shipping inwards and outwards before the War and at the present time. During the year' ending December, 1913, 2,014 ships amounting to 5,371,531 tons entered, and 1,971 vessels of 5,230,417 tons cleared at Australian ports. In the twelve months ending 30th June last, only 1,078. vessels of a total tonnage of 2,488,920 tons entered, and 1,117 of 2,614,656 tons cleared. This represents a reduction of inward and outward tonnage of over 50 per cent. Besides the actual losses, large numbers of vessels which in normal times served Australian requirements, have been diverted to other work. Inter-State and Coastal Shipping. The coastal shipping has also been greatly depleted by the transfer of Inter-State vessels to service overseas. No less than fifty-three of such vessels, with an aggregate tonnage of 195,617, have been taken off the coast. In addition, sixteen ships of an aggregate tonnage of 77,017, which in normal times served Australian coastal requirements, have been removed to other work, leaving their former services to be performed by the remaining fleet. The position in the coastal and Inter-State trade, as a consequence, became so acute that it was deemed advisable to appoint a Central Committee to regulate and secure the most economic use of the space available, the whole of the shipping business thus beingbrought under the administration of the Controller of Shipping. Despite the surrounding difficulties, the result of this arrangement has proved in the highest degree beneficial. Regulation of Capital Issues. The issue of capital by companies became subject to Treasury control under the Wa r Precautions Regulations in January, 1916. S'nce then, 821 mining applications have been received, and consent has been given to a capitalization of £9,394,000. Manufacturing and producing"" applications numbering 2,194 have been received, aud consent has been given to capitalization of £30,099,000. The other applications received number 1,332, in respect of which authority has been given to a capital of £20,092,000. The total applications have been 4,347, and the total capital authorized has been £59,585,000. The figures include capital of reconstructed businesses and moneys required to pay off maturing debentures and other liabilities, as well as new projects The mining purposes are chiefly coal, gold, molybdenite, t in , and wolfram. The capital permitted tion to manufacture and production (£30,099,000) includes- Companies concerned in agricultural, horticultural, and pastoral in dustries ... ... £7,115,000 Foodstuffs, manufacture of ... ... ... I r o n and steel works and smelting and treatment ' of metals ... ... Gas and electric light ... Plantations, chiefly in South Seas ... ... - Engineering and ""metal-. working of all kinds ...

Drugs and chemicals Distillation ... ... Shipbu'lding ... ... Glass bottle manufacture Other manufacturing and producing industries ... Total ... £30,099,000 The capital issues approved for purposes other thau mining, manufacturing, and producing were mainly for financial and trading undertakings. In the administration of the regulations' every effort is made to avoid placing unnecessary restrictions on raising for production, manufacture, ' and extension of Australian trade. Mr Watt. The expenditure of money on amusement businesses has been made subject to Treasury consent. The practice is to refuse permission for the erection of buildings for amusement purposes in localities where the public is now catered for. The effect is to prohibit the investment of capital in new amusement ventures. Expenditure required to effect necessary repairs to existing structures is usually allowed. Speaking generally, I believe that, although some sections of the commercial world may have chafed under the restrictions, the ' regulations have been amply justified in this time of war. in - rela- Repatriation. The Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act of 1917 was proclaimed in A p r i l , 1918. The Department then took over the activities of the State W a r Councils. When the Department assumed control, 49,150 men had been discharged, and an accumulation of claims had to be 4,163,000 met. During the months A p r i l to July, 13,927 men were discharged, and the Department has not only dealt with this 4,156,000 current work, but has cleared off the 1,781,000 prior accumulations. Th© first function of the repatriation 404,000 authorities was to provide employment for the large number of men who had 1,560,000 been discharged. For the neriod from 670,000 the 8th A p r i l to the 31st July, 16,469 applications were received, and 12,001 932,000 men were placed in employment. The number of men out of employment on 858,000 the 31st July was 2,719. On the other 764,000 hand, the - Department had 3,278 positions offering, but in most cases suitable 723,000 applicants were not available. 436,000 The applications for general assistance 372,000 during the same period numbered 30,972, 368,000 of which 23,649 were approved. The ex328,000 penditure for .this period was £182,081 , 204,000 for 25,855 cases, which includes matters . 96,000 approved by the State War Councils, but which had not been completed at 5,169,000 the date the Department assumed control. In the period from August, 1917, to June, 1913, 3,365 applications fbr land settlement were confirmed, 1,618 men being allotted blocks. These figures do not include the number settled by the Queensland Government, as that State at present stands outside the agreement with the Commonwealth. capital Hostels . for the permanently and totally incapacitated have been provided in Sydney and Melbourne, and similar provision in the other States will follow. Provision made for the current financial year is as follows: Repatriation generally, in cluding administrative expenses ... .... 1,000,000 Advances to States for land settlement ... 1,500,000 ancl southern boundaries. Advances to States for forestry operations to absorb returned men ... National work-shops, community settlements, hostels, vocational training establishments ... ... Total 3,230,00 War Pensions. War pensions force at 30th June, 1918, numbered scarcity of shipping. 110,602, including about 6,000 pensions which are being paid in London. actual London figures at 30th June are not yet available. The increase in the number of pensions in the twelve months is 65,411. The expenditure in 1917-18 was £2,772,210, an increase £1,622,968 over the previous year'. A further increase of £2,227,790 is exwaterfalls, pected this financial year. Provision accordingly made for £5,000,000. average fortnightly rates of pension granted to date are £ 1 16s. 6d. in case of incapacitated soldiers £ 1 Is. 2d. in the case of dependants. Northern Territory. The establishterests ment of freezing works at a cost of £700,000 has greatly stimulated the deare known to exist. velopment of the pastoral industry of the Territory. In the first season, about 19,000 head of cattle were treated at the works, of which 85 per cent, were ""Natives Taxes Ordinance."" ""freezers."" The second season at meat works has just finished. It proved shorter than usual, due to the late start, but otherwise was satisfactory. The war and lack of capital has hampered the mining industry. Several mines which have been subsidized by the Goof vernment are being developed, and are depth is a very hopeful sign. giving promise of encouraging .returns. The wolfram deposits at Hatches Creek, in the Frew River district, have over £40,000 worth of wolfram in the last two years, in spite of the fact transport 'difficulties are very great. The demand for pastoral land in the Territory has been greater during past year than at any time since it was acquired by the Commonwealth. high prices of stock have probably accounted for this demand, but have in cidentally increased the difficulty of secur£ ing breeders for new country. The portion of the Territory adjacent to Queens- ' land has been occupied more quickly than_ other parts, but settlement is also spreading towards the centre from the northern Large areas of country in all parts of the Territory previously held under annual tenure have 500,000 during the past year been converted into pastoral _ leases' of forty-two years' duration, with conditions as to improvements and stocking.

A. scheme for utilizing portions of the farming areas for repatriation purposes is now being prepared. The current expenditure of the Federal Capital Territory has now been so far reduced that the revenue is almost equal to the expenditure. Railways. Trans-Australian The two ends of the Trans-Australian railway were linked up on the 17th October, 1917, and the first train carrying passengers was run through from Port Augusta on the 22nd October, 1917. The traffic has largely exceeded expectations; three through passenger trains are now run each way per week. sengers must book well ahead to secure accommodation, and their numbers are steadily increasing. The live-stock traffic is growing. construction of the Tailway will enable 'large tracts of pastoral lands to be developed which otherwise would have remained undeveloped. The goods traffic is also increasing. Consignments of perishables are transported from the Eastern States to K a l goorlie and Perth. The loss in working the line for the eight months ending 30th June, 1918, amounted to £57,428. It is estimated that working expenses will exceed the revenue by £44,000 in 1918-19. Provision has been made in the current year's Estimates for £300,000 to provide for additional rolling-stock, water supplies, ballasting, and other construction expenses. Oodnadatta Line.' The Oodnadatta Railway is worked by the State of South Australia for and oh behalf of the Commonwealth. During the year just closed the loss to the Commonwealth in the working of this railway was approximately £37,000. That loss has to be provided for in this year's Estimates. The loss on the previous year's working was £43,640.",46

Under existing legislation, the Comhas apmonwealth is required to maintain the train service and the same rates and fares as were in operation when the line was The administration taken over in 1911. It is hoped that arrangements will be made with the State - of South Australia for rates .and freights to be increased at an early date. Darwin to Katherine River. The extension of the Northern Territory Railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River (54 miles) was completed during the last financial year. In the 1917 season, 18,869 cattle were Line. trucked for Vesteys, Darwin, and for the 1918 season 28,795. A greater number would have been trucked during the latter season but for industrial troubles, just prior to commencement, between Vesteys and a section of their employees. It is anticipated that at least 40,000 cattle will be carried next year. Pas- During the financial year just closed the loss in . working expenses over revenue amounted to £21,126. The working expenses of this line have The been carefully considered by the Com-' monwealth Railways Commissioner, and it is probable that the railway will during the ""present financial year-for the first time since taken over by the Commonwealth-pa y working expenses, and return a sum of £5,000 tb the Treasury towards interest. Provision of £15,000 is made for the Northern Territory Railway, of which £7,000 is required toward the completion of the railway from Darwin to Pine Creek, and £8,000 for additional rolling-stock and certain other works entailed by the development of the traffic. Cordite Factory. During the past twelve months the Cordite Factory has been able to meet all orders in regard to the output of small arm and big gun cordite and fulminate of mercury. Provision is made on"" the Estimates for a sum to meet extensions of plant in connection with the manufacture of fulminate of mercury and detonators, and a further sum for other extensions. Money will also be required to complete the Acetate of Lime Factory at Bulimba, Queensland. The works will be in working order this month. The establishment of this adjunct enterprise means that shut Australia will no longer be dependent upon outside sources for acetone- a raw material used in ' the manufacture of cordite. Provision is also being made for the erection and installation of a plant for the purpose of manufacturing tri-nitrotolu.ene. This Factory is near completion, and - it is expected will be in operation early next year. Aviation. Hitherto the work at the Central Flying School at Point Cook has been limited to elementary instruction, but it has now been decided to establish a new course' which will produce pilots completely trained and ready for service abroad. Proposals have been worked out for the creation of air services for Australia on a more extensive scale than was contemplated before the war. The necessary expenditure will be large. The scheme in volves the creation of a force of which the personnel will in normal times be citizens. They will be trained during suitable periods by a smaller number of permanent instructors. It is obvious that at this critical period it is not advisable to publish details of the works to be undertaken. The planes, engines, and materials for their construction will be produced within the Commonwealth. Amalgamation of Federal and State Taxation Offices. This proposal has been the subject of much discussion at recent Conferences between the Treasurers of the Commonwealth and the States. The scheme of handing over the collection of the direct Federal taxes to the States was not acceptable to the Government, for reasons which I have explained to the House. In July of this year, I offered the States to collect their income taxes for one-third of the present cost. This offer was not accepted. W it h a view to simplifying the labours of taxpayers, the Taxation officers of the respective Governments were requested to collaborate in the preparation of a uniform schedule for Federal and State purposes, hut reported their inability to do so, in the face of the differences in the existing Income Tax Acts. In all the circumstances, I believe that the proper course is for the States to pass laws based upon the Officers' D r a f t Bill , or the new Commonwealth Act, and to transfer the collection to the Commonwealth. If the States demur at this proposition because of a fear that their claim upon the money involved would be prejudiced, the Federal Parliament should be prepared to give them suitable statutory guarantees. Revenue and Expenditure, 1918-19. Let us now turn to the Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure for the present year (1918-19):£ The revenue for this year, not including proceeds . of additional taxation proposed, Is estimated at 35,314,500 which is a reduction on the actual receipts for last year of . . . . £1,488,468 Adding the balance brought forward from previous year .. . . 3,905,091 there will be available a total of . . 39,219,591 The expenditure for 1918-19 is estimated at . . 45,344,595 so that we are faced with a gap of . . . . £6,125,004 the bridging of which I shall deal with in a few moments. Comparison of Revenue. In comparing the Estimates of Revenue for 1918-19 with the. actual receipts 1917-18, the f o l lowing differences are found:Customs and Excise shows a decrease of .. . - . £1,176,295 land tax shows a decrease of 123,778 Succession duties shows a decrease of 193,232 Shipping shows a decrease of 584,986 Repayment of advance for purchase of cloth shows a decrease of 550,000 Entertainments tax shows a decrease of 40,890 Miscellaneous receipts shows a decrease of 462,499 Other items'shows a decrease of . . 45,768 Post Office shows an increase of .. £214,278 War-time proflts shows an increase of 1,119,992 Interest recovered from States shows 323,710 an increase of Total decreases .. £3;176,448 Deduct increases £1,687,980 Net decreases £1,488,468 I propose to explain later the causes of the decreases and increases in Customs and Excise, Land, War-time Profits, and Entertainments taxes. W it h respect to the other decreases and increases, I may say(1) Succession duties are obvipusly liable to large differences in annual yield. (2) The decrease in shipping revenue is apparent and not real. A Trust Account has now been established for the enemy vesvels which have been handed over by the Navy to the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers. The receipts of those vessels are credited to the Trust Account, and only the balance of receipts over expenditure is carried into the Revenue Account. The total Shipping Receipts included in the Revenue for 1917-18 are . . £3,039,986 Deduct Expenditure .. Net Revenue-1917-1 8 . . £2,045,466 The total estimated Shipping Receipts included .in the Revenue for 1918-19 are Deduct'Expenditure of vessels still under Navy control Net Revenue-1918-1 9 . . £2,180,000 It will be seen that, instead of a decrease, there actually will he an increased Net Revenue, estimated at £134,534. (3.) In 1916-17, an advance was made out - of revenue for the purchase of cloth for the Expeditionary Eorces. The amount was repaid out of ""War Loan in 1917-18, and the item does not recur this year. (4) The Post Office increase is acJ counted for by increased business of all kinds. (5) Miscellaneous receipts and other items are subject to fluctuations, as they include many non-recurring items.",47
103,Mr BOYD,TREATMENT OF VENEREA L,"Shal l we be responsible to the German owners of those ships for the repayment of .earnings after the war? - Mr Watt - I do not propose to open the question of international law on the point; that would involve, perhaps, as long a statement as that I am now making. I would prefer to ask the honourable - member, as a fearless layman, to discuss the matter himself; because the lawyers in the House do not seem inclined to do so. Estimates of Expenditure from Revenue, 1918-19, compared with 1917-18. It often happens that, in considering the Budget proposals of the Government, a comparison is made between the "" actual"" expenditure of the previous year and the "" estimate "" for the current year. This is misleading, because the invariable experience is that large sums provided on the Estimates remain unexpended at the end of the year. That is strikingly exemplified in the accounts of 1917-18, for which the estimated expenditure was £37,283,832, but the actual expenditure was £34,975,304, the amount expended 994,520 being £2,308,528 less than the Estimate. The Estimate of Expenditure for 1917-' 18, as already stated, was £37,283,832, whereas the Estimate for 1918-19 is £45,344,595, representing an increase of £8,060,763. This increase is made up as follows:£2,455,000 Decrease. Increase. Commonwealth expenditure other than war .. .. .. £471,988 War expenditure out of revenue . . Payments to States .. .. .. .. £8,010,251 ' 125,000 275,000 Interest paid for States . . .. .. 397,500 Total Increases . . .. .. £8,532,751 Deduct Decrease . . ' .. .. 471,988 Total Increase, as stated above .. £8,000,763 It will be noticed that the Commonwealth expenditure, apart from war, is estimated at £471,988 less than the esti1 mate for last year. The following is an explanation of this decrease:Increases. Decreases.

In the Department of Defence,the increase is caused by the additional training which it is proposed to give to the Citizen Forces during this financial year. A payment in relation to increased cost of seamen's wages under Arbitration Court award explains most of the increase in the Prime Minister's Department. Four Deputy Public Service inspectors are shown for the first time on the Estimates of the Department. As they previously appeared in another section of % the Estimates no increase of cost is involved. There is larger expenditure in the High Commissioner's Office, due to war work. In the Navy Department considerable increases have been caused by revision of the pay of the sea-going Forces by additions to the numbers of those Forces, and by more numerous Citizen Forces. The decrease in the Department of Trade and. Customs is due to the fact that £200,000 was provided on the Estimates, 1917-18, for remission of duty on cornsacks. This is a non-recurring item. It has heen possible to reduce the nonwar expenditure of 1918-19, as compared with the estimate for 1917-18, by £471,988, notwithstanding the fact that large inevitable and automatic increases of expenditure have to be provided for. These may be set out as follows:Invalid and old-age pensions £95,000 Apple and shale oil bounties 29,250 Interest' on Treasury billsworks, &c. .. .. Payments to States . . 125,000 Interest on transferred properties .. Universal training-militar y and naval .. . . 296,689 Collecting direct taxation . . Automatic increments to permanent officers under Arbitration Court awards, &c. 81,704 Sundry increases . . .. - Had it been possible to avoid these increases', the reduction in the Estimates for .the coming year, instead of being .£471,988, would have heen £1,394,550. Reductions in Estimates of Expenditure. I may mention that after the Estimates of expenditure were finally revised by the Departments, they were reduced as follows:Estimates in chief . . ' £1,045,004 New works payable out of revenue .. .. New works payable out of loan .. .. Total reductions £2,297,979 War Expenditure included in Ordinary Estimates. It must be remembered that almost all the Departments, are performing work due to the war, and this is reflected in the expenditure. The following gives some indication of the nature of these services:Prime Minister: - War despatches, cables and correspondence, sale of Australian products, shipbuilding and shipping, audit, war work in the High Commissioner'sofiice. Treasury - Taxation , war pensions, war loans. Attorney-General - Wa r Precautions Regulations, investigations, and prosecutions, enemy contracts and patents, metals, legal war problems. Home and Territories - Passport s and related matters.

Works and Railways - Buildin g and other work for Expeditionary Forces and repatriation. Defence and Navy - Wa r work carried 77,660 out by administrative branches. These services are estimated to cost £300,000 per annum; but it has not 93,521 hitherto heen considered practicable to remove them from the ordinary Estimates to the section carrying war expenditure. 75,561 In comparing our expenditure in the pre-war and war periods, honourable members . should, of course, take this, important phase into account. 48,177 .

War Expenditure out of Loan and Revenue. I have already shown the total under 'this head up to 30th June, 1918, and the estimated total up to' the end of 1918-19 may now be summarized as follows :Up to .Tune, 1918 - ou t of Revenue £24,702,159 1918-19-ou t of Revenue .. Up to Juno, 1918, out of War Loan . . £159,895,038 1918-19-ou t of War Loan .. Total War Expenditure estimated to June, 1919 WaT-time ProfitsTax. Returns were lodged in 1917-18 by businesses which had made over £1,000 profit in the war-time accounting period. There were 6,401"" returns. . Of these 1,083 showed excess profits when compared with the pre-war standard. 'The 'tax assessed to these businesses amounted to £1,064,857, of which there was collected up to 30th June last the sum of £680,008. The average tax per taxpaying business was £983. The number of new businesses was 173, and these were called upon to pay £94,573 in tax, or an average tax per new business of £546. The old businesses which were assessed numbered .910, and their taxes aggregated £970,284. per old business was £1,0 Mr Watt. The Government has carefully studied the general incidence and effect of this impost, and has decided that it 'would not be justified in recommending it3 aboli* tion. Its effect, however, upon new businesses is too severe. An ' amending Bill £78,064 will, therefore, he introduced to give re.. .. £175,000 lief to ithem, and thus remove the existing 25,183 discouragement of new enterprises. Con- cessions are also proposed in relation to .. 117,376 58,728 tin mining, and in certain other direc454,951 tions shown by experience to be necessary. In 1917-18 the tax was 50 per cent. For £620,500 1918-19 it has already 'been fixed at 75 322,500 per cent. The revenue, including arrears 229,500 of the previous year, is estimated for 220,000 133,725 1918-19 at £1,800,000.

I now come to the question of new taxation. As already stated the revenue of 1918-19 at existing rates is likely to be £6,125,004 less than the expenditure. To bridge this gap it is proposed to obtain in 1918-19 the following estimated additional revenue: From Customs and Excise £1,985,000 „ Income tax ... 2,200,000 „ Land tax. ... 380,000 ,, Entertainments, tax 275,000 ,, Postage war tax ... 516,000 21,129,602 £45,831,761 Total taxation 5,356,000 78,014,809 Add amount to be trans- 800,000 238,809,847 ferred from London funds £284,641;608 6,156,000 The gap is 6,125,004 So that there is an estimated surplus in 1918-19 of ... ... £30,996 I shall now deal with these subjects in dueorder. Customs and Excise Revenue. The Customs and Excise revenue in 1917-18 was £13,225,295, and, not taking into account the revenue which will result from the new taxation, - would yield in 1918-19 the estimated amount of £12,050,000, a falling off of £1,175,295. The £12,050,000 shows a very serious decline compared with 1915-16, when the The average tax revenue reached £16,934,103. This represents, a reduction of £4,884,103. In last financial year certain luxury strictions took effect. They operated for lows:only a part of the year, hut they will influence the revenue' for the whole of 1918-19. Shipping is being gradually reduced, and restrictions are heing placed by Allied Countries upon exports. For these reasons there will inevitably be an forced shrinkage in the importations spirits, motor cars, musical instruments, paper, jewellery, fancy goods, agriculcannot tural products, and many other commoat dities. On the other hand, our bonds contain large quantities of spirits and tobacco, and the Australian spirit and tobacco, ining dustries are in a flourishing condition. Were it not for these facts the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth during"" 1918-19 would be very - much less than has been estimated, and in this conthe nexion it may be pointed out that lants and tobacco, at present rates duty, are estimated to provide well over 50 per cent, of the total Customs and Excise revenue. The proposals for the new duties, which will be levied wholly oh stimulants and tobacco, will be introduced to the House by the Honourable the Minister for Trade and Customs on the conclusion of the Budget Speech. Including the £1,985,000 estimated to be received from the additheir tional duties, the total revenue frpm stimulants and tobacco is estimated for 1918-19 at £8,337,050, which represents 59 per cent, of the total estimated Customs and Excise revenue of £14,035,000. Income Tax. It is proposed that the rates of income tax collected for last year shall be increased by 30 per cent. The additional yield is estimated £2,200,000. The flat rate on companies will be raised to 2s. 6d. in the £ 1 . estimate of the revenue at the old rates £7,400,000 for 1918-19, so that the total now expected from income tax this year is £9,600,000. Land Tax. In 1913-14, 17,823 perdisputed sons paid Federal land tax, and in 1914Government 15 the number rose to 18,264. The taxgate payers in 1916-17 numbered about 17,000. cidence. - During the seven years ended 30th June, 1917, there was a considerable duction of the taxable field owing to sales, and the total unimproved value the lands which for that reason ceased [231] rebe subject to. Federal land tax is as foi-; Town lands £15,087,000 Country lands .... 36,350,000 Total ... ... £51,437,000 In 1914-15, the rate of tax was increased by making the progression rise at enl/18750th of one penny, instead of at of l/30000th of a penny, as before. The additional tax collected by this alteration be exactly stated, but is estimated 30 per cent. The increases from 6d. to 9d. in the flat rates on all values exceeding £75,000 in the case of residents, and from 7d. to lOd. on values exceed£80,000 in the case of absentees, were50 per cent, and 42.85 per cent, respectively. J?he tax assessed in 1914-15 was £2,347,000. Since that year sales have operated to decrease the revenue, tax to be finally assessed for 1917-18 stimubeing estimated at £1,900,000. Comof paratively few sales have been made by the larger land-owners. This is probably due to the exceptional prices obtainable for primary products. Some taxpayers have not been deterred by the tax from purchasing additional land, and taxpaying absentees also appear as purchasers. In 1915-16 and 1916-17, 4,065 residents of Australia, who already paid land tax, purchased additional land, while sixtythree taxpaying absentees also increased holdings. The total value of the land purchased by these 4,128 persons is £6,210,000, the average purchase being £1,504. The latest complete statistics (for 1914-15) show that ownership pf taxable land was distributed as follows: 14,363 residents owned land of the unimproved value of £200,490,000 3,511 absentees owned land of the unat , improved value of £4,345,000. The unimproved value of lessees' estates The in Crown leasehold lands was assessed in is 1914 at £12,240,000. This value will be greatly increased for succeeding yeara when the additional lands dealt with are included.. The basis ^of the valuation is by the Crown lessees, and the proposes to carefully investithe matter to avoid any unjust inThe actual collections of land tax in 1917-18 amounted to £2,123,778, and the reestimate for 1918-19 is £2,000,000, not - including the yield from increased taxa-. of tion. The Government proposes that the to land tax be - increased by 20 percent. Tbis being expected' to yield about £380,000, the total revenue in 1918-19 is estimated at £2,380,000. Entertainments Tax - This tax is charged on persons who pay more than 6d. for admission to entertainments. Certain proprietors who, - when the tax was introduced, decided to maintain their former prices unaltered, and to pay thei tax themselves, were compelled by pressure from competitors to collect the tax from the publio. In the six months ended June, .1917. the taxable entertainments numbered 67,799. Doubling these figures for twelve months we have the following position: Taxable entertainments in 191617 Taxable entertainments in 1917-18 ... ... 159,609 Increase ... ... 24,011 At present rates of tax, the revenue estimated for 1918-19 at £205,000. This shows a falling off of £40,890 compared with £245,890 received in 1917-18. The decrease is explained by the curtailment of horse-racing and boxing. The Government proposes to impose a tax of one penny on 3d. and 6d. admissions to entertainments. Admissions at these prices are at present free of tax. The extra yield for 1918-19 is estimated at £275,000, bringing the estimate of total revenue up to £480,000. Postage War Tax. The proposal for a postage war tax is that there shall bean increase of | d . on letter-cards, postcards, newspapers, and packets. yield for 1918-19 is estimated at £516,000. - Transfer from London Funds. In last financial year the Treasurer included in his Estimates of Revenue a sum of £825,355 which he proposed to transfer from London funds. The money was not required, as the actual revenue exceeded expectations. £800,000 from these funds has been included - as part of the money to fill the gap I have referred to. The London funds were accumulated by transferring amounts from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to a Trust Account in anticipation of the supply of goods, &c -, in Britain. Large quantities of the goods for which provision was thus made have not been supplied, and are not likely to be shipped for months, and, perhaps, years. The moneys are therefore Jfr. Watt. available for transfer back to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Taking into consideration the fact that We are now in the fifth year of war, Australia is to be congratulated on the generally healthy condition of its finance, production, trade, and manufacture. This is, of course, partly due to recent good seasons and to the expenditure of considerable sums of loan money. The resulting stimulus would not, however, have operated with such tonic effect if we had not been able to dispose of our staple products. The purchases, of wool, wheat, metals, butter, and other primary commodities by the Mother Country, even when we could not deliver the goods, have contributed in the most visible and noteworthy way to the maintenance of 135,598 our stability and prosperity. I wonder whether our people fully appreciate the . potent influence) of Britain's wisdom and ""generosity in every phase of our national well-being. It is is devoutly to be hoped that this aid and ' liberality may be continued until oversea oommerce resumes its normal flow. If not, our material situation will swiftly and surely become very serious. I sound this note after mature deliberation, for I am deeply impressed with Australia's dependence, not only alone for. safety, but also for material progress, upon our Home-land and Empire. There are obvious difficulties which mav prevent an indefinite repetition of this paternal magnanimity. If these embarrassments in- ° tensify, then the people may have to accommodate themselves to a measure of discipline from which they have happily The been free throughout the whole period of the war. The war prospect is brighter today than it has been since the fateful month of August, 1914. The Allies have arrested and rolled back the Western German offensive, and in the assumption of the initiative' have inflicted heavy punishment on the enemy. In Macedonia, encouraging movements are also in progress. The magnificent victory in ' Palestine should fill every Australian heart with pride and thankfulness and with an unalterable resolve to stand firm until the end. Thus only can this nation prove itself worthy of its blood and"" heritage, and worthy of the 50,000 brave men who have laid down their lives that we may be safe and free.

It is proposed to increase the rates on imported ale, beer, and stout by 3d. per gallon. This increase will be accompanied - by an increase on Australian beer. Ale and beer are at present prohibited imports, but 30 per cent, of the 1916-17 importations of stout is permitted. Imported Spirits. The most important item is spirits, on which an import duty of 25s. per gallon is proposed.

Sd. 3s. l i d . an increase of 5s. per gallon. Although this rate may appear high, it is pointed out that the British Government recently doubled the rate on spirits, the British duty at present being approximately 30s. per proof gallon. The higher duty on spirits necessitates consequential amendment in Tariff items 4, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 24. Australian Spirits. The. Excise rates on Australian spirits have been increased, and have the effect of generally reducing the margin in favour of the locally-made article, and, in two items, of abolishing it altogether. Under present conditions, the difficulties attending importation, such as partial prohibition of imported spirits, the shortage of shipping space and the consequently greatly increased charges' freight, have been of considerable advanvision tage to the local distillers. On the other Tariff hand, the increased cost of production of Australian spirits has been trifling. 'These considerations justify, in the revenue, a reduction in the margin of protection hitherto enjoyed by the local industry. The increase of 35s. per proof gallon spirits, n.e.i., has been imposed with view of preventing the use of inferior spirit for human consumption. An unmaintained. desirable practice has grown up of blendcut ing, after clearance from bond, of spirit not distilled in accordance with the resame quirements of Excise Tariff items 1 to 6 with spirit distilled under those items for potable purposes. The inferior.spirit against can be purchased at a nominal price only, and the rate has heen increased to add to its cost, and thus discourage its use potable spirit. This will not affect delivery of spirit for industrial purposes, as manufacturers can obtain delivery security as to its use at the potable spirit covered by Excise Tariff items 1, 3, 5, and 6. A duty of 6s. per proof gallon is proposed on spirit used in fortifying wine. The present rate is 8d. per proof gallon. In view of the increased. duties proposed on all forms of stimulants, cluding imported wines, a duty on spirit used in fortifying wine may reasonably be imposed in .the interests of revenue. A further effect will be that spirit will more sparingly used in fortifying wine with consequent advantage both to the quality of the wine made and to the health of the consumer. The duty is equivalent approximately to a duty of about 6d. per gallon on the wine. Imported Wines. Higher duties are proposed on imported sparkling and wines. These are in conformity with general increases on stimulants. Tobacco, &c. The import duties on 2arisen tobacco have been increased by 8d. per lb. A new heading applying to tobacco cut fine, suitable for the cigarettes, has been inserted in Item 22, the rate being the same as that oncigarettes, viz.: 10s. 6d. per lb. if United Kingdom origin, and lis. per lb. otherwise. The object of this amendment is to defeat the practice of using cigarette Tariffs. tobacco in the illicit manufacture of cigarettes for sale, thus escaping the Mr Jensen. for Excise duty on cigarettes. A similar prohas been inserted in the' Excise An - advance of Is. and 2s. per lb. respectively has been made in the duties on interests of cigars and cigarettes. - Australian Tobacco. The Excise rates on Australian tobacco have been increased by 8d. per lb. on hand-made strand, plug, on and cut tobaccoes. The margin of prothe tection in favour of local tobacco as against the imported article has been ' A new item, viz.: Tobacco fine suitable for the manufacture of cigarettes, has been inserted with the rate as that on hand-made cigarettes, viz., 6s. 3d. per lb., the object being, as already stated, to protect the revenue the practice of using cut tobacco in the illicit manufacture of cigarettes. The rates on cigars have been increased as a by Is. on hand-made,"" and Is. 6d. on the machine-made; while ah advance of 2s. per lb., corresponding to a similar adon vance in the imported rate, has been same rate as made on cigarettes. Excise Beer."" In consequence of - the prohibition of the importation of beer, the trade of the Commonwealth has been placed in the hands of the local brewers, who now have »o outside competition. The Excise duty on ale, porter, and , other beer has been, advanced from 7d. into Is. per gallon, and the distinction in rate between beer brewed from malt and hops only and that brewed, from other materials has been eliminated.

107,Unknown,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"Sitting suspended from 6.18 to 7.1/.5 p.m. MINISTERIAL STATEMENT. Debate resumed from 20th September (vide page '6286), on motion by Mr'. WATTThat the paper he printed. Mr MAHONY . (D all e of the first ideas which entered my mind after seeing the statement read by the \j Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) last week was that this is a Government of statements and not a Government of - deeds.",60
108,Mr BRENNAN,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"A Government of statements, not of statesmen.",60
109,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"That hits off the present Ministry exactly. During the lifetime of the present Parliament, I have listened to something over a dozen statements made on. behalf of the present Govern-, ment, but I have failed to discover that it and the party in power have ever gone beyond the making of those statements. Let us hope, in regard to this last statement, that - Ministers at length realise their responsibilities to the country, and will tackle seriously the big problems which confront Australia today. The statement now before us commences with expressions of hope and confidence in the military ments of the. Allies- a hope that we all share. We desire that we may obtain an honourable and just conclusion! to the great struggle now proceeding. But although the statement eulogizes the brave deeds of our boys at the Front, Ministers are content with mere words; they do not go further. All honour has been paid i h spoken and printed words to the brave young Australians who have risked their all for us, but little of a practical character has been done by this Government to recompense them for . their sacrifices. One .of the greatest troubles in this community today is the high cost of living, which affects the dependants of our - soldiers. According to the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr Knibbs, the food and groceries that a householder bought in 1911 for £ 1 would now cost"" £ 1 l is . in Sydney and £ 1 9s.. 7d. in Melbourne. - * That shows the extent to which the purchasing power of the sovereign has decreased; and I ask, when Ministers are paying eulogy to our soldiers, what are you going to do to rectify this reduction in the purchasing power of their money % The paltry 6s. per day which wte fixed as the pay of our soldiers on the outbreak of war does not purchase nearly as much . now as it did then, and it would be better for them if , instead of speaking and printing Words in praise of their brave deeds, we increased their pay to an amount whose purchasing power would be y ) [7.45] - On e at least as great as that of the rate fixed at the outbreak of the war.",60
110,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CUSTOMS DUTIES,Would it not be better if we made an attempt to relieve them?,60
111,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"A good deal is being done to that end, but the best way to relieve the distress among their dependants, their wives and children, is to increase their pay to an amount whose purchasing power will be equal to that of the rate of pay fixed at the beginning of the war - If the recruits numbered twice what they are today, that would - not increase the purchasing power of money. We ought either .to give our soldierssufficient money to enable them and their dependants to purchase .those . things that are necessary for a decent degree of comfort, or we should compel the exploiters, those who by means of combines are controlling and increasing the prioes of foodstuffs, to - provide the com- munity with goods at a reasonable cost. achieve- The Government' are doing neither of these things.",60
112,Mr CORSER,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"At the present time, things are cheaper, in Australia than in any other part of the world. Mr . MAHONY - E v e n the toys that Father Christmas brings to the children have increased in price by from 30 per cent, to 40 per cent. Honourable gentlemen opposite do not like to hear these statements. It does, not suit those on the other side to listen to the request that the soldiers' should get a fair deal, and that the exploiters should be prevented from robbing the dependants of the soldiers. They get uneasy when they hear statements such as I am now making. We must pay our soldiers at least 10s. per day to give them anything like a livin g wage. In support of that contention, I remind honourable members of the report of the Board of Trade appointed by the Holman Government in New South ""Wales. It consisted: of a representative of the. employers and a representative of the employees, with His Honour Mr Justice Heydon as chairman. Having gone carefully into the whole question of the cost of. living, it delivered it as its opinion that £3 per week is the minimum wage that any man' in Australia should receive. That opinion was published only a few weeks ago, and in the face of it the Government should pay our soldiers at least 10s. per day, and increase the separation allowances accordingly. If this be not done, and the war goes on for another year or more, the purchasing power of money will be further reduced. When men and women cannot buy what they need, they are in a very bad way. With shame must it be said that the wives and children of our soldiers are compelled to depend on the generosity of goodhearted private citizens for a decent living. Instead of compelling them to depend on private charity, the Government should come down with taxation proposals which would make those who have the money contribute enough to give a decent living to the soldiers who are risking their lives and shedding their blood in defence ""of the wealth of the country. .",60
113,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"Well , the Government are putting a tax of 33 per cent, on the tickets bought by children to go to picture shows.",61
114,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"Yes ; that is so. Th© Sydney Daily Telegraph is not a newspaper that can be accused, of having Labour leanings. On the contrary, it is very much opposed to Labour. Yet this is an extraet from an issue of that newspaper published - in May lastAfter paying excess profit duties, the ings of the White Star Shipping Company during the past year amounted to over £1,500,000 sterling. This enabled it to pay a! dividend of 20 per cent.",61
115,Mr JOWETT,CUSTOMS DUTIES,You surely do not blame like to know. this Government for that.,61
116,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"I blame all the Goare vernments. I refer to the profits of the White Star Company as typical of what is being made by many other companies all over the world, including Australia. Let me draw - attention to another mentioned in the Sydney Sun in an issue of July lastManly Perries - Half-vear' s profits, £14,116 14s. lid. "" The Manly Ferries Company is a New South Wales company.",61
117,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CUSTOMS DUTIES,What is its capital?,61
118,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"What is the capital of our soldiers and their dependants? Their capital is their lives, which they are risking and often sacrificing in defence of l i e country, although we pay ithem a mere paltry 6s. per day. For anything more, they are 'dependent on the charity of some local committee of bighearted men and women, whose help may increase their incomes to a sustenance wage. It is a shame .that the Government allows this to occur in Australia. Whenever any honourable member on this side of the House raises his voice"" on behalf of the soldiers or their dependants, honourable members opposite .indulge in sneering remarks, and say, in effect, "" Hands off the sacred profits of the exploiter. Don't touch the profits. It does not matter about the soldiers or their dependants."" Whenever we ask for a living wage for the soldiers,. we are laughed at by honourable members behind the Government.",61
119,Mr JOWETT,CUSTOMS DUTIES,No .,61
120,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"I can tell honourable members, however, that the day will come, and come quickly, too, when the people will make them laugh on the other side of their mouths on this question. Mr RICHARD FosTER -^-The day is coming when the soldiers will make you do that.",61
121,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,The honourable member will find where the soldiers .will be. Let mejcome now to another part of the Ministerial statement. We are told that earnthe Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy are still in Great Britain.,61
122,Mr RILEY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,What are they doing there ?,61
123,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,That is what I would,61
124,Mr GROOM,CUSTOMS DUTIES,-Do you mean to say you so ignorant as not to know that?,61
125,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,I say that the people of this country would like to know what they are really doing in England.,61
126,Mr JOWETT,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"They were invited by case the Imperial Government. Ministenal [25 SEPTEMBER, 1918.]",61
127,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"I want to know, without any humbugging or side-stepping, what tlieir mission really is, because we read in the papers the other day that some unkind scribe had suggested that they were engaged in some physical occupation such as "" jawing "" the people; and we read, also, something about a carpet weighing a ton being placed in their office. Is this country to be called upon to pay for this sort of thing?",62
128,Mr BOYD,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"Where did you get that "" yarn "" from ?",62
129,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"Fro m the press which ""barracks"" for the honourable member and his friends opposite-the Argus and the Age-and therefore I must accept it as being true. Another matter mentioned in the statement is the proposed amendment of the Standing Orders.",62
130,Mr GROOM,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"The honourable member cannot discuss that, because it is down on the business-paper.",62
131,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"I would remind the honourable member that the Speaker is quite capable of maintaining order in this House without his assistance; and I have no doubt that, if I transgress the Standing Orders, the Speaker will inform me.",62
132,Mr GROOM,CUSTOMS DUTIES,But I want to save you from your transgressions.,62
133,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"I wanted to know why there was any need for any amendment of the Standing Orders; but when I perused the statement further, I saw - that the Government proposed an amendment of theelectoral laws, providing for preferential voting for the House of Representatives, an amendment of the maternity allowance, as well as the re-introduction of postal voting.",62
134,Mr BOYD,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"Hear , hear!",62
135,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"I well remember, not many months ago, how a certain little gentleman waved his arms about in this House, and told us that this was a non-party Government, and that not one stone in the temple of Labour would be displaced during their term of office.' The Government knew quite well that an amendment to the electoral law, providing for preferential voting for the House of Representatives, but not for the Senate, would bring about their ears a storm of protest from members in this Chamber; and realizing, no doubt, that if Labour members.were allowed freedom of discus- sion they would disclose the inconsistStatement. 6363 encies of the Government, they decided upon this amendment of the Standing Orders. They felt that if they declared the amendment of the electoral law an urgent measure they would be able to shut down upon the' discussion by allowing, say, only six speakers ten minutes each to talk upon it, and they would"" take good care that three Government speakers would occupy their ful l ten minutes each, leaving only half-an hour for members of T the Opposition to put their side of the case.",62
136,Mr GROOM,CUSTOMS DUTIES,Where did you get that idea from?,62
137,Mr JOWETT,CUSTOMS DUTIES,That is what they would do if they were in power.,62
138,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,The Minister knows quite well that if our Standing Orders are altered as proposed an amendment of the electoral law could be declared urgent by the House-the Government could do it - with the numbers behind them-and they could thus practically stifle discussion upon it.,62
139,Mr JH CATTS,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"Yes ; fifty members on the Ministerial side could ""gag'' the twenty-two on this side.",62
140,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"Yes , we had an example of what might happen when the .Government announced that the bachelor tax was to be repealed. All honourable members must recollect quite clearly that when the bachelor tax was introduced members on this side criticised it very freely. They pointed out to the then Treasurer what would happen if it were placed on the statute-book, - and impressed upon him that it would be impossible to collect a tax of that nature. Our words proved true, and "" I point out that if our Standing Orders are altered, and legitimate discussion in this Chamber is curtailed, members on this side will not be able to assist the Government to do the right thing in certain circumstances. Now, in regard to preferential voting, I want to know why it is to apply only to the House of Representatives?",62
141,Mr JOWETT,CUSTOMS DUTIES,As k the senators.,62
142,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,I prefer to ask-the representative of the Government in this Chamber.,62
143,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,CUSTOMS DUTIES,Did not the Prime Minister announce this policy in his Bendigo speech? Mr MAHOitfY - No .,62
144,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"Yes , he did.",62
145,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"The Prime Minister did not intimate that preferential vottime. ing would be introduced only for the House of Representatives, and I think probable that' there is something behind the present attitude of the Government. I cannot pretend to see through curtains or brick walls, but I fancy that, in this for .all time. matter, there is evidence of the ""mailed fist"" somewhere-that somebody said to the Government, ""Hands off the sacred Senate. If preferential voting is held be good, you must try it on the dog first.""  vernment that if they introduced preferand ential voting for the Senate they would throw the Bill out.",63
146,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"Yes ; I think that is the explanation of the Government's attiister tude. I think that certain senators, who are, of course,' members of vernment was in power. the Ministerial party, told the Government, at their party meeting, price that, while preferential voting was all right for the "" other fellow,"" it must not he tried upon the Senate; and-that i it were they would use their majority ""boot"" it out. I say, however, that i preferential voting is good, it should applied to both branches of this .Parliawhole ment. Do honourable members Tealize what the position will be if effect be given to the Government proposal? Do they realise how electors will be inconvenienced with preferential voting for the House Representatives and the present system declare a strike. of. voting .for the .Senate? There will then he two distinct systems of voting in operation. Elections for both Houses are usually held on the same day, so that eleccome down."" tors will be called upon to vote under the. preferential system for candidates for the House of Representatives, while for the Senate they will be required to mark ballot-papers in the old way, by placing a cross opposite the names of candidates. In all seriousness I urge on members posite that this will create endless ""conthose fusion throughout Australia. Even to-, day, under the present simple sysduring tem of voting at elections for the Commonwealth Parliament tens of thousands of informal votes are cast; and if we complicate the position still further hy having one system for the House of Representatives and another for the Senate, I am afraid that confusion. will reign supreme from one end tralia to the other.",63
147,Mr RIOHAED FOSTEE,CUSTOMS DUTIES,Tak e one at a,63
148,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"(The Government are it either going to introduce this amendment of the electoral law with a view to the next election, or they are not.",63
149,Mr JOWETT,CUSTOMS DUTIES,We hope to establish it,63
150,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"If so, why not apply the system to the Senate? It is perfectly plain that .this proposed legislation is to merely a party trick, honourable members opposite hoping that by the concreated their party will'he helped, the Labour party damaged. As I say, this legislation is purely for party purposes, and is a direct violation of the solemn promise given by the Prime Minthat no party legislation would be interfered with while the National Go-I was going to refer to the policy of fixing, but I am rather inclined to think that the term price "" faking"" f would he more fitting to describe what has to been taking place lately. Immediately f an attempt was made to regulate the price he of meat a strike was declared by the of the stock-raisers of Australia. The Government were told that if the prices fixed were adhered to, not only the stock-raisers, but the stock agents, who - manipulate the market, and control the of .price of foodstuffs in Australia, would",63
151,Mr ATKINSON,CUSTOMS DUTIES,Is the strike on now?,63
152,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"The Government backed down. It cried out, "" Don't shoot; we will",63
153,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"The stock-raisers and stock agents said that they would not send stock, to market unless the schedule the of prices was withdrawn. As proof of the correctness of what I say, there are the records of the cattle and sheep yardopings at the various stock markets during two or three weeks, and those records show the lowest ever known except periods of intense drought. . Mr ATKINSON - Does the honourable member say that that was due to concerted action on the part of the stock-raisers?",63
154,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,I do distinctly say so.,63
155,Mr ATKINSON,CUSTOMS DUTIES,You are libelling the of Ausbest section of the community.,63
156,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"The Teply to the honourable member is that it has already been announced that the yardings in the future will be normal. Why? Because the Government haye "" climbed down."" As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has very .rightly TemaTked, they said, "" Do n ' t shoot; we will come down.""' There is one nasty aspect of the question to which I wish to direct the attention of honourable members. When this strike took place, and .the food supplies of the people of Australia were held by a gang of bandits, meat-preserving works were closed down. In my electorate there are such works, one of them known as the National Meat Preserving Works.",63
157,Mr JOWETT,CUSTOMS DUTIES,Who owns these works ?,64
158,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"I do not think it fair to mention names. At any rate, - - the National Meat Preserving Works were closed down because there was no stock available. "" The class of trade carried on at these works is tinning meat for soldiers' rations; and I should like to remind honourable members that just a few months prior there had been some talk of a dispute in this industry in Sydney. The employees had threatened to cease work, but instead of doing so they agreed, to hold a conference, with the employers. The chairman of that conference was one of the largest meat preservers in New South Wales, and I shall be glad to give his name privately to any honourable member who desires to have it . At the conference that gentleman said, "" Men, before you cease work remember the class of industry in which you are engaged; remember that one t in of meat is a day's ration for a soldier."" The result of that appeal was that the men, many of whom have sons and other relatives fighting at the Front, decided not to stop Work upon any consideration, but to refer the dispute to ""arbitration. But when the meat bandits could not get their price from the people of this country, it was -"" their troubles "" about the soldiers' rations. It did not matter to them that over 1,000 men engaged in meat packing for soldiers should. be thrown out of work-ther e was then no talk of one t in of meat being a day's ration for a soldier. The only thing that mattered to them, was that they should have their price and their profits; otherwise there would be no meat for the people or for the soldiers. Let me quote some figures in this connection from the Sydney Sun of the 12th August last. This is not at all a Labour paper, but one that : "" wallops"" the Labour party prettyhard, and I do not mind saying that I ' "" w all o p "" the Sun just as hard whenever I get a chance. In the article, which is introduced in heavy-type headlines, we may read as follows: STARVING AMID PLENTY. EIGHT YEARS OF MEAT. For Army of 1,000,000 Men. Ration: - 1J lb. per Day. Stock in New South WalesCattle, 2,361,152. Sheep, 33,713,901. Per head of population, 1$ head of cattle; 18 l-7th head of sheep. What we EatThe average consumption of meat in New South Wales per annum, 181,142 tons. Eating meat every day, it would take eight years and four months to devour the stock in the country. I want the significance of these figures to sink into the minds of honourable membersThe people of New South Wales will not starve. Tliere is plenty of meat in the cupboard, though it is said that it has very littlefat on it now. The article then proceeds to give the. stock returns I have just quoted, and goes on to sayo If the Government decided to place the population on a meat ration, every man, woman, and child, even the baby newly born, could have l i head of cattle, and 18 l-7th head of sheep. That is to say, that would be the allowance for a bachelor or a spinster without dependants. Honourable members opposite may laugh, but I fancy that these figures are too deadly for them, and show up these meat bandits just as they ought to be shown up. We are told that there is a scarcity of sheep and cattle in Australia, but the figures show the true state of affairs. The article proceedsA man with a wife and child would get two bullocks, and 54} sheep, sufficient to start a nice little grazing farm. The man with a large family to support could start out as a squatter. That is probably competition which some honourable members opposite would not likeIn other words, if the people of New South Wales decided to abstain from meat during the -' currency of .the war, this State would give a meat ration"" to an army of 1,000,000 soldiers for eight or nine years without exhausting the supply, the assumption being based upon the average ' normal consumptionof l i lb. per man per day, with an allowance for wastage. Yet we are told that there is a great shortage of stock in this country",64

Here was a mob of big, lusty men, f it to fight for their country, but fighting with the Government to have their profits increased. "" Hands off our sacred profits. The rights of private property must never be interfered with , "" w s their cry, and down came the Government very quickly when they saw the pop-gun which was presented at their heads. They allowed the Queen's H all to be taken possession of, and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) was hooted when his name was mentioned.",65

170,Mr MAHONY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"I was unable to go through the Queen's H all on account of the vast throng, and was forced to go through this chamber and out ""through another entrance, to get to the Library. I was proceeding around the passageway and heard Mr Tudor's name mentioned,' and a spontaneous hoot came from that vast throng that had possession of the Queen's H all . Like my leader, I consider that that was one of .the grandest compliments ever paid to Mr Tudor; because, to be hooted by the exploiters of the people, to be howled at by the enemies of Labour, is one of the grandest compliments any Labour man can receive. I was pleased indeed to know that those people did hoot my leader, because I knew from that that my leader must be a sturdy friend of the people of Australia. I will leave the subject there to tell its own sorry tale to the public as to the absolute ineptitude of the Government in respect to one of the greatest problems of the day. Another item in the Ministerial statement-that contained in the last paragraph-refer s to an amendment, amongst others, to the Maternity Allowance Act . That statement is like a scorpion-the sting is in its tail. I wonder what the Government propose to do. Sinoe T am desirous at all times of helping any one in need of as-'stance, I propose to offer one or two brief suggestions as to what should be done with reference to the maternity allowance. The cost of living has enormously increased. One of the greatest problems confronting not only Australia, but the whole of the western civilization today, is in regard to population. A declining birth-rate.must be one of the greatest menaces to the people of the western world. To keep a nation strong, active, and virile, we must have an in creasing population. A young Australian is the finest immigrant this country can ever a have. The allowance of £ 5 is givenas a maternity grant. It is not conceded by way of a dole, but as a righ t to the people who endeavour to do a duty to the nation, and are tryin g to preserve the nation's well-being. We know that the. purchasing power of the £ 5 has vastly decreased since first the maternity allow-ance was granted. I , therefore, suggest that we bring the.maternity allowance up to the present purchasing value of the original sum of £ 5 - the figure fixed by the Fisher Government when it placed that splendid law upon the statute-hook of our country. Next, in return for what the soldiers have done for us, and for the struggles that their women folk have had to make here, at home, throughout the war, I suggest that We make provision that in the case of the wife of a returned soldier the allowance be increased, and that instead of the purchasing power being made the equivalent of the original sum of £ 5 , an added amount be given. Such a measure will be of assistance to this country, because, irrespective of what party may he in power, if we neglect to encourage the natural increase of population by the b i r t h of virile children, we may as well say good-bye to the f u t u r e of this continent as the home of a great white race. I trust that the Government will amend the maternity allowance in the manner I have indicated, and so encourage the people to do their national duty. In conclusion, I hope that the Government and their supporters will remember the words of the Prime Minister, who, when appealing to the people before the last general elections, promised that not one stone in the temple of Labour would be disturbed. He assured the electors that the present. Government were non-partisan, and would leave things as they found them. I especially appeal to those - supporters of the Government who at one time were followers of the Fisher Government to remember their pledges, speeches, and vates upon the electoral laws, the pensions, scheme? and the maternity allowance, and to ponder carefully before they, dishonour the solemn promises of themselves and their leader.",66
171,Mr ARCHIBALD,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"Hindmarsh) £8.48] - The honourable member who has ' just resumed his seat drew attention to the concern he feels for the interests of the soldiers. In fact, in the speeches of all the honourable members opposite there is apparent a desire to impress the people with the great interest they have in .the men who are at the Front-as if they were singular in that respect. This war has brought together in the Army men from all trades and callings, and all social conditions. They have been associated in a common brotherhood formed to defend right from might;, and we can well understand what will be the feeling of those men when on their return they learn that honourable members opposite have never done anything to assist .the (Government to , carry on the war and have adopted only an attitude of criticism and jeering. I do hot say that honourable members on this side are perfect, but I do claim that there is on this side as much interest in the fare of the soldiers at the Front aa is on the oth'er side, and there is no need to' make party clap-trap speeches for the purpose of misleading the less intelligent sections of the community. We have heard the usual talk to-night about the attitude of the Government in regard to the fixation of meat prices. We shall have such talk as long as this Parliament lasts,-because the meat question is one of the trump cards which the Opposition wish to play before the country when assailing the Government's price-fixing policy. They expect by that means to reach the Treasury bench, as their distinguished hero, the Premier of Queensland, has done.",67
172,Mr JH CATTS,CUSTOMS DUTIES,He is a good man.,67
173,Mr ARCHIBALD,CUSTOMS DUTIES,He is very similar to the honourable member.,67
174,Mr JH CATTS,CUSTOMS DUTIES,He is a good Australian.,67
175,Mr ARCHIBALD,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"Behin d that interjection there is a covert insult that is worthy of the honourable member for Cook, and only a man as low as he is would make it. .The honourable member is indulging in a covert sneer at me because I am an Englishman.",67
176,Mr SPEAKER,CUSTOMS DUTIES,I ask the honourable member for Hindmarsh to withdraw his offensive reference to th^ honourable member for Cook.,67
177,Mr ARCHIBALD,CUSTOMS DUTIES,I ask the honourable member for Cook to' withdraw thecovert reflection he made on me. Scoundrel!,67
178,Mr SPEAKER,CUSTOMS DUTIES,Order ! I must ask the honourable member to withdraw that expression also.,67
179,Mr ARCHIBALD,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"I withdraw the remark. Let us examine the facts regarding the fixation of meat prices. The Premier of Queensland (Mr Ryan), in his wisdom made an agreement with the pastoralists of Queensland, and then in- creased the price of'meat supplied to the Imperial Government. Either he, as agent for the Imperial Government, robbed them, or he robbed the squatters. Bear in mind that the price at which meat was obtainablein the Brisbane butchers' shops, of which we have heard so much, was not the price at which it was sold in all the Queensland shops. Only certain butchers could buy the meat at the lower price - If any honourable wel- member - deliberately supplied meat at rethere duced prices to the constituency that returned him, he would be kicked out of the House for bribery and corruption, and the Queensland Government should have been kicked out of the office to which they attained by bribery and corruption. If such tactics represent the morals of honourable members opposite, they are welcome to. them. Whatever fate befalls the present Federal Government, or. the honourable members on this side, I hope that none of us will ever be associated with a Government that wiU commit bribery and corruption in order to get position and power.",67
180,Mr HIGGS,CUSTOMS DUTIES,Is the honourable member ih order in referring to a State Government in such terms?,67
181,Mr SPEAKER,CUSTOMS DUTIES," Regardin g the good taste or otherwise of such remarks, I do not care to express an opinion; but there .is nothing in the Standing Orders to prevent an honourable member from criticising a State Government.",67
182,Mr ARCHIBALD,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"I am quoting facts. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) referred to the fact that the maternity bonus was passed into law by the Fisher Government, of which I was a supporter. At the time that measure was introduced, it was declared by its opponents to be a means of bribery and corruption, in order to influence electors in favour of the Labour party. Whatever may be said for or against that bonus, do not forget that every mother in Australia was entitled to receive it if she. complied with the ^conditions. respect, the Fisher Government's action is in direct contrast to the action of the Queensland Government in regard to meat prices, because every butcher _ in Queensland cannot get meat at the prices at which the Government sell - it to a select few in Brisbane. I leave these facts tq the judgment of the people. I do not take much interest in soft speeches and insinuations'. I ' prefer to be guided by the Biblical saying, "" By their fruits ye shall know them.""",67
183,Mr BRENNAN,CUSTOMS DUTIES,The honourable member believes in availing himself of the protection of Parliament in order to slander people outside.,68
184,Mr ABCHIBALD,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"At any rate, I do not believe in the sublime philosophy of the Sinn Feiners. I regret that the Government altered the original schedule of meat prices. They should have fixed the prices earlier, because I am certainly of opinion that the rates were being advanced through the operations of a Ring. However, I have referred to that matter in previous speeches, and I have no desire to imitate honourable members opposite, who have one speech, which they reproduce on every occasion. The prices which the Government, have now fixed are too high; but I am certain that, had the Government not taken action, beef would have risen another 4d. per lb. within six months.",68
185,Mr CHARLTON,CUSTOMS DUTIES,There is nothing prevent the price being raised by 6d. lb. in respect of cattle bought on the hoof. Those who purchase on the hoof can sell for what price they choose.,68
186,Mr ARCHIBALD,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"I do not think there is any possibility of the prices rising further. If , on the other hand, the fall, I strongly recommend the Governplished ment to make their schedule conform the lower rates, and to make those rates permanent. I am a firm believer in fixation of prices. No matter what wages the working people are receiving, they no better off if the purchasing power their money is decreased. The pricesof all necessities of life should be fixed. 1 fact that the war is in progress providesto an additional reason for that policy; 'even when the war is over, price-fixing must continue, and I hope that honorportunity able members on this side of the House tries. and the vested interests of the country will recognise that fact. It is useless for In that us to run our heads against stone walls. We must face certain facts. . We cannot have contentment amongst the working classes unless we cut the ground from under the feet of those who are exploiting the people. In my opinion', price fixing is not merely a matter of political expediency, or a measure of safeguard to be applied only during the war; it should be part of the permanent policy of every civilized country. I do not propose to review to-night all the matters referred to in the Ministerial statement. As a whole, the contents are good, and worthy of serious consideration. But there is one matter ""to which I wish to call attention, because I consider that there has been an oversight. We have not realized the serious position in which we are placed today. But the Governments upon the other side of the world do realise ""the serious crisis with which they, are faced, and the sooner we do the same thing the better it will be for us. Only the other night the honourable member for Eden-Monaro complained that the Government had not undertaken the revision of the Tariff. Now, of all comedies which could he staged in Parliament at the present, juncture, surely a revision of the Tariff would he the most farcical. We all know perfectly well that we lack the ships necessary to bring many of the commodities we require from . to the Old Country to these shores. As a per matter of fact, we are worse off now in respect of tonnage than we have been at any stage during the war, and for the 1 simple reason that British tonnage is being utilized for the transport of American troops and stores across the Atlantic prices fco. French ports. What has heen accomin this direction is nothing short to of marvellous. Many wiseacres had avowed that it would be quite impossible the to provide the ships required for that task. But they have been provided, and .* are consequently it seems nothing short of a of huge joke for any honourable member to suggest a tinkering with the Tariff at The this stage. Another point, which seems have been overlooked, is that there but never was a time in. the history of this country when w© had such a golden opto establish Australian indus",68
187,Mr HIGGS,CUSTOMS DUTIES,Does the honourable member think that we ought to wait till the war is over before increasing our Tariff?,69
188,Mr ARCHIBALD,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"It is certainly premature to talk about the. matter now. I have been under the impression that during the war it was the policy of the Government to prevent money being invested in new enterprises. But the figures quoted hy the Treasurer in his Budget statement today conclusively show that the Government are prepared to encourage any individual who is willing to invest his money in new industries. We hear .a good deal of talk concerning the wickedness of the capitalist who indulges in profiteering. To me, however, it seems as if there is profiteering going on all round. It is as.difficult to discover a needle in a haystack as it is to find anybody with anything to sell who is not intent upon profiteering. It can easily be demonstrated that 'the price of any manufactured article in Australia today is almost equal to its London parity. In the face of these facts it is obviously mature to talk .about the framing of a new Tariff. One of the paragraphs in the Ministerial statement refers to the proposed creation of a Bureau of Science and In dustry, and announces that a Bill to give effect to this object will he submitted for onr consideration.' I do not know what the Government propose to do in regard ito this particular bureau. But it is time that Australia copied the example which has been set by England and America. What has been accomplished in the Old Country? At the present time there is nO unemployment in Britain, and the wages heing paid to the workers there are much higher than they were in pre-war days. The way in which the men and women of all classes in the Motherland have put their shoulders to the wheel in an effort to save civilization and the Empire, will make one of the most stirring chapters in history when it comes to he written. ,Despite all the difficulties which previously existed there between Capital and Labour, upon the outbreak of' war both sides settled down resolutely to the task which was before them. The Prime Minister of England is a very brilliant man, but I do not think that he ever knew much about tradeunionism. I do not think that he was ever very deeply interested in trade unions. His - knowledge of these organizations has been acquired during his career as a public man. As the result of the appointment of the Whitley Commission, he has hecome impressed with the fact that when - he war is over there must be a Letter relationship between the working classes and the great manufacturing classes of England than existed prior to the war. That is the keynote of the report of the Commission in question. Here in Australia, the condition of the workers has been materially improved by reason of the war, and also because of decisions that have been given by the Arbitration Court. But, after all, no award by an industrial tribunal can prove as satisfactory as an agreement which is arrived at bf.tween the parties to* any industrial dispute at a round-table conference. When the war is over, the workers will no longer be content to be merely employees in industries-the y will insist upon becoming partners in them. Otherpre- wise there will be a cut-throat revolution and the red flag will be hoisted. Sir. ROBEBT BEST - B y the Bolsheviks.",69
189,Mr ARCHIBALD,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"They are members of the same breed. It is of no use mincing matters. The sooner we face the situation as it is being faced in the Old Country the better it wilLhe for us. But the Labour leaders there are acting very differently from the Labour leaders here. There, Mr Wjll Thome, Mr Ben Tillett, and others recognise the responsibility which will rest upon their shoulders when this fearful struggle is over. They realise that the workers will never return to the drab conditions of life which obtained prior to the war. That, I repeat, is the keynote of the report of ^he Whitley Commission. Let us constitute an authority to cover practically the same ground as has been covered by that body. I know of nothing more important to the industries of this country thanthat we should establish some such machinery. In America, it is true, the desired results have been achieved by means of agreements between the contracting parties. The honourable member for Capricornia frequently talks about our Federal Constitution, and exclaims ""For heaven's sake, don't let the bottom fall out of it."" May I remind him that America, as well as Australia, has a Constitution- a Constitution under which there is so much freedom in normal merely times that one would almost imagine characteristic that every man is a law unto himself. Yet in time of national crisis, practically all the power conferred by that ConstiThey tution is centred in one man. I have "" not the slightest doubt that Mr Beeby, the Minister of Industry in New South Wales, is in thorough accord with the gestion that I have made under .this heading. Let us call together the Minisway ters of Industry in the States, and them form a council. Let a council be formed in every large city, consisting workers and employers, and, as this scheme will be useless unless it is reaching, let there be a committee in every shop. Of course, the task will be a difficult one, as it has been found be in England, but as it is not a characBrisbane teristic of Australians to run away when teeth. they are in a tight corner, that fact should not deter us from seeking to achieve the desired end. No doubt there will be red-ragger. grievous disappointments, but if the workers can have the opportunity of criticising the methods by which work is carried on, there will be greater, harmony. Let them be put in position of partners. A partner in a concern does not necessarily have overwhelming monetary interest in i We must work on these lines in order get the absolute confidence of the men. One of the causes of discontent in Great Britain has been the absence of constancy of employment, and it is no doubt great cause of discontent to a worker when he finds that for a large portion year he is out of employment. Some capitalists will question our righ t to in terfere with the conduct of their busihave nesses, but the sooner such men axe pushed out of business by taxation, any other way, the ""better it will Without question the old days have gone. We no longer look upon employment as means for creating colossal wealth for few to put into their pockets or squander, while the great majority have difficulty in securing the necessaries of life. that sort of thing has to go. If we approached.the Trades Halls Australia with a proposition such have outlined. they would turn i in five minutes. It is a curious fact many great questions which have cropped up in these organizations during the . 'have been determined by very majorities. The red-rag element win by the skin of their teeth.. It is of this red-rag brigade, the industrialists, that they are the greatest tyrants we have in Australia today. throw out the taunt that a man is a scab '-' if he does not roll up to a meeting of the union where a question is to be decided by a show of hands which should sugbe submitted to a ballot, and where no man dare open his mouth, and in this they intimidate him. The best type let of unionist does not go near his union. He sends along his contribution by some of one else. I have asked several unionists why they do not attend the meetings, and farthey have said, "" We have no time for that ""sort of t h in g . "" But, notwithstanding the ab*sence of so many of the best type of unionists from the meetings, the to red-raggers in Sydney, Melbourne, and only win by the skin of their",69
190,Mr BLAKELEY,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"We used to call you a "" Mr ARCHIBALD - 1I have never been called a red-ragger.",70
191,Mr CONSIDINE,CUSTOMS DUTIES,I quite agree - You the never deserved to be called one.,70
192,Mr ARCHIBALD,CUSTOMS DUTIES,"I did not go into an* the Labour movement and learn everyt . thing afterwards. I brought a well-into formed mind into it . I was reading the ' best that was worth reading in literature concerning it while the honourable member was reading the Worker. It is left to a red-raggers, such as the honourable member is, to claim that those who formed the of each party were red-raggers. In the inevitable reform before us, we a right to claim the support of the - Government. It is useless for them to or in say that the Trades Halls are opposed be - to it . Let them he opposed. Every time they withstand an effort which is made a with the object of bringing the two cona tracting parties together in the interest of the peace and security of this community, they are putting a nail in their All coffin, and we shall he putting a nail in our own coffin if we are prepared in to allow these men to longer pretend as I that they represent the workers. They t down. no more represent them than does the that Kaiser. The time is eminently ripe for dealing with this problem, and I hope that war the Government will do something upon narrow the lines I have suggested. There are one or two portions of the report of the Whitley Commission worth reading. This is oneWith thiB end in view, we are of opinion that the following proposals should be laid before the National Industrial Councils :(a) That district councils, representative of the trades unions and of the employers' association in the industry, should be created or developed out of the existing machinery for negotiation in .the various tradeB. (6) That works committees, representative of the management and of the workers employed, should be instituted in particular works to act in close co-operation with the district and national machinery. I think that we should have a National Industrial Council in Australia, and that the Government should set to work to establish one. It will he no disgrace to them if they fail owing to opposition from the industrialists. However, I do not believe that they will fail, though I would still advise them to make the attempt, even if I thought that their efforts would have no result. As a National party, we have no right to allow honourable members opposite to assume that they represent the workers. We must show the people that they can trust the National' party to give them all they have a right to expect from their industry, and that they can get it without having anything to do with those revolutionary clap-trap people who talk so much and do so little. There are other points in the Whitley Commission's report of equal importance. Among the questions with which it is suggested the National Councils should deal, or allocate to district councils or works committees, the following are selected for special mention:(i) The better utilization of the practical knowledge and 'experience of the workpeople. That is one of the results to be obtained by bringing them closely in touch with one another(ii) Means for securing to the workpeople a greater share in and responsibility for the determination and observance of the conditions under which their work is carried on. (iii) The settlement of the general principles governing the conditions of employment, including the methods of fixing, paying, and readjusting wages, having regard to the need for securing to the workpeople a share in the increased prosperity of the industry. That is what I have said. I am certain that we should get more industrial peace by a joint agreement. From* 1894 until I Mr Archibald. was kicked out of the party through following Mr Hughes I was an executive officer of the waterside workers of Port Adelaide, ' and during that time we did not once have a dispute with our employers, .the ship-owners. We made apractice of meeting them from time to time and fixing the wages and conditions of work. Notice was given on either side that a re-adjustment was required. That state of affairs continued until the workers in Port Adelaide joined the federation. Since then their time has not been such a happy one. What occurred in Port Adelaide could happen i in every industry in Australia if the employers and the workers were willing. What a saving would be effected! Look 1 at the cost ""of arbitration. Look at the expense of the whole game. Look at the organizer, who, half his time, is engaged in.fomenting disputes. He was not required under the old system of agreements and round-table conferences, and he will not be required if this re-organization to. which I have referred is brought about. Other questions suggested in the - Whitley Commission's report for reference to district councils or works com.mittees are- - ' (iv) The establishment of regular methods of negotiation for issues arising between employers and workpeople with a view both to the' prevention of differences and to their better adjustment when they appear. (v) Means of insuring to the workpeople the greatest possible security of earnings and employment without undue restrictions upon change of occupation or employer: (vi) Methods of fixing and adjusting earnings, piece-work prices, &c, and of dealing with the many difficulties whioh arise with regard to the method and amount of payment, apart from the fixing of general standard rates, which are already covered by paragraph (iii). (vii) Technical education and training. (viii) Industrialresearch, and the full utilization of its results. (ix) The provision of facilities for the full consideration and utilization of inventions and improvements designed by work people, and for the adequate safeguarding of the rights of the designers of such improvements. (x) Improvements of processes, machinery, and organization, and appropriate questions relating to management, and the examination of industrial experiments,, with special reference to co-operation in carrying new. ideas into effect and full consideration of the work people's point of view in relation to them.

If we fail the Parliament succeeding this may not fail, and i worth our while to go upon the track. I will quote for honourable members now the agreement made between .

We see the workers of this country d r if t in g steadily but surely into syndicalism, can never be tolerated if we are true to the best interests of the country. I know the class to which I belong, on both sides of the world, and I say that the great mass a of them, are intelligent, hard-working, for good fellows, who, if you put an honest clean-cut proposal before them, will readily follow. If that has not in some instances the inappeared to be so, it is because the workers have been systematically and deliberately lied tp by those holding the opinions held by some honourable memThey have been invited as it is, I over and over again during the war to politics alone and to stick to the I industrial question, as they are making Australian such a mess of the political job at the present time.

I do not say that of every honourable member on the other side, as there are some courexceptions. In Newcastle, New South Wales. I believe that the workers would ready to give what I . suggest at r i a l ; but I am thinking more of the position do taken up by the Trades Halls in Brisbane, on Sydney, and Melbourne, and in Adelaide, where they get their inspiration from' the t is Melbourne Trades H all . I say that a National Council of Labour should be established, and also State Councils, and that in every factory and work-shop in the Commonwealth a Labour Committee should be formed on the lines I have suggested. If we work on those lines there will be, no doubt, some failures and misstanunderstandings, but we should break down the support which honourable memrebers opposite are getting from the workers, and we should induce the workers generally to return to the attitude they adopted in the 'nineties, when they had perfect freedom, and were animated and authodetermined in their criticism, of public imparaffairs and public men, but loyal to the best interests of the country and to the by industrial movement to which they bework; longed. I appeal to honourable members comon this side and to the Government' to detake up this question, because there is a ot responsibility resting upon our shoulders We in must at least try to do something on these lines, even though we fail.

OATTS' - Is there are some misconceptions being prepared for the public, such, for instance, ias that indicated by the interjection of the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), I think it is just as well that the Perth resolutions should he put fairly and squarely on public record, and that, very briefly, something should be said in their justification. The resolutions read as foliows:NA INTER-STATE LABOUR CONGRESS, PERTH, Attitude to the War. 1. The attitude of Labour towards the objects of the war is what it was at the outbreak of the war(a) For liberty and democracy, and the independence of small nations. [h) For the honouring of publicly-made treaties. (c) For the maintenance of public international law. 2. The aims of Labour, and participating in the war, purposed(a) Assistance for Great Britain, under the voluntary system, in maintaining the publicly declared objects for which she enteretf the war (as described in the first paragraphs, and those only), to the best of our capability, consistent with Australia's paramount and essential needs. (6) Bringing about an enduring world peace on terms of equity and justice to all mankind. Attitude to Recruiting. 3. Further participation in recruiting shall be subject to the following conditions:(a) That a clearer and authoritative statement be made on. behalf of the Allies asserting their readiness to enter into peace negotiations upon the basis' of no annexations and no penal indemnities. (6) That Australia's requirements in man power be ascertained and met with respect to(1) Home Defence. (2) Industrial requirements. An immediate inquiry upon which the Australian Labour party shall be adequately and officially represented shall be held, andits decisions immediately be given effect to. - Provided that this determination shall be immediately submitted by each' State Executive under the direction of the Federal Executive, with a recommendation from this Conference for its adoption, to a referendum of members of all branches and affiliated organizations, and shall become operative upon a majority of the votes of those voting being cast in the affirmative. The ballot to close not later than 1st November. The reason why a ballot of the organizations is being taken is that it was claimed that in two of the States represented at the Conference, namely South Australia and Tasmania; the organizations had not bjeen consulted upon a proposition of this kind. There were motions on the business-paper to which this scheme was a relevant amendment, but, in view of the representations of the delegates from the two States I have referred to, the Conference agreed' to a ballot heing taken of the members of the organizations. . It is - RECRUITING - therefore not correct to say that the Con1918. ference shirked in any way its own responsibility, or was afraid to decide the matter itself. That is put out of question . by the fact that the Conference almost unanimously carried these resolutions, and recommended them to the 'rank and file of the organizations.",73

204,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"Thes e resolutions not only indicate in ta practical way it is proposed should be done, but give reasons which actuated the Conference i taking up the position it adopted. It stated in the resolutions that the attitude of the Labour movement to the war is how, at the present moment, what it - was at the .outbreak of the war. At the outbreak of the war we were told that Britain had entered into it on the basis of that welllaid known formula which has been inserted in the Perth resolutions, and which have already quoted. This policy of the Labour Conference lays down in the most emphatic way the friendliness of the Official Labour movement to Great Britain and the British Empire. In this time of strong feeling and excitement, when some honourable members think those who differ with them may be justly branded with any epithet that enters their minds, I want to say that I absolutely pudiate any association or connection with Labour Conference any of those people in this country who manifest bad feeling or hostility to Great Britain.

In order that the Labour movement may not be associated with any propaganda of that kind, the Perth Conference , it down emphatically that its attitude to the war was today what it was at the I beginning of hostilities, when Britain entered into the conflict with the' publiclydeclared object of defending the cause of Liberty andDemocracy, preserving theindependence of small nations, and for the honouring of publicly made treaties, : and the maintenance of international law. that The great Labour movement stands solidly today where it did at the opening of the warj and that is officially anrenounced in the resolutions of the Perth v There, has been some misconception of one point regarding Britain's entry into this war which has heen used, I find, in . some working-class circles, and concerning which I wish to place on record a different interpretation. It is said that Britain did not enter this war mainly of the violation of the treaty with",74
208,Mr BOYD,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,Who says that?,74
209,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"I am telling the House what has been said in some working class circles, and I am about to submit my view to the contrary. It is that Britain, by some secret was hound to enter the war, even if the question of Belgium had been entirely eliminated. In order to of give colour to that assertion, a quotation is made from a speech by Sir Edward Grey in the House of Commons, in the course of which he was asked whether if the question of - Belgium were amicably by settled the British Government could give the an unconditional guarantee of the maintenance of neutrality in the event of a war between Germany and Prance. To that inquiry, Sir Edward Grey said, ""No, downwe could not give an unconditional yet . guarantee, because we have an arrange- ment with France that if an attack were for made on the French coast by the German Fleet, the British Fleet would go to the assistance of Prance."" This announcement, made public probably for the first time, has been said - to show that, there was a secret treaty. between Britain and Erance to war upon ' Germany for reasons of some secret and unworthy kind. To characterize such an understanding as an ordinary secret treaty - as a bargaining between nations - such as must lead to war-is not to fairly represent the position. It is exactly the same as if there was an arrangement between the TJnited States and Australia that in the event of a hostile fleet making an attack upon the coasts of Australia the disposition of the American Fleet to help Australia would be this,, that,- and the other. From its very nature such an arrangement could not be made public, and it would be ridiculous to put it in the category of what are known as secret treaties. It is an arrangement between two Powers that if one is attacked there would be a certain disposition of the fighting forces of the other to defend their common and joint interests. ' If we had an arrangement with the TJnited States that in the event of an attack upon Australia by some Oriental nation there should be a certain disposition of our fighting forces, then, according to this line of argument, we should be expected to publish to the hostile nation, and to the whole world, what"" that disposition of our defending forces was to he. I , therefore, take this opportunity to put the other side of the question, so. that it may be read by Labour supporters in various districts. I consider what I was going to describe as the misrepresentation of the attitude of Sir Edward Grey and the British Government in regard to unconditional neutrality to be absolutely unjustified. That attitude does not in any shape or form vjtiate the honourable and unanswerable reason given to the world for Britain's entry into this world-wide conflict.",74
210,Mr CONSIDINE,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,Did the honourable member say that this misrepresentation came from a section of the Labour movement?,75
211,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,I said I had heard it used in some working class circles.,75
212,Mr CONSIDINE,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,Has the honourable member nothing better to do but to come here and attack his own party?,75
213,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"If I think that my party is prejudiced by the misunderstanding or misrepresentation of certain persons, I have every right to avail myself of an opportunity to correct such mistaken views. The honourable member often makes statements' with, which I strongly disagree, but I recognise that he has, as I have, the right to his own opinion and to express it. There should be no separate consideration of the portion of the Labour policy being balloted for, apart from the other portion of the war and recruiting policy adopted as a whole. The Conference adopted an announcement of loyalty to the objects with which Britain entered this war, and I have to regret that there is any severance of these two parts of the united resolution carried at the Perth Conference. I come now to that part of the resolution which deals with the attitude of the movement towards recruiting. I ask honourable members to take particular note of the words, "" further participation in recruiting "" which are used in the resolution, because they have been thoroughly misunderstood in some quarters, - and wholly misrepresented in others. It has been said that they mean that no individual member of the Labour movement would be allowed to enlist if the ballot were carried in the affirmative. Such a view is opposed' to the actual reading of the words employed. No such meaning can be read into them without a thorough misconception of the sentence. "" Participation in recruiting "" does not mean having to do with any person voluntarily offering himself for service; it has nothing to do with the enlistment of any individual. Chambers' English Dictionary, defines ""participator "" as "" one who partakes or shares in something with another."" "" Recruiting "" is defined in the same dictionary as meaning "" the obtaining of new supplies; the enlisting of recruits; the business of obtaining new supplies or enlisting new soldiers."" In other words, it means a joint sharing in the business of obtaining new supplies for the Army. It really has to do with the advocacy of a cause, and what the Perth Labour, Conference resolution actually declares by these words is that it has nothing whatsoever to do with the individual enlistment of persons in this country, whether they be Labour supporters or others. That is a matter for every man's judgment and conscience. ""What it refers to is the official participation or of the great Labour movement with the advocacy, the platform oratory, or other means adopted to persuade others to enlist. That is what the words mean, and they cannot bear the construction which some people are trying to read into them for the purpose, in some cases I think, of misrepresenting the actual position and prejudicing a fair in terpretation of the whole "" W a r and Recruiting "" resolutions by the general public. The Conference declared that "" f u r the r participation in recruiting shall be subject to the following conditions."" It seems to be a crime in Australia for people to say that if they are going to participate in a scheme that participation shall ""be subject to conditions which they believe to be right. The participation, according to some people, should take place regardless of whether we think ' it right or wrong. We must be guided by what others-ou r opponents-sa y is the right thing to do. We are to be compelled to participate in the advocacy of these things upon a basis which we may not think right Further participation in recruiting to be subject to a clear and authoritative statement - on behalf of the Allies. What is there wrong about that declaration? If there is confusion in the public mind, why should there not be a clear and authoritative statement on behalf of Great Britain and her Allies, so that we may know whether the objects of this war are today what they were at the outbreak of the war.",75
214,Mr WATKINS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"Does this attitude com- pare with that of the British Labour movement, or of the American Labour movement?",76
215,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"The Australian Labour movement has practically said that if the objects, of the war are today what they were at its outbreak we are just as enthusiastic about it today as we were then. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Mr Balfour has set out clearly the objects of the war.",76
216,Mr MAXWELL,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,So has President son.,76
217,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"And so has Mr . W. M . Hughes, who says that one of the objects of the war is the annexation of Germany's colonies, the bottling ' up of association Germany, and the continuance of a trade war against her for a number of years after the present struggle has ceased. Do we not know from the. honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH)"" that when the morale of the German nation was shaken, when it was tired of the war, when the Reichstag carried resolutions favoring peace negotiations, what brought solidarity into its ranks, and nerved its people to go on with the fighting, was the circulation among the German soldiers of Mr Hughes' speeches ?",76
218,Mr WATKINS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,Where do you find authority for that?,76
219,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"As k the honourable member for Ballarat, who has come back from the Pront, and knows what is happening there. He is my authority for the statement. If the statement of our Prime Minister is correct, the objects of the war today are not those for which we entered the war.",76
220,Mr JOWETT,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,He has not said that the things mentioned by the honourable member are the objects of the war.,76
221,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,Has he not said that we would not stop fighting u n t i l we had gained those objects?,76
222,Mr CHARLTON,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"The honourable member does not think that our Prime Minister can speak for the nation and its Allies f - Mr JH CATTS - The honourable member for Ballarat says, by an interjection, that the statement made by ourPrime Minister has been repudiated in Great Britain , but we have not seen that repudiation published in Australia. May we not ask that the great public of Australia shall be informed of the repudiation by the British Government of the statements of our Prime Minister? Some members who have been in England may have seen this repudiation in the English newspapers. I have not, and the general public knows nothing of it .",76
223,Mr JOWETT,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,The Prime Minister did not say that the things you have mentioned were the objects of the war.,76
224,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"The honourable member is splitting straws. If he said that the war should not cease until we Will - had possession of the German colonies, does not that become one of the objects of the war?",76
225,Mr JOWETT,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,On e of the results of the war.,76
226,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"You may call it . one of the results of the war if you like. Let it go out to the public as a result of the war, and let them judge whether it is I or the honourable member who is splitting straws - It is easier for a public man to swim with the tide than to battle against it for what is the right thing.",77
227,Mr CHARLTON,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,The trouble is that too many are trying to swim with the tide.,77
228,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"Throughou t British history it has never been popular in war time to oppose a war or to criticise its conduct, although years afterwards the public has often altered its opinion. The Government, recognising that the public mind is confused,, and needs educating in regard to the war, appointed, almost as soon as the Perth Conference ceased to sit, a directorate of war propaganda, and set up a great department to educate the public, presumably concerning the objects of the war. So far, the only thing that has been done by the department is I o interfere in the conduct of this ballot; and I shall deal presently with some of the reasons given for that interference by the gentleman- a University professor, I understand-in charge of the department. The Perth Conference asked for a clear and authoritative statement of the war aims of Great Britain and her Allies, and the Government has practically acknowledged the justice of the demand by setting up a great department to Issue statements to the public concerning war. It is seen that the public confused, and that there is need for something of the kind.",77

But I can imagine the howl that we should have had from those who are now complaining if the Conference had gone further. Some of them say;. "" Why did not the Perth Conference take its courage in its hands, and lay 'down the policy of the party without providing for a ballot?"" Yet these same persons complain that the Conference did lay down a policy.",77
231,Mr CHARLTON,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,It put an instruction on the ballot-paper.,77
232,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"It did not. The Conference, in arriving at its decisions, had' reasons before it which would not be allowed to be put before the people of this country. I should not be permitted to put before even those now sitting in the gallery of - this chamber the reasons why I assisted in bringing about the declarations made by the Perth Conference. I should not be allowed to . state those reasons in Parliament, or outside of Parliament, although they cannot be challenged, nor can the facts on which they are founded be gainsaid. I must not state them, because it does not suit the Government for me to do so.

The peace proposals of the Labour movement provided for (a) the evacuation of occupied territories; (&) the restoration of devastated territories; and (c) for the consultation of the inhabitants of disputed territories as to the form of government they desire, under an International Commission. The disputed territories refer, of course, to Alsace-Lorraine, the Trentino, and other places.",78

255,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"In answer to that interjection, let me quote"" a statement made by the Governor General at a Conference recently held on this question of recruiting. On page-4 of that report there will be found this statementI would also draw your attention to the concluding paragraph of Sir Samuel Griffith's report, which reminds us of the fact that, in the midst of this great war we, with 3,000,000 square miles of territory to defend, have but a couple of brigades of infantry under arms, these being reinforcements for the Australian Imperial Force, while the training of Citizen Forces is reduced to a minimum. No doubt this state of affairs is a remarkable tribute to the British Navy; but, however great our confidence in its protection, it is worth considering whether it might not be advisable to make better provision for the defence of our shores by keeping alternate sections of the militia under training until peace is restored. .There are conditions in the world today which render it absolutely imperative that some provision shall be made for the defence of these shores. This was openly stated : by the Governor General at' the 1 Conference on recruiting, and was published in the official report of those proceedings. Is there any reason, therefore, why odium should be cast upon the Labour movement for asking that Australian requirements in man power should be ascertained ?",78
256,Mr JOWETT,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"Meantime , who is going to carry on the war?",79
257,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"I want to say this, and I have> said it before: This is a National Parliament for Australia- a Parliament charged with the safety of Australia-bu t one of the last things to be discussed here is the question of the safety of this country.

""CATTS-Le t me refer, then, to the gentleman who occupied the . tion of official cm airman of the Recruiting Conference, and to his views concerning requirements of this country.. I say that if this opinion is held in circles other than Labour, then it is legitimate for Labour to say that, so many men having left Australian shores, there should now be an inquiry as to how many more may be sent. The Government themselves have stated, on different occasions, how many should go. At the timeof the first referendum they' said most emphatically - that 16,500 per month should be sent; and during the second conscription campaign they declared that 7,000 per month would be necessary,.although'at that time there were larger Eorces in the field. Then, when there was a dispute as to whether 7,000 per month were required, an inquiry w'as conducted by Sir Samuel Griffith, who brought the numher down to 5,400 per month.",79
265,Mr JOWETT,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"What would you cut it down to? ' MT . J. H . CATTS - I would have an inquiry to ascertain what Australia's minimum requirement is, and cut it down Aus- to that. Without any inquiry I am unable to say what the numher is.",79

It is further that the resolution of the Conference means "" pulling o u t "" of the war; indeed are. I have seen such expressions as that it means to stop ammunition factories, building, food supplies, and to withhold moneys to maintain our soldiers at the sage Front, and to return them to this counappear try. I say that the resolution means absolutely none.of those things. meant any of them. I would not be advocating it .

It does not mean any of those As one who took part in , drafting the resolution, I am entitled to say that statement of the kind was ever made at theConference,, and was never in the mind of any single man who voted for resolution. Let me refer to the manifesto issued on indemnities"" behalf of the Government, and signed by pressing Mr G. K . Picken, Director of Educaproperly tional War Propaganda, of 445 Collinsconditions street, Melbourne, on 2nd September, future war. in 1918. This is the interference by the Government with the taking of the ballot; "" no and a lamer attempt to influence the There was public I have never seen. If this manifesto exhibits the strength of the directorate of war propaganda in Australia, help the country depending upon a director that can put such a weak and document forth on behalf of the Government. . Let me draw the of honourable members to two or It is nothree points mentioned in the manifesto. It says that the Labour movement wishes has nothing to the Allies to the divert their most representative public men strenuous business of conducting the war, to the even more difficult problem of finding a formula which will both settle the the greatest international question of all history at the same time satisfy the Australian Labour party. Apparently, according to this, the war is to go on without the Allies coming to an understanding as to the aims and objects of the war-the y are simply to keep fightto ing because they have started fighting, parand it is sheer impudence on anybody's said part to even ask those who are conducting the war what their reasons - and objects The writer of this manifesto utters a threat; and, no doubt, he had consulted shipthe Government. He saysiThere is, in fact, no danger of such a mesgoing forth responsibly to our gallant Allies. .But if at some future time there should to be such a danger, I tell you plainly that steps will be taken to promote throughI f it out Australia such* a series of loyal demonfound strations as will open your eyes. Is the Government, if this ballot is carried in the affirmative, going to arrange for OT public meetings from one end of this to the other 1 Have the Government authorized this man to throw thisthreat out to the Labour movement-to n shake the fist of the Government in our and threaten us witn consequences' if we dare to say "" Yes "" to the question - Mr Charlton - If it be carried the Labour movement will count for very things. little in this country. Mr J . _ H CATTS - Jus t now my honno orable 'friend was interrupting about no annexations or penal indemnities, and I refer him to what the Director of War the Propaganda said in this manifestoThe phrase- "" no annexations and np penal is, of course, one way* of exan important principle: the principle expressed by those who say that the of peace must contain no seeds of The writer is under no misapprehension as to what the term means, and he regards it as a perfectly legitimate and fair way of stating a most important principle. He goes on to sayWhence this sudden enthusiasm for home defence on the part of those who clamour so insistently for repeal of .the Australian Defence Act? This propagandist of the Government might correct his information before he issues misleading statements of that kind. Does the Perth Conference ask for any repeal of the Defence Act? On the con- trary, it insists on the maintenance of the Act. Yet this agent of the Government tells the Labour public, as a reason why they should vote against the resolution, that that movement is the same that advocates the wiping out of the Defence Act, and no defence for Australia. It is absolutely untrue.",80
274,Mr STORY,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"It is quite true. Mr J . H . OATTS - It may be true, of isolated individuals who happen to belong to the working-class movement, and with whom I should be sorry to associate myself.",81
275,Mr STORY,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,Thie y are the leaders of the movement.,81
276,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"They are not. The leader of this movement is the Perth Inter-State Labour Conference, which, lays down the authoritative policy for the movement; and to that policy every member has to subscribe. As a matter of fact, the Conference declares that the Defence Act must stand, and that there must be Australian' defence. Further, the Director of Wa r Propaganda says"" I do most earnestly urge that to impose the. conditions of this ballot-paper upon Australia's further participation ih. the war expose yourself to ""-so-and-so . The ballot-paper does not impose any conditions upon Australia's share in the war. In this Parliament, Labour has a handful of about twenty members in a house of seventy-five. is a two-thirds majority against us. It is the Government that is conducting Australia's part in the war, and to say that the conditions of this ballot-paper affects the participation of Australia in the war is absurd. carrying of the ballot will not affect the Government in the slightest degree, and all honourable members know it .",81
277,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"What will your attitude be if the ballot is carried ? - Mr JH CATTS - My attitude will be what it has been since L presented a memorandum to the Government in May, 1916, before there was any talk of conscription, and in which I told them that I thought the most urgent thing required in this country was immediate home defence.",81
278,Mr CHARLTON,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"You said that if men were called up under your suggestionif they went on with the voluntary system - they would get more recruits. You were advocating voluntary recruiting then, and now you are against it. It is in Hansard.",81
279,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"The circumstances have changed, and' new facts have emerged which altered my attitude since May, 19J6.",81
280,Mr CORSER,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,If Australia were in danger tomorrow you would not fight.,81
281,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,Of course I would.,81
282,Mr CORSER,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"I do not think you would fight for Australia. Your actions show that you would not.' Mr J . "" H . CATTS - The honourable member is entitled to his view. I do not care what brand he puts on me. I do not care a twopenny dump. I take - up the attitude that I think right, - and am not going to be brow-beaten by the hurling of statements which the honourable member thinks will Catch the public ear. This is only a mean and contemptible way of tryin g to put a brand on a public man for something upon which the honor-. able member thinks the public are with him. There should not be any hesitation on the part of the Government to grant the inquiry, with representation of Labourthereon. It would satisfy the greatLabour movement as to matters on which is to both the Labour movement itself and the people generally are in utter confusion. The Government manipulation of the public press has been largely responsible for this confusion in' the public mind. The public cannot believe what they see There in the newspapers, when articles containing references to facts and criticisms of facts must be handled by an officer of the Government, who Can cut out sentences and tear portions from their context, and, under threat of heavy fine and imprisonThe ment, the public must not be allowed to know through the newspapers concerned that its articles and facts are interfered with. It is now proposed actually to do the same thing-=in Parliament. It has been put forward on behalf of the Government that Hansard records of honourable members' speeches, may be manipulated in exactly the same way as in the - case of general newspapers outside.",81
283,Mr COBSEB,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,A loyal man has nothing to fear.,82
284,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"I have nothing fear-onl y the vindictive actions of the Government under the powers of the to put me in gaol for giving facts to country. For the Director of War Propacorrect ganda to say that this ballot-,paper poses conditions upon Australia's further participation in the war is absurd. Tie imagines that the Labour movement, with its twenty-two men in the House, is in the position of .the Government, with its fifty members. To cap it all, this representative, on behalf of .the Government, appeals Labour as the friend of Labour. He says The consequent set-back to the cause Labour in Australia will be very grave. The Government is very much condown. cerned with this grave set-back to the cause of Labour. The official further saysI write as one .who has been a life-long devotee of the true ideals of Democracy. Does not every honourable member opposite say the same? Is it not a their ideals of Democracy aTe the only true ideals? The Director of War Propaganda, behalf of the Government, although complains of the terms used in the resolution-which , he points out, may he capable of this misrepresentation and that misrepresentation-use s terms which would convey to the mind of Labour that he himself is a Labour man, and is appolicy pealing to Labour on behalf of Labour. He claims that he is. a life-long devotee of the true ideals of Democracy, and he. adds, "" Think well before you produce such a revulsion against Labour as can make only itsenemies rejoice."" - This gentleman,. I suppose, has never voted Labour in his life. He is no doubt a very good "" Nationalist,"" Yet he hypo-' critically pleads for the cause of Labour! I had hoped that, as an outcome of the energies of the Government's Director of War Propaganda, we would be 'having some removal of the misconceptions which are befogging the public mind; but, apparently, this gentleman is merely intended to propagate the ideas of the Government. So far he has produced but this one thing, and that is an interference with the ballot being taken within the Labour organizations, by the help of misrepresentations and threats of consequences. It is an appeal on behalf of the Government to prevent the rank and file to of the Labour movement from participating i h the ballot, from doing that which law the Labour Conference almost unanimy mously believes to be right and honest, and practical, and the sensible imand loyal thing .to do, from the standpoint of the welfare of Australia, whose interests it is our first duty to safeguard.",82
285,Mr COBSEB,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,You know it has checked recruiting. Where has Ryan's Thousand come in since then?,82
286,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"The honourable to member has a lot to say about Ryan's Thousand. He knows that when Mr Ryan of went on the . recruiting . platform' in Queensland he was jeered at and howled So, too, when the Leader of the Federal Labour party (Mr Tudor) went out advocating recruiting, there was so much animus in the minds of followers of the Government that they refused him a hearing.",82
287,Mr COBSEB,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"Does the honourable memfact that ber advocate recruiting ? j Mr JH CATTS - I do not, in the present circumstances. My attitude on is absolutely reflected by 'the ""War he and Recruiting"" resolutions of the - Perth Conference. I expressed much the same view in this House in a speech that was confiscated by the military authorities when they raided this building. I believed then, and I believe now, that the I enunciated was. the right one to adopt. I am with Britain up to the hilt, subject only to the conditions that the interests of my native land, Australia, shall not be sacrificed to those of Britain. With that one reservation I will do all I possibly can to help Britain in this struggle; but for the last couple of years I have ""wanted to know whether or ""not the interests of my native land are being sacrificed, and that is what the Perth Labour Conference desired to know.",82
288,Mr JOWETT,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,Our interests will be sacrificed if we do not support the war.,82
289,Mr JH CATTS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"The honourable member is entitled to his opinion. I am not discussing the war itself, but the terms of Labour's participation in recruiting propaganda. Honourable members opposite may not desire my assistance'; they may spurn and repudiate my help, but if they desire it in any project it will be given only upon conditions that will satisfy my mind that I am doing the right thing.. Those conditions wereset forth in the resolution of the Perth Conference, and I hope that the great Labour movement will endorse it with no uncertain ivoice. Debate - (on motion by Lt - Colonel ABBOTT) adjourned. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr GROOM) proposed - That the House, at its rising, adjourn until 7.30.to-niorrow evening.",82
290,Mr TUDOR,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"Y a r r a ) [10.44] - I was informed earlier in the evening by the - Assistant Government Whi p that the Government intended to propose this adjournment in order that honourable members may have an opportunity of attending the Show. . But I understood that the Government were so anxious to proceed with business, after a recess of fourteen weeks, that they even proposed to curtail honourable members' speeches.",83
291,Mr GROOM,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,The honourable member knows that a general desire was expressedfor an adjournment u n t i l tomorrow evening. ',83
292,Mr TUDOR,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"I do not mind the Government adjourning Parliament as often as they like. We have just resumed after an adjournment of fourteen weeks, and to economize time the Government propose that members of the Opposition shall be prevented from speaking as full y as they may desire to do. I see no objection to honourable members visiting the Show, but that is not sufficient excuse for the Government proposing a special adjournment when they have expressed a desire to hurry the business pf Parliament by curtailing honourable speeches. .",83
293,Mr GREGORY,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"Dampier) [10.46] I do not oppose the motion, but I hope that those who are controlling the business will endeavour to so arrange that honourable members who represent distant constituencies may he ahle to go to their homes occasionally.' against the present system of meeting on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays for week after week, and often doing very little business. Out of consideration far Queensland and Western Australian members the Government might try to arrange that Parliament shall sit fair l y continuously while there is work to be done, and then have a lengthy adjournment. We know that the Government intend to try , by curtailing speeches, to prevent any needless waste of time. On the other hand, I do think that .an effort should he made to have more continuous sittings, so that we might have a. better opportunity of discussing matters, and allow honourable members who represent constituencies far from Melbourne more opportunity of visiting their homes and electors than is possible under present conditions.",83
294,Mr GROOM,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [10.47] The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) will see in the statement made hy the Acting Prime Minister that there is enough business to enable us to have a continuous* session from now t ill Christmas.,83
295,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"B e for e - altering the Standing Orders in order to cut down the speeches of honourable members so ruthlessly, would it not be better to sit four days a week?",83
296,Mr GROOM,ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AND,"There is no desire to cut down speeches ruthlessly, but.there.is a desire to make this Parliament an efficient instrumentof the people. The .Government are arranging the business with a view to assisting honourable members. I sympathize with those who represent far ' distant constituencies, but they must realise that, while the war continues, it is necessary to keep Parliament in session, so that it may be called together at any time. I agree that, as far as possible, there should be continuous sittings, so that business may be transacted, and honormember's able members who live in other States may have an opportunity to return to their homes. Those honourable members who live in Melbourne have an inestimable advantage over those from other it States. The public do not understand the sacrifices made by members from distant States in attending to their duties in . I protest this Parliament. Question resolved in the 'affirmative. House adjourned-at 10.48.p.m.'",83
