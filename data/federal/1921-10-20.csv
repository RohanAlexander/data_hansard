2,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Defence if he will extend by six months the period within which application may be made for the grant to volunteers of the Australian Imperial Force who served with the British Forces? The date originally fixed for the termination of the period was November, 1920, but the period was subsequently extended from^ the 1st to the end of this month on new conditions. I know of some sixty diggers who went to the bush, and have only just heard of this grant. .

3,Mr FENTON,CONTRIBUTION TO BRITISH,"I ask the Acting Leader of the House whether the information that has reached the public within the last day or so, that several millions ar§ to be spent on building ships for the British Navy, towards the cost of which the oversea Dominions will bo asked to contribute, is correct? I understand that New Zealand is already providing for, or has provided for, her contribution. ""What is the position of Australia in the matter? What decision has the Government arrived' at in regard to it? Six JOSEPH COOK - So far as I know, there is no truth in these rumours. COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING.",19
4,Mr BLUNDELL,CONTRIBUTION TO BRITISH,"Before the Government comes to a decision about its shipbuilding policy, particularly so far as South Australia is affected, will Ministers meet the representatives of all the unions engaged in this business, with a view to discussing the whole question with them, in the hope of arriving at a satisfactory solution of the present difficulty?",19

8,Mr WEST,CONTRIBUTION TO BRITISH,"Yesterday I asked the Treasurer a question, which he either misunderstood or evaded; therefore I repeat it today. Is it the intention of the Government to float its own loans in London, and to employ the branch office of the _ Commonwealth Bank there in connection with the matter, instead of handing the business over to Sir Robert Nivison?",19
9,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,CONTRIBUTION TO BRITISH,The intention of the Government is to float further loans in the usual way. WASHINGTON CONFERENCE. INSTBUOTIOWS TO DELEGATES.,19
10,Mr FENTON,CONTRIBUTION TO BRITISH,"It was promised, either by the Treasurer or by the Prime Minister, that the House would be made acquainted with, or would have an opportunity of giving, the instructions to the Australian delegate at the Washington Conference, so that we should know whatpolicy he intended to pursue. I understood that a course was to be followed similar to that taken in connection with the representationof the Commonwealth at the recent Imperial Conference. Has the matter been decided on by the Gofor vernment? Have Ministers determined what policy shall be followed?",19
11,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONTRIBUTION TO BRITISH,"I cannot say putation what course the Prime Minister intends children to take. He returned to Melbourne only yesterday after a week's absence electorate and in New South ""Wales, and I regret to say is not well enough to are4. born attend here this afternoon.

13,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTRIBUTION TO BRITISH,"I cannot say offhand what the position is, but I shall inquire respecting it. I think that we are under a statutory obligation to pay a bounty in certain circumstances, if manufacturers comply with conditions that have been laid down; but no applications are now being made, and I am not aware that there were any last year. NA SHIPBUILDING.  to repeat to the Minister for Home and given Territories a question which I have put to him twice already, and to which he promised an answer last week. It retralia. lates to Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh's the shipbuilding contract. I ask again when we may expect an answer to the question, and what the Government is going to in the matter?  cannot give an answer now. As I said when the matter was mentioned last, it is in the hands of the Crown Law authoriCharge ties. I have spoken to them about it since, and they have told me that they port will be able to furnish a reply at an early date. I do not know more than that. NORTHERN TERRITORY. NA CHILDREN.",20
14,Mr MATHEWS,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"the Minister Home and Territories, upon notice I. Is there any truth in the statement that the Prime Minister promised the Chinese dethat permission would the granted them to bring their Chinese-born wives and to Darwin for a period of three years? 2. If that is so, is it not a contravention of in his the White Australia policy? 3. What status will the children have who in Australia under this permission? Are a number of Chinese, classified as "" merchants,"" but who are really local storeadmitted to Darwin; and, if so, is this permissible?  honourable member's questions are as 1. I am not. aware of any Chinese deputation waited on the Prime Minister, or of any promise having been made by the Prime Minisrespecting the admission to Darwin of the to Chinese-toorn wives and children of local Chinese. If the honourable member has in mind a deputation which waited on me when I was in Darwin, the answer is as follows:A promise was given that applications by Australian-born Chinese for permission to bring their wives and children to Australia for limited periods would receive consideration, 'but that every such application would be dealt with on its merits, the determining factors to be(a) the character and standing of the applicant; (&) the length of time which had elapsed since husband and wife last met; (c) the circumstances, if any, which prevented the husband from proceeding to China to see his wife. 2. 2To contravention of the White Australia policy would be involved, as any permission would be for definitely limited periods. 3. Children Iborn in Australia of Chinese parents would be entitled to remain in AusI t is not, however, anticipated that number would be considerable, or that any appreciable proportion would remain in Australia, as the mothers, when returning to China, would of necessity take with them their do Australian-lborn children of tender age. 4. Jfo. HIRING OF ""BILOELA. """,20
15,Mr MAHONY,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"the Minister in of Shipbuilding, upon notice I. Was the Biloela hired to the Island TransCompany; if so, for what .period? and 2. What was the total amount of money received in connection with the hiring of the Biloela?  honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. No definite period. 2. No amount has yet heen received, but the arrangement provided for the payment of money at the rate of £15 per week. LEAVE OE ABSENCE . Motion (by Mr Charlton) (by leave) agreed toThat leave of absence for one month be given to the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) and the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr MCDonald), on the ground of ill-Health. Motion (iby Sir JOSEPH COOK) leave) agreed toThat leave of absence for one month be given to the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden), on the ground of ill-health,, and to the honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Bruce) and the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson), on the ground of urgent public business. BUDGET 1921-22. In Committee of Supply: Debate resumed from 19th October (vide page 12054), on motion by Sir JOSEPH COOKThat the first item in the Estimates, under Division I . , The Parliament, namely, ""The President, £1,100,"" be agreed to. On which Dr EARLE PAGE had moved, by way of amendment That the item be reduced by 10s., and that this be taken as an instruction to the Government to reconsider the Estimates for the purpose of reducing the total expenditure from revenue by the sum of £2,817,108, the amount of the anticipated deficit, in order to square the ledger. Dr. EARLE PAGE (Cowper) [2.43] I wish, as a matter of personal explanation, to say that yesterday, while speaking of the Estimates of the Post and Telegraph Department, I quoted some figures as being those for last year, when, as a matter of fact, they were the figures relating to the current financial year, as the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) showed me from his Budget statement. My mistake was due to a slip made by my typist, but it did not in any»way affect the argument.",20
16,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"ParramattaTreasurer) [2.44] - I regret that I have not had an opportunity of looking over the speech of the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), as I said last night I should like to do. I arranged with the honourable member to let me have a proof of his speech; but he countermanded that afterwards, and declined to let me see it until he had corrected it this hire morning. It was then so late that I could make little or no use of it.",21
17,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,It was available at half-past 10 o'clock this morning.,21
18,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"It was available to me at about half-past 11 o'clock, and then I had not an opportunity of looking closely into it. However, I have no doubt that I shall get on quite well without it. I do not know wiry honourable (by members should laugh; but I was about to observe that, as the honourable member's speech was handed out to the press early yesterday, I have no doubt that the resume of it published in the newspapers is fairly accurate. I have been obliged to rely upon the public .press for the details to which I propose to refer. Looking over the reported statements of the honourable member, I return again for a moment to the tone and temper of his utterances. I think it is much to be regretted that the honourable member should have disfigured his speech by the personal references in which he indulged.",21
19,Mr BRENNAN,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,I thought the right honourable gentleman had exhausted that aspect of the matter yesterday.,21
20,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,I intend to exhaust it a little more today.,21
21,Mr BLAKELEY,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,I hope the right honourable gentleman is not going to drag in party politics.,21
22,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"The honourable member for 'Cowiper yesterday lectured the Governments of the whole of the States of the Commonwealth, and, indeed, of most of the countries of the world incidentally, on the subject of national budgeting. He described the State Governments* as reckless and extravagant, and as indulging in a Rake's Progress.",21
23,Mr ROBERT COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Did he include tihe Victorian Government ? Sir JOSEPH COOK^Yes , he did. I think we might let the Victorian Government alone. Already they are busily engaged in legislation against a deficit. Why they should be excluded from the honourable member's criticism I do not know. He was very sweeping in his generalizations. We were all engaged in a "" Rake's Progress,"" and "" indulging in a carnival of financial folly."" He used the words ""slovenliness,"" ""faking,"" ""dumping,"" "" deliberately deceiving and bluffing the pulblic,"" ""manufacturing surpluses, and skinning soldiers to do it,"" and "" failing to spend money on soldiers' graves."" Generally, his statements were that where there had been saving, there was faking, and where there had been no saving, there was extravagant waste. I should like to examine a few of the lionorable member's statements today in the brief time at my disposal, to find out exactly what brand of economy he stands for. In his speech of yesterday he was almost universal in his outlook. He was retrospective for the last one hundred years. He went back to Napoleon's time, and, coming on through the years, showed us in stately procession what had been done elsewhere, and directed our attention to those glorious and shining examples. Then at last he got down to "" tin tacks,"" and suggested these things: That we ought to reduce expenditure to the lowest possible limit-in which I entirely agree with him-that we ought to pay war expenditure out of revenuethat was very clear also-and that during the war we should have done all these things, and at the same time have created 'arge sinking funds for the purpose of paying off our indebtedness quickly. Those are not proposals for the ""present, but statements as to Ttftiat should have been done during the war. I had little to do with the Treasury, except during the last twelve months. I came in at the tail end of the hunt; but all I have to say about OUT finances during the war days is this: There were at the head of the Treasury and in control of it at the time men whose reputations for sound finance will not be challenged successfully by my honourable friend. Expenditure during the war day3 was reduced to the lowest possible limit. Take, for instance, the Post and Telegraph Department  starved.",21
24,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"It was starved during the war days, and we are trying now to catch up with its requirements.  vernment were to reduce the Defence Estimates by £3,000,000, and provide for an additional expenditure to that extent in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department, an improvement would be made.",22
25,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,The honourable member has been making speeches ever since the sitting began.,22
26,Mr GREGORY,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"We had the same Government policy for three years. Last year the right honourable gentleman altered it. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - It was the policy for three years, and may I suggest that it was the policy of this Parliament.",22
27,Mr GEEGOEY,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,It was not.,22
28,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"It was the policy of this Parliament, and the honourable member must take his full share of responsibility for whatever was done during the waT days. We are told by the Leader of the Country party that during the war more should have been speht out of revenue. Is it not rather late to make such a protest? Did any honourable member of the Country party urge the adoption of such a policy during the war days ? Not one of them. They have only made this discovery, through the mouth of their leader, now that the war has been well over for three years.",22
29,Mr GREGORY,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,What nonsense! Consider the promises made.,22
30,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"The honourable member did not once, during the whole time of the war, advocate the imposition of more taxation than was actually put on, so that these observations from the mouth of his present leader as to what should have been done during the war are criticisms of his own party as much as any other. The Treasury during those days was in charge of men like the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), whom I have often criticised as being one of the most conservative Ministers that ever presided over the Treasury. He was followed by the late Lord Forrest, who, in turn, was succeeded by my immediate was predecessor, the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt). I have no doubt whatever that they charged the revenue during the war days with as much as they thought it prudent to do. The Leader of Go- the Country party said, also, that during the war we should have created large sinking funds, so as to provide for quick payment of our war debts. there any nation which did that during the war? I know of none. The nations the basic wage. had no money for sinking fluids in those days; they were obsessed with the one idea-wit h the one desire to raise enough money to enable them to pursue the The time for creating sinking funds not when we were in a death-grapple with our enemies and fighting for our very lives. How absurd it would be f o nation when the war in which it was enI gaged was at its height to begin raking money and saving it for the purpose paying its debts when that war was over.",22
31,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Was there not a sinking, f u n d in connection with English loan raised during the war?",23
32,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"If that is what the honourable member meant-and already he is beginning to "" back-pedal"" - the reply is that every loan floated here transactions. has a sinking f u n d attached to it . True, it is a very small one, amounting to only 10s. per cent., but B r it a in did no more than that. As a matter of fact, she did a great deal less. None of the Allies did what the honourable member suggested in his speech should have been done by us - no t one of them created large sinking funds during the period of the war. Let us pass now from the time of the war and deal with the premust sent. So far as I can gather, the Leader of the Country party says that what we should do now is to reduce our ordinary expenditure- I stress that point - curtai l borrowing and create bigger sinking f u n d so as to discharge war debts quickly. How are we to do all these things? What is the brand of economy which he is so persistently preaching in these days? He never once told us. I shall come in a. moment to the only statements I can find that he made on. the question of how to do it . I want first of all to mention the things which says we should not do. ""He says, for i stance, that we must not touch the basic wage; the increments to public servants must go on.",23
33,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Did that?,23
34,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"He did ; that is one definite statement that he made yesterday. The basic wage is involving us the today in an annual expenditure of from Is £1,000,000 to £1,250,000.",23
35,Dr EABLEPAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,I said nothing about,23
36,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"The honourable member put it in another way. He said that the Publio Servioe increments must war. go on. The payments under the basic was wage are increments, and I take it that the honourable member's statement applied to that last increment as well as to others. r a If he did not say anything like that, may ask if he is in favour of interfering with, in the arrangements that were made? He of supported them in the House; they were put to him plainly at the time by the Prime Minister, and he supported them. Is he now prepared to go back on them? On the contrary, he says the Public Serevery vice increments must go on, and, therefore, we may not interfere with the pay of the Service. The pay of the Public Servioe is responsible for nearly the whole of the deficit in respect of this year's That, them, is one item from which he says nothing must be taken in his process of economy. The honourable member also says that we must not "" skin the soldier,"" and that we must not borrow any more for the soldier. One of his points of criticism yesterday was that I had provided in this year's Budget for an expenditure of £11,000,000 on repatriation. He objects to that, but at the same time says we not "" skin the soldier "" ; we must not give him any less , and we must not borrow. Clearly, therefore, this provision, according to my honourable friend, should bo made out of revenue. At the same a time he says there must be a much bigger our sinking fund . He did not indicate the extent to which he thought our sinking f u n d should be increased, and what he means by a big sinking f u n d I do not know. I doubled the sinking f u n d in the last Budget. Is he for doubling it again ? Is he in favour of paying an additional £3,000,000 out of revenue into the sinkhe ing fund ? The money could come fro m n - nowhere else. I should like the honourable member to say where the additional sum, over and above the sinking' f u n d that w© have, is to be obtained. he say Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - He will not * prescribe t ill you call him in .",23
37,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,It is better that he should not. It is much easier to make broad general statements.  honourable gentleman is now doing.,23
38,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"No ; I am trying, but not with much success, to induce the honourable member's leader to come down to details. Where, again, are we to look for economy at the hands of the Leader of the Country party ? Is he, like those outside, who are a giving him so much encouragement, in favour of interfering with what is known as the "" Salary Grab"" ? He was one of those who asked for an increased allowance to honourable members. Is he now ready .to throw it away again? He was one of those honourable members who asked the Prime Minister to make the increase. Is there to be economy in Canberra?",24
39,Mr WIENHOLT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Yes .,24
40,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"But the Leader of the honourable member's party does not say so. He is for more, and not less, expenditure at Canberra. We are now beginning to realise to what extent his party is behind him with regard to his economy campaign. Unanimously, so he said yesterday; but the top and bottom of it all is that the honourable member for Cowper is an economist, not at all of the type that is doing duty with so much popularity and success in - this city just now; yet, somehow or other, people outside encourage him. These, then, are the things which we may not do in order to balance expenditure and revenue. We must not interfere with public servants' wages. We must not interfere with anything relating to the soldiers. Anything attempted in that direction must be generous and liberal, and be done out of revenue instead of loans. He will have nothing to do with any-, thing but big sinking funds, which means another heavy drain upon revenue to the extent of, say, £3,000,000 or £4,000,000. Neither will he have anything to do with the taking away of any of those privileges which he has been at so much pains to acquire for himself and the rest of us. I am not blaming him for these things. I only want to know where his economy comes in, and I am proceeding to show, by the process of elimination, where it does not come in. He tells us plainly that we must do none of these things. What he says we ought to do is to reduce the personnel of the Public Service; and last night he suggested that we, the members of the Government, had our tongues in our cheeks when we talked about retrenchment, in view of the fact that, during the year 1919-20, 1,500 new appointments were made to the Service. I have not been able to test his figures on this point, so I cannot challenge them.",24
41,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,I got my figures from the report of the Acting Public Service Commissioner.,24
42,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Then I have no doubt that the statement is accurate; and I am quite sure, also, that if 1,500 new appointments were made, there was very good reason for making them. My friend, the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), was in office then; and I am certain that during those crucial days he made no unnecessary appointments to the Public Service.",24
43,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Probably some of the appointments represented a move from the temporary to the permanent list.,24
44,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"That may be so, and as I am going to point to some instances of blundering on the part of the honourable member for Cowper in connection with the Publio Service Departments, I shall pass this statement for the moment. Let us now exaniine his proposals for economy. The honourable member will not have us do any of these things I have mentioned. Rather he proposes taking many more millions from revenue for other purposes. This was his definite statement last night. Listen to his proposition. It is the duty of the Ministry, he declared, to say where economies can be effected, and which services shall bear the brunt of them. Eor the rest, he says, I want a general re-organization of the Departments! ",24
45,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Thes e are the honourable member's proposals for economy!,24
46,Mr LAZZARINI,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,They are pretty general in terms.,24
47,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Good old * general re-organization! It is not hia function', so he says, to put his finger on any particular item which should be subjected to economy.  when you were in Opposition.",24
48,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I should think it is the duty of any honourable member in this House who is a believer in economy to point to any direction in which it may be effected. Though the Leader of the Country party, with meticulous care, told us what we must not do to economize, he never once stated how economy was to be effected. This, he said, %vas the duty of the Government. Economy. there must be, so he urged, to make up for those huge spendings which he himself prognosticated as being so necessary to the development of this country. He would spend millions more on sinking funds, millions more out of revenue on our soldiers, and millions more in order to secure the increments to the public servants; but he omitted to point out one particular item in which economy could be effected. All he says is, ""Economy there must be, but you must effect it ; for the rest let re-organization.""",25
49,Mr GREGORY,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,He was not so anxious that you should do it.,25
50,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Well , I would not mind if the honourable member had to face the task. He would then find out that it was not so easy of accomplishment as to talk about. The Leader of the Country party also went on to criticise some of the Departments, and even complained of the makeup of the Budget, and pf the way in which the balances were got out. He accused officials of the Treasury of faking the figures. That is what his statement amounted to, for he must know that the Treasurer does not say what special item shall be placed in a particular part of the Budget. This is the duty of the accountants. But even this does not suit the honourable member, for the simple reason that he does not understand the Budget; and in proportion as he does not understand it, so he talks the more confidently about it. ",25
51,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I am going to. Take, for instance, his statement about the Post Office. He said it was estimated that there would be a surplus over expenditure of £1,800,000.",25
52,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Ove r ordinary exthereby penditure.,25
53,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,I see. And what does the honourable member mean by ordinary expenditure?,25
54,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"The ordinary expenditure is set down at £7,450,000!",25
55,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"But that is not all the expenditure. That is merely the administrative charges. It does not include developmental expenditure, which is just as imperative in the Post Office as any other expenditure. It is easy to say there will be a surplus in a Department when you put in your expenditure only half the amount you require. Any one can do that. The total estimated expenditure in the Post Ofiice this year is £9,660,000 and not £7,000,000 odd. It is nearly £8,000,000 for ordinary services, plus the capital expenditure on public works.",25
56,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,That is what I us have a general pointed out.,25
57,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Then why did the honourable member say that the Department would have a surplus of £1,800,000 on the year? Was he endeavouring to bluff and deceive the public? Was that the object of his legerdemain? The facts are that £7,913,000 is to be spent for ordinary purposes, and £1,747,000 of capital expenditure, the grand total for the year being £9,660,000; and as the estimated revenue for the Post Office is only £9,311,000, so far from there being a surplus to go into other forms of revenue, the Government are this year putting £300,000 more into this Department than they are taking out of it.",25
58,Mr GREGORY,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,How much of the capital expenditure is from loan moneys?,25
59,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Roughly , about a half. Here is another half-truth to which the honourable member for Cowper gave utterance last night. He said that we were spending £900,000 from loan moneys on the Post Office, but omitted to point out at the same time that we were this year voting from revenue for public works in connection with the Department nearly as much as we did last year. I object to the honourable member telling the Committee about half the vote, but saying nothing about the other half, creating a deliberately false impression. The honourable member went on to point out discrepancies between the total amounts showing in the Estimates and those set out in the Budget papers; and he said that the same fact could not be stated in the same way in the two different places; hut, since he knows everything about the Budget papers and the Budget, he ought to know that the only place in which everything connected with a particular Department' is brought to account is in the Budget papers. Sometimes items in connection with a Department appear in the Estimates under the vote for quite a different Department. For instance, expenditure which appears under the vote for the Department of Works and Bailways may properly belong to the Post Office. However, everything is brought to account in the Budget papers, where the grand total for the whole Department is shown. If the honourable member was not aware of this fact, he could very easily have asked for an explanation instead of talking so confidently and so abusively about the manner in which the Estimates had been prepared.",25
60,Mr BRENNAN,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,And this is what the Country party gets for keeping the right honourable gentleman in power.,26
61,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,But this is a non-party matter. We are talking to each other as brothers.,26
62,Mr FLEMING,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,The right honourable gentleman has not been very kind is his remarks as a brother.,26
63,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I have been a little kinder than the honourable member's leader was last night. In any case, the honourable member for Robertson is now no judge of the question. The Leader, of the Country party referred last night to the Defence Department. Here I am dealing with another of those items which he entirely misrepresented. mentioning the principal increases in the Defence expenditure he included in the Permanent Military Forces a sum £249,257 under Administrative and In structional Staffs, which is clearly shown on page 124 of the Estimates as being penditure for the year 1920-21. The orable member's figures were wrong. increase which he claimed the credit discovering is no increase at all. In stead of an increase of £576,000 over the expenditure in 1913-14, as he suggests, the amount really was £327,000. Again, he referred to the item "" Universal Training"" last year, and showed that there was an amount of £191,950 voted last year as against an estimate of £434,302 for this year. He ought to have known that the amount voted last year was £350,505. I do not know what accountant the honourable member employed in getting out this information for him, but he really must be very "" slovenly."" There are about half-a-dozen cases of this kind, but I need not weary the Committee with them. They all arise from the same cause-lac k of care on the part of the honourable member to look into a simple matter. The honourable member delivered a diatribe against the Department of Trade and Customs, and wanted to know why there was an increase of seventy on the central staff. There is an increase of seventy officials because seventy permanent men have now taken the place of seventy temporary men who were doing work which has come to be regarded as of a permanent nature.",26
64,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Then why does the cost of the Department increase at the same time?,26
65,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Because , as the honourable member insists, increments must be paid. - Dr EARLE PAGE - Absolut e rubbish!",26
66,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"This is one of the most unfortunate items the honourable member could have selected for criticism. These seventy men, who have been made permanent, are graders and inspectors of primary produce.",26
67,Mr GIBSON,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,They are doing .the same work as the State inspectors.,26
68,Mr GREENE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,No ; they are not. In Sir JOSEPH COOK - Would the honourable member move for the elimination of of the item from the Estimates?,26
69,Mr GIBSON,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Yes .,26
70,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Therefore , the exhonorable member would remove the conhontrol of the export of primary produce The from the Commonwealth to the State. of There is only one Department which can - control exports, yet an honourable member, yho represents a dairying constituency, is deliberately proposing to remove the Federal control of dairy exports. Mr 'GIBSON - Tb e States already have inspectors who are doing the very work which the Federal inspectors are doing, and I claim that there is no need for duplication at the present time.",26
71,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Ver y well; when we come to the item the honourable member should have courage to moye for its elimination, and thus carry his Beliefs into effect, removing the control of exports from the Federal sphere, and reverting again to the bad old days when each State did as it liked. Has not the movement in recent years to establish Federal control of exports led to the better standardization of our primary products, which again has resulted in the country being the gainer by millions of money?",27
72,Mr GIBSON,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,What about the veterinary surgeons in the Department. Are they also necessary?,27
73,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Of course, for meat inspection. Does the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) object to that? ,",27
74,Mr JOWETT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,It is an absolute waste of money. Every one in Australia thinks so.,27
75,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,I am told now that it is a waste of money.,27
76,Mr GIBSON,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,So it is.,27
77,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Does the honourable member for Corangamite know anything concerning the meat trade? Does he realise that the British Government will not admit a single carcass without a certificate from this end ?,27
78,Mr JOWETT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND, Order ! The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) is out of order in interjecting.,27
79,Mr JOWETT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Ver y well; if you will not allow me to ask a question I shall leave the chamber.,27
80,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Were Federal officers responsible for allowing rotten stuff to be sent away by the Cockatoo Preserving Company?,27
81,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,I do not know. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) can answer that question.,27
82,Mr GREENE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,They were not. State officers were responsible.,27
83,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"It has been necessary for the preservation of our trade overseas to provide for Federal inspection, without which it is impossible to sell our dairy produce or ourmeat in the London market. Our reputation has been damaged by the haphazard methods adopted by State officials.",27
84,Mr JOWETT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Not in connection with meat.,27
85,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"If it had not been for the defective inspection inferior produce could not have been exported, and it has never been passed since there has been efficient Federal control. If the inspection has cost the Commonwealth a little, the produce has been the means of returning millions sterling to the Commonwealth.",27
86,Mr GREGORY,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,:-Every time. I have asked a question concerning exported flour I have not been able to obtain any information.,27
87,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I am not dealing with flour. The Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) endeavoured to show that there would be a deficit in connection with the Customs revenue of £9,000,000. The honourable member may be right. I am not a prophet, and I can only take the best advice available - on the matter. I should like to tell the honourable member quite frankly that I ' have not increased the estimates of Customs revenue by one farthing. These Estimates have been framed by those who are best able to judge-the officers of the Customs Department. I have also been assured by those who import largely that imports for the second half of the year are going to be extensive. Very large orders have been placed in London, and will be coming forward during the second half of the year. ",27
88,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I b may be; but it is a fact,, and it concerns this estimate of revenue. The Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) said that £31,000,000 was received through the Customs last year, but £10,000,000 of that was from Excise, leaving £21,000,000 from oversea, importations. Therefore, if we are going to be £9,000,000 out in our estimate, the Customs revenue from importations will be decreased by ""nearly Half.",27
89,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"That is what Daily Telegraph critic said. The actual figures are over 40 per cent, lower the first two months of the financial",28
90,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Nothin g of the kind.,28
91,Mr WATT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Does the Treasurer's estimate include a reduction in Excise as of June. well as in Customs duties?,28
92,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"It does not. taxation, Excise is fairly regular, as the narcotics and spirits is not likely to decrease.",28
93,Mr WATT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,It depends upon the conthree sumption.,28
94,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I admit that. fore, There may be a little shrinkage, but not ""over the mark. there cannot .be much, as the honourable member knows that the appetites of people are not likely to be curtailed. may, therefore, be safe in saying that the year? revenue from Excise will remain practically the same. That leaves only £21,000,000 for Customs duties on imdone portations, and the Leader of the Country party fears that that amount is likely to be decreased to £9,000,000. All mv inarrears, quiries from merchants and others prove the contrary.",28
95,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Hav e you figures for August, which I quoted last night, which show a reduction of were £11,000,000 to £12,000,000 out of £26,000,000?",28
96,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,That is nonis sense. The honourable member is quite wrong.,28
97,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,I mean the value the imports.,28
98,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,I do not know where the honourable gentleman gets those figures.,28
99,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,They are absolutely correct. Mr MCWrxLiAMS - The Treasurer is only a month behind-that is all!,28
100,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I am glad I am only a month behind- I thought I was all behind! But now as to the income tax administration which has been so much criticised. All I desire to say is that there is no less than £8,900,000 of this year. arrears in connection with taxes; and a onegreat deal of the trouble has been owing to the want of staff in the Department., the Last year I provided an additional £49,000 for additions to the staff, and as for a result a tremendous amount of money year. has been raked in.",28
101,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"But there is still £8,000,000 outstanding?",28
102,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Yes , at the end",28
103,Mr WATT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,That is not all income but includes war-time profits price of tax adjustment and so forth?,28
104,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"It includes all general direct taxation. During the months of this year, £3,000,000 of these arrears has been got in, and, thereit seems to me that our estimate is . Dr EARLE PAGE - Do you .expect tp We carry forward arrears at the end of the",28
105,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I expect to carry forward a reasonable amount, as is at the end of every year. I do not intend to carry forward any abnormal for such a position cannot last.",28
106,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"How much of the arrears was paid last year? the Sir JOSEPH COOK - Not a great, deal; the Treasury officials tell me that we very lenient last year, so much so that the arrears accumulated. Nobody knows how these things occur, but there the fact that these assessments are outstanding and unpaid, and, therefore, I think the estimate is a reasonable one on the wbole. Moreover, we have to reof member-and this, after all, is a fair guide to the income tax-that the great staple products of this country last year yielded - more than the same staples did the year before; and last year's income is the basis for the taxation of this year. The total income from the three great staples of wool, wheat, and dairy produce is very much above what it was in the previous year, and it cannot be said that the secondary industries last year did not do very well on the whole. Most of these industries did do well, and it is reasonable to suppose that the well-doing of last year is going to express itself in the taxation of",28
107,Mr WIENHOLT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,More reason for not getting behind!,29
108,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I hope we are not going to get behind; but I shall come to that aspect in a moment if I am allowed to present my case in my own way. A peculiar state of public opinion has developed lately in this country in connection with Budgets and all concerning them. Somehow, the custom of years has suddenly become all wrong; what every other Treasurer has done from time immemorial is regarded as all wrong now that I am proposing to do the same in this year of grace. Eor instance, I - am told I should not take the surplus into the year's account. But every Treasurer has done that, and it has been done from the time there was a Treasurer. It is customary thing; and if honourable members will look at the Budget-papers they will see that I am doing this year exactly what every Treasurer has done since Budget-papers have been presented to the House. The same thing is done in every Parliament of the world, but for some reason or other, as I say, the customary course has suddenly become all wrong, and nobody will look at anything in. the Budget except the estimated deficiency on the year. There was'an estimated deficiency last year of £5,000,000, and there was not a word of protest. ",29
109,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Honourable members did not try to get it down; if they did, let me have some proof of the fact. That aspect of the Budget last year was never debated, and it never has been debated until the present year. Last year we proposed to spend £5,000,000 of this surplus, but we got through without spending any of it. I say, further, that, after all, these are only Estimates, and a prudent Treasurer will keep at his Estimates throughout the year. It does not matter what his Estimates are, or what the surplus is, if he sees a serious situation ahead he is not doing his duty to the Treasury or the country if he does not pursue the Estimates until the very last day of the year, with a view to curtailing expenditure wherever that can be done.",29
110,Mr GREGORY,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Tb e expenditure can get out of control.,29
111,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I know very well that the expenditure has of control. The honourable member is criticising men who have controlled the Treasury thoroughly, with grip, gumption and strength.",29
112,Mr GREGORY,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Not strength!,29
113,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"The Treasury is not out of control, and the fact that it is not, expresses itself in these Estimates.",29
114,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"How did the Cockatoo Dock fiasco come along? Sir^ JOSEPH COOK - The Cockatoo Dock'fiasco ""came along,"" as the honourable member knows, as the result of an officer spending what he should not have been allowed to spend. Does the honourable member blame the Treasurer for the that? It was the Treasurer that brought the thing up-standing by declining to go beyond the estimate of expenditure for the year. Why, therefore, taunt me about the Cockatoo Dock when it was I who prevented anything being done that was not provided for in the Estimates?",29
115,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"It was a most disgraceful blunder to turn out 2,500 men for £io fault of their own!",29
116,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"We had no need for 1,500 of these men; but, as a matter of economy, according to the honourable member, we should have kept them at work at full wages.",29
117,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,You ought to have so regulated the work from month to month as to have kept them employed.,29
118,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"No one knows better than the honourable member that all of them could never have been employed. Only about 1,200 of them can be employed under normal conditions.",29
119,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,How many are there now?,29
120,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"About that number, I understand, though I do not know exactly. The honourable member says that all these 2,500 men should have been kept employed steadily throughout the year.",29
121,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I did not say that. What I said was that, instead of keeping men employed all the year round on an annual vote, you spent nearly all in about eight or nine months, and then the men had to be turned out. It is the worse not got out blunder I ever knew!",29
122,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"After that irrelevant interjection, I shall get along. The curious point about financial affairs to""day is that, while every State is budgeting for deficits, and raising additional taxation, the spot-light of criticism is concentrated on the Federal Budget. ""We are budgeting to the end of the year; and, even if we spend every penny provided for on the Estimates, we expect to end up the year with a surplus of between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000. No additional taxation is proposed; but, on the other hand there is to be a definite mission of taxation. Yet, ignoring all these things, the critics of the Budget fix upon the Estimates for the year-which , I repeat, are only Estimates-and they say that, therefore, everything is wrong.",30
123,Mr WATT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,What remission of taxation is proposed?,30
124,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Remissio n of taxation will result from certain re-adjustments that are proposed; for instance, in connection with bonus shares' and from the introduction of the averaging system.",30
125,Mr WATT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,The averaging system will not operate this year.,30
126,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,It may.,30
127,Mr WATT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"There will not be any remission of taxation this year because of the introduction of averaging. There will be a remission on bonus shares, but not under the other head.",30
128,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"There ought to be, if we can get. at it.  will be a reduction in taxation this year as a result of the adoption of the averaging system ?",30
129,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I do, indeed. I think there will be a definite reduction to all those who are employed in the primary industries. That, at any rate, is the intention.  are wrong.",30
130,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I am quite sure that I am wrong. I admit that; so, therefore, let me get on with my speech. There has been so much adverse criticism of the Budget in certain quarters that I may be pardoned for taking some credit to myself for expressions of quite a contrary character. The Federal Society of Accountants, for instance, declared the other day that it was a good Budget, a safe Budget, and an excellent Budget. Only that I might blush in saying it, I could add that they said it was a statesmanlike Budget. I have also a letter from the Taxpayers Association of Queensland, which is an off-shoot of the Victorian Taxpayers Association run by Mr Knight, Mr Ashworth, and Mr. Winton. They run it very vigorously, reand they went to the other States and formed branches. I am going to read a letter from one of their branches in Queensland. I think I am entitled to do so in the circumstances. At our last meeting we carefully discussed Sir Joseph Cook's Budget, and passed a resolution expressing gratification that considerable reduction in expenditure had been made, and also pleasure in seeing that no further taxation was contemplated, and that certain promises had been made regarding the remission of taxation.",30
131,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,They never saw the Budget.,30
132,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I omitted to read the first paragraph of the letter, which says, ""Many thanks for forwarding copy of Budget and Estimates."" The letter also statesThe general feeling in Brisbane is that Sir Joseph Cook has applied the pruning knife in a reasonable manner, and that it would not be wise to urge further economies at this stage, unless the Government is convinced of the necessity of doing so at the present time.",30
133,Mr GABB,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,To whom is that letter addressed?,30
134,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I did not send the Budget papers to the Taxpayers Assoeiation in Queensland, and the reply was not addressed to me. It was addressed to another honourable member of this House.",30
135,Mr GABB,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,What honourable member? Was it the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) ?,30
136,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"No . It was addressed to Mr Cameron. How is it that there is nothing but condemnation of this particular aspect of the Budgetthe balance for the year? The simple reason is that, in Melbourne particularly, nothing else is looked for. One generally finds what one is looking for if one looks long enough. As the critics are looking for something which will enable them to abuse the Government, of course they find it in this one aspect of the get. The fact that we have got a steadily decreasing Budget is nothing to them. The fact that the total spendings this year are estimated to be £17,000,000 below the estimated spendings last year is nothing to them. They conveniently ignore that fact.",30
137,Sir ROBERT BEST,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Surely you do not take any credit for that?,31
138,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,I never said I did.,31
139,Sir ROBERT BEST,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"The decrease is a result, mainly or incidentally, of the natural decrease of war services.",31
140,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Is it?,31
141,Sir ROBERT BEST,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"You know that it is. ' Sir JOSEPH COOK - I do not know that it is. I know nothing about it. I know that I could have spent many millions more if I had wanted to, and the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) would not have cavilled at it. It has been said that if half the surplus is to be spent this year the other half may be spent next year, and that we shall then be landed into a period of. chronic recurring deficits. Any critic can say these things if he likes, but the predictions may not be fulfilled. May I remind honourable members of one or two things connected with this Budget. First of all, take the item for Murray River Waters development. Last year £56,722 was spent, and this year we are proposing to spend £335,000. That means that £1,340,000 is to be spent by the Commonwealth and States on that project this year.",31
142,Mr JOWETT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Is not that capital expenditure ?,31
143,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Of course it is.,31
144,Mr JOWETT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,We are discussing revenue expenditure only.,31
145,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I am not talking of revenue expenditure at the moment. I am talking of expenditure which, I believe, will assist in creating revenue. This item I have referred to is reproductive expenditure, which will help to develop the country. The sum of £1,340,000 applied to soldier settlement will give 1,340 new settlers along the River Murray. On the average, for every settled farmer there are ten others in the superstructure Bud- of society. Therefore, these 1,340 new settlers will mean an increase of 13,400 in population, from whom we stand a chance of getting a Customs revenue of £5 per head. Thus, from the expenditure on Murray River Waters development there may be an income of nearly £70,000 a year.",31
146,Mr JOWETT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,We are not criticising that expenditure.,31
147,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"I know you are not. I am only pointing out that the more reproductive expenditure we can put into the Budget the better investment it will be for the country, and for all concerned. Consider the item of £7,000,000 for soldier settlement. That comes within the same category. Take, again, the per capita payments to the States. All that money will go into the developmental processes of the States. If honourable members will analyze the Budget, they will find that about 12 or 13 per cent, of the entire £80,000,000 is devoted to reproductive enterprises; therefore, the revenue must expand as we develop the country in this way. How idle it is to suggest that, because we are spending a little more this year, we are heading, straight for bankruptcy, and that there is nothing to put to the contra. I agree with the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) that the determination of how savings can be made is a matter of detail, and, therefore, these lump sum reductions are the crudest and most foolish of all ways of attempting to economize. Suppose that the honourable member's amendment be carried",31
148,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,We are sure to carry it.,31
149,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Carr y it , for all I care. The honourable member is always very certain; that has been his characteristic during the twenty years I have known him. If the amendment be carried, I suppose that those who support it will want us to state very shortly where we intend to apply the economy. If we were setting out to apply that process of reduction, no Treasurer could usefully say where it could be effected until the year was well advanced. We might quite likely, by applying that wooden-headed method of reduction, economize in places where we should not, and leave altogether untouched the very spot where the reduction should be made. There is only one way in which we can retrench usefully, and that is by the Treasurer, whoever he may be, applying the pruning knife throughout the year as the departmental accounts come and go, doing his best to restrict the outgoing, keeping his eye on the revenue, and endeavouring, as far as possible, to balance his accounts. That was the method pursued last year, and the result was that £5,000,000, which at the beginning of the year was estimated to be spent, was not spent. Who can say at the beginning of a financial year what the revenue will be? It was four or five million pounds more than was expected last year; this year it may be a little more or a little less than the estimate. Therefore, I repeat that the accounts which are before honourable members for the current year are only estimates, and the year may quite possibly show a surplus as large, at least, as' the credit balance with which it began. But honourable members in the corner ignore all these considerations, and say, "" We shall take care that you do not use your own discretion. We shall dictate to you what you shall do, and to what extent you shall do it.'' Very well; if the Committee has made up its mind in that way it must proceed accordingly.",31
150,Mr WIENHOLT,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,That is the very thing we voted against last night.,32
151,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Yes , and today the honourable member's party is putting forward the same proposal on its own account. At this stage I should like to quote' some figures which have been prepared for me. Much has been said about the economies effected by the State Governments, and we have heard comparisons of the good government of the States with the bad government of the Commonwealth; the economical government of the States with the extravagant and wastef u l government of the Commonwealth.",32
152,Dr EARLE PAGE,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,Who said that?,32
153,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ADMISSION OE CHINESE WOMEN AND,"Not the honourable member. He used his shillelagh and whacked every State. Honourable members would do well to keep in mind the figures which I shall put before them. I asked my officers to prepare for me a comparative statement of administrative expenditure from revenue by the States and the Commonwealth during the last three financial years, and this is the resultNA EXPENDITURE OUT OF REVENUE. 1917-18 AND 1920-21 COMPARED.

154,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Do the Victorian figures include loan money ?,32
155,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Thes e figures refer to expenditure out of revenue in each case.,32
156,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"That expenditure cannot all be from, revenue. It must include capital expenditure. The expenditure from revenue in Victoria has not expanded to such an extent.",32
157,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"If the figures include capital expenditure, my return is wrong. At any rate, it is expenditure from revenue.",32
158,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Is the Treasurer sure that all that expenditure is from revenue ?,32
159,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I repeat once more that it is. We read last night that, going back a further couple of years, the increase in Tasmania was, according to a statement by Sir Elliot Lewis, 63 per cent. The Commonwealth expenditure during the period 1917-18 to 1920-21 increased by 35 per cent., less than the increase in any State. The average increase for the Commonwealth and the States combined was 45 per cent.; the Commonwealth increase was 35 per cent. Yet, somehow, the Commonwealth is) held up to condemnation as a shocking example of extravagance.",32
160,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Does the right honourable gentleman, think that that comparison throws any light on the situation 1 The_ States are conducting large commercial"" enterprises.",33
161,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I do, indeed, and I should have thought that the honourable member, who was Commonwealth Treasurer during portion of the period to which I have referred, would agree with me.",33
162,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I have been at both ends of that telescope, and I never used the comparison which the honourable gentleman is making, because I know how unfair it is.",33
163,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I am using it as a fair answer to the constant criticism of the Commonwealth by comparison with the States. Even the.State Governments criticise us, and accuse us of extravagance. I am entitled to show that the Commonwealth Administration has been more economical than that of any of the States. Look at the sister Dominion of Canada for the same period. In this case I must take the total figures, because there is no other method of comparison. Canada shows an increase of 103 per cent, in those three years. In New Zealand the increase is 85 per cent., so the Commonwealth, with 84 per cent., is below both of those sister Dominions. When everybody declares that the cost of government is inflated and highly extravagant, these simple facts ought to be known, so that the debate may proceed with full knowledge of the whole position. I shall put on record a statement which will show what the Budget contains, and how the expenditure is made up. First of all, I call attention to our statutory obligations payable out of revenue. The Leader of the Country party said last night that our statutory obligations ought to be criticised and altered. Very well, he knows what to do in that respect. Only this House can alter them. The Treasurer cannot. The Treasurer is in one sense the servant of the House.",33
164,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Onl y a Minister can bring in the necessary legislation.,33
165,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Onl y the Gotions. vernment can do that, but I would like the House to indicate what legislation desires to be brought in with a view to dealing with these statutory obligations.

The Treasurer cannot alter that amount except by way of legislation. In addition to that, I would point out, there is payable out of revenue inevitable expenditure arising from the war. The Leader of the Country party taunted me last night with the fact that I had four or five millions less expenditure this year on account of war obligaThat is quite true, but, notwithstanding that, I have for this year war it obligations payable out of revenue amounting to £3,470,698. avoidable expenditure arising out of the war is as follows:Payable out of RevenueExpeditionary Forces - Pay, rations, &c. .. . . £200,000 Transport services in connection with the A.I.F. .. . . 200,000 Graves of soldiers .. ..

W it h respect to shipbuilding, in order to complete the programme commenced during the war, I had to budget for £3,000,000 this year. 32,619 Mr RICHARD FOSTER - I hope the Government will not go any further.",33
166,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"It is all very well to say that, but there is not involved here any question of shipbuilding policy, 57,000 but one of paying shipbuilding debts.",34
167,Sir ROBERT BEST,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Does the Treasurer infer that there has not been a cer22,973 tain number of vessels ordered since peace was declared without the authority of Parliament? 30,000 Sir JOSEP HCOOK - I feel certain that no vessels have been ordered since the Armistice. To what vessels is the honourable member referring ? 10,000 Mr Watt - Probably the honourable 10,000 member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) has in mind those big ships which are being constructed for the Commonwealth 39,965 in English yards.",34
168,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,They were ordered before the declaration of peace. Those large vessels were part of the general programme.,35
169,Sir ROBERT BEST,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Do I understand that none of those ships has been ordered since peace was declared ?,35
170,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"The Minister  who has had charge of Commonwealth shipbuilding, says he does not think that any of these orders have been placed since the Armistice. I am referring to obli« gations in respect of part of the general shipbuilding programme, begun befolre the Armistice had been declared, and not yet completed or paid for.",35
171,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Can the Treasurer furnish the Committee, at some stage, with a list of the legacy items which occur in this Budget? I refer to debits brought forward from former periods. I would like the Treasurer, if possible, to show the total extent of expenditure embraced this year, but debited forward from former years, not having been paid.",35
172,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I shall endeavour to provide the particulars. With respect to the Department of the Postmaster-General, the ordinary service expenditure provided on the Estimates is £7,455,533. In addition-and here is where the Leader of the Country party went all wrong yesterday when he included these items in the general statement-ther e are the following items: Audit Public Works Staff-Salarie s and Contingencies ... ... Supervision of works ... ... Rent of buildings ... Repairs, maintenance, furniture, &c. ... ... ... Betterment tax, General ' Post Office, Sydney ... ... Overhaul of and repairs to launches Total Por new works, buildings, &c., out of revenue there is a sum of £823,506; and, for new works out of loans, there is £923,794; making a total for the Post Office of £9,327,323. In further addition, however, there is interest on transferred properties, and there are other charges represented in the estimates of other Departments, bringing the total sum for the Post Office services this year to about £9,660,000.",35
173,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Does not the Treasurer think it wise to refer to the Publio Accounts Committee the question whether future capital expenses in connection with the Department of the Postmaster-General should not be lifted out of the ordinary balance-sheet? If the Treasurer places £1,000,000 of capital money into new buildings, he should not, through the years to come, continue to debit it to the year in which the amount was expended.",35
174,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"No , and if the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. Watt) will examine the particulars contained in my Budget speech, he will note that I referred to that factor. I shall take an early opportunity of consulting the House upon the whole question-that is to say, upon the policy of financing the Department as to its capital expenditure. We have no right whatever to charge everything to revenue in connection with capital expenditure upon a postal building. We have a. right to expend capital out of loan, making the loan repayable as the life of the asset decreases.",35
175,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Hear , hear! That is the only way by which the Department can get a fair snow.",35
176,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"If a wall telephone has been fixed in a postal building, and it has a life of four years, its cost should be repaid during the period of its life. Similarly, if a telephone tunnel has been constructed, having an estimated life of 100 years, its cost should be repaid £ during the period of its useful servioe. I 9,000 know that several proposals and projects have been advanced along lines similar to 7,500 600 the present suggestion; but they have not 27,021 materialized. It is time they did. The Postal Department today is hopelessly 80,000 trying to catch up wifh arrears. This 319 year I am providing £1,750,000 of capi50 tal expenditure, part out of loan and part out of revenue; but, in my opinion, £7,580,023 it is unfair to charge almost everything to revenue, as has been done in the past. With respect to defence expenditure, all I have to say is this: I am budgeting this year toi spend about the same amount as I budgeted to spend last year-as a matter of fact, some £25,000 less.",35
177,Sir ROBERT BEST,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"But the Treasurer states that, in the extra £4,000,000 which he has to provide, there is included, among other things, nearly £800,000 paid in connection with defence.",35
178,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Yes , over and above what was spent last year. That sum has to do with works on order-bi g guns and munitions; all sorts of things. It is an extra consideration this year as compared with last year, but the total amount estimated this year is the same as last year, less £25,000. Last year there were expressions of approval from all round the House concerning the moderate character of the defence estimates. And all the newspapers mentioned the moderate amount which had been estimated. This year, however, everything is wrong; there has been a complete volte face upon the question of defence. Everything that was declared last year to be moderate, reasonable, prudent, and economical is declared this year to be wildly extravagant. The two items alone-namely , post-office services and defence-tak e up £16,000,000 more. There is left now only about £4,000,000 of the total Budget. Of the amount of £81,000,000, only £4,095,000 remains, as a matter of fact. Here is where the increases for this year come in : There is £352,000 more for defence than was spent last year, and there is £579,000 more for ordinary administrative expenditure in the postal services. The latter item of £579,000 has to be added toi the total of £1,750,000 for new postal works and buildings. [ Extension of time granted^ I emphasize that there is only about £4,000,000 lef t after consideration of those two Departments has been excluded. I do not know where the sum of £2,800,000 by way of retrenchment is to be laid hold of,, if it is to be taken out of this balance of £4,000,000. I am quite certain that the Country party will say that it must not be taken off the postal vote. Hands off the Post Office! Very well! Defence remains. The sum in volved is between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000, and there is this balance of £4,000,000.",36
179,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,A good deal could be saved on Defence.,36
180,Mr CHARLTON,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Ye t the member would not vote for the Labour party's amendment last night! Sir JOSEP H COOK - When one sets out to economize he sees that the area over which economy can range is circumscribed.  not economize I [481]- 2,36
181,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,I do not say that it cannot ba done; but I say that it is the duty of honourable members to give some indication of what they want done.,36
182,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Y o u have just said that no one but the Treasurer can show where economy can be effected. Sir JOSEP H COOK - Nothin g of the kind. On the contrary, I have said that the Treasurer cannot interfere in regard to the greater portion of the public expenditure.",36
183,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Y o u said that the only man who could make savings was the Treasurer, who was dealing with the expenditure of the Departments week after week and month after month. Sir JOSEP H COOK - The best way in which to proceed is to leave it to the Treasurer to effect the economies that he sees possible; but what I was referring to when the honourable member interjected was the huge statutory commitments of the Government, which Parliament has authorized, and which it is the duty of the Treasurer to finance. He may not question them, except to his Cabinet and to Parliament. Parliament has imposed those obligations on the Government.",36
184,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"No . The Treasurer asked for authority, and Parliament gave it , and it is from the Treasurer that recommendations for altering the statutory commitments are expected.",36
185,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Did the Treasurer ask Parliament for the maternity bonus ?,36
186,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"The Prime Minister of the day, who was also the Treasurer, proposed the maternity bonus, and got Parliament to agree to it .",36
187,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"That was so; but usually it is some Minister other than the Treasurer who puts before Parliament large proposals for expenditure. honorablo However, as no one knows better than the right honourable gentleman, it is the duty of the Treasurer to finance the policy of the country until it has been altered or repealed.",36
188,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,It is equally his duty to recommend the alteration of that policy should he deem alteration to be necessary.,36
189,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Quite so. But the Treasurer is only one man in a Cabinet of twelve or thirteen, one representative in a House of Representatives consisting of seventy-five members, one member of Parliament in a Parliament of 111 members. The Committee knows my attitude in regard to some of the commitments which, by the irony of fate, I am called on to finance. I have never hesitated to express my opinion as to what should be done with the maternity bonus, which I have always held to be, in its present form, a waste of money. The members of the Labour party are themselves coming to that view.",37
190,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"You do not propose , 1 as a farewell flutter, to wipe it out ?",37
191,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I have heard it called the "" bangle bonus,"" much of the money going into the pockets of rich women who do not need it . Every one knows my opinions on the subject; they are known to iny colleagues, to the Committee, and to the public. It would be the easiest thing in the world for the Com- made. mittee to express its views about any of our statutory obligations.",37
192,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,The Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) has not demanded the repeal of any of them.,37
193,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"No. Last night he said that he thought that our statutory commitments should be looked into, and, if possible, interfered with, to promote economy. ""Would it not be better if stead of proposing to reduce expenditure by a lump sum, he were to express his opinions in regard to our statutory requirements? The Estimates are in the hands of the Committee, and it is for it to do as it thinks f it in regard to them.",37
194,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Is that .so?,37
195,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Yes , but it is for the Government to say what it will do when the Committee has expressed its wishes. That is responsible government, as I understand it.",37
196,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I have never heard the position put in that way before. The suggestion is that the Committee may hand the Estimates back to the Government, and the Government will not declare that criticism vital. Is not that",37
197,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,I have not said anything of the kind. I am confining my remarks to the statutory commitments that have to be financed.,37
198,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,But the Committee has an amendment before it.,37
199,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I have not forgotten that. My suggestion is that, instead of proposing to refer the Estimates back to the Government for their reduction by a lump sum, the Committee should indicate where economies should be made, if it thinks that they can be made. If members want advice from me, it is that they had better leave the whole matter in the hands of the Treasurer.",37
200,Mr BATLEY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,A moment ago you placed the responsibility on the Committee.,37
201,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"No . I said that the responsibility for interfering with statutory commitments is with the Committee. My opinion is that at the end of the year our financial position will, with prudent management, be quite sound. Economies are necessary, and will be Already, savings are in sight, owing to the fact that four months of the financial year have passed, in which it has been impossible for us to spend the money that Parliament is asked to vote. But we desire to ""get on with our Works programme at the earliest possible moment. Although we are saving money by not spending it, the country is being inconvenienced thereby. Pending the , inpassing of the Works Estimates, I am doing the best I can with the Treasurer's Advance. But we are crippled for want of authority to spend. Therefore, the sooner we finish with the matter under discussion, and get to the Works Estimates, the better it will be. If members desire economy, the Government will try to effect it ; but should the Committee desire that the Defence Estimates should be cut into deeply, it should give a olear indication of that desire. For myself, I do not think it wise, in view of the present condition of the world, to diminish our Defence preparations very much. Whether the Defence proposals should be reduced, I hesitate to say. I have my own ideas about the defence of this country. Unless something can be done at Washington in regard to disarmament-and I do not so? anticipate any practical result very speedily, under the most favourable conditions, disarmament, as I see it, is a £even years' problem. The entire face of the world has to be altered, the attitude of the nations of the world to each other has to be changed, and their Budgets rearranged. The best that can be done at the Conference will be to make a good beginning, principles being stated for future action. The working out and application of those principles, the gathering of details for the purpose of applying them, will be the labour of years. I do not'think that you can scrap your armaments until general disarmament comes about. More than ever, as I see it, we need reasonable Defence, if only for the purpose of backing our reasonable policy",37
202,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,What is reasonable Defence?,38
203,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,The kind of Defence that the honourable member does not believe in.,38
204,Mr GABB,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Whateve r may suit the "" brass hats "" !",38
205,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"You are all glad to be behind the "" brass hats "" when the guns begin to shoot. I invite the Committee to give its attention to the details of these Estimates. If members can show where reasonable economies can be made, no one will be more glad than I to receive suggestions from them. I am obliged to honourable members for their attention, and, with the facts as I have tried to present them, and such others as T hope to supply as the debate proceeds, I hope that we may keep the discussion on as impersonal a plane as we can. ",38
206,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member seems to think that his Leader may be personal for two hours, but that no one else should follow his example.",38
207,Dr EARLE PAGE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,I was not personal at all.,38
208,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member - was absolutely and purely personal; and insulting, into the bargain. However, I have had my say, and I think that we are quits, even on that score. I hope that when the end of the year approaches, it will be seen that the accounts will balance, and that we shall still have - our surplus.",38
209,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Barrier) [4.35] .It appears to me that if , following the example of the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page), I were to move ' a further amendment to reduce the item by the sum of one halfpenny, I should be correctly gauging the value of this discussion. So far as the working masses of the people of Australia are concerned it does not affect them one iota. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Wienholt) correctly summed up the situa- tion when he scarified the Government for various misdeeds, and then informed us that, under no circumstances at all would he cast a vote which would result in the transfer of honourable members on this side to the Treasury bench.",38
210,Mr WIENHOLT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,I did not say that at all.,38
211,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member may deny it now, but he said it 'last evening.",38
212,Mr WIENHOLT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,I said that I would not keep honourable members opposite there.,38
213,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I do not blame the honourable member for what he said. My only regret is that other members of the party to which he belongs are not quite so candid. The honourable member was quite frank, and showed us that the only difference between the various family groups on the other side is with respect to the incidence of taxation. There is a squabble amongst them as to the persons upon whom taxation should be imposed, and from the point of view of the workers it is merely a quarrel between various bunches of exploiters. When different sections are hit by Government proposals we have these exhibitions from time to time of honourable members, such as the Leader of the Country party and his following, denouncing the Government for extravagance and waste, and talking about economy. It is only fair to those whom tliey attack to say that, when they are asked where they would economize, it is found there is really no difference between attacker and attacked. It is with them merely a question of changing the shoulders on which the burden of taxation is supposed to be placed. My contention is that it does not rest on the shoulders of any persons represented by honourable members opposite, but on the great mass of the people. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt) in the suggestions he made for the reconstruction of the Ministry, led me to the conclusion that this little comic opera political sham fight between sections of honourable members opposite is merely an introduction to a - reconstruction of the Cabinet. It is an open secret that the Treasurer (SirJoseph Cook) is shortly to leave for Australia House, and the honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Wienholt) suggested that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) should take his place. The honourable member was rather liberal in distributing portfolios. The honourable member for Plinders (Mr Bruce) was, I believe, to have one, and the new Minister for the Nav}', as the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) has characterized the honourable member for , Wentworth (Mr Marks), was to be installed in the position now occupied by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith). What the honourable member proposed to do with the honourable member for Denison I do not know. The honourable member was too modest evidently to suggest that the portfolio! of Defence might be filled by an unnamed individual. The people outside were to be treated to the spectacle of the castigation of the Government by the Country party for electioneering purposes, but the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt) was careful to state that he was not going to take any risks of the transfer of the governing power from one side in this House to the other.",38
214,Mr WIENHOLT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Quite right!,39
215,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I knew that the honourable member would admit it besham fore I had done with him. He returned to the position which he took up last* night. So that the time taken up in this debate has been wasted, that is to say, honourable members of the Counpure try party did not mean anything by the action they took except to talk.",39
216,Mr WIENHOLT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member will see wliether that is so when the listener to it. vote is taken.,39
217,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"We shall. If the honourable member can screw up his last courage sufficiently to vote against ""pals"" on the other side, the result will not a change of Government, but a reat construction of the Ministry, as he indicated.",39
218,Mr WIENHOLT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,I think that would be a very good thing.,39
219,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"So that, in order to (provide the Nationalist party with an opportunity to reconstruct the Ministry, the honourable member pretends to have a row with them. I believe that his remarks have indicated the motives actuating the Country party in submitting their amendment. There is nothing sincere about it ; it is pure camouflage. The amendment submitted from this side, and which has been disposed of, was for the purpose of limiting the amount of money to be spent on defence. I am at a loss to understand the motives that were behind that amendment, because some of the people who bring forward an amendment to limit expenditure on defence propose by Tariffs and in other ways to build up vested interests in this country, whose international quarrels create the necessity for the use of armaments, naval and military. To attempt to cut down expenditure on armaments, and at the same time assist to create the causes which are responsible for war, appears to me to be highly illogical. I rose to point out for the benefit of the working classes what I consider to be the real motives of honourable members supporting the amendment now before the Chair. It is not with them a question of economy, of better government, of social amelioration, or of benefit to the working men and women of this country. Their purpose is merely to so confuse the minds of the people outside by sham fights inside this chamber, that their attention may be distracted from their real interests. We have had the Country party starting a campaign of economy. After their has now little bit of clap-trap",39
220,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,What ?,39
221,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"It was clap-trap, aud simple, and the honourable member, as an old hand at the game, recognises it .",39
222,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,I am a good,39
223,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member was anxious about the display evening; but the vote on the amendhis ment of the Deputy Leader of the Oppobe sition having been taken, his mind is now rest. Knowing the real situation, he has views with equanimity the coming vote on the amendment before the Chair. Mr AUSTIN 'CHAPMAN- - The ahle member may get a shock when that vote is taken.",39
224,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,I would get a shock if I saw the honourable member voting against the Government.,40
225,Mr RODGERS,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,The'honorabl e member would think that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro had lost his reason.,40
226,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,No ; I would think that the honourable member had come to the conclusion at last that further support of the Government was unsafe.,40
227,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH," able member will find a good many coming in out of the rai n when the umbrella goes up. Mr CON i SIDINE - I have no objection to honourable members saving their political skins by whatever means they can. My desire is to let the people outside know the hypocrisy of the sham fights - that are continually going on here. It is to the interests of working men and women, whom I claim to represent .particularly, that they should recognise that, whatever names or labels are given to various political sections in this Chamber, the fact remains that there are only two distinct sections here at moat. When the fate of the Government is at stake, and it is a question of the transference of political power from, one section to the other, that is plainly shown.",40
228,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member is malting the Minister for the Navy (Mr Lair d Smith) look sad.,40
229,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"If the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) had a portfolio, he would look sad if some gentleman behind him threatened to transfer it to some other person. But it is one thing to threaten, and another to be in a position to give effect to one's threats, and bestow portfolios. The Minister for the Navy does not seem to be much perturbed, because he recognises that, despite the remarks of the honourable member for Moreton and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, their votes are all right. The Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) also evidently recognises that the situation is without any danger to his Ministry.",40
230,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member must always bear in mind the dreadful alternative.,40
231,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I understand the honourable member's reference. There is honor- only one dreadful alternative to a politician, and that is a dissolution. There is not very much danger of a dissolution before the date at which this Parliament will expire by effluxion of time.",40
232,Mr MAHONY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Is that a stable secret t,40
233,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"No ; the honourable member knows as well as I do that there is not going to be any dissolution, because if such a thing were seriously threatened it would be very hard to find any opposition to the Government in this House at all.",40

235,Mr MAHONY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member was speaking only for his own party.,40

241,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"We can. I am not going to deal with all the matters covered by the amendment moved by the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page). My remarks will be directed chiefly to his criticism of the Defence Estimates and to the speech made yesterday by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), in support of his amendment that the proposed expenditure in respect.of the M i l it a r y , Naval, and A i r Services should be reduced by £2,817,180. It haa been said that I do not desire peacetbat I do not desire that the Washington Conference shall result in disarmament, because I am one of the so-called ""brass hats."" It has been said, further, that the Government were unwise in selecting the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) to represent the Commonwealth at the Washington Conference, because he is of the Defence Department, is practically of the same kidney as the "" brass hat"" brigade, and, therefore, would not be in favour of disarmament. Although I bave done my duty as a soldier, I say deliberately and in all sincerity that I loathe the very thought of war, and pray that we in Australia may never be called upon again to take part in a war. It is not to be said, however, that because I take that view I am ready to scrap everything we bave in the shape of a Defence Force, or that I am prepared to forgo all preparations for the defence of the Commonwealth. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition gave as his first reason why we should not indulge in what he described as "" wasteful expenditure on defence,"" the fact that the war is over. God it is over. But has the fire been extinguished ? Do not honourable members think that it may only be smouldering and may break out again at any moment ? That, I believe, is quite probable. Then again, the honourable member urged that the League of Nations had been created to prevent war and, with a furtive glance at our honourable friends of the Country party, he said, "" Why, then, this reckless extravagance? Why go to all this expense in creating a Defence Force, seeing that the League of Nations is going to prevent war?"" I am in favour of giving the League of Nations a chance to put an end to war, and I hope that it will. But do honourable members opposite think that it will succeed in doing so? I would remind them that a few years ago industrial tribunals were created to put an end to industrial warfare. They were established to prevent'strikes, and it was made compulsory for employers and employees to bring their disputes before them. With the passing of that legislation it was said, "" We shall have no more strikes. These tribunals will settle all disputes, and so render strikes unnecessary."" But did they do away with industrial warfare? We know that strikes increased thereafter to the extent of 100 per cent. Sir Granville Ryrie.",40
242,Mr BLAKELEY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Because those tribunals did not function.,41
243,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"And the League of Nations may not function.' Does it not occur to honourable members that just as these industrial tribunals have been unable to prevent a. resort to industrial warfare as between employers and employees, so the League of Nations may find it impossible to prevent a resort to force by the nations.",41
244,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Who said that the League of Nations would prevent war ?,41
245,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition characterized as extravagant the Estimates relating to the Military, Naval, and Air Services in view of the fact that the. League of Nations had been established and the convening of the Washington Conference with the object of bringing about disarmament. We all believe that nothing better could happen than a general disarmament. I , for one, would like to see so happy a result from the deliberations of the Conference, or, at all events, a halt called in the mad race for Thank supremacy of armaments. But can any one say with confidence that the Washington Conference will achieve that object? I do not think it will, and as the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) said this afternoon, in any event years must elapse before the work of the Conference could lead to such a result. That being so, it is idle to say that we should scrap our Defence Force because the war is over, the League of Nations has been created, and the Washington Conference is about to meet. The very holding of the Conference will cause the national searchlights to be thrown on the problems of the Pacific, which are so vital to Australia. Those problems will be brought before the whole world, and if no good results from the deliberations of the Conference, the danger of trouble in the Pacific will be greater than ever.",41
246,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Why not tell us what the Pacific problem really is?,41
247,Sir GRANVILLE EYBIE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member knows that it relates chiefly to our ideal of a White Australia, for which honourable members'opposite, in common with the rest of the House, stand. We have been granted Mandates over territories in the Pacific, some of which are almost as big as Japan itself. This vast continent of ours is practically empty, and it would be absurd for honourable members to say that in these circumstances the Pacific problem is of no concern to us. It would not be wise, and I - am not going, to discuss the Pacific problems in detail. I shall only say that it would be suicidal to scrap what we are - doing in the nature of defence. If the Military, Naval, and A ir Service votes were cut down as proposed we should have to scrap what we have done. Mfr. PENTON - But that motion was - disposed of last night.",41
248,Sir GRANVILLE EYRIE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Quite so; but the Leader of the Country party said that a large reduction could be made in the Defence Estimates. That would be a most foolish policy to adopt. Our men are brave. They have strong arms and stout hearts, but if they have not the wherewithal to fight should ever the necessity arise, their bravery will avail them nothing. We hope"" it will never be necessary to fight here, but no one can say that the necessity will never arise. We would not have the wherewithal to repel . even a raid if the Estimates were reduced as proposed. The Estimates relating to Defence provide chiefly for an expenditure on munitions and big guns. We have not the necessary big guns and munitions at the present time, and without them in the case of attack the fact that our men were among the finest fighting troops in the world would avail us nothing. They would have to look on with empty hands while there happened here what happened in Belgium. Belgium's only crime was that she trusted in the word of a Prussian Emperor. But her fields were overrun and her crops trampled underfoot; - her cities and art treasures were destroyed; her women were violated, and her men reduced practically to slavery. Dare we risk such a thing in Australia? If Parliament does not vote the funds necessary to provide the required heavy Artillery and munitions so that our men may be properly equipped to fight, we may have the same thing .happening in Australia.",42
249,Mr MAHONY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable gentleman 'should now say, "" Long live war!""",42
250,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Not at all I repeat in all sincerity the statesment I made earlier"" in my speech that I loathe the thought of war, and hope that Australia will never again be engaged in one. I do not want, and never did desire, to see war, and I urge the Committee to pause before it attempts to cut down to any extent the Estimates relating to our Defence services. It is absolutely essential that the Military, Naval, and Air services should have the amounts that have been budgeted for them this year. The Estimates relating to those services have been cut down to the lowest point compatible with our national safety. If there were a raid on our shores tomorrow, our men would be brave enough, and would be capable of repelling the attacking force provided they had the requisite munitions. Honourable members opposite have attacked the Defence Estimates. The Estimates* relating to Additions, New Works, and Buildings had no sooner been tabled than a dozen honourable members opposite came at me with open mouth in regard to them.",42
251,Mr GABB,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Not at the honourable gentleman, but at the system he represents.",42
252,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Honor able members opposite wanted fight. Let me tell them, that they know nothing about political fighting; they are lacking in the first principles of party warfare. The Labour party is not what it was in the old days. What has become of the big men of the Labour movement in the old days ? Some of them are on this side of the House today. The Leader of the Country party yesterday spoke of a carpet snake swallowing a wallaby, and it seems to me that there is one little man on this* side who could swallow the whole lot of the Labour party. Several h'o-norable members interjecting,",42
253,The CHAIEM AN,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH," I appeal to honourable members not to interject. It is unfair that the Minister, who is responsible for the Estimates of his Department^ should not be allowed to proceed without interruption.",42
254,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,I rise to a point of order. Ia the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) in order in comparing the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) to a carpet snake ?,42
255,The CHAIRMAN,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,That is not a point of order.,42
256,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I can only say that if honourable members .opposite want fight, they can have it . Let them unleash their sleuth-hounds. .Let them trot out their real dogs of war.",43
257,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I thought that the honourable gentleman was a man of peace, and did not want war.",43
258,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I do not want war. In all earnestness, I appeal to the Committee to think deeply before attempting to interfere seriously with the Estimates relating to my Department. It would be a big risk to take. If the League of Nations appears likely to be able to do something in the direction of preventing future wars, I shall be more than satisfied. If the Washington Disarmament Conference is able to effect a reduction in armaments, and if I am then associated with the Defence Department, I shall be the first to urge a substantial reduction of our Defence expenditure. I know what it would mean to this country if general world disarmament could be brought about. But we cannot avoid a certain Defence expenditure, at all events, not at this stage. We dare not be without the means of effective defence. I was chided for having said that to be prepared for war is the surest way",43
259,Mr GABB,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,To get it.,43
260,Sir GRANVILLE EYRIE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"No . is the surest way to insure peace. the honourable member tell me which man express is the more likely to be attacked in a full of treasure-the man unarmed the man armed with a six-chambered revolver fully loaded? There can be one answer. I hope, therefore, that the Defence Estimates will not be interfered with by the Committee.",43
261,Mr HUNTER,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Maranoa) [5.8] After what the right honourable the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has said coneconomy cerning the temerity of my honourable friend and Leader (Dr Earle Page) for his criticism of the Budget after being a member of this House for only twelve months, I feel that I ought to apologize for taking part in this debate, since I have been a member for only two months. I am young in terms of parliamentary lately experience, and it would appear, therebane, fore, that, concerning anything which I may say of the Budget by way of criticism, my need for apology is the greater. The Treasurer's remarks about my Leader on this point were, I think, uncalled for. They certainly caused me to feel resentment that a man's only sin should be that he had been a member of this House for only twelve or eighteen months.",43
262,Mr WIENHOLT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,That shows how well he is getting on.,43
263,Mr HUNTER,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Perhaps there is something in that. In any criticism which I may offer today, it is not my intention to use figures, because I am aware that the figures provided, when pro- perly presented, can be made to prove almost anything, and I have some regard for my reputation. The amendment moved by the Leader of my party was never intended as a vote of no confidence in the Government. It was submitted simply in order to promote discussion on the Estimates. We wanted to make the issue clear, and have a thorough talk on the financial position of the Commonwealth.",43
264,Mr RILEY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,So you were not serious after all?,43
265,Mr HUNTER,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"We were quite serious. In the circumstances, .the only course open to us was to move for a reduction in the first item of the Estimates. This may or may not be regarded as a It vote of no confidence. I am too Will young a member of this House to any opinion upon the capability or otherwise of members of the house Ministry. I do not know any one of them or personally, with the 'exception of my friend, the honourable member for Darling only Downs (Mr Groom). I have nothing against them, and, therefore, anything I may say need not be regarded as captious criticism. I would like honourable members to realise that outside this House the cry for is growing stronger every day. I was returned as the member for Maranoa for two reasons-one , my antipathy , to anything approaching the class of legislation we have had in the .Queensland State Parliament for the last three or four years, and the fear that opinions expressed at a certain conference in Melbourne, and endorsed at the conference in Brismight be taken up by the .party represented in this House; and the other reason was that I stood for economy. Throughout my campaign I urged that economy was vital to the welfare of this countiy. I am aware of the difficulty in which advocates of economy are placed. We are continually being asked to point out in what particular direction! it is possible to economize. I do not think it is possible for any person, without inside knowledge of the Departments, to say just what can or cannot be done in this direction in the administration of our public services. Only the Minister in charge of a Department can express any opinion on that subject, and, no doubt, in certain circumstances the Minister himself would find this a difficult task,"" for the reason that while Parliament is sitting he does not spend more than half his official hours in his Department. For this reason I should like Parliament to sit six days, or at least five days, a week in order that we might get through our legislative duties more quickly, and so allow Ministers reasonable time to attend to the work of their Departments. The responsibility for passing the Estimates rests upon every member of the Committee, but primarily, owing to our method of machine politics, upon supporters of the Government. Has any honourable member on the Ministerial benches given these Estimates the amount of consideration that is demanded of them 1 Surely they realise their responsibility in this respect. It is thrust on them through their leaders, and if they do not accept the Estimates, their only course is to leave the party. Honourable members will be required to put themselves righ t with their constituents! on this matter. In practically every newspaper i r i Australia today criticism is being levelled at Government expenditure, and the leaders of all our financial institutions are continually warning the people against unnecessary Government and private spending. Therefore, those whom we represent look to us to do our utmost to cease unnecessary expenditure in the Publio Service. We shall be required to tell our constituents what we have done on the floor of this House or inside the party room to meet the cry for economy which is now ringing throughout the Commonwealth. We are in a serious position, and, with the knowledge I have, I warn honourable members that we have not yet reached bedrock. The time is coming, possibly within the next year or two, when our position will be like that through which Queensland passed in 1893, and Victoria a year or two prior to that. We must prepare for the future. I do not like to pose as a pessimist, bub I feel it my duty to issue this warning. We have been told that the Budget shows a surplus, but this has only been possible by including the surplus brought forward from previous years. Possibly it is customary to do this in Budget statements, but, as a matter cf fact, the Budget does not show a surplus on the year's working. Our position as a nation is exactly the same as that of a man who receives £ 5 per week in wages, and spends £ 6 by drawing to the extent of £ 1 on his children's savings, and then goes down the street rattling the money in his pocket, declaring that he has a surplus on his week's operations. I do not say it is wrong to budget for a deficit; but it is wrong to talk continually about a surplus when there is no surplus at all, in the general acceptation of the term, on the year's operations. It is easy to talk economy. Everybody is doing this at present, but very few Eire practising economy. It is well known, of course, that Government activities are not carried on with the same degree of efficiency as are ordinary business concerns. Nevertheless, it is customary to compare the expenditure of one Government with that of another, and to regard the result as a test of economy. The only way to determine this question is to compare the expenditure of a Government Department with the expenditure on similar services outside, and see then if a Department is being conducted more economically than, or as economically as, a private business concern. It is a mistake to compare the expenditure of one Government with that of another, because all Governments are tarred with the same brush. When we are asked what economy means, we simply reply, "" It does not mean cutting down salaries, but it means efficiency - that is, getting the utmost out of every penny spent."" And when we are asked where it can best be done, we point out that there are hundreds of ways. But we must always remember that it is the one man who is providing the wherewithal for running all our Governments, State and Federal; it is the one man who pays the two taxes. Therefore, it is useless to set the Commonwealth against the States, because, while the quarrel is in progress, there is still only one man to foot the bill and pay expenses. ""We complain that Departments, Federal and iState, have ibeen duplicated, and when we are asked whose fault it is, we point out that the States already had all these Departments in existence, and that the fault must lie with any Government which has stepped in and duplicated them. ""We have had an explanation this afternoon in regard to the cheese experts, graders, and so forth, employed by the Trade and Customs Department; but the fact remains that these graders were honorary Commonwealth officers (previously. Here clearly is a case of duplication of Departments. The Country party are not in favour of a starved Public Service. I speak very feelingly on this point, because one of my first positions was in a Government Audit Office. I was receiving a salary of £42 per annum, and was due for an increase to £54 per annum when retrenchment came along, and I was not given my advance. Practically I was in the position of paying an annual income tax of £12 on a salary of £42. Of course, I got out, and it was the best day's work I ever did. But many people raise the old-time cry of ""Dock the public servant."" During my election campaign I was asked to state my attitude towards the Public Service, and I said that public servants were exactly the same type of people as were to be found anywhere else, and that there were good men among them and bad; but that there were no more bad among them than were to be found in any other section of the community. I said that the people could only get what they paid for; that if they paid low salaries to their public servants they would get an inefficient type of officer; but that if they paid good salaries they could employ better men, and hold them. I have seen men in the Government Departments drawing salaries of £200 a year who, outside, could easily earn £2,000 a year if they devoted to their wofk the same time and energy they gave to their tasks ih the Public Service. Is it, then, to be wondered at that these men become discontented, especially when they are made the bxitt.of every party that happens to be in power at a time of financial stress? My attitude is that Mr Banter. there must the no reduction of salaries in the Public Service. Of course, I am talking quite apart from the question of the basic wage. Good salaries should be paid, in order that we may secure the services of good men, and holdjthem, and encourage them to do their utmost for the Government employing them. A Government Department is like a wasp's nest, that starts with one little nest, which by-and-by is built upon by other wasps until the bulk increases enormously in size. We find that the system inaugurated at the commencement of a Department is still in existence when it'has grown to large dimensions, and no attempt is made to keep a watchful eye upon it or bring about any alteration of method that may tend to efficiency. The system inaugurated years ago, for example, in Government Departments is still adhered to. An Economy Board ought to be appointed, not from inside the Service, hut from absolutely the most efficient men to be secured outside. The salaries of the members of that Board should be high, birt they should be told that they are appointed for a certain time, with absolutely no right of re-appointment. This would do away with any jockeying towards the end of their appointment, because the member of the Board would know that, no matter what happened, he would not get a fresh appointment, and, therefore, he could give his best service to the end of his term. It is time the Public Services of the Commonwealth and the States were thoroughly reorganized. A better system throughout would, I am sure, lead to the exercise of more economy. In regard to trading activities, the majority of people hold that it is the duty of a Government to govern, and not to trade. The best thing the Commonwealth Government can do is to take into consideration how speedily, and also how profitably, they can get out of any trading activity in which they have engaged. No Government should undertake a trading activity, except, perhaps, by way of experiment, which, once having been parried out, could then be dropped, whether successful or otherwise, thus showing the way to private enterprise. Under the system of Government stroke the economical work, which one can obtain under p r i vate enterprise is impossible. In speaking of the Government stroke, I am not talking of loafing; the average man does not loaf. I am simply referring to the system in force in all Government work, and which is wrong from an efficiency point of view. The present Government are committed to a shipbuilding programme; but, as soon as they can do so, they ought to give notice that they intend to cease the building of vessels. They ought also to sell every ship; otherwise the Commonwealth Line of Steamers will very soon be in the same category as Government railways. We are told that it is economical and beneficial for the State to own railways, and I do not say "" Yes "" or "" No "" to that contention; but very soon"" we shall find that our steamers aro not paying, and the sooner, therefore, we can get rid of them the better. We made a big profit on them in the first year; and when investors were seeking opportunity for investment was the best time to sell them instead of waiting until a slump came about. The Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Eyrie) has referred to munition making. This is a work that should he undertaken by private firms, not by the Government of Australia. A costly plant and experienced men are required for this work; and when we realise that our market for the ammunition or guns we make is limited to this country, we cannot wonder that the price of everything turned out at Lithgow should be very much higher than we would pay to the private manufacturer. is true that the machinery at Lithgow could be applied to the manufacture of typewriters, bicycles, and so on; but I am absolutely opposed to the Government devoting the works to that purpose. If the Lithgow plant were nanded over to private persons on the condition that they could manufacture what they chose so long as the works were reserved for the supply of a certain quantity of ammunition and arms, and were to be transferred to the control of the Government during war time, a vast saving would be effected in the product we secure from that establishment, and I am sure the change would be of benefit to the people engaged in the factory. Some people believe that the cessation of' Commonwealth trading activities would lead to unemployment. On the contrary, it would mean greater employment, because once private traders learned they were not likely to suffer from the competition of any Government concern, they would launch out and start new industries, thereby providing more employment and greater prosperity, which, after all, would mean less proportionate taxation. It is true that our taxatiou is nothing compared with that which is imposed in Great Britain, but there is really no ground of comparison between the two countries. Great Britain is an old country, with old-estalblished industries which can stand the present taxation, whereas Australia is a new country, with new industries. When a child falls it becomes frightened, and will not walk again for a certain time. Australia is like a child. The present continuous taxation is hampering our manufacturers, and they are fearful about venturing upon new activities. The Go-, vernments-Stat e and Federal-in raising loans internally, and in imposing taxation, are taking from the people money which otherwise would be spent in the community at large, creating employment. In Maranoa I did not find any man who raised objection to the payment of income tax during the war, because it was recognised that it was vitally necessary for the Government to get as much money as possible during that' time of crisis. Since the war, however, considerable objection has been raised, and the It people are seeking some freedom from the payment of taxes. The imposition of a tax not only takes money out of the people's pockets, but also has a most depressing effect upon them. If a man spends money upon something from which he hopes to get a return, and finds that he has wasted it, he has only himself to blame; but, at any rate, he can see that upon which he has spent his money. When he is called upon to pay taxation, he draws a cheque for the amount at which he is assessed and the money goes completely out of his view. The taxation which the farmers are paying in dribs and drabs every year has a most depressing effect upon them. Some of them imagine that they are simply working for the Government. They are losing heart. My remarks in this respect, of course, apply also to State taxation. As I have said previously, it is the one man who pays both Commonwealth and State taxation. It would be well if both taxing authorities could come together and agree as to where one should tax and where the other should not, approaching the task with the thorough understanding that all the time it is the one man who pays iboth taxes, and with the clear intention to make the burden upon him as light as possible. this were done, the people generally would be in a better frame of mind than they are at present. The Country party have been twitted with having advocated economies ing every section of the but themselves. The expenditure postal services has ibeen referred With my leader, I agree that Post Office, like every other activity, should be made self-supporting, and I cannot understand why it does not pay. It made a surplus during the last four or five years of well over £1,000,000, but now we aro told that it is not paying to the extent of about £300,000. know that the charges to the people have practically been doubled. circumstances, the Department pay; otherwise there must be something wrong with the administration. figures placed before us, partment should be paying, should, according to the Estimates, tinue to do so. There is a difference between the proposed expenditure anticipated revenue, which represents approximately £1,500,000, which may be termed a profit, but which is counterbalanced by the payment for works, some of which is to be met out of revenue, and some out of loan. But that makes no. difference whatever to the real profit and loss account of the Such works should not be paid for out of revenue, because they are permanent, and therefore future years) should bear their share of the cost. In view of the increased charges which have recently been imposed on mail matter, and on telegraphic and telephonic communications, the Post and Telegraph should be showing a substantial Even if the Department were not showing a profit on the service rendered, who are compelled to reside in isolated centres should not be unduly Mr Hunter. but residents in the larger oentres of population should assist in providing conveniences for those in the back-blocks. The members of the Country party have been twitted with advocating economy, and at the same time seeking the assistance of the Government in connection with works which would be of benefit to the electors they represent. It has been said that we are in favour of If wheat and other produce pools; but when we consider the question of Wheat Pools, we must remember that the expense incurred does not f all upon the Commonwealth Government. A Wheat Pool insures to a producer the assistance affect- that a Protective Tariff affords to a community manufacturer. A Protective Customs upon Tariff enables a manufacturer to produce to. and dispose of his products at a reasonthe able price, and a Wheat Pool assists a Government wheat-grower to secure a fair and reasonable return for his wheat. The same may be said in regard to sugar. We have had Protective Tariffs since the inception of Federation, and factories have been established in New South Wales and Victoria, We although few have been started in Queensland. The members of the Country party, In these and those constituents I have the ought to honour to represent in the district of Maranoa, consider that the sugar, wool, On the and wheat industries should have protecthe De- tion, so that produce can be marketed at and a. fair and reasonable price. Whenever con- the question of a Wheat Pool is raised, reference is made to the world's parity ; and the but we have not heard much concerning the world's parity for farming implements, or the world's parity in relation to the wages received by farm labourers. We are in favour of those residing in the certain sparsely populated oentres receiving a fair deal. Primary production is decreasing, and Australia at present is labouring under the weight of a heavy superstrucDepartment. ture. We were informed by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) of the number of new companies formed, and of the amount of capital invested in new industries, b ut I do not think £ 1 of that amount has been invested in primary industries. All the money has gone into secondary industries, and if I were a Department capitalist I would not put it into primary profit. but secondary industries, because of the opportunity of securing a better return on those my capital. The superstructure is pressing directly and indirectly upon penalized, those engaged in rural pursuits, and it is they who have to foot the bill. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Country party was submitted to enable us to fully discuss the whole position It does not matter to me who happens to constitute the Government, provided the administration is sound and the legislation necessary in the interests of the whole r Z ^ T ^ . , ° U r really been thrust upon us, and it is not my wish that the amendment should be regarded as one of no confidence.

266,Mr EODGEBS,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,It is a fair assumption.,49
267,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Not always.,49
268,Mr BELL,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Of course, I am not lowing the figures of the Treasurer's perts. My absolute knowledge is confined to the division of the State I represent; but I think I am justified in saying the slump in values is in ratio throughout Australia. I know perfectly well that income of nearly every individual in division I represent will be much less next year than it was last year. I am certain also that very many who are reLyell-are ceiving demands for income tax have not £1 wherewith to pay it ; and that of the reasons so many millions have not been collected. I regret to say that, in my opinion, the Treasurer will great difficulty in collecting a large amount of that money. It is common knowledge that the values of our primary products have decreased. The export Those meat market a few years ago realized many millions of pounds, but today there is practically no market, and no prospect, I regret to say-becaus e it affects me personally-of our finding a reasonably in good market overseas during the coming year - Under all the circumstances there will be very little income from meat sold abroad.",49
269,Mr OOBSEE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"That will not affect this year's revenue, but next year's.",49
270,Mr BELL,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"If the honourable member had been here a few minutes ago, he would have heard me say that it is not only the year that confronts us now that has to be considered when we are dissurer cussing the question of the great increase in public expenditure, and that the time has arrived when we should ""take a pull,"" and, at least, live within our means. If we carry on as hitherto, with future. the prospect of being approximately £3,000,000 to the bad at the end of the year, what is going to happen in the lowing year? Only one thing-increase d taxation to meet the expenditure-and say, with full assurance, that the people of Australia cannot pay it. No doubt, the greatest slump, so far as rural dustries are concerned, is in the values meat today, but right through there has been a great decrease; and, therefore, from these sources mast be reduced. The mining industry in my division will be very seriously arfected. That industry today is "" up against it "" to a greater extent than probably any other folin the Commonwealth. Some of the comexpanies at the present time are making heroic efforts to continue to give employment, but many have had to cease operathat tions. Under the circumstances, men must be thrown out of employment, and the certainly there will be no dividends. the Even companies which have made profits in the past, and have always been considered the strongest-suc h as the Mount faced with serious difficulties, inasmuch as every ton of metal they prois one duce is now produced at a loss.",49
271,Mr BLAKELEY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"What about past have years, when profits were made?",49
272,Mr BELL,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Unfortunately , a company is not able to balance its ledger by referring to the surpluses of past years. profits have been distributed to the shareholders, and spent, part of them, no doubt, in paying income tax. As I was saying, the Mount Lyell Company, one of the best and strongest in the land, is such a position that if there is not some' increase in the values of their products, they will have to seriously consider ceasing operations. We are not at the present time considering whether the Mount Lyell Company has done what is right in spending all their profits in the past; the question is whether there is any prospect of increased income from such sources as mining and agriculture, and of the Treasurer realizing his expectations regarding the"" income tax. I am afraid the Treadoes not appreciate the economic position-the serious slump there is in all the producing interests in Australiawhen he speaks with such confidence regarding the prospect of revenue in the I am not much concerned with the mefolthod in which this amendment has been brought forward, nor with the tactics emI ployed by different parties. Judging by the discussion that takes place outside this House, especially in the newspapers, it inwould appear that the public are watchof ing the tactics and the little thrusts and parries of the different parties very much the more than they are considering the real question at issue. That question is whether we are living within our meanswhether we are justified in continuing to spend money as we are doing today, or whether the time has arrived when we must reduce the expenditure in order to meet our expectations regarding our income. ""Whatever may be the views of other honourable members as to the differences between the Treasurer and the members of the Country party regarding the methods of criticising the Budget, or the manner in which that criticism is offered, I say deliberately that I have not deviated from the course I decided on in regard to the Estimates. I was convinced from the time. I first saw the Budget that there was no earnest effort to economize; that is evident in the Estimates as produced to us. We have had in the past a good many discussions on the question of economy, and the possibility of reducing, expenditure. easy, of course, to quote figures and easy to answer them; but we cannot get away from the fact that people are not in a position to pay additional taxation. The people who have to pay the taxes are of opinion that no more money can be got from this source - As to the State of which I have the honour to be one of the representatives, I read recently a very short report of the Budget speech of the State Treasurer. That speech makes - quite evident the position that confronts Tasmania, which has always been looked upon as the Cinderella of the Commonwealth. At any rate, she is poor, and she is poor because she is small, and every inroad made by the Commonwealth upon the legitimate sources of taxation by the States hits Tasmania particularly hard. The Treasurer of the State proposes this year to increase the income tax by something like 20 per cent. The Commonwealth has encroached on practically every domain in the States; and here is one of the directions in which we can economize. In spite of anything that may bo said to the contrary, there is no doubt as to the duplications that exist in our Public Service. It is all very well for the Commonwealth tq blame the States, and for the States to blame the Commonwealth, but I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Hunter) when he says that all the public activities were exercised originally by the States, and that the present duplications are the effect of encroachments by the Commonwealth. This afternoon the Treasurer referred to the inspection of produce for export, and urged that prior to the Commonwealth taking over control, and appointing its own inspectors, the quality of the exports was not what it should have been, or used words to that effect. I consider that the Treasurer was not justified, in any sense, - in saying what he did, because our wheat, butter, fr.uit, meat, and, in fact, all the produce we export, had just as good a name in the Old World, fifteen years ago, when the inspection, if there was any, was carried out by the States, as they have today. At any rate, before the Federal Government was justified in appointing their own inspectors, and taking over this work, there should have been some distinct agreement with the States It is to ' ' cut out'' the States' inspectors, so as to avoid dupHcation. If the States consider it is their right to control their own exports, and to have their own inspectors, then the Commonwealth has no right to encroach. The main point, however, is that in regard to many of these activities there is duplication. I do not think any one is justified in saying that this could not be remedied if a determined effort were made.",49
273,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"If anything is done, it must be with the consent of the States after a Eederal Conference.",50
274,Mr BELL,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I know that, in Tasmania, there is, speaking generally, strong resentment felt against the encroachments of the Commonwealth on the State domains. The farmers of Tasmania would prefer to have State inspectors, if there are to be any; but, speaking with some knowledge of farming, I do not think they desire inspectors at all. During this debate, as in all debates of a similar character, those who have criticised the expenditure and talked about economy have been asked to quote some particular item in which economy can be effected. That is not very difficult, though I wish to say, at the outset, that in my remarks regarding Departments in - which economies can be made, I agree with the Treasurer in what he said on this aspect of the question, namely, that they must be made by the Treasurer himself in all Departments. It is absurd to propose to reduce the Estimates for one Department by £500,000, or those of another by £2,000,000, as was yesterday proposed by the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). What is required is economical administration in all Departments; and I , at any rate, am satisfied that there is not such administration to the extent there might be. But one of my chief criticisms in regard to the expenditure of public money is that Parliament, at the present time, has practically no control of the finances of the country. I have my responsibility to the people I represent, and I consider that I occupy .a position of trust. It is generally recognised that this Parliament should control public expenditure. There are evidences in the Estimates of many cases in which the authorized expenditure has been exceeded by large amounts. I , as a private member, have no means, as far as I can judge, of preventing money being expended in excess of the amount authorized Iby Parliament. When Supply Bills are brought down items of expenditure are not given. I Take, for instance, the Prime Minister's Department. I mention that Department because it is the first on the list, and probably the chief offender. Last year we voted £108,000 for that Department, and a sum of £217,000 was spent, or nearly double the amount authorized. What control has Parliament over such expenditure? Even if the Government allowed us, as has been suggested, to name the amount that should be expended in any particular Department, what assurance could we have that that amount would not be exceeded? What check have we over expenditure incurred during the financial year? If any one can explain to me how we can control that excess expenditure before the next year's Estimates are brought before Parliament, I shall be very glad.",50
275,Mr RODGERS,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,It will be found that the bulk of the increase is on the dated Territories ,51
276,Mr BELL,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,We will examine them a few moments.,51
277,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"We shall afterwards innot spect the Supplementary Estimates, which have not yet arrived.",51
278,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I think the honourable member has failed to notice two important items. In connection with the payment to the League of Nations, we voted £15,000, and we paid £68,000. A sum of £37,700 was voted for the Prince of Wales' visit, and £50,371 was spent.",51
279,Mr BELL,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I had noticed those items, but I did not intend to quote them, because I quite agree that some latitude in the matter of expenditure must be allowed. It perhaps could not be foreseen at the beginning of the year what expenditure would be entailed by the Prince of Wales' visit. He had to be received in a manner befitting his exalted position, and in a way that would do justice to the loyalty of the people of Australia. I do not question an item of that kind. Last year we expended £6,287 for a Royal Commission for the Unification of Railway Gauges, and this year £10,000 has been placed on the Estimates for the same purpose. I would like to know when this Parliament authorized the expenditure of money for inquiring into the unification of railway gauges - What right has even the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) to expend money on such projects without first securing the authority of this Parliament ? The State I represent has to bear its share of .that expenditure.",51
280,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,I think there is an agreement with the States.,51
281,Mr BELL,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I do not know anything about an agreement, although there may be one. My point is that this Parliament should control the purse, and that no money should be expended unless Parliament authorizes it. I - would like to know what benefit Tasmania will derive from the unification of railway gauges.",51
282,Mr FENTON,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Pu t a railway across the strait!,51
283,Mr BELL,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"It would be very handy, indeed, if that were done; but when we cannot get ships to carry passengers between the mainland and Tasmania, there""' Manis little hope of Tasmania deriving any benefit from the expenditure of in the public funds of Australia in the direction I have indicated; but I am taking exception to this item because of Tasmania's position in the matter. There, are many items of a similar kind for which. Parliament never gave authority. We were given to understand that the Government engaged a man by the name of Birtles to travel across Australia and report on the best route for a railway to the Northern Territory. I take it that that inquiry will have to he paid for out of revenue, but I have not heard that Parliament has authorized any expenditure of money in connection with it. Another item to which I wish to direct attention is that of the Scientific Expedition to New Guinea. Last year a sum of £3,051 was provided for this expedition, which, presumably, is still patrolling New Guinea. Expenditure on any item is not restricted to the amount stated on the Estimates, or to the amount spent in the previous year. What authority was given to the Government to send such an expedition to New Guinea? Dr Campbell Brown is the leader of that expedition. He is very well known in the division from which I cpme. I mention this fact to show that this Parliament has not complete control of public expenditure, although that is its right, which it should insist upon. I , as an individual member, as far as I am able, am going to insist upon it. Otherwise we cannot expect that reasonable care will be exercised in the expenditure of public funds. In connection with the Prime Minister's Department, there is a High Commissioner's office in London. Last year I availed myself of the opportunity, during the discussion of the Estimates, to criticise the expenditure on the High Commissioner's office. I moved that the amount proposed to be provided bereduced by a sum of £7,000, or to the amount spent during the previous year. That motion was defeated. The amount placed on the Estimates was £53,974, but £73,514 was expended. Is there any justification for the expenditure of over £73,000 on the High Commissioner's office when this Parliament authorized an expenditure of only £53,000 ?_ The amount expended represented an increase of £19,000 over the amount spent during the previous year, and a large increase - upon the amount authorized by Parliament after severe criticism in this House.",51
284,Mr HECTOB LAMOJSTD,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"That kind of thing is happening in many other stances. i Mr BELL - That is so. I am citing instances that have come prominently under my notice. The secretary of the High Commissioner's office was formerly secretary to the Prime Minister's Department in Australia. The man who occupied the position previously received £1,000 a year. Immediately Mr Shepherd was appointed his salary was doubled to £2,000. His salary is now £500 more than that of the Inspector General of the Commonwealth Eorces, and very much more than that of any of the secretaries of our great spending Departments in Australia. Can the right honourable the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), or any other member of the Government, justify the expenditure of money in that way? Will they say that they are exercising that careful scrutiny of small details which is expected of them, and which the Treasurer claims to have exercised? I say, deliberately, that they cannot justify any such claim. I do not wish to criticise a public officer, but I Ho not think that there are many members of this House who consider that the appointment, in the first place, was a good one. There are not many members who will say that an officer occupying that position is entitled to a salary of £2,000 a year. The best business men in our cities, who are running very prosperous business departments, are receiving very much less than £2,000 a year. It has been stated that Mr Shepherd has very big expenses to meet. Probably that is true; but right through the Department we find that large increases in expenditure have taken place, amounting, in the case of temporary employees, to no less than £10,000. I will admit that it is very difficult for any one in Australia to criticise successfully items of that kind, but certainly some explanation of the increases in expenditure should be given to this House. When it is found necessary or desirable to expend large sums of money-sometime s amounting to thousands of pounds-ove r and above the amounts authorized by this Parliament, the particular item should be cited and an explanation of it given when the Supply Bill is brought befors the House, inor, at any rate, at the very earliest opportunity.",52
285,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"May I honourable' member's attention to another item? An advance is made to the Treasurer to enable him to make advances to public officers to meet expenditure particulars of which will afterwards be in cluded in a parliamentary appropriation. For that purpose the Treasurer receives £1,500,000 a year-to meet unforeseen expenditure which has not received the authority of Parliament. authorized the expenditure of £1,500,000.",53
286,Mr BELL,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I do not think that meets my criticism. Because we give the Treasurer £1,500,000 to meet unexpected or unforeseen expenditure, that is no reason why expenditure not specially authorized, such as that included in the items which I quoted, should not be brought before this House and explained in detail when Supply Bills are brought down. I do not think my criticism is answered in the least degree by what the right honourable gentleman has said. W it h regard to expenditure generally, and to the directions in which it can be cut down, I would cite the expenditure on Cockatoo Island and Williamstown dockyards. That expenditure can be, and ought to be, curtailed. We find that there are numerous officers-experts , I presumeat both places. There are an engineermanager and subordinate carrying out similar functions at each of those places. Many thousands of pounds have been expended without building any ships, or even employing any hands; the money has been absorbed in the maintenance of highly-paid officers, and what results do we see for it ? The revelations in connection with the Royal Commission which inquired into the administration of Cockatoo Island Dockyard were very disquieting. I am very much afraid that the members of that Commission were mainly concerned with the re-employment of the men who had been discharged, rather than with bringing to light unjustified expenditure, and clearing up criticism as to the shocking methods employed on the Island. It appears to me that a lot of white-washing was indulged in .",53
287,Mr MASKS,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,I take strong exception to that remark.,53
288,Mr BELL,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"W it h the exception of the honourable member who signed direct the minority report, the members of the Commission were mainly conoerned with the re-employment of the men. Of course, no one desires to see men out of employment, but the mismanagement of the Dockyard, and the large expenditure for no appreciable results did not appear to receive much consideration from, the Commission, with whose report I was very much dissatisfied. I think I am entitled to say that much. Parliament that Mr MASKS - The honourable member can say that without casting reflections on honourable members who served on the Commission.",53
289,Mr BELL,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I am reluctant at all times to give personal offence, but as a public man, I cannot shirk my duty, even though my remarks may not be acceptable to honourable members. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) indicated that there would ba a considerable reduction of expenditure in oertain directions, particularly in connection with repatriation and pensions. Although I am quite willin g to admit that there is ;room for great economy in the amount expended on War Servioe Homes %nd yet have more houses built than were built last year, yet if the Treasurer can only economize at the expense of the soldiers his policy will not be received with much satisfaction. I , as a representative of the people, and knowing a good deal about what some of the engineers wounded and sick soldiers are putting up with today, regard that proposal as unjust. Naturally, there will be a reduction in the amount required fro m year to year for war service pensions, but there is not the least doubt that pensions are being unwarrantably reduced. This matter has been brought before the House on many occasions, but if there is one matter upon which honourable members are unanimous it is that justice must be done to the men who suffered because of their war efforts. We have asked that an independent Medical Board should be appointed to r e view the cases of soldiers who express dissatisfaction with their pensions. I agree with the remarks which were uttered upon this subject yesterday by the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). To my own knowledge pensions are being reduced in many cases on the ground that the disability from which the soldiers are suffering was not due to war service, but was pre-existent. I have said - on other occasions, as was said by the Acting the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, that the only fair attitude for the medical officers to adopt is that if a soldier was accepted for service any disability he suffered subsequently must be regarded as due to war service.",53
290,Mr CHARLTON,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"We have brought this matter up on many occasions, but have never achieved anything.",54
291,Mr BELL,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"That is so, and it is time that some drastic action was taken. We have pleaded, remonstrated, warned, and threatened, but the Government have done nothing. Senator John D . Millen, the honourable member for Wilmo t (Mr At kinson), and I have for the past six months endeavoured to get justice done to one soldier, from whom I have a letter in my possession now. He drew a full pension for two years j and six months ago, when he was lying on a sick bed and more in need of his pension than ever before, it was abolished, on the ground that his ailment was not due to military service. Can honourable members imagine anything more absurd? Ministers have asked us why - we do not bring specific cases before them. We have done so, and the honourable member for Wilmo t will confirm everything I have said. We have pleaded this man's case before the Repatriation Board, but we can get no redress. Sir GRANVILL E RYBIE - I with the honourable member, but he should not in the same breath advocate the cutting down of the Estimates. Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m.",54
292,Mr BELL,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"On more than one occasion we have protested strongly against the reduction of the soldiers' pensions, and have asked that this obvious grievance should be remedied. The Assistant M in ister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) interjected that he agreed with what I said as to the injustice done to returned soldiers who were maimed, but that I should not vote for a reduction in the Estimates. only items in which the Treasurer has shown that he would be able to bring about a substantial reduction are those that would detrimentally affect the soldiers. Against such a course I protest most strongly, because I contend that, although a reduction' of pensions will come about naturally in time, the reductions now being effected are made at the expense of who have been (badly injured, and are sicker today than they were previously. If they have carried a pension for two or three years, not many medical men will agree that it is possible to say now that their disability is not due to war service, but was pre-existent to the war. I have already quoted a case, that came under my personal notice, of a man who had been sick and drew a pension for two years, after which the pension was cut out altogether. Another instance is that of a man who was shot through the stomach, during the war. On his return he submitted to numerous operations. I travelled some distance to see this soldier, because the case had been mentioned to me by his townsmen as one of obvious injustice. The man bears evidence of a fearful wound, and he has to wear a truss to keep his bowels in position. At one time he was granted the full pension, but it has been gradually reduced u n t i l now he gets only 12s. 6d. a week. It is said that he is fit to work. It would make any but a strong man weep to see that returned, soldier and to be told that he is able to do manual work. There is no possibility of his being a malingerer. I saw him before the war. He was a strong, able-bodied fellow- a champion wood-chopper, as a matter of fact, and now he bears evidence of being sympathize a sick man, quite unfitted for manual labour. His pension has been reduced because the Medical Board say that as he is only to a certain degree incapacitated he is fit to work. To such treatment of returned soldiers I shall not submit. We have brought these instances before the House time and again. We have asked for the appointment of local boards to reconsider such cases, but we have had no remedy. There is only one action to take, because it is useless to protest further. I hope the reconstruction that has taken place in connection with the War Service The Homes will remedy the chaos that existed in that Department. Eor that chaos TJ hold the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D . Millen ) personally responsible. Despite what has been said in this House by way of interjection, that Parliament deliberately took the power out of the M in ister's hands, and threw it upon the Commissioner, that is no justification for the condition into which the Department soldiers drifted. The Minister surely is responsible for the expenditure. We gave the Commissioner power to spend up to £5,000 without the approval of the Minister, but some £6,000,000 was evidently expended before half the financial year had passed. Until that time the Minister did not discover that the homes were not being built, and that the Department had drifted into chaos. Although the full report of the Commission has not been submitted, - we have seen sufficient of the evidence, and the Minister, I say again deliberately, must be held responsible. The Treasurer stated, on one occasion, when the Government was charged with not standing up to its responsibilities to the soldiers, that it had "" spent £100,000,000 on repatriation. Indeed, the Government has spent something like that amount, but that is not standing up to its obligations to the returned soldiers, because the soldiers have not had the benefit of the money spent on the War Service Homes. Land speculators, dishonest contractors, and such like have reaped the advantage, and not the returned soldier who has had to pay £800 or more for a house. In many cases the soldiers' applications have been lodged for years, and still they cannot get homes. Where homes have been provided, the price charged is much in excess of what the average man can afford to pay, or what the property will be worth in the near future. There is but one course for me to take in regard to the amendment of the Leader of the Country party (Dr Page). I have made my perfectly clear, in the past, on the question of efficiency and economy in the expenditure of public money, and in the. administration of public ments. I am convinced that we shall be up against a very serious stringency for years to come. The condition of Europe must be appreciated by every honourable member who reads, and its financial position must affect us very seriously. Australia has its commodities to sell, but Europe is not in a position to buy them; consequently there is a great reduction in values. The worse effect of the war, apart from the fearful loss of life, is that everybody has got into the habit of spending money freely, and living extravagantly. The British ment set the great example, during the war, of spending the savings of a century, Mr Bell. and pledging the nation's credit for the future, with the avowed intention of keeping up the so-called morale of the people. Everybody had money to spend during the war. It is easy to get into the habit of livin g in luxury, and hard to get out of it . The countries of Europe are, in the main, bankrupt, and, in so far as they are unable to find money for the purchase of the goods we can supply, Australia will be the sufferer. Thetime will arrive when we shall be compelled to cut down our expenditure. It is no use the Treasurer saying that we cannot reduce the Estimates. It must be done, because we have not got the money to spend. If it is said that we cannot reduce the Budget by £2,800,000 this year, what will happen next year, when we shall not be able to find the money? Now is the time to start to reduce expenditure. The time when we should have made a commencement to retrench in ourpublic expenditure is long past, and the sooner we make the attempt the sooner will Australia get out of its difficulties. I have no doubt that we shall pull through. Australia is in a better position to face financial stringency than any other country I know of. The advice given by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and many others, is that the only way to get out of this trouble is for the nation to work. I am a great believer in the gospel of work; but we should encourage men to labour in the expectation that they will be able to better Earle their position, and make homes for themattitude selves. If , after they work, we tax them practically out of their homes, there is very little encouragement for them to continue. It isuseless to preach such a Depart- gospel to them if we are going to take from them all the profit of their labour. financial There is only one course for me to take, and that is the straight one. It is plain to me what I should do. I pledged myself, when on the hustings, to absolute economy. That is the only pledge I made, and I am going to stick to it . It is for the Government to decide what they will do, if the amendment of the Leader of the Country party is carried. We must reduce our Estimates. If that is not done, I cannot continue to be a supporter of the present Govern- Administration . I shall vote for the amendment of the Leader of the Country party. It is the only thing for me to do, if I am to preserve my self-respect. It is the right thing to do in the interests of the people of Australia, and particularly in the interests of those who are fighting against the hard times experienced in my own electorate. I am prepared to face the music, whatever it may he. stated in the press that honourable members are afraid of an election, but I do not think that fear affects us very much. The possibility of a worse Administration taking the place of the one we have has a deterrent effect on some honourable members, who might otherwise criticise the present Government. It is obvious that there is no danger of the Opposition coming into power. I have no fear in that respect. If I had no other objection to the Opposition than in regard to the action which was exposed yesterday- I refer to the subject matter of (the ^motion tabled 'by jthat party-that , in itself, would be sufficient. A party which will not support defensive measures to insure the safety of its country is not one that I would follow in any circumstances. It is all very well to talk glibly about disarmament. It may be well enough to speak of reducing the Defence Estimates, or of practically cutting them out altogether. Those who would do away with defensive preparations by land, sea, and air, cannot, at any rate, have experienced the sensation of being bombed from the air. Those who have witnessed the wreckage of warfare do not talk lightly of disarmament. I have been through two wars, and I am bound to say that if there should be any possibility of preventing war in the future, with honour, I shall always stand for peace. But those individuals who will not endeavour to insure peace by taking all necessary precautions and preparations against war, can never hope, and should never expect, to have the support of the people of this country. Obviously, the reason why the Labour party is in the position that it occupies in this House is that its views and attitude upon the defence of Australia are not commendable to the people. That reasonable economy is possible, even in the Defence Department, I have no doubt; and, if it can be effected, it must be. I think that economy can be brought about, still leaving Australia with an adequate defensive policy. But, as for the proposition to cut out the whole of the Defence proposals, that is absurd and, indeed, impossible. If I thought there was any danger of the coming into power of the party which is advocating such a thing, I would certainly hesitate before casting my vote. I desire It is to see effective economy. I think it can be brought about without any loss of efficiency. I have the greatest respect for the majority of the Ministers. I have already criticised the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen). I do not wish to be considered to have shown any lack of personal respect, but I am bound to say that I have no confidence in his administration. Unless Ministers generally can handle their finances with more evidence of care and scrupulous consideration for thorough economy, I must take up the attitude towards the Government which I have already indicated.",54
293,Mr HAY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"New England) [8.19] - Whatever happens I suggest that honourable members be cheerful about it . The other day the Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith), when a certain question was put to ,him answered, "" Lead, kindly Light."" I may add, in the present situation, ""Amid the encircling gloom."" The Government of today may be likened to the pale horse of the Scriptures. The Apostle John in his Book of Revelation* wroteAnd when he had opened the fourth seal I looked, and, behold, a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. I do not suggest, for one moment, that the Treasurer's name is Death; because, for one thing, he has* a new life opening up before him, according to reports; and I desire to make no inference concerning what may follow. But since the Budget was presented a very considerable amount of criticism-indiscriminate , it may behas been hurled at the Government. I have been so perplexed that I have deemed it well to make a very close individual investigation of the Budget, i u order to arrive at some reasonable conclusions. Later, I shall refer to an analysis which I made so that I might satisfy myself concerning the present position. One hears at every turn prophets, false and otherwise; but prophets truly are those who advocate economy. All honourable members realise that economy is necessary in order to restore and re-establish our country after a period' of seven, years of war and the period after war. A great many people, unhappily, seem to think that the war is over. The violence of the war is ended, but its after effects will not have been done with for many years; and so the administrators of this country, and everybody, in fact, axe compelled to consider the question of economy.. No Government can force the people to economize except by excessive taxation. It is true that excessive taxation exists at present; but are the people who are preaching economy economizing to the fullest extent? Economy must come from the individual, to institutions, and to the Government; otherwise there must be failure. A Government may impose economy upon the people; but the people, when their turn comes, at election time, will force the Government into economy. There are a great many lines along which economy may be exercised. I am convinced that the first line can be drawn in this House, and by the Government directly. Honourable members who preach economy should be satisfied to have their parliamentary remuneration cut down by half. If they were to engage themselves sinoerely in the affairs of this country they could perform its parliamentary business in three months, and be free to attend to their own interests for the remainder of the year. Great extravagance occurred only last year when Parliament sat practically from February until December. All the costs and charges attached to that long session can probably never be assessed. From the analysis of the Budget figures which I have made, I must admit that I cannot see how, with the present statutory obligations, the government of the Commonwealth can be carried on at a lower expenditure. With the appalling weight of statutory obligations which bears upon the Government I fear that they will be unable to meet all calls with the sum for which the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has budgeted. With the reduction of the prices of all primary products, except wool, the Government may not collect the revenue which they anticipate. The only process of economy which can be applied is for this House, at a later stage, to resolve itself into a Committee to consider to what extent we can reduce our statutory obligations. Mr ffay.",56
294,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Now the honourable member is talking.,57
295,Mr HAY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"If we are unable to do so our national obligations will grow still heavier, and taxation must be increased. The more money that is taken from us by way of taxation the less we shall have with which to develop our undertakings and enrich this=country. There are very grave considerations at stake. The Treasurer poured a little oil on the troubled waters, in Sydney, the other day, when he said he hoped and believed that at the termination of the financial year he would be able to show a surplus. I hope that his successor will be able to do so, any how.",57
296,Mr MAHONY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Is that a threat?,57
297,Mr HAY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"At any rate, if the present Administration may be likened to the pale horse, I do not wish to see that which followed the vision! In a Budget such as that for this year, and with the responsibilities imposed on the country, it is desirable and necessary that, apart from criticising, honourable members should make themselves familiar with the intricacies of the Budget; I mean that they should examine the country's finances irrespective iof the particulars 1 contained in the statement of the Treasurer. An investigation of the accounts of the Government, however, naturally involves a certain amount of criticism. We are all entitled to engage in such criticism, so long as it is fair and reasonable. There are many matters in regard to which one must at the present time consider what should be the action of the Government. I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr. Hunter) that the sooner the Government draw out of all their commercial undertakings the better, so that the losses which always occur under Government control may be ended, and that Ministers may have ample time for the administration of the ordinary Departments. I shall weary the Committee only as briefly as possible with the result of my investigation of the Budget in regard to several important points, and I hope that I may be permitted to read the statement which I have prepared, because it contains figures which I wish to have recorded with accuracy. I propose to hand it to the Hansard reporters. when I have finished my speech. A great deal has been said about "" savings,"" but I ask - whether, if certain moneys appropriated by Parliament had been spent, the Treasurer would not have found himself with a very large deficit at the end of the financial year? Whether the money not spent may or may not properly he termed ""savings,"" the facts are these: In his. Budget speech the Treasurer said that he had saved £452,256 during the year in the Military Department and on A i r Services. Of that sum, nearly £100,000 was saved by not spending the parliamentary appropriation for the development of civil aviation. Parliament voted £100,000 last year for this purpose, but only £4,732 was spent. Nearly £150,000 was "" saved "" by not establishing the services authorized by Parliament, the cost of which was estimated at £200,000, of which only £58,155 was spent. In this way the "" saving "" of £250,000 is accounted, for. In support of these figures I refer the Committee to page 206 of the Estimates. While the costs of running the Defence Department were, in most instances, kept just within what was estimated, a saving of £159,000 was shown by not putting into operation in its entirety the universal training scheme which had been approved, for which £350,000 was voted and only £199,000 spent. The saving on other training was £40,000, and this was effected by not carrying out the objects for which Parliament voted the money. Thus the Treasurer may claim to have saved only £3,000 by the careful administration of the Department; £449,000 of the total declared savings of £452,256 being obtained, as I have shown, by not spending the parliamentary appropriation. The declared savings in respect of Additions, New Works, and Buildings amounted to about £982,000; the vote being £3,070,502 and the actual expenditure only £2,098,203. I wish to compare for a moment the Budget of 1913-14 with that of 1921-22. These are not strictly comparable because of the war, but it is necessary to place them side by side to gain an idea of the extraordinary increase which has taken place in the expenditure of the Commonwealth during the last seven years. For the year 1913-14 our expenditure was £25,332,385, but the Treasurer estimates to expend this year £81,897,632.",57
298,Sir GBANVTLLE ETBIE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,You must make allowance for the depreciation in the value of the sovereign.,58
299,Mr HAY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I am not taking that into account, and I have not seen a sovereign for years. The difference between the amounts I have just mentioned, which shows how our expenditure has increased, is £56,065,247. Of this enormous sum, a large part is applied to war purposes, such as general repatriation, war pensions, War Service Homes, &c. This expenditure is set down at £42,399,253, and, of course, was not provided for in the Budget for the year 1913-14. This must be deducted from the expenditure estimated for the present year to make a fair comparison between the expenditure of 1913-14 and 1921-22. If that deduction be made, it will be seen that our ordinary expenditure, that is, expenditure other than war expenditure, is 50 per cent, greater today than it was in 1913-14, the estimate for this year's expenditure other than war expenditure is £38,998,379; while, as I have said, the expenditure'in 1913-14 was £25,332,385. In other words, the estimated ordinary expenditure of this year exceeds by £13,665,994 the similar expenditure of 1913-14. The ordinary votes for expenditure, which in 1913-14 amounted to £13,578,746, have been increased for this year to £22,519,044; an increase of £8,940,098, or nearly 75 per cent. Of the total estimated expenditure for this year-£81,397,632-£42,399,25 3 comes, as I said, under the heading of war expenditure, and the remaining £38,998,379 is made up a3 follows:Ordinary votes and appropriations .. .. .. £22,519,044 Payments to States .. .. 6,937,500 Payment to Tasmania . . .. 85,000 Works and buildings, &e. . . 2,948,411 Interest, State Loans . . .. 911,250 Works and buildings from loan . . 5,597,174 £38,998,379 Before criticising Ministers for failing to economize in their ordinary administration it is necessary to ascertain exactly what field that criticism should cover. So much has been said about extravagance that we must, first of all, ascertain how much of the total expenditure can fairly be brought under review in this connection. Of the £22,519,044 under the heading of "" Ordinary Votes and Appropriations,"" £6,703,275 reprehowever, sents special appropriations regulated - Statute, and are therefore out of the control of the Government, so that the expenditure for which Ministers can be criticised amounts to only £15,815,769. The total expenditure may, therefore, be divided into that towards which criticism cannot be directed, and that upon which such criticism is fair. The following War analysis of the Treasurer's Budget figures Payments should make this clear:ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE iron Regulated hy Statute. Special appropriations . . ..

The figures mean that the ordinary cost of running the routine of government, quite apart from war matters, but including new works, is £9,000,000, or 60 per cent, higher than in 1913-14. Mr Eay. This analysis does not include war expenditure. Including this expenditure, an analysis of the Budget gives by the following results:GENERAL SUMMARY.

300,The CHAIRMAN,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH," I ask the honourable member to resume his seat. I think it is my duty now to direct the attention of the Committee, as I intended to have done before, to the necessity of observing our rules and orders of debate. One of these, which is imperative, is that no honourable member shall read his speech. I have no desire whatever to' interfere with what has gone before, but I felt it my duty to inform the heads of different parties that in future I shall require observance of that rule. I have no objection, and in fact realise the reasonableness of it, to honourable members quoting from notes where they find it necessary to refer to a large number of figures, but to read a prepared statement of figures is altogether opposed to the standing order. I ask the honourable member for New England (Mr Hay) now, ancl other honourable members, to in future comply with the rule to which I have referred. The necessity for it must be obvious to every one. I again repeat that it is imperative. The practice has been going on now for some time, and, I notice, has been growing toi such an extent that it might soon develop into a real abuse of the standing order. The honourable member may quote from, a statement of figures, because I know how difficult it is to retain a great number of figures in the memory, but I ask him not to continue to read his speech.",60
301,Mr HAY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I think you are quite right, sir. As a matter of fact, I spent some time last evening and on other occasions in listening to the reading of speeches, and I have merely followed an example which you have permitted, but I shall not transgress in future. 1920-21. Estimated 1921-22. Of the expenditure of £38,998,379, £14,637,025 is-regulated by Statute, and £ £ £ £24,361,354 is not so regulated.

303,Mr HAY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"May I appeal to you, sir, to say whether I may refresh my memory ? To make a long story short-and , by the way, these interruptions by the Prime - Minister are very disorderly- I may as - a general summary explain that with respect to expenditure beyond the control of the Government because of statutory obligations, from which they cannot escape except by repudiation or failure in some direction to observe the law, in 1913-14 the amount was £10,043,680, in 1920-21 it was £71,924,363, and in 1921-22 it is estimated at £57,036,278. The expenditure within the control of the Government was-In 1913-14, £15,288,705; in 1920-21, £20,949,951; and . in 1921-22 it is £24,361,354. So that during the period, from 1913-14 to 1920-21 the expenditure within the control of the Government had increased to the extent of £5,500,000 or thereabouts. That, of course, was quite a reasonable increase, because of the war conditions which prevailed. But the expenditure over which the Government have control increased from £20,900,000 last year to an estimate of £24,361,000 for this year. Again, I must admit that there have been circumstances over which the Government have had no control-increase d wages and increases in a thousand different ways. I say a. thousand advisedly, because I mean it , since there are so many different channels by which costs have increased during the last year that it is very difficult at a glance to estimate the sources of increased charges. The figures show that increased expenditure on items beyond the control of the Ministry, as compared with 1913-14, is only about £3,500,000, whereas an increase of over £9,000,000 has taken place for the same period in the expenditure directly under the control of the Ministry. This is apart from war expenditure. Here in itself is an immense field of criticism. The figures mean that the ordinary cost of running the routine of government, quite apart from war matters, but including new works, is £9,000,000, or 60 per cent, higher than in 1913-14. - It is obvious, from the glance at the figures which have been supplied, that economy must be effected from within, that Ministers must reduce the cost of running their own Departments; for this is a matter in which it is difficult for members to make concrete suggestions. The Economic Commission made ex1 tended investigations into the working of the various Departments, and it would be interesting to know how many of their recommendations have been put into effect. At the same time, due allowances must be made for increased awards and all other conditions which count in increased expenditure. What I desire to say, not quite in conclusion, but as a "" semi-final,"" is that departmental expenditure has 'increased to the extent of very nearly £1,000,000 over last year. Again, I must repeat that certain increases, due to awards, the basic wage, and in other ways, have to some extent accounted for the increase. These facts have, no doubt, also been responsible for the increase in expenditure in nearly all Departments in 1920-21, compared with the sum voted for that year. Eor instance May I read these figures?",60
304,The CHAIRMAN,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member may refresh his memory from his notes.,61
305,Mr HAY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"May I frequently refresh my memory? Por instance, the vote for Parliament shows an increase in. this way of £10,256. I have no doubt that that is due to increased salaries. I confess that I was one of those who voted for increased salaries. I was new to Parliament, and, as Kipling says in "" MCAndrew's Hymn ""I was but four-and-twenty then. Yoii wadna' blame a child? I find that the expenditure for the Prime Minister's Department was increased by £58,439 over the sum voted, the Treasury by £109,748, the Attorney-General's Department by £22,150. I do not blame the Minister for this increase in view of all the anxiety he has had to suffer because of industrial and other troubles. There was no reason why the expenditure for his Department should not increase. The expenditure for the Home and Territories Department shows an increase of £20,631, and for the Defence Department a decrease of £209,281. What was my honourable friend the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Eyrie) doing? The Trade and Customs Department shows an increase of £80,000, and the Department of Works and Railways, controlled by the economical Minister (Mr Groom), an increase of only £2,634. What could he have been doing? The Postmaster-General's Department shows an increase of £522,992, and I wish it had been £1,000,000, because we wouid then, have had better post and telegraph services. I shall quote no more figures. I have considered very carefully the whole situation, the conditions of the country, and the prospects ahead of us. With the prices of all our primary products tumbling, and the inability of primary producers in many directions to carry on their undertakings, I suppose that I , like a great many others, have reason for anxiety.",61
306,Mr BLAKELEY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member is not the only one in the chamber to-night who has reason for grave anxiety.,61
307,Mr HAY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Is that so? I asked the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Groom) the other day what land was likely to be made available on the Murray River irrigation areas. My object in putting that question to him was to ascertain what suitable land would be available for the settlement of either Australians or those who come from abroad. Unless we make proper provision for those whom we propose to settle on the land we had better leave the job alone. We cannot hope to be successful by dotting down a man here and a man there, and saying to them, ""Here is your land; carry on."" Something more is required of us. We can make a success of land settlement in this country of ours, not by the haphazard methods which have been adopted so frequently, but by taking reasonable precautions to insure that the people will succeed when they are settled on the land. I asked the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) this afternoon whether he had ever known of a closer settlement scheme carried out by any Government in Australia that had been successful. He replied, "" I knew of one, but it was more or less of an accident."" Is that right?",61
308,Mr WATT,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,It is.,62
309,Mr HAY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"There are many grave reas they are today. sponsibilites associated with the task of settling the people on the land. useless to endeavour to convince oneself that people can be successfully settled day under the conditions that obtained in connection with land settlement fifty years ago. Times have changed, and the people want better conditions. While am prepared to advocate immigrationthe bringing of European people to this country in order to settle them on the laud and so to increase our productionI think there are a great many people Australia whom we have first to consider. Care should be taken to choose areas suitare able for proper community settlement and to provide not only means of transport and marketing facilities, but the financial backing and all that is required to make the settler prosperous. If land settlement today were placed in the hands of those who know and understand the business there would be no cause for fear as to the future. If the Government settled, say, fifty people on a given area under conditer) [ 9 . 1 ] tions which led to those people becoming prosperous, we should quickly have another fifty people settling around Nothing is more calculated to bring cess to this country than the settlement of the people on the land under good ditions. If the people already on land are not prosperous we cannot expect others to come here to go on the land. I am not going to further delay the Committee. I have been asked how I am going to vote. I shall tell honourable members what I propose to do. I was sent to this Parliament to support decent governnot ment, and I am not going to deceive .mythe circumstances. self. I propose to sit on the side in a division opposite that occupied by the Labour party.  for the appointment of a Select Committee to find out where the honourable ber is.",62
310,Mr HAY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"We shall not need a Select Committee to - f i nd out where the honourable member is going at the next general election. I defeated my Labour opponent at the last election, and my constituency last thought he had in his mind. returned me to support the institutions government in which I believe. not going to deceive myself. My estithe mate of this country is very high, and my hopes of its future prosperity are unbounded. I do not believe, however, that it can prosper while our undertakings are cramped and tied up in a thousand ways There are many things required of this Government - It . It is has been said by members of the Country party that the amendment tomoved by the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) is not intended to be a motion of censure, but that it has been submitted merely I with a desire to bring the Goverument to its senses, and to-compel it to exercise economy. I do not know whether it was intended that a brick or a peanut should be thrown. At any rate, I was returned in to support the* institutions to which I have always belonged, and which I think best calculated to insure good government in this country and to promote its continued prosperity. Therefore, I shall vote according to my opinions; and if it be the desire of honourable members to go to the country in order to get the views of the electors, I am perfectly satisfied what the opinion of m y constituents will be.",62
311,Mr HUGHES,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Bendigo-Prime Minis- I am somewhat at a disadvantage in taking part in this discusthem. sion, but I feel it is necessary sucthat I should, set out the views of the Government on the amendment consubmitted by the honourable member the for Cowper (Dr Earle Page). I shall endeavour to do so as shortly as possible. I regret more than I can say that I have to deny myself the opportunity, which I should have welcomed, of being able to deal with the amendment and its mover in a way that both deserve; but as that is possible, I shall do the best I can in Honourable members should consider what it is that the Committee is asked to do. You, Mr Chanter, have been a long time a member of this Parliament. I ask you if you can recall an amendment of this sort put forward memwith the avowed purpose which the honourable member for Cowper declares is his intention? What he asks this Committee .and the country to believe is that he has submitted his amendment not at all in a party spirit; that this,, indeed, was the He of would have the Committee and the I am people believe that he was animated by purest and most patriotic motives. Ho declares, in effect, that hia amendment is not to be regarded as a vote of want of confidence in the One honourable member of his party, so I am informed, this afternoon made a statement that he did not regard as a vote of no confidence Government. Apparently the honourable member for Cowper, who has come into this arena of public affairs late in life, and who has had no experience of these matters, thinks that this is the way in which the business of the country can be carried on. I shall not, for reasons that I think are fairly obvious, permit myself to referi to the personalities in which he indulged in this non-party of his, or to his. criticisms right honourable colleague surer (Sir Joseph Cook), myself, and every other member of this Apparently, in his opinion, my colleagues and myself are grossly incompetent, altogether futile persons. What, are we to think of the honourable man when he says that he proposes to refer to us, who, according to him, are grossly incompetent and guilty of reckless extravagance, the delicate and duty of determining just in what way the Estimates are to be reduced by the sum of £2,800,000? The honourable for Cowper, no doubt, will derive some little light, and, perhaps, benefit, the remarks that have fallen from the lips of the honourable member for New England (Mr Hay). The world is very sick, staggering under, a fearful burden of debt, and with its feet torn and bleeding, at every stride it takes. My honourable friend, the member for New pointed out that we have emerged from the greatest trial to which the civilized world has ever been subjected; that trade, commerce, and finance are alike and disorganized. With the world stricken to its very soul, groaning, grumbling, and seeking light, the honourable member for Cowper comes here with copy-book maxims about living one's income and other things that one can get out of Smiles' Self-Help, other counsels of perfection. the Budgets of all the great tries in the world today. one that can compare favourably the Budget which has been presented by my right honourable colleague the Treasurer? If so, which is it? Is it that of Afr. Hughes. England?, Is it that of France? Is it that of America ? Is it that of Canada ? Government. The honourable member has told us a great deal about economy, and we all believe in economy. This Government has tried it to practise it . But there is wise economy im the and there is foolish economy. In Hansard debates of last year, page 5570, I find some remarks made by the honourable member for Bobertson (Mr . Fleming) that are most pertinent to the present debate. I commend them to my colleagues generally. The honourable member's words are as follows: The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) gave us an address in which, so far as amendment I heard him, he seemed to favour the economy of my of increased expenditure, for which a great the Trea- deal could be said at the present moment. Australia is an immense,, undeveloped continent, and it would be extremely uneconomical Government. for us, even in a time of straitened finance, to be content to leave things as they are. No and private person who held a property worth imthen, proving would be content to lose money by allowing a temporary tightness of the money gentle- market to prevent him from developing it. In 1 this regard, the honourable member made a splendid vindication of the Budget. It is chiefly a Budget of development. But not only is Australia a heritage, on which we must difficult spend money in improvement; it is also a country which is open to attack from all sides, for which we must provide means of defence. member IF the Budget be analyzed, it will be seen that its proposals for expenditure are mainly in one or other of these directions. from",62
312,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,They were at that time; but you have fallen from grace since then.,63
313,Mr HUGHES,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"The amendment stumbles which the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) has submitted is, so far England, as I know, without precedent, and, the honourable member must be told, cau have but one effect. Last night the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr . chaotic Charlton) took quite another course. He whole moved for the reduction of an item, and although I did not agree with his views, his course was straightforward. He was prepared to take the responsibility for within reducing an item to which he objected. He said, in effect, "" Here is a world which and has lately been through the greatest war Look at of all the ages. It is sore stricken, coun- and weary of war. Let ug beat the Is there sword into a plough-share and, as with far as possible, r i d ourselves of this intolerable burden of armaments. I ask the Government to cut down these Estimates in this particular direction."" On that amendment the Committee knew where it stood; hut as the honourable member for Cowper voted against it, we are to assume, if we can assume anything from what he says or does, that when he calls upon us to reduce these Estimates by £2,800,000, he does not mean that we are to follow the suggestion of the able member for Hunter, and cut down the expenditure upon defence. In fact, his vote upon the amendment indicates that we must not do so. Very well, then, where are we to cut down our expenditure? I suggest that the honourable member»is not able to tell us whether we are to cut down our Estimates. He cannot point to any definite item, and say this must be reduced. Of the total Budget of £81,000,000, £43,000,000 is to be spent on soldiers. Does the honourable member contend that we are giving too much to the soldiers? .The fault I find with the Budget is that it gives them too little, and later on I shall have something to say a'bout that aspect of the matter. The honourable member will not venture to say that we can cut down the"" money allocated for. war pensions, War Service Homes, land settlement, or any other branch of repatriation work. Are we, therefore, to cut down the salaries of public servants? The honourable member has certainly suggested, in fact, think he said, that there were too many public servants. Let him indicate plainly what he means. Are we to dismiss public servants? If so, from which Department 1 Are salaries to be reduced ? If so, whose, and by how much? I say that if there is to be any cutting down of the salaries of the public servants of this country, while I have a voice in the matter, al start will be made in this chamber. The problems confronting the world today are the results of the great war, trade depression, disorganization of finances, high prices, fluctuations of markets, unemployment. No one knows what price he may expect to get tomorrow for his produce. The remedy almost invariably suggested is Government aid. The honourable member does not seem.to understand the disease from which the world is suffering. He speaks about economy, but he does not tell Us where we should economize. Can we do it by cutting dowrr the vote for immigration, land settlement, or the Murray waters scheme? I refer honourable members to what the honourable member for Bobertson (Mr Fleming) said, namely, that this country wants development and people. Well, how are we to develop the country, and how axe we to people it? If the Government retains the confidence of honourable members and the country it will bring the people here; but will not do so unless f t is able to put them on the honor- land. And it can only do this by a vigorous but wise policy of development. It will not bring people here to put them into the crowded cities, and so swell the ranksi of the unemployed. Let the honourable member fon Cowper indicate any item of expenditure to which he takes exception. Is it the money to be spent upon the Post Office, upon the carriage of oversea mails, or upon the payment of old-age pensions? The honourable member has taken the course of throwing upon the Government the onus of reducing the Budget, because he himself is unable to put a finger upon any particular item he would take the responsibility of cutting down. I have no wish to detain the Committee. The Government cannot accept the amendment, as the honourable member ought to have known when he submitted it. If he did not know this, he is certainly not fit for the position-he occupies. If he did know it, what he has said has been an effort to mislead the Committee and the country. 1 As for economy, the honourable member must not think that he is the only person who is anxious that the Government should live within its means. While the Government cannot and will not accept the honourable member's amendment, or any general direction such as is contained in it, it fully recognises the need for economy, and that as a general principle it is desirable that we should live within our income. We shall make an honest and determined effort t i do that. Further, the Government invite the Committee to indicate where economy can be effected; and, provided that that economy does not strike a vital blow at the policy of the Government, we shall accept the decision of the Committee. More than that no Government has ever done, and no Committee has a right to expect. That being the position, I venture to express the hope that honourable members on both sides of the.House will reject the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page). It is perfectly obvious what will happen if the tactics to which the honourable member and certain members of his party have resorted are continued. The Government stands for certain principles, upon which a great majority of honourable members ^n this House were electedinoh:.cIing ;iie honourable member. But responsible government is impossible if the tactics of the honourable gentleman are to continue. I venture to hope that this amendment will be rejected by an overwhelming majority of the members of the Committee. If it is a party matter, and is to be regarded as a vote of no-confidence, let honourable members, of course, exercise their own discretion; but if it is an honest desire for economy, I suggest that it be dealt with in the manner I have mentioned. If honourable members will show where economies can be effected when items are before the Committee, the Government will accept the decision of the Committee on all matters which do not emasculate their vital policy.",63
314,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Bobertson) [9.24] As the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has done me the honour of referring to some remarks I made on the last Budget, I desire to say something concerning this one. The right honourable gentleman has quoted a term which I believe I used on that occasion, "" the economy of increased expenditure."" The party to which I belong has always stood, and I hope will always stand, for the economy of increased expenditure, where that expenditure is such that it will enable the country to secure a return for the outlay. The Prime Minister knows that it is not the amount of money spent which has caused the trouble, but the manner in which it has been disbursed. He also, knows that the Government have not been getting full value for the money expended, and the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) realizes that for the last twelve months at least he has not been receiving anything like full value at a time when inoney is dear. The Government have been floatiug loans at .the high rate of 6 per cent, because the lenders realise that, the Government are not getting f u ll value for the expenditure. The Treasurer said in his Budget speechOne notes with gratification some favourable omens in the general situation. Within the last six months the Bank of England rate' has dropped from 7 per eent. to 5£ per cent., and that money is becoming cheaper is evidenced by the latest news from London that short loans can be ohtiined as low as 3J per cent., whilst three months' bank bills are now only 4J per cent. The Government have to pay over 6 per cent., fox the reasons submitted by the Leader of the Country party, and bev cause they are not administering our affairs in a way that will create confidence in the minds of the world's financiers. The Prime Minister has said that heavy expenditure is necessary in order to develop the Commonwealth; but that is a very slender argument and altogether beside the question. He also stated that it was the duty of those who favour a reduction in the Estimates to show where savings can be effected, when he knows that the only people in a position: to recommend reductions in expenditure are the heads of the Departments who are in close touch with the different branches of governmental activity. The right honourable gentleman must recognise that it is not our business to tell him exactly - where money can be saved. We know that expenditure can be curtailed, because in many instances money is being squandered. Take, for instance, the administration of the War Service Homes Department. When this House passed measures framed for providing assistance to returned soldiers, honourable members were generous in their attitude, because they realized their obligations to the returned men. We passed those measures in the hope that the returned soldiers and the country would get f u ll value for the outlay. It is common knowledge all over Australia that money was poured into the War Service Homes Department, much of which has been wasted, and that the administration has not only been lax, but absolutely inefficient. The Department is now endeavouring to rectify the position, irrespective of whether the ex-soldiers get full value or not. I have before me particulars concerning eighteen homes erected for returned soldiers, six of which were sold at the cost of erection, six under the cost of erection, and the remaining six at more than they cost to build. It is unnecessary for me to give particulars concerning the six sold at the cost of erection, but details concerning tho3e sold above the cost are as follows:No. Cost to build. Sold at. £ a. d. £ 20 .. 819 10 11 . 825 1 733 8 5 . 800 43 578 13 4 . 800 72 594 1 2 . 600 4 794 16 7 . 800",65

336,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Of what use is the Minister unless he gets men under him. quite he can trust? The whole of the administration has been such that the position of these is becoming disastrous.,66
337,Mr BLAKELEY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,It was disastrous before you ceased to be a direct supporter,66
338,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"It takes time to find out. I supported the Government so long as I thought they would carry out quite their election pledges and fulfil the in tentions of the House, but when I found that the administration was so helpless it could not carry out those intentions with anything like business capasomecity; then, naturally, I took my place n where I coiild criticise it . And I am going on to criticise until steps are taken, not only to remedy the injuries .done to returned men, but to put the affairs of Australia on a sound footing. Mr MOGRATH,,-Where did you get the figures? M i \ FLEMING - In Perth, Western Australia. I shall now take the six where houses were sold to returned at under the cost price. In case No. the house cost £877 8s. 3d., and was for £800; in case 68, the house was built for £1,033 Is. 2d., and sold for £860. The soldier did very well there.",66
339,Mr MOGRATH,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,He might not do very well.,67
340,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"That is true, behim cause, in quite a number of instances, houses cost more than they are worth, though, in other cases, the men got reseeing markably good value. This arises from the fact that values have risen since the initiaall tion of the scheme. Naturally, if the houses had been built at anything like reasonable rates, the soldiers would get far more than the market value. scheme had been carried out on proper lines, and real business acumen disbeen played, our soldiers would have got the houses at under contract price outside. However, in case No. 15 the house £1,019 19s. 9d., and was sold for £750; in case No. 215, the house cost £947 15s., and was sold for £800; in a case given under letter E, the house cost £1,120 0 18s. 3d., and was sold for £875; and case No. 24, the house cost £810 3s. and was sold for £800. I submit that these figures in themselves are an absohands lute proof that the Minister in charge is not handling the Department so as to get a fair, honest deal for the returned men. I do not say that the Minister is wittingly deceiving the soldiers, but do say that incompetency in such cases is almost as bad. It is OUT duty, as presentatives of the people, and, I take it, it is particularly my duty as presentative of the returned men, to and get things rectified. When the Gotrench vernment will not rectify matters there is only one thing to do, and that is put men there who will rectify them.",67
341,Mr CONSIDINE,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Do - you really beround. lieve that is going to happen?,67
342,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,I sincerely hope so.,67
343,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Thes e things are done by returned soldiers.,67
344,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"Certainl y they are, to a large extent, but that does not exonerate the Minister for Eepatriation. Every one knows that amongst cases the returned soldiers there are bad men men and good men, men of business 3, capacity and men with none. The Gosold vernment could get just as capable men from amongst the returned soldiers as from amongst any other section, but the Government, in many cases, have not selected the right men. When an employer finds that an employee is not the right man for his purpose, he gets rid of and appoints another. There is no the necessity to go outside the ranks of the returned men to get men quite capable of that we obtain the fullest possible value for every pound we spend, and that the soldiers are given a fair deal.",67
345,Mr MOGRATH,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,You would not expect a private to get any of these jobs. They If the are only for colonels.,67
346,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"The privates have just as well treated as have the officers. One good point about this country is that it does not matter what social cost rank a man may occupy, he gets an equally fair deal. It is nonsense to talk about "" colonels "" as against privates, or the wealthy man as against the poor man; my experience of Australia is that if a in man ""has it in him,"" it does not matter 6d., whether he was "" born with a silver spoon in his mouth,"" or works with his",67

348,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"O r has a brass hat I on his head, or bluchers on his feet-if a man is prepared to do his work, he regets a fair deal. We here enter our protest as emphatically as we can against a rethe waste of money. We are not showtry ing the Government where they can reby cutting down the Estimates of this Department or that, but, in a broad, to general way, showing the necessity for that application of proper business methods andbetter administration all It is easy for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to stand up and try to throw us off the track by asking us' to point to particular items that can be reduced. I think I have said enough to show that a great deal can be done in tightening up the administrative methods of this country. Unless the men now in charge of the Government can do it , others must be put in their place.",67
349,Mr EODGERS,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"I can assure the honourable gentleman that the cases he speaks of are not known to the central administration, I mean that the central administration does not know of cases in which a soldier has been charged for more than the completed cost of his house. Personally, I do not know of one such case. If that be the general position, I shall direct that every soldier shall get his house at the completed cost, and not more than the completed cost.",68
350,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,The Assistant M in ister is now letting himself in for something. I do not think that he really - knows what he is saying.,68
351,Mr RODGERS,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,I know what the Act provides. The Government will stand up to the Act ..,68
352,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,It is singular that no Western Australian member has called the attention of the central authorities to the circumstances.,68
353,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) knows that I am in a specially favourable position for getting the particulars from the men. I get scores of letters every day from returned men all over Australia. I have been here week in and week out trying to get these grievances put right.,68
354,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,Are they isolated cases?,68
355,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"They are not isolated cases. There are plenty of them. I ask the honourable member for Eden-Monaro ""(Mr Austin Chapman) to support me in getting these things put right. The Treasurer has told us in his Budget statement that he expects to get an increased amount this year fro m income tax. That seems to me to be another proof of lack of business knowledge. The right honourable gentleman may be able to collect some of the money which has not been paid, but which, should have been paid during last year. The collection of the arrears may make up some of the amount he is budgeting for, but it is quite certain, and is within the knowledge of every man interested in production, that the income tax this year must be considerably reduced. The prices of all primary products have fallen, and not only that, but in many instances the numbers of stock have also decreased. Men are today making up for their losses of the last two or three years^ where they can, by breeding upstock. There will be practically no> income tax this financial year from very many people who, in the past, have been paying large sums into the Treasury. The income tax is a particularly sore point with the man on the land. We know that the Treasurer had a Koyal Commission appointed, which was supposed, in some way, to rectify these grievances. The Commission has been sitting for a long time, but so far we have not had - any report from it . The man ou the land is still paying double,, and sometimes treble, taxation. In the face of this the Treasurer comes along and tells us that he is going to extort more money from the man on the land this year than last year. We are told by the Prime Minister that we are not as heavily taxed as are rather the people in the Old Country. There is no possible comparison between the position here and that in the older lands. In those distant countries, which have been longer settled than Australia, less money is . required for developmental purposes. Every pound taken from the primary producers and manufacturers of this country in the way of income tax reduces the amount that can be put into production. In an older land, where everything is more developed, where it is not necessary to keep on improving properly and extending manufactures, it does not injur e people so much to have to pay heavy income tax ; but in this country, where all our earnings are needed to put into capital account' to extend our affairs, to improve our country, to increase our flocks and herds, to develop our land, and to improve our production, it is disastrous for the Treasurer to tell us that he is going to raise more by income tax in the present lean year than he has raised in the preceding years. There are one or two other matters to which I want to refer. We have been challenged to mention any items which can be reduced without impairing the efficiency of the Departments concerned. We all know that it is not our business to do that, but I want to mention larly the way in which we are squandering money in training our boys. do not think any one would me of wanting to reduce fence efficiency of Australia. I realise as fully as any one else that are very many dangers looming that the world has not yet adjusted itself to peace conditions; that we shall probably not see real peace again in our time, and that we may never be able to get back to the old sense of security. I do not want to see anything done which will reduce in any way our power to defend when the trial comes, as come it must. can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that a great deal of money which is now being spent on so-called defence is sheer waste. ""Under the present system, our boys are not being made fit for war service, but are being given a disgust of the compulsory system. I have taken some trouble to find out the defects of the system. for instance, the University Rifles, a corps which includes men who, above all others, should be taking an interest in the future of this country, and in preparing themselves to hold safe this magnificent young land. They are feeling with the system of training, and are feeling that they are only being '' made fools of,"" to use their own expression. this? It is not because they do not take any interest in the future of this country. It is not because they do not want to do their duty by this country. It is because of the method by which they are being trained and handled. I have seen these fine young fellows in charge of the officer who is supposed to be training them. He told them to double, and, like many young fellows would have done, they responded in a haphazard and careless way. He became annoyed, and tried to brush them. dp. One or two of them and he told them that he would keep them at the double until they had learned how to double. When he talked to them in that way, they quite naturally got more careless and more irregular than before. Then, instead of keeping a firm hand on them, and making them do as he had told them, he let them sit down on the grass for the rest of the time. That is the sort of thing that is going on. I have seen a similar occurrence on the- Dandenongroad. Men, who were supposed to be Mr Fleming. training, laughed when a dog ran by. particu- Their officer took them to task. There was really something comic about the inciI dent, and they only laughed the more. accuse He tried to make them stand up against the de- the fence for half-an-hour. When some of them got tired they sat down, and he there had no authority to make them do otherahead; wise. The whole thing ended in a fiasco. Men are not beingtrained in a way which will make them efficient for the time which undoubtedly will come when the present young men of Australia will have to defend their country. They are being given a dislike for the whole system of training. ourselves We must have discipline, but should imI pose it in a way which will meet with the appreciation of the men.",68
356,Mr MATHEWS,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,They all like it .,69
357,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"-They do if it is properly imposed. But no man will stand a half-hearted instruction to do a thing, Take, and then be allowed to do as he likes. An officer must insist on his men doing what they are told to do, otherwise he may as well admit that he is incapable of handling them. This is another instance which proves that if one cared to disgusted go through the administration of the Government he could show many directions in which they have failed, not so much Why is in the spending of money, as in getting a return for it . I wish to deal with income taxation, not from the point of view of the producer on the land, but in order to point out the way in which the Government have failed to obtain taxation which, in the opinion of many people who have in other vestigated the matter, should be obtained. On the 29th September last I asked the Treasurerlaughed, 1. Is it a fact that certain importing firms have heen evading the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act? 2. Will the Government so amend the Act as to render the continuance of this evasion impossible ?",69
358,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. There have heen no illegal evasions of tax. The form of the present law, however, makes it possible, by means of certain legal arrangements, for foreign businesses to conduct branches in Australia in the form of separate companies, and thereby reduce the income tax which would otherwise be payable. 2. The Government proposes to consider means to prevent a continuance of this state of affairs. The Treasurer's reply stated that there had heen no evasions; hut still he admitted that income tax which should have been paid had not ibeen paid. In view of that reply, I asked him on the 5th October1. For how long has the evasion of income tax by importing firms been obtaining? 2. When did the matter first come under the notice of the Treasury or other Department? 3. Has the question received thorough investigation; and, if so, when, and by whom?",69
359,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Since the introduction of the Federal come tax. The so-called evasion is rendered possible by a foreign parent company which sells its product to a subsidiary company in Australia at a price very little below the ing price to the Australian public. This enables the subsidiary company in Australia to show a very small taxable profit. Consideration is being given to the amendment of the law in this connection in order to prevent the evasion in the future. 2. About two years ago. 3.,The Taxation Department recently completed a thorough investigation into the most important cases which have come under its notice. I ask the Committee to note the words "" to prevent the evasion in the future."" There we have an admission in three different forms that evasion has been taking place. On the 12th October I asked the Treasurer the following question:1. What sums is it estimated have been to the Taxation' Department owing to evasion of taxation by importing firms? 2. Has legal opinion been obtained from side the Department as to the possibility of receiving payment of these sums?",70
360,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"So far as is known, all taxes due by importing firms under various Taxation Acts have been recovered. There we have an illustration of the present Government's lack of administraOil tive and business ability. In those three sets of questions they contradict themselves three times. They say there have been no evasions, and then they say that there have been evasions, and that cerc.i.f. tain sums cannot be recovered. cannot they be recovered ? Have the vernment made any genuine attempt to deal with the matter? [483] ",70
361,Mr GREGORY,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,It was brought specifically under their notice.,70
362,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND COMMONWEALTH,"It has been brought under their notice on many occasions. All Australians who are interested in taxation know that the British Imperial Oil Company has been evading taxation; and why the Government will not at least take the advice of somebody outside the Department, with a view to recovering the money that is due to them, is hard to explain. If a man in the country forgets to submit a return of income, or makes a slip, even through ignorance, that can be construed into an evasion of the tax, the Government lose no time in bringing him to book. But a big firm, which has in- been importing oil into this country, and which the Government admit has been evading taxation, is allowed to go scotsellfree. So long ago as 1916 the"" late Mr. Palmer, formerly member for Echuca, brought this matter under the notice of the Government. The first Government acknowledgment of his complaint was made in 1917. Mr Wagstaff, general manager of the British Imperial Oil Company Limited, stated before the Inter-State Commission in 1918The British Imperial Oil Company is part of what is known as the Royal Dutch Shell Group The British Imperial Oil Company has only two shareholders, consisting of the Anglo-Saxon Company Iriniited and the Asiatic Petroleum Company Limited. The British Imperial O i l Company is one of 119 subsidiary companies owned lost by the Royal Dutch Shell Combine. The the Anglo-Saxon Company Limited is a distributing company in the Combine. The outAsiatic Petroleum Company Limited is a shipping company in the Combine. The Royal Dutch Shell group holds the 60 per cent., and the Shell Transport Company 40 per cent, of the Combine shares. The agreement between the Anglo Saxon Company and the British Imperial Company is short, and provides that: "" The local company shall be charged the market price for benzine as published in New York,"" and that all prices shall be Section 53 of the Income Tax Act Why states that any agreement entered into for' Go the purpose of evading taxation shall be declared void; and another section provides that a person who is proved to have evaded taxation may be fined an amount representing three times the taxation for which ,he was liable. What does that mean? The.importation of benzine into the Commonwealth during the five years 1916-20, in cases of 8 gallons each, totalled 11,871,588 cases, of which the British Imperial Oil Company imported approximately 8,330,107 cases. The cost of the benzine to the British Imperial Oil Company per 8 gallons is-Distillation, including all costs up to this stage, 4d.; freight, Is. Id.; duty, 8d.; distribution, 2s.; cases and tins, 2s. 6d.; total, The retail prices ruling in Australia during the five years 1916-20 were:-1916, 17s. 6d. per case; 1917, 20s.; 1918, 24s.; 1919, 25s.; 1920, 28s., or an average for the five years of 23s. per 8 gallons. The profits of the British Imperial Oil Company as disclosed by the above figures on the sale of benzine .only were:-1916, £841,366; 1917, £1,252,242; 1918, £1,345,740; 1919, £1,734,259; 1920, £1,925,000, or a total of £7,098,607. If the Government collected income tax upon that amount and fined the company as the Act entitles them to do, they would recover £6,000,000. The people are anxious to know why the Government do not test this case, or why they do not, at any rate, get an outside opinion concerning the matter. When, however, we bring up the matter in the House, we 'receive only evasive answers such as those I have read to-night. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) accused 'the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) of, if not falsifying figures, at any rate iending them a wrong colour. Has the Leader of the Country party ever done anything to compare with the evasive and directly contradictory answers given by the Treasurer? It astonishes me that the right honourable gentleman should accuse the Leader of the Country party of putting a wrong complexion upon figures when those figures were quoted from official quarters, whilst the Treasurer, who is in charge of the finances of the country, gives replies that are evasive, misleading, and contradictory. I impress upon the Government that before they go raking up the last few pounds of taxation due from men who are suffering in the back country, they should recover ifr. Fleming. those large sums that are owing to them as instanced by the facts I have quoted concerning the British Imperial Oil Company. That concern was owned by the enemy during the late war. Now it is deliberately evading taxation in a large and general way. If the Government i carried out its duties properly, it could get enough money in taxation from that company to cover the estimated expenditure for the increased postal and telegraphic facilities required throughout Australia. But no6s. 7d. thing is done, and the Government wonder why fault is found with its. administration. AstineGovernment shows so little sympathy for those' who are labouring to increase the country's production, we contend that it is time we had a Government in power which would so handle the affairs - of Australia that, not only would encouragement be given to primary producers and others, but they would have some advantage over those outside competitors with whom we have been trying to deal through the Tariff. In addition to accusing the Leader of the Country party of putting the Budget figures in an unfair light, the Treasurer taunted him with heing a new man in the House. Let me remind the Minister that a three year-old horse has been known to win the Melbourne Cup, and on some occasions v that three-year-old has been Australianbred. I see no reason why an Australian, although new to parliamentary life, should not lay down the right and proper lines on which the Commonwealth should be governed. The members of the Country party, like all others here, got their mandate from the electors; and if we think a certain honourable member is fit to be placed in command of our party, it is not for the Treasurer or any other honourable member to taunt our Leader with being a parliamentary novice. The Leader of the Country party has already proved his ability in the country. In his own profession he stands high. I am sure the honourable member can carry the weight and do the distance. We have been training him for some time, and, if the House will only give him a reasonably good start, he will land the stakes and bring the money home.",70
