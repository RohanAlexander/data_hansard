3,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [2.33] --! desire to make a personal explanation. It has been stated in the press and elsewhere, during the last few days, that before the honourable member for Bourke, the Government Whip, left the House last Friday morning, he made ah arrangement with me which would have precluded me from taking the steps which led to the exposure of the inability of the Government to keep a quorum. In an interview with a representative of the Melbourne Herald, published on Friday afternoon, the Government Whip is reported to have said I had to address one of the mid-day protectionist meetings. B it ore leaving the House, I saw Mr Chapman, the Postmaster-General, and asked him to look after matters in the House for me. Mr Chapman said- "" You had better see Mr Kelly (the acting whip on the other side) and arrange for pairs and other matters."" It is always a matter of honour with the whips during the absence of one of them, that the' other will not take any unfair advantage. I saw Mr Kelly, and told him that I would be away until two o'clock, and that I had arranged with Mr Chapman the details of pairs and other matters. Mr Kelly said "" All right."" I returned before I had expected, but by that time a number of members had left, and there was no quorum. On Friday the honourable member saw me ini the Opposition room, where I was writing letters, and told me that he was going away, but that in his absence the Postmaster-General would act as Whip, and would arrange for pairs in connection with any divisions which might occur. He did not speak of any other matter. The possibility of a quorum not being present was. not mentioned, and no arrangement was bers made with me in regard to the keeping of a number, quorum. Evidence of the correctness of House what I say exists in the fact that he told me that the Postmaster-General would, in there his absence, look after divisions, and, i there bad been a division, how could the only Government have prevented a count-out in the absence of a quorum? The honourable such member made no arrangement with me in regard to the keeping of a quorum; he did leave not suggest that the Opposition should conmake nive at the evasion by the Government its constitutional responsibility to keep quorum for the transaction of public busiarticle continuesness. I am therefore inclined to think that he must have been misunderstood or some misreported by the Herald interviewer. Nothing transpired during the conversadinner. tion with me which could have inspired him. the honourable member with the belief that an arrangement had been entered into betention tween us for the keeping of a quorum. There was no such arrangement. Furtherwithin more, when the count-out occurred, of the five Ministerialists in the Chamber, the to only private member present was the honoff orable member himself. As he was here to see what was happening, that disposes of the ridiculous contention that I may was guilty of a practically dishonorthe able act in calling for a quorum than while he was away. A blackguardly before attack was made upon me yesterlunch with day by the Melbourne Age in connection other with this matter. It is not my custom to natures take notice of newspaper criticism, especiseems ally not of libels emanating from a journal which daily prostitutes its talents in the vices of Sapphira; but I cannot alpurpose low the virulently mendacious attack public to which I refer to pass without comment, even though appropriately enough this newsthe paper has erected over its portico a statue of Mercury, the patron of thieves and liars. The article to which I refer is as follows: - his There is a code of honour, it is said, even among thieves, and Mr Chapman says there is one amongst politicians, and particularly amongst the Whips who marshal them. Men have to play the game or be ostracised It is certain that on Friday the Opposition broke all recognised rules in bringing the sitting vant to myself. to an end with a "" count out."" This it was that caused the. Government to cry "" A f o u l ! "" A ""count out"" is a part of the game, too; but it has to be brought about according to the code. Friday's "" count out"" was a breach of poitical honour, and hence the Ministerial indignation. The standing orders fix a quorum of the Chambe at twenty-five. Auy member may object to going on with business if there are fewer mempresent. Very often there are not half that and no notice is taken, because it is known that they are in the precincts of the and available on call. But if from any cause those in Opposition can seize a time wheno are not twenty-five Government supporters f within hail, they can leave the Chamber with two or three of their number to demand a count out. And that is a quite legitimate part of the game as it is played. To guard against a thing, it is the duty of the Ministerial Whip, when Government supporters desire to the Chamber in any unusual numbers, to an agreement with the Opposition, and such agreements constitute a code of honour. On of Friday that was done. a I have shown that it was not done. The Mr Hume Cook told Mr Kelly that he and other members desired to be absent for a couple of hours during the adjournment for The latter acquiesced, and that bound But no sooner were these members absent, together with a few others who left early for lunch, than Mr Kelly drew the Speaker's atto the want of a quorum, with the necessary effect that, as none could be obtained .1 few minutes, Parliament had to rise for the week, and the business before the House had be sacrificed. Mr Deakin characterized this in his Maryborough speech as "" watching men to their lunch, and then counting out the House before they could get back."" In palliation ' of this dishonourable trick it be urged by its impish perpetrator that Opposition had more members in the House the Government had. And that is true. But the time was 12.45 P- -> only a few minutes m adjournment, when members leave for a sense of security, relying upon each to at least abstain from the tactics of a political welsher. However, there are some which no honour binds when expediency to perceive advantage in a dodge. There was no party gain in the spiteful little piece of sercunning, and there was, of course, no public to serve, but only a loss of valuable time. There was the petty gratification that a Quilp might feel in pinching his wife's arm or in belabouring his wooden figure with blows of his waddy. It was an act that brands the Opposition Whip as contemptible amongst his fellows, but as that does not alter previous status, the people are the only sufferers. It might be well, however, if Ministers, to mark their sense of the meanness of the deception that was practiced on their own Whip, should refuse to hold any further intercourse with the offender for the rest of the present Parliament. The remainder of the article is not releThose statementscan, I think, best be shown to be false by comparing the present attitude of the newspaper with that which it took up on a similar occasion a couple of years ago. By such a comparison I shall prove, out of the mouth of the Age, that its mendacious attack upon me was absolutely without justification. The House was counted out on Friday, the 9th September, 1904, a few minutes after the resumption of ""(proceedings following the luncheon adjournment, when a luncheon party was being held within the precincts of the Chamber. This is what the Age said of that occurrence: After the adjournment for luncheon a curious thing happened. When Sir William Lyne resumed there were only nineteen members present. The member for Hume looked about him, and made a signal to Mr Thomas, member for ""Broken Hill . That honourable member promptly jumped up and called attention to the state of House.",13
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Surely the honourable member does not believe that.,15
5,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am quoting the Age. The article proceedsThis extraordinary contretemps created not a little dismay in the Ministerial ranks, and degree of humour at the expense of the Governdone with this newspaper. ment. Almost at the very inception of its term of office, and of an important debate, the Government had failed in its responsibility to a House. The two Ministers in the Chamber appeared to be panic-stricken. Here was dence of a fine capacity to conduct the business of the country ! Sir John Forrest was entertainMinisterial ing the Prime Minister and others upstairs at a luncheon, but where was the newly appointed Government Whip, Mr Wilks ? Why did he keep a House? The episode was regarded as mittee. a further conclusive proof of the demoralization of the House under its present leadership. Sir William Lyne, who was speaking at the time of the count-out, was by no means disand pleased at the turn of events. He had several strong criticisms to level against the Minister, he said, and he was not going tinue with them while Mr Reid persisted running away. According to all precedent the Government is responsible for the transaction public business, and must bear the responsibility of keeping a quorum. Apart'from the member for Hume, members strongly expressed the opinion that a Govern-^';' ment which neglected its duty in this fashion, which deserted its post to allow public affairs to look after themselves, and which in a craven way refused to face criticism, must be brought to account with promptitude. The "" count probably did more than anything else could have done to hurry up a no-confidence motion. That was the view taken by the Age newspaper in regard to a similar ocurrence during the life-time of a Government to which it was opposed.",15
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Was the Age opposed to the Reid-MCLean Government ?,15
7,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If it had not been opposed to that Government, the honourable member for Barrier would have received treatment similar "" to that received by me yesterday in its scoundrelly leader. Mr 'THOMAS.!-But I did not intent tionally count the House out.",15
8,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"This is what the Age said when the House was counted out on the 2nd November, 1904:While the Opposition is not fulfilling the threat of some of its members to give the Government no quarter, it can be depended upon to embrace opportunities for embarrassing Ministers when those opportunities prominently present themselves. On two occasions the Government has neglected to keep a House. On Wednesday night there was a "" count o u t "" almost at the usual hour of adjourning, and the Treasurer the yesterday wanted to evade the penalty for this neglect by replacing the lapsed estimates on the notice paper, going on as if nothing had happened. Oppositionists were not inclined to be so lenient. They might be as anxious to get into recess as the Government, but like all true oppositionists, they must support the standing orders. some Having quoted those statements, I have It has shown itself so unworthy in all its political critikeep cism, from whatever stand-point directed, that I thought I could not do better than evianswer its lies out of its own mouth. The Prime Minister and others sitting on the side of the Chamber, have said that I deliberately counted heads before not calling attention to the state of the ComTo that charge my reply is that on Friday morning I did not enter either the Labour room or the Ministerial room, I therefore leave i l to the Government to explain how I could have counted heads. Prime The best evidence of the falsity of the to concharges which have_been made by the Goin vernment in its extraordinary indignation of at this exposure of its inability to maintain a quorum, lies in trie fact that of the three parties represented in the Chamber ^vhen attention was called to the state of the Committee, the members of the Opposition, who were in no way responsible for the keeping of a quorum, were proportionate! v a larger representation than were the out"" mernbers of the other parties present.",15
9,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Bourke) [2.45] I also wish to make a personal explanation with respect to what occurred on last Fridav. The statement of the honourable member for Wentworth is correct to a certain degree, but I think' that it is necessary that I should give my version of what took place. What happened was this: I found it necessary to leave the House for about two hours, and. in the ordinary course of business, I communicated with the Postmaster-General, to whom I usually refer upon such occasions of the kind- I think that I had been under the necessity of doing so only three times since I have held my present position. The ^Minister said-""You had better see the Acting Whip of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth, tell him to w things are, and put him on his honour as to the state of the House."" I think that the Postmaster-General added: "" If you do that, things will be as safe as a church."" My answer was that I did not think it necessary to put the honourable member for Wentworth upon his honour, but that I would inform him of the circumstances, and that it would then be all right. I saw the honourable member for Wentworth and told him that I would be away until two o'clock, and asked him to see the Postmaster-General if it were found necessary to arrange for any pairs. I did not ask him not to count out the House. not make any particular or special arrangement with him as to that or anything else. If one had to make a special arrangement of that kind in every such case, it would be necessary to enter into a solemn compact half-a-dozen times a day.",15
10,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,How often has the honourable member helped us?,16
11,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"In every way I could. I have always arranged the business with the view to meeting, as far as practicable, the wishes of honourable members of the Opposition, and I am sure that not a single honourable member can say that he has been inconvenienced by any act of mine. I did not think it necessary to enter into any special arrangement upon the occasion referred to. because I naturally expected that the business would be allowed to proceed in the ordinary way. As proof that there was - an understanding in this respect, I desire to point to the fact that the honourable member for Lang, who now significantly objects to the restoration of the ""Bounties Bill to the business-paper, arranged with the honourable member for Yarra that there should be no courit-out. .",16
12,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,No ; he did not say there should not be a count-out.,16
13,Mr HUMECOOK,Unknown,"I understand that the honourable member for Yarra desired to go to lunch .and that he saw the honourable member for Lang, who stated that rather than permit a division to be taken before lunch he would keep the debate going.",16
14,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"1 asked the honourable member for Lang whether he thought there would be a division before 1 o'clock, and he said "" No.""",16
15,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"And I understood he also said that the business should be kept going until 1 o'clock. The honourable member for Lang told me that he had agreed that the debate should be kept going until 1 o'clock, which I understood to mean that there would be no count-out, but that business would be permitted to proceed in the ordinary way. If the honourable member for Lang states that what I now say is incorrect, all I can add is. that I misunderstood him. What I have stated tends to prove that there was an understanding on both sides of the House that the business was to be allowed to proceed in the ordinary wav. It is well known that at noOn on Fridays honourable members who have to leave Melbourne are I did busy making arrangements for their departure, and no advantage has, so far,, been taken of that fact. I admit that it is the duty of the Government to keep a quorum, but I would point out that the circumstances connected with the previous count out were entirely different from those which surrounded the proceedings onlast Friday. Upon the previous occasion no arrangement was entered into, nor was any undertaking given.",16
16,Mr KELLY,Unknown,That count-out also occurred on a Fridav.,16
17,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"If an arrangement had been made between the representatives of both sides upon the previous occasion no attempt would have been made to count out the House. I know that the previousi count out took place on a Friday, and I am further aware that the statements made with regard to the dinner that took place on that occasion are true. It is also quite possible that the bells may not have been heard by some honourable members who were within sufficiently easy reach of the Chamber to attend and help to make a quorum. The circumstances, howeverj were entirely different from those on Friday last, when a number of honourable members went away in the full belief, that no tricks would be played. They felt satisfied that the honourable understanding would be observed, and that there was no danger of their being deprived of an opportunity to vote, or of any business lapsing.",16
18,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. I think that it is a serious reflection upon the House that twenty minutes should be occupied in explaining differences between two honourable members that might very easily, be dealt with outside, or in the press; I desire to know whether extended explanations, such as those to which we have listened are in order, unless a motion is moved which will enable other honourable members to take part in,the discussion.",16
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is always a matter for deep regret when honourable members indulge in very long explanations.. I do not think that such explanations do so much service as those who offer them may think. At the same time, it has always been the custom of this, and of every other Parliament of which I have any knowledge, to allow very considerable latitude to an honourable member who feels aggrieved, even though the grievance may appear trifling to other honourable members. I should be very sorry to restrict the rights and liberties of honourable members in this respect, but I hope that they will refrain from making explanations at length, and especially from making them in such a form as to provoke other explanations, and practically give rise to a prolonged debate.",17
20,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [2.50] - I desire to make a personal explanation in connection with the leading article which appeared in the Argus relating to the matter under discussion. The comments of the writer show that either he is blindly prejudiced, or absolutely ignorant of what transpires in this Chamber. If the members of the Labour Party, like prominent members of another party, were to complain of every unfair comment that is made in the press, they would occupy the whole of the time of the House. In yesterday's Argus the following statement appearedThe Watson Ministry managed to secure a count-out in the House of Representatives. That is absolutely incorrect. The person who wrote that statement endeavoured to convev the impression that whilst the Watson Government were in office the House was counted out. As I happened to be the Government whip at that time, I should take it as a reflection on mvself""if a count out had taken place. If the writer of the article will take the trouble to examine the records of the House for the three and a half months during which the Watson Government were in office, he will find that no count out occurred. I have a distinct _recollecltion of the two count-outs, which occurred during the time the half-and-half Ministry occupied the Treasury bench. The Argus, which backed up that Ministry, however, forgot to mention the events referred to. I would recommend the Argus to exercise a little more care, and to confine itself to accurate statements. With regard to the events of last Friday, I may mention that as I was about to go to lunch I saw the honourable member for Lang, and asked him if there was any likelihood of a division taking place before lunch. He said he thought not, and that, if necessary, he would keep the business going.",17
21,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [2.55] - I had not intended to trouble the House with a personal explanation, but as my name has been mentioned, it is only fair to myself that I should make some explanation as to my connection with the events under review. So far as I am concerned, what happened was this: At about twenty minutes to 1 o'clock I was on my way to the library, when I met the honourable member for Yarra, accompanied by several others, who were about to go to lunch. The honourable member for Yarra said, "" I suppose there will not be any division before lunch."" I said that I could not answer for that absolutely, but that I did not think so, because the honourable member for New England had just risen, and I thought that he would in all probability cut out the time until 1 o'clock. I added that I did not think that there would be anv division, because, if necessary, I would keep the debate going until the adjournment for lunch.",17
22,Mr KELLY,Unknown,But the honourable member did not know that there would be a countout in the meantime.,17
23,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"No. When I returned to the Chamber, I was surprised to find that the honourable member for New England had concluded his speech, and that the honourable member for Kooyong was addressing the Committee. As soon as the latter honourable member had concluded, at about a quarter to 1 o'clock, I rose with the object of continuing the debate, but simultaneously the Minister in charge of the Bill, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, also rose, and suggested that the adjournment for lunch might at once take place. I was thus prevented from speaking, and then the honourable member for Wentworth suggested that it would be desirable to have a quorum before an' adjournment was made for lunch.",17
24,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Ha d no consultation taken place among the members of the Opposition ?,18
25,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"There was no conspiracy organized by the Opposition, as alleged by the Prime Minister, to effect a count-out by calling for a quorum. I believe that, as a matter of fact, the Postmaster-General was to blame for what occurred, because in an audible whisper he advised the Minister in charge of the Bill",18
26,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must confine his remarks to an explanation of his own conduct.,18
27,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I shall content myself with what I have already stated.,18
28,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The count-out wicked waste of public time.,18
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We have had wicked display of bathos on the part of the Prime Minister.,18
30,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Eden-Monaro-Postmaster-General ) [2.59} - As my name has been brought into this matter, and it has been stated in the press that I was mainly responsible for what happened on Friday last, I wish to say a few words in explanation. I was attending to some business in the Ministerial room when the honourable member for Bourke came to me and stated that he desired to leave the House until 2 o'clock. I asked him before doing so to see the Opposition Whip .and to put him on his honour as regards the business of the House. That is the usual practice, and it is the one which was followed during the whole time that I occupied the position of Government Whip. It was the only arrangement which it was necessary to make. For example, when I was about to visit England, I merely informed the honourable member for Macquarie of the fact, and his reply was, "" I will see that everything is all right."" There was never anv occasion to bind him down to an agreement of that sort. That is why I said to the honourable member for Bourke, "" Put the honourable member for Wentworth upon his honour."" Of course, I do not know what the honourable member for Bourke said to the honourable member. I was not aware whether there was a quorum within the precincts of the building at the time of which I am speaking, but I was informed in the Ministerial room that the honourable member for Wentworth was arranging for a count-out.",18
31,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Who informed the Postmaster-General ?,18
32,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I do not go "" blabbing "" around information which is imparted to me confidentially, and, therefore, I do not intend to reveal the name of my informant. If the honourable member for Wentworth is sincere in his statement that the charge levelled against him .is absolutely false, I should like him to definitely say. that he did not arrange in any way to secure a count-out. Let him say that. When I entered the Chamber the honourable member was in close consultation with honourable members of the Opposition. It was about fourteen or fifteen minutes to 1 o'clock, and, as we have often was a risen before - the ordinary hour for luncheon, in order to allow of amendments to Bills being framed, I suggested to the a Vice-President of the Executive Council that he should consent to an adjournment. I did so, believing that my information was good, and that it was the intention of the honourable member for Wentworth, if possible, to count-out the House. It transpired that my anticipation was correct, because immediately the Vice-President of the Executive Council rose, the honourable member-wh o had not had time to arrange with some other honourable member to act for him-himsel f called attention to the State of the Committee. Let the honourable member deny-if he can-the statement that he took steps to arrange for a countout. SUGAR BOUNTIES .",18
33,Mr CULPIN,Unknown,"I wish to direct the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to the following statement which appeared in the Brisbane Courier of Friday last:The Mossman canegrowers are experiencing considerable delay in obtaining payment of bounty claims, which amount to between £300 and £400 weekly. The head office, it is stated, only remits a comparatively small amount, and then awaits the return of the farmers'"" vouchers before further remitting. The funds available are only sufficient to meet half, the claims. Unless the present arrangements are altered, the payments at the end of the crushing will be at least £10,000 in arrears, and at the rate of £400 per fortnight the final payment on the present season's cane will not be made till late in 1907 - a prospect which the farmers never contemplated when registering. The mill directors have wired a protest to the Collector of Customs in Brisbane. I should like to know whether the Minister - will inquire into the matter. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I heard, only this morning, that some dissatisfaction existed with regard to the payment of the bounties, but upon inquiry I found that the officers in my Department knew nothing about the matter. The bounties are paid over by the Treasury, and perhaps, the Treasurer can afford the 'honourable member some information upon the question. MR. CHARLES ATKINS.",18
34,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs the folbers? lowing questions:1. Was Sir William Lyne at Ballarat on table.

"" 4. Does Sir William Lyne endorse that doctrine, and does he think that a person who advocates freedom of contract is a fit and proper person with whom to hold political meetings?",19
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"In answer to the honourable member, I may say that 1 was at Ballarat on Friday night addressing a public meeting. I was asked to attend by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I did not know who was to be present, and I must say that this is the first occasion upon which I have heard the statement, which the honourable member for Barrier has just made, regarding an utterance by Mr Atkins.",19
36,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,He made that statement most definitely.,19
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I did not know anything about that. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports informs me that the invitation to attend the meeting came direct from Ballarat. The meeting which I addressed was,19

45,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The principal rolls for all the States will be printed on or about the date mentioned, but they will contain more than the names of electors who were enrolled prior to the 16th of July. In New South Wales and Victoria, for example, they willcontain the names of persons who have been enrolled upon specific claims, and of others who have been enrolled UDon the information collected by the police. In fact, in all States they will include the names of all electors whom the electoral officers are satisfied are entitled to enrolment. In some of the States these rolls will be printed earlier than they are in others. Then the supplemental rolls will contain all the names of electors who are qualified to vote, and have applied for enrolment up to the time of the issue of the writs. The desire of the Department has been to include upon the principal rolls the names of as many elee1 tors as possible, so that the supplemental lists may be as'small as possible.

I submit this motion in lieu of the resolution which I moved some time ago, and which embodied the recommendations made by the Tariff Commission upon these particular items. The present proposal differs from the former resolution only in this respect : that it is considered by the Department and by myself much more satisfactory to impose a specific duty upon harAct, vesters and strippers than to levy an ad valorem duty. Honourable members will recollect that in the past a good deal of trouble has been experienced on account of the impossibility of ascertaining the correct ad valorem duty which should be collected upon these goods. Any further trouble in that connection will be obviated if , upon these two classes of machinery, resort be had to specific duties.",20
53,Mr KELLY,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,At what rate does the specific duty proposed work out? Sir . WILLIAM LYNE - At about 25 per cent. It is five shillings less than the ad valorem duty recommended by the Tariff Commission.,21
54,Mr KELLY,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That statement is based upon the Minister's arbitrary valuation of harvesters ?,21
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is based upon a proper valuation.,21
56,Mr LONSDALE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Minister knows that it is not.,21
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Sometimes honourable members say that I know nothing.,21
58,Mr LONSDALE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable gentleman does not know very much.,21
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I know quite enough for the honourable member. basis upon which this has been arrived at is the valuation of ^£65 placed on these machines. As I explained just now, our proposal will, if adopted, save the Department a great deal of trouble-it will avoid the necessity of communicating with the States and with Canada. If we had had in the first instance a specific duty much of the difficulty that has arisen would have been obviated.",21
60,Mr LONSDALE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is a piece of political thieving.,21
61,Mr MCCAY,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is the Minister making any condition as to price?,21
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It is unnecessary to embody in the motion the conditions as to price, but I shall lay upon the table a short memorandum showing what the Government propose to embody in the Bill to prevent a combination charging more than a certain price for these machines without losing the advantage of a portion, if not the whole, of the duty. The Bill , which I shall not prepare until the motion has been dealt with, will provide that the cash price of 5-feet stripper harvesters must be reduced by the end of 1906 to £ 7 0 . I wish to emphasize the point that the Tariff Commission recommended that the price should not exceed That, to my mind, would be an outrageous charge.",21
63,Mr LONSDALE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Then the honourable gentleman does not think that ^ 6 5 is a fair price for the imported machines?,21
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I have heard that statement so often that it is unnecessary for the honourable member to repeat it,21
65,Mr LONSDALE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,But the two things do not fit.,21
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I have no wish to listen again to a tirade of abuse such as that to which. I have been subjected. The Bil l will also provide that the price of the 5 f t . 6 in. harvester shall be reduced by the end of 1906 to ^ 7 5 .,21
67,Mr ROBINSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They can be bought for,21
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable and learned member goes about the country talking in a blustering way of things about which he knows absolutely nothing;. I shall show how little he knows of this subject. Before we fixed the Customs valuation of £ 6 5 upon the 5 f t . 6 in - harvesters, the selling price in Melbourne was .£84.

Failing such reductions, power will be taken to reduce the import duties, by proclamation, or resolution of the House, to an amount to be determined by such proclamation or resolution, not to be less than one-half of the new duties imposed.

I cannot go into every detail in submitting this bald motion which is intended really for the information of the Committee, and is not part and parcel of the Bill to be hereafter submitted. I recently met a member of the firm of Hugh Lennon and Co., who directed my attention to a statement which appeared in the Argus of 22nd and 24th instant, to the effect that, in consequence of the motion submitted by me, in accordance with the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, the price of harvesters had been increased. The gentleman in question gave me his business card, showing that the prices charged for these machines are .£75 for the smaller size and £ & o for the larger size, and that - these prices have prevailed ever since the ring that was in existence was partly, if not wholly, dissolved.",22

93,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Certainly . I am very glad that the honourable member for Maranoa referred by interjection to that phase of the question. If there is one thing I desire more than another it is that the weaker section of the community shall be fairly paid. I desire that the workers shall be protected just as strongly as I wish to secure protection for the manufacturer. If honourable members require further information as to the number of machines imported, I shall be prepared to supply it at the proper time. I may mention that the proposal to pLace on the free-list certain articles which are at present dutiable will not come into force until the Bill has been passed. At the seen present moment hand-worked rakes and ploughs combined, maize harvesters, maize binders, maize planters, moulding boards in the rough and not cut into shape, and potato raisers or diggers are on the free-list, and it is proposed to add hay tedders and potato sorters to the list, for the reason that it seems that they are not manufactured here, and that probably* if they were not made free, as recommended by the Commission, the price would be unduly increased. I shall be glad at the proper time to give honourable members all the information that is required in regard to this matter, but I do not think that it is necessary at present to do so. Progress reported. SPIRITS BILL. SECOND READING.",22
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.31] - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. The object of the Bill is to give effect to the resolution' agreed to by the Committee of Ways and Means for the imposition of duties of import on spirits, and to carry into effect the recommendations of the Tariff Commission on the subject. This is done in greater detail than if has hitherto been the practice to adopt. In one or two respects, however, tihe measure requires amendment. For instance, medicines are to be interpreted to include "" medicines for internal or external application."" It has been pointed out to me that.if that interpretation .were 'left as i't stands, injustice would be done, and unnecessary expense w-ould have to be incurred. I therefore propose to add the words,' "" other than liniments and veterinary medicines."" also propose to amend the provisions relating to ""methvlated spirit,"" because I have been informed that, for some time past, the law has been abused, owing to the practice of illegally treating the spirit so that it can be sold for human consumption. This, of course, is an evasion of the Tariff, with which I propose to deal very stringently. Scents are interpreted to include "" all liquid preparations of perfumery and liquid preparations for toilet purposes."" That interpretation and the definition of Australian standard brandv. which has already gained a high reputation, carry out the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. Clauses 10 and 11 provide10. After the twenty-eighth day of February One thousand nine hundred and seven, no imported spirits shall be delivered from the trol of the Customs for human consumption unless the Collector of Customs for the State satisfied that the spirits have been matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than two years. 11. Spirits distilled in Australia - shall not be delivered from the control of the Customs for human consumption unless they have been matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than two years. It has been reported to me that those provisions will cause a good deal of trouble and, perhaps, create injustice unless we make arrangements for a supply of spirits during a period in which no supply would otherwise be available. With a view to partially meeting, the difficulty, I have alreadv decided that no further action shall be taken until the ist March next.",23
95,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That wili not be sufficient for wine spirit, although it may be sufficient for molasses spirit.",23
96,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"In Committee I shall place my information clearly before honourable members, and leave them to take the responsibility of making an alteration. If the words "" two years "" are allowed to remain as they stand, I .shall have no power to do other than see that the provisions are complied with.",23
97,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,If the period is altered there must also be an amendment of the Excise Tariff Bill.,23
98,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes . But I shall have no power to extend the time if the provision remains as it is. The term ""two years"" has been inserted in the Bill because that is the period recommended by I the Tariff Commission. It is provided that gin shall be matured in wood, which, judging by samples which have been sent to me, tends to make it brown. I understand that chemists say that to mature gin in wood is to improve it, but those in the trade complain that the drinkers of gin and schnapps are so accustomed to a clear spirit that their business will fall off if a discoloured spirit is placed on the market. Moreover, I have been told that a large quantity of gin which has not been matured in wood has been ordered, and is on its way here. In dealing with the subject, the Committee will have to determine whether gin shall be matured in wood, and, if so, for what length of time it must be kept before being used. I have received so much information lately on the subject of wines and spirits that I am almost in con- a position to lecture in regard to them. I have been informed that pot distilled spirit is is received into iron tanks which have been bricked and cemented, and is as good on the day of distillation as it ever will be.",23
99,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable gentleman refers, not to pot distilled spirit, but to rectified spirit. The former requires maturing, while the latter does not.",24
100,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable and learned member was with me when Mr Seppelt explained the matter to us, on our visit to the distillery, where we saw the whole process. If spirit is put into wood, it may be discoloured, but it improves, although there is a considerable loss through absorption and evaporation. No loss occurs when the spirit is kept in iron tanks, bricked and cemented, and my information is that such spirit can be used at once, because keeping does not improve it. I discovered, in going through three distilleries I have visited, that the patent still eliminates the ethers, while the pot still allows them to pass over, and consequently makes a better spirit. That, no doubt, is why the Tariff Commission is so strongly in favour of pot stills. In the process of distillation, four tanks are used, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. The best spirit is that which goes into the tanks numbered 2 and 3, and the spirit in the tanks numbered 1 and 4, being equally good, is put through the still again, to bring it up to the same standard as that in tanks 2 and 3. I agree with the Tariff Commission that, where it is possible to use the pot still, it should, in the interests of the public, be used. I should, however, like to know what is the exact meaning attached to the words "" pot still or other such method.""",24
101,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I think the words are subject, "" similar processes.""",24
102,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They mean processes giving somewhat similar results.,24
103,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"M v desire is to ascertain how the words will be strued, and in Committee I hope to information from the members of the Tariff Commission on the subject which will enable me to prevent the leaving of loop-hole of which advantage may be taken. In clause 13 I propose to insert the wordsSpirits to be used for the purpose of scientific investigation in connection with universities public institutions. The use of spirit under that provision be subject to strict supervision. I shall, however, deal with the matter more f u l in Committee. I refer to these proposed amendments now in order that honourable members may know the course which I intend to take.",24
104,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Angas) [3.43] - Although "" the Bill has - been introduced to carry into effect a resolution arrived at by the Committee of Ways and Means a week or ten days ago,. I think that it affords us an opportunity to deal with the suggestion made in regard to the time allowed for the maturing of rectified spirits of wine.",24
105,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is a new point. The Committee did not accept the honourable and learned membeVs view.,24
106,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,No vote was taken on the question.,24
107,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable and learned member wishes to reopen the Excise question.,24
108,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I see no objection to reopening it for the prevention of injustice.,24
109,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,We cannot reopen the Excise question unless we have the Excise Tariff Bill before us again.,24
110,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The matter with which I wish to deal is an important one, and a way should,, therefore, be found for dealing with it.",24
111,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If it is dealt with, it will break up the whole scheme.",24
112,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I think not. Although I recognise the splendid work done by the honourable and learned member, I do not regard the Commission as infallible.",24
113,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Our recommendations were based on the evidence laid before us, which the honourable and learned member did not hear.",24
114,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have gone to some trouble with a view to understanding this having visited several of the distilleries - one twice in one week - and having studied the reports of the Commission, and read some of the evidence given before it . It cannot conreasonably be held that the Commission get made no mistakes. The treatment which the Government have meted out to the recommendations of the Commissioners constia tute a reflection upon their work. Either the Government are wantonly disregarding sound recommendations, or the reports furnished by the Commission are at fault. My point is that some of the grape spirit and does not require to be kept for two years in wood in order to secure the degree of will puritv desired. The remarks of the Minister might apply to pot-still spirit, but ly not to rectified spirit produced from grape wine. When distillation takes place by means of pot stills the results arrived at are very different from those which are brought about when spirits are rectified by means of patent stills. The process of high rectification has the effect of removing from the spirit all the impurities that can possibly be eliminated. The Bill provides that the blended brandy shall contain 25 per cent, of pot-still grape spirit and 75 per cent, of pure rectified grape spirit.",24
115,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That will not be brandy, but merely simulated brandy.",25
116,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am speaking of pure wine spirit. Does the honourable member seriouslv say that a spirit which is made soltelv of wine spirit is not brandy?,25
117,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Not if the spirit is made by the rectification process. ' Mr Glynn - I know that the honourable member has got pot stills on the brain. He has been reading up something with regard to the use of pot stills in France, and thinks that none of the products of distillation under the improved methods adopted during the last two or three generations can compare with the brandy produced by the pot stills used in the south of France.",25
118,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is the opinion of all the best experts.,25
119,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That has nothing whatever to do with the point with which I am dealing. What I say is that spirit made from pure grape wine is pure brandy. It is provided in the Bill that blended brandv shall consist altogether of pure wine spirit, and that 25 per cent, shall be made by the pot-still process. Now, experts tell me that pot-still brandv should be kept in the wood for a period of two years, in order to eliminate from the spirit some volatile oils which are passed over in the process of distillation. By maturing the spirit in wood for two years these oils become eliminated or of less strength. The same remarks would not apply to the 75 per cent, of rectified wine spirit which is proposed to be used in making up blended brandy. keeping that spirit for two years you would not attain an appreciably higher degree of purity, because the process of rectification eliminates the volatile oils which are to be found in the pot-still products. I have taken the trouble to visit some distilleries and obtain accurate information on this point, and the view which I have expressed is supported, not only by distillers, but by Excise officers. Therefore, I cannot be so much mistaken as the honourable membeT for Perth seems to think. The Bill provides that the whole of the blended brandy, including the rectified grape wine spirit, shall be matured in wood for two years, and I contend that, according to the information supplied, that provision is not necessary in regard to the rectified spirit, which cannot reach any higher degree of purity by the process of maturing, although. it may approach a little more closely to the standard of alcoholic purity known to chemists. There is not sufficient rectified spirit in store-no r could it be obtained within six or eight months-to enable the manufacture of brandy to be Carried on. Plenty of molasses spirit can be obtained, but rectified grape spirit cannot be made until the next vintage takes place. Therefore, the two-year period specified in the Bill would not commence until after the next vintage. I would suggest that in the case of rectified spirit, a period of two years should be allowed to elapse before the provision to which I have referred is brought into force. Of course, I know that, according to the views held by the Chairman of the Tariff Commission and by the honourable member for Perth, what I am now saying is all ^ fudge, but it is the judgment of science.",25
120,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,M v opinion is merely based upon the evidence.,25
121,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,But evidence is not always correct.,25
122,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The evidence is as reliable as any information that the honourable and learned member could obtain by visiting the distilleries.,25
123,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Some of mv information has been derived from Mr Seppelt, who has written a letter upon which the Tariff Commission",25
124,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Mr Seppelt has been priming honourable members with information in his own interest.,25
125,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No , - he has not. I visited Mr Seppelt, because I was on By circuit within five miles of Seppeltsfield. My visit took' place a week after I had been, approached by a deputation of representative distillers of South Australia, and mv sole desire was to obtain a little more information. Distillers and Excise officers alike state that it is not necessary to keep rectified wine spirit in the wood for two years.",25
126,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They did not say that to the Commission.,25
127,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I cannot help that; I am merelv giving the information as.it has been conveyed to me.,25
128,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable and learned member is raising new points.,26
129,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Are we to remain silent because certain information has not been given to the Commission? Cannot we bring forward any new points that may be brought under our notice? A number of reports have been presented by Comferred missions since the first Commonwealth Parquired liament was opened, and, I think, only have been acted upon. This tends to show that honourable members have not attached any very great importance to the evidence which has been taken at such great expense, or to the conclusions which have been based upon it . Now we are told that in the case of the Tariff Comthe mission we must accept the evidence as incontrovertible, and their conclusions as beyond all possibility of error. I am deavouring to supplement the evidence given before the Commission with inforthese mation' which mav fairly be regarded as reliable, seeing that it is the testimony of expert witnesses. My contention that we should provide that the use of rectified spirit that has not been kept f two years shall be allowed until after the next two vintages have taken place. Until March next there will not be sufficient wine spirit available to permit of the manufacserved ture of what is described in the Bill blended brandy. Molasses spirit can. ever, be procured at once, because the raw material is available. I hope that when we reach the Committee stage an amendone ment will be carried in the direction have indicated.",26
130,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Bendigo) [3.55]The Bill is intended to give effect to the general recommendations of the Commisverv sion, which could not have been included in the Excise Tariff Bill . I am glad to see that Ministers have seen their way clear to accept the recommendations of Commission with regard to the spirit wine industry generally. I hope that this Bill, in conjunction with the new Excise limit duties, will have the effect of placing distillation industry of Australia upon sure, satisfactory, and scientific basis, that the industry will receive a great i m petus. I trust that the manufacturers that it should operate all round. will welcome the opportunitv to carry on their industry upon proper lines, and that approval. the consumers will be able to feel assured that they are obtaining a good article. should like to draw attention to some of the features of the Bil l with which I think the general public are not fully acquainted. [121] I refer more particularly to the provisions relating to what may be described as the standardization of spirits. Distillers will no longer be granted a concession by way of Excise duty without having to give something in return. As a compensation for the Excise advantages that are conupon distillers, they will be reto produce a good article, whether two it be brandy, or whisky, or rum. Upon complying with the statutory requirements, they will be entitled to affix to their goods a Commonwealth certificate and trade name. Therefore, it seems to me that they will have every inducement to comply with the law in order that they mav enjoy advantage of. the standardized name whether it be "" Australian standard brandy,"" .""Australian blended wine brandy,"" ""Australian standard malt enwhisky,"" ""Australian blended whisky,"" or ""Australian standard rum."", I think that provisions will give rise to a spirit of emulation as between distillers, and that they will take a pride in turning out a. is good article. In the course of the evidence given before the Commission, very great o r stress was laid by a number of witnesses, comprising manufacturers, Excise officers, and wholesale merchants, upon the absolute necessity of strong spirits being prei n wood for a certain length of time as before they were permitted to pass into howconsumption. There was a general consensus of poinion that spirits matured by being kept in wood- I believe that only witness was doubtful upon this pointI were much improved in character. It was pointed out that, owing to the process of oxidation of the secondary products, or, in other words, the evaporation of the strong volatile elements, the spirit became much purified. It was stated that one of the causes of the failure of Australian, and particularly of Victorian, spirits, was that they were placed upon the market the when they were immature. Mr Joshua and admitted that age matured spirits, and agreed that, perhaps, there should be a placed upon the introduction the of immature spirits to the market. a It was also urged that that time limit and should apply not only to imported, but also . to locally-produced spirits-in other words, To that proposition there was a general chorus of The point upon which I have brought into conflict with the honourable and I learned member for Angas 7- for whose opinion I entertain the very greatest respect - is that whilst throughout the whole of the evidence tendered to the Tariff Comallowed mission it was laid down as a general position that young and immature spirits probation. should not be allowed to pass into general consumption, not a single word was uttered in reference to differentiating spirits which are distilled at a low strength and spirits which are distilled at a strength. The general opinion was that the advantage to be derived from oxidation suggestion. applied not only to spirits produced at low strength by means of the pot still, also to highly rectified spirits. There was no nate suggestion that highly rectified spirits did not require time for maturing. distinctly laid clown that all spirits should I had spoken. be kept in bond or "" quarantine,"" as might term it, for a certain term before thing. they were allowed to pass into general consumption. What I complain of is that the point which has been raised by the honourable and learned member for Angas is a new one, which was never suggested by the wine-growers, by the distillers, themas selves, or by the departmental experts were called upon to advise the Commission. There may be something in the point, but I am guided only by the evidence. I know dence. nothing whatever about what has transpired in private conversation. The recommendations of the Commission are based upon the sort. the sworn evidence of witnesses, and if certain gentlemen desired us to differentiate between spirits distilled at a low strength by means of a pot still and highly rectified spirits produced by the patent still, they ought to have brought that fact under our notice. I submit that the information presented by the honourable and learned member for Angas should not carry the tralian same weight as should attach to the general views which are embodied in the recommenan dations of the Tariff Commission. As a member of that body, I am guided only by the evidence and not by the ex post facto statements which have been communicated to the honourable member and to others who have had no opportunity ot"" cross examinfor ing their informants. Probably had point been, brought under the attention the Commission, that body would have in with vestigated it. I repeat that no distinction was drawn between spirits produced low strength and spirits distilled at a high strength, and, consequently, our recommendation is that no spirits intended for ral consumption-irrespective of whether they are produced by means of the pot still or by any other method-should be Sir John Quick. to be taken out of bond, unless prothey have undergone a certain period of",26

But I have been at considerable trouble to investigate this question of spirits, and I wish to point out to the Chairman of the Commission that the only spirits which require to be kept in wood for two years are whisky, rum, and brandy. According to the testimony, not only of expert distillers, but of expert officers of the Customs Department, a highly rectified spirit is no better after it has been stored in wood for two years than it would be after it had been stored there for only two weeks.",27
138,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is what I use said,28

140,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"What does the honourable member mean by a "" highly rectified spirit ?""",28
141,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I mean a spirit from which all the injurious ethers have been expelled, and one which, consequently, cannot possibly improve with age. This highly rectified spirit is used for the purto pose of blending with pot still spirits which contain these ethers. Take the case of gin as an illustration. If we insisted that gin should be stored in wood for years, it would become exactly the same colour as whisky.",28

149,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,W it h the exception of gin. I thoroughly agree with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that there is an unlimited opening for the of methylated spirits. But the Minister must see that those spirits are not demetiiy,28
150,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is provided for in the Bill .,28
151,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But the Minister will require to see that much more effective supervision is exercised than has been exercised hitherto. Alfhough it has been against the law to denature spirits, we know that they have been denatured. Whilst we are affording a fair measure of protection the distillers, we ought to see that the revenue is thoroughly protected. In this connection I would call the attention of the Minister to the fact that a large amount of two revenue is being lost to the Department through what is known as the "".grogging "" of casks. In dealing with this matter, I a find that the Imperial Parliament has provided an elaborate set of regulations which' distillers, when they are refilling to their casks, from extracting spirits from the and from selling them, thus evading a the payment of duty. A very lafge amount age of spirit can be extracted in that way, and Minister should see that something is done to prevent it. I should like to quote, some regulations upon this subject which! are in force in Great Britain. Regulation. Empty casks to be refilled or removed to a distillery - Spiri t casks left empty after any whether they have contained British spirits or foreign^ spirits, are, as a rule, to be report refilled. When this is not desirable or convenient, as far as the proprietor is concerned, they may, nt his option, be removed lo a distillery or warehouse, or they may be exported; the in either case being first properly drained, and bungs, which should be of hard wood, driven in. Regulation 2^0 relates to the removal of empty casks to a distillery, and provides When casks are so removed a dispatch showing the "" number "" and the "" content "" of each cask, the denomination and the strength of the spirit which it last contained, and the date of removal, is to be sent to the officer at the disor warehouse to which the casks shall consigned. The officer at the distillery or warehouse is to send a receipt on the same document showing the dale of arrival of such casks, and report whether there be any indication of the extraction of spirit from the wood of the casks during transit. The officers at any distillery or warehouse to which the empty casks are sent are to exercise a general supervision over such casks, and to see that they are not again removed from the distillery premises or warehouse for the purpose of having the spirits extracted from the wood prior to being refilled. Regulation 291 has reference to the exportation of casks, and provides thatWhen casks are exported, a dispatch showing the spirits stated in the preceding paragraph is to be sent to the export officer at the station where the ship is lying, who will state thereon whether there be any indication of the extracTion of spirit from the wood during transit, and if satisfied of the contrary, certify to the actual shipment of the casks. The document thus attested should then be returned to the officer at the warehouse from which the casks were removed. In cases where the officers are not satisfied, as specified above, the casks must be detained for the decision of the Board as to whether the bond should be put in force. They have to enter into a bond with regard to these casks292. Bond for removal to be given - Genera l bond may be entered into - Bon d should be given for the security of the revenue in respect to the spirit contained in the wood of such casks during iheir removal. If the ordinary bond be given the amount of the penalty should not be less than £ 2 f ° r e a c n hogshead, and £ 1 for each quarter-cask, with proportionate amounts in even pounds for casks of other kinds; but, if desired, a general bond may be given, the liability o i the remover being calculated on the above relative bases. In cases of exportation the penalty will be double the iibove rates. Apart from any penalty lo which the remover may be liable, it must be understood that any misuse of the option of sending casks to a distillery or warehouse may result in the withdrawal of such option. 293. Casks may be washed out instead - Spiri t casks, not belonging to a distiller, or which it may be inconvenient to send to a distillery or warehouse for refilling, or which, from unsoundness or unsuitableness the proprietor mav not wish to refill at the warehouse, may be delivered therefrom, provided that at the' expense of such proprietor they be effectually washed out with water, so as to remove the spirit from the wood prior to delivery. For this purpose each cask should be partially filled with water to the extent of a sixth part of its ""content,"" be retained in warehouse at least six days, be rolled round at least once daily, and be left at rest after being rolled with a fresh surface in contact with water each day. The rinsings from the casks thus treated are to be destroyed in the presence of the officers, unless, at the'option * f the proprietor, duty be paid on the quantity of spirit at proof which they contain. The fact that it is deemed necessary to frame regulations of this kind should be sufficient to show honourable members the Mr Hutchison. importance of the question with which we are dealing. I know of no provision made by the Excise Department to deal with the large quantity of spirit that can be extracted in this wayIn the latter case, an account is to be taken of the quantity and strength, and the particulars are to be entered at the foot of the operation account to which the casks belong after the rinsings have been collected in suitable sized casks; and such rinsings may then be delivered on the passing of a warrant in the usual way; or they may be added to a subsequent operation, subject to the regulations with regard to spirits reduced with water, or they may be exDorted either in original casks or in others of legal size. 294. On certain conditions a similar quantity may be used - Shoul d the proprietor give notice of his wish to pay duty on the rinsings of casks, and express a desire to obtain the spirit in a more concentrated form, a similar quantity of water, not less than 10 per cent, of the "" content,"" may be used, the cask being retained a longer time in warehouse, the essential principle being that each part of the internal surface of the cask shall remain in contact with water for about forty-eight hours before the cask is removed from the warehouse. On certain conditions casks may be cleared after twenty-four hours - If , however, the proprietor should so request, the casks may be completely filled with water and the contents destroyed after remaining in the casks not less than twenty-four hours, an undertaking being puncheon, £ 2 for each given on the request that the casks shall not be subsequently ""grogged."" Water may be added in the warehouse or immediately on removal therefrom in the yard or other suitable premises adjacent thereto, and the casks when filled may be left in any convenient place within the walls of a dock or under Crown lock or other place of reasonable security elsewhere. The officer must examine the casks when filled, and see the contents destroyed at any time after twenty-four hours from his examination, certifying to this effect in the register. 295. Examination and destruction of contents. - The officer must examine the casks when filled and see the contents destroyed at any time after twenty-four hours from his examination, certifying to this effect in the .register. 296. Casks emptied for methylating spirits When spirits are removed from the distillery or from the warehouse after methylation the empty casks are to be removed to a distillery or warehouse, subject to the foregoing regulations, or at the option of the methylator they may be washed in a locked compartment at the place of methylation in the same manner as casks washed in warehouse, the rinsings being, at the option of the methylator, destroyed or added to the spirits in the next methylation, on condition that the spirits to which the rinsings are added be not thereby reduced below the legal strength at which methylated spirit may be sent out. In case the washings are added to the methylated spirit the slock should be adjusted accordingly. Casks of British liqueurs, such as orange bitters, of which the strength is under 42 per cent., may be delivered when emptied without the grogging regulations being applied to them. 297. Empty casks delivered - All empty casks before being delivered from warehouse must be properly drained, and, as far as possible, subjected to examination at the time of passing the outer door, when they must be rolled over with their bungs out. I discovered these regulations quite ally whilst glancing over Ham's Inland Revenue Year-Book for 1896, and I was struck by the fact that they had not been mentioned by any Minister of Trade and Customs in this House. Whilst effectively protecting the manufacturer, should take steps to effectively protect the revenue. I am glad that the members of the Tariff Commission are prepared to consider the amendment ings of clauses 10 and 11, and I think that after giving the matter further attention they will come to the conclusion that those clauses are unnecessary, except in so far as they deal with purely pot-still spirit. Whilst I am pleased that no delay has occurred in taking steps to protect a trade which was all too rapidly falling into the hands of foreign manufacturers who have been introducing into the Commonwealth for ageing rectified spirit. the worse kind of spirits",28

I would respectfully urge that the recommendations of the Commission have been based on very careful and painstaking rewe are search, and that, while in some respects we the evidence submitted to it has not been of that all-embracing character that we could have desired, the Commission has endeavoured to supplement any shortcomin that direction by official information available from other sources.",30

The honourable and learned member for Angas has spoken of the knowledge of the experts of the Department. I admit that they are, as a rule, highly capable and efficient, so far as the particular work with which they have to do is is concerned; but I do not admit that they have that special knowledge which would enable them to decide what are the true of spirit, the higher classes of spirit, and what constitute the essential Those matters are wholly beyond their province. into Whilst they have given the Commission much useful information, they have been careful, as a rule, to deal only with those details upon which their experience enables In most cases, they have frankly indicated I have been at considerable pains to read up, not onel, but several authorities on rectified spirits, and, in addition to what is the universal experience, I find an overwhelming mass of evidence to support the contention of the Commission that even highly rectified spirit, if new, is not nearly so wholesome as that which has been matured for a number of years.",30
162,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,In what respect is it,30
163,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have already said, but for the benefit of the honourable member I shall repeat the statement, that chemistry is very much at a loss to explain the particular constituents of alcohols-thei r qualities and the operations that take place in the changing of the various constituents from one chemical form to another. That has been admitted by the ablest chemists who have come before the Commission. In dealing with questions about which the ablest men know the least, witnesses, as a rule, have been most dogmatic in proportion to their lack of knowledge. We have overwhelming evidence to the effect that raw rectified spirit is highly injurious when taken into the human system. That is undoubtedly the experience of those countries in which alcohol is used as a common beverage by the mass of the people. In Scotland, ' Ireland, and of late years, on the Continent of Europe - in Germany and France, where highly rectified spirits have, unfortunately, largely been coming into consumptioni-the testimony is almost unanimous that a process of deterioration physical, mental, and moral takes place in those who swallow raw, and highly rectified spirit;",31
164,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is so, but we are dealing with rectified spirit to be used blending purposes.",31
165,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The evidence goes to show the necessity for keeping highly rectimember fied spirit under lock and key years after it.has been manufactured.,31
166,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What effect would that have on the spirit?,31
167,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It would make it less injurious. Common experience points to the advantage of keeping such bond for two years. It is found that, as the result of ageing, it mellows and becomes less injurious in human consumption.",31
168,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is contradicted by many experts.,31

171,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I say that highly rectiput fied spirit, \f new, even when taken in junction with any other spirit, is injurious in proportion to its newness.",31
172,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"All spirit, whether rectified or otherwise, is injurious.",31
173,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,But the pot distilled spirit must be kept.,31
174,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member admits that, but he will not admit that highly rectified spirit should be kept. In my opinion it should be kept, and the experience of experts shows that it is more necessary to mature highly rectified spirit than to mature pot distilled spirit.",31
175,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Why ?,31
176,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is not easy to explain. The chemical constituents of spirit, and the changes which take place in it, are not very well known, even by the best chemists. They admit that they have to act largely, on the result of practical experience, which is almost universally to the effect that crude spirit, even though highly rectified, is injurious to the human constitution, and becomes less injurious after it has been kept for a period of years.",31
177,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is very questionable.,31
178,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member may question the statement, but it sets forth what I believe to be the attitude of for science and of experience in regard to the subject.",31
179,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does not the honourable think that all spirits are injurious for two if used as beverages?,31
180,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not wish to discuss that point at the present time. If spirits are poisons, they must be regarded as remarkably slow in their action.",31
181,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They sometimes produce spirit in insanity very quickly.,31
182,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not believe in the use of alcoholic beverages; but I ask why it is, if spirits are so injurious as some persons would make out, that nations.which have been soaking in alcohol for centuries still, physically, mentally, arid morally, examongst the highest races on the earth?",31
183,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I dispute the soundness,31
184,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The subject is a big one, but I do not wish to discuss it now, as I must keep to my text. If rectified is used in Australia, in the manufacture of brandy, I regret it, and hope that the practice will be discouraged by this Legislature. A great deal of the evidence before us shows that the best brandy conis produced by means of the pot still, and pot stills only are used in those countries which manufacture the brandy bearing the best reputation. Rectified spirit may be used in compounding a so-called brandy^ but the concoction is not a true brandy.",31
185,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It should not called brandy.,32
186,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Wit h regard to the maturing of gin in wood, it is objected that the colour thereby imparted to the spirit would retard its sale.",32
187,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It would give it the colour that whisky possesses.,32
188,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Althoug h of recent years' the whisky sold has possessed an amber tint, I remember when in Scotland all the whisky was as colourless as the gin now on the market, notwithstanding that it had been matured in wood. The colouring to which the honourable member for Hindmarsh refers is due, not to maturing in wood, but to maturing in sherry casks, and it has not. been proved that casks or other wooden vessels could not be made in which gin could be stored for a number of years without being coloured. A great deal of the whisky sold nowadays is almost identical in its component parts with gih, though flavoured differently.",32
189,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the honourable member knew of any merchant who keeps his gin in wood ?,32
190,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No ; but I think it likely that gin can be stored in wood without being discoloured thereby. If , however, it could be shown that it would be of advantage to mature gin in vessels other than wood, I would not object to that being done.",32
191,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is best to sell gin soon after it has been made.,32
192,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If the honourable member inquires the prices of different brands of gin, he will find that he must pay more for gin which has been matured than for gin which is new, and will be told that matured gin is superior in quality to new gin. What weighed with the Commission, in recommending the storage of spirit in wood, was that it is necessary to prevent storage in bottles being allowed to count, it being Ithe general opinion of experts that spirit doe's not lappreciably mature after bottling,",32

Medical men will agree with me that, for external application, methylated spirit can be used to advantage, and that it would be very exbe pensive if other spirit had to be used in our hospitals and asylums. I am informed by the Minister's colleagues, and by the official who is watching the Bill, that it will not be necessary to reinsert these words in clause 15; but I ask the honourable gentleman to see that they are inserted, if it is at all doubtful that they are not covered by the amended interpretation of the word ""medicine.""",32
194,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Lang) [4.42] - I believe 'that if the community would forego the use of alcoholic beverages it would be 1 all the better for doing so. Indeed, if people generally were persuaded that spirits are injurious, instead of beneficial, when used as a beverage, there would be no need for legislation of this character; but until the happy time comes when that truth is recognised we should do our best to secure that only spirits of the highest purity get into consumption. This measure however, pays special consideration to the interests of the Victorian distillers, at the expense of the industries of the other States. It is well known, so I am credibly informed by persons whose opinion is entitled to respect, that Victorian distilleries do not possess up-to-date appliances, being fitted up with the old-fashioned pot stills, which have long since gone out of date. However much it may be desirable tb provide for the maturing of spirit distilled by pot stills, because of the large quantity of impurities contained in it, it is not so necessary in the case of the highly rectified spirit distilled by the patent stills. In any case, I understand that the effect of keeping spirits' in wood for a long period is not to get rid of the impurities, but to disguise their presence. As a matter of fact, these impurities still exist, although the spirit becomes so mellowed that the impurities are less noticeable. This applies to spirits distilled in pot stills, but not to spirits produced in patent stills, such, as are used by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The spirits produced in pot stills contain a very large proportion of impurities, whereas the product of the patent stills is much purer, because in the process of rectification all deleterious substances are eliminated, and the spirit is as pure as it is possible to make it.",32
195,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It is pure in the same sense that distilled water is pure; but we dependent, know that it is unwholesome.",33
196,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If the honourable pure, member drank distilled water mixed with that a very little phosphoric acid he would very much prolong his life, because stand that that mixture will prevent the ossification which leads to senile decay.",33
197,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member may obtain some very pronounced opinions with regard to distilled water from old prospectors in Western Australia, who have been drinking it for years, and who are fully aware of the disadvantages attached to its use.",33
198,Mr MALONEY,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It was not the distilled cohol itself. water, but the tinned dog, that killed off the diggers on the Western Australian gold-fields.",33
199,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am informed that, by the process of high rectification, all most poisonous elements in the spirit are eliminated, and that it is not necessary mature the spirit by keeping, it in wood. If it were to be kept in the wood f o twenty years, it would not be .any better than if it were matured for five This information is given to me by men who have had many years of experience in distillation, and who are practical men.",33
200,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Are they men who disin tilled by the patent still process?,33
201,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"One man has been He stated, furtherengaged in distillation for over forty years, and has used every conceivable kind of long still. On reference to the report of the Tariff Commission, honourable members will notice that it is stated by witnesses that sure spirit cannot be turned out by means >f a pot still, whereas spirit upwards of degrees overproof can be manufactured means of patent stills. According to' the kinson. evidence of Mr Wilkinson, the Government Analvst of Victoria, the purer spirit prothat duced by the patent still is the least sonous. Mr Wilkinson, speaking of the the consumer. secondary products, saysIn the higher boiling portions, there was was called "" fusel o i l . "" This consisted cohols higher in the series, for instance, butyl, and amyl alcohols. In distillation, the impurities were in part eliminated, but they necessary for flavour. A spirit containing of them was practically featureless. It had no but to disguise their presence. character, and was neutral in taste. Referring to Mr Wilkinson's evidence, is further statedHe summarized these articles by stating the so-called impurities of any spirit, upon for commercial value the flavour was largely possessed toxic properties greater than those of ethyl alcohol, the main constituent of all spirit and the least toxic. If alcohol were it would have no injurious effect other than due to alcohol, no' matter its origin. So far as scientific knowledge goes, the substances removed in the rectification of spirit were more I underinjurious than alcohol itself. With regard to inferior spirits and adulteration, it is stated in the reportMr Wilkinson had examined some of the cheap spirits imported, and had found that they were highly rectified, and contained very few impurities indeed. They might have been of any orgin. Physiologically, they could not be considered injurious. So far as ""scientific.knowledge went, the substances removed by the rectification of spirits were more injurious than alThis statement is in direct contradiction to that of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who said that the imported spirits were of the most injurious character, arid the were poisonous in a marked degree. I do not recollect the exact remarks of the honto orable member, but he represented that closer supervision would have to be exerr cised in regard to imported than in regard to locally manufactured spirits. A little years. later on Mr Wilkinson saidThere was no proof that the keeping of spirit for a time would eliminate certain poisonous elements. Medical men were very much divided opinion upon this subject. Only an improvement in flavour would be gained. It was a scientific fact that, no matter how spirits were kept, the poison in them remained. I do not pretend to be an expert in these a matters, but I think lhat we should paysome regard to the opinions of men of ex60 perience which are backed up by the indeby pendent testimony of men like Mr Will ",33
202,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Mr Wilkinson says if spirit were kept in wood for two poiyears or more it would be of advantage to,33
203,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes ; but he qualifies what that statement by indicating that the adof alvantage to the consumer would take the propyl, form of improved flavour.. He points out were that the effect of keeping spirit in wood is none not to eliminate the poisonous elements, He says that the poisonous element still remains, it but that the flavour is improved.",33
204,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is because of that the gradual process of oxidation to which which the secondary products are subjected.,33
205,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Jus t so. But the poisonous elements still remain.,34
206,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No ; they are verted. "" Mr JOHNSON - Mr Wilkinson that it is a scientific fact that, no matter how long spirits are kept, the poison in them remains, and, therefore, the advanthey tage to the consumer to which he refers must be merely a matter of palatability. In other words the spirit, by being kept in wood, will become more palatplete cuble. His testimony in that respect is supported by men who are envery titled to be regarded as experts. It seeins to me that if any reason can be advanced favour of maturing in wood for a period two years spirits which are produced means of the pot-still, it does not apply spirits which are produced by means of patent still. I understand that if the posal of the Government be enforced, some distillers will be required to expend a vast upon this proposal. sum in acquiring land, and in providing immense storage accommodation for spirits. Whilst I do not appear special pleader for any distiller, I do that, if the Minister desires to place manufacturers of all the States upon an equality, due regard should be given to these considerations. Unless it is lutely necessary-upo n the ground of health-to compel the distillers to incur immense outlay to provide storage accomcleared modation for their spirits, the Minister ought to consider whether it is desirable enforce a provision of this kind. Personupon ally I should be very glad to see an put to the distillation of spirits, so far come. as they are intended for consumption as a beverage. If it is necessary-as I suppose it is-to distil spirits for medical purthe poses, I have no objection to urge. But if we could only persuade the community the less they indulged in spirits the it would be for them, we should soon arrive at that period when it would be no longer necessary to enact special legislation preservation of the public health.",34
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Parramatta) [5.3] - As the Minister has paid some tention to one or two points upon which intended to offer some criticism, and on not be rum. account of other personal reasons, I do not intend to occupv the time of the House any length. There is still another reason which deters me from speaking in any the most deferential way upon this question, and that is the presence in the House strength. of members of the Commission. They have paid more months of attention contc this matter than ordinary members have, been able to devote hours to it, says and they must be presumed to have discussed its pros and cons very fully and deliberately. But, notwithstanding that have given all this attention to the subject, there may be points which have been left unconsidered-point s as to which the evidence has not been so full and comas to enable them to arrive at the real facts of the situation. Of course, it is easy for honourable members who have not been through the process of sifting and in inquiry to know all about the subject. I of confess that I have not read the evidence by taken by the Cc>mmission as carefully as to the honourable member for Lang appears to the have done. Not having read that evidence, proI suppose that I am in a much better position to record an intelligait - vote I speak, therefore, only of information which has been their conveyed to me by persons who know as a all about the subject, and who are insay terested in it from a commercial standthe point. All that information is in agreement upon the point of the standard which should be set up in connection with the distillation absoof, say, rum, which is made from molasses. All' the evidence which I have gathered an goes to show that that rum cannot be of its impurities at so low a degree as 35. In fact-to use the expression to employed by the persons who spoke to me the subject-ru m so distilled simply end ""stinks,"" and the stink cannot be over",34
208,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The spirit has to be distilled twice, and it is the central portion of distillate which has a commercial value.",34
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I was not aware that of that. I am speaking of the molasses better spirit which is distilled in New South Wales. The trade describes it as being in a stinking condition when it is so distilled, for the and they urge that nothing less than 60 degrees would eliminate its objectionable odour.",34
210,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It would be too highly atrectified then. Experts say that if it were I distilled at 60 degrees of strength it would,34
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am informed at that nearly all the rum which comes from the West Indies-and a large quantity of but the rum used in Australia comes from there - is distilled at from 65 to 70 degrees of,34
212,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Then it must be "" doctored "" or simulated rum.",35
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,-That is what my informants tell me. They say that in any case to distil rum at so low a strength as 35 degrees would mean that they would never be able to get the stint out of it.,35
214,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The standard has been increased by general consent to 45 degrees.,35
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is a very considerable difference, I admit, and to some extent it meets the objection which I have been urging. The fact that a higher degree eliminates impurities from the spirit is not questioned, and it is only the degree of rectification which is concerned in the argument. If we can eliminate these impurities by rectifying the spirits at a higher degree, it seems to me that we should do so. Then I am formed that'rum is rarely more than six months old when it is sold in the markets of London. It is never kept longer than that period, and rarely so long. The argument is advanced that if in one of the great markets of the world a standard of. six months or under is observed in the sale and consumption of these liquors, it should afford some guide to us in prescribing the period during which they should be bonded here. Concerning the importation of this stuff, I am told that it would be almost impossible to ascertain the duration of the storage of rum. For instance, I am assured that no certificates are issued by the Excise Department in London, or at any of the other places oversea ",35
216,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"We are considering that question now, and I have communicated with the Imperial authorities in reference to it.",35
217,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I .am glad to hear that. There seems to be something lacking which would permit of an easy identification of the age of spirit. I take it that the Minister only requires to be assured that spirit has been stored for the prejscribed term. If he can be - made aware of that fact in a way which will not undulv interfere with business, so much the better. At present there-does not seem to be any facile means of ascertaining how long spirit has been actually stored. In the absence of any certificate from the Excise Department at Home the only other course for the Minister to adopt would be to accept a certificate from the - distillers. Whether that could be done under a system of proper supervision, I do not know. I do not know how supervision can be applied to spirit which is produced in another part of the world. That is the difficulty in regard to the importation of these spirits under any circumstances, and under any system of classification. We want to be able to check the certificates which accompany them, and how that is to be done, seeing that there are no checks kept by the Excise Department at Home, is a problem which requires to be solved before we can determine the facts of the case as they apply to the period during which rum should be stored. However, these are matters of administration, and no doubt the Minister will look into them. I amglad to hear that he is in communication With the authorities at Home, with a view to ascertaining whether they have any better means for determining the age of spirits than we have. No doubt he will avail in- himself of the experience of the world if any such experience be available in the official quarters in which he is apparently seeking it.

218,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Angas) [5.15] - The honourable and learned member for Bendigoand the honourable member for Perth were of opinion, when I was speaking a few minutes ago, that I intended to propose an amendment to exclude rectified spirits from the provisions regarding maturity. The honourable member for Hindmarsh and I endeavoured to point out that those provisions were not required, but, at the same time, we do not object to their application. What we do wish is that their operation may be postponed for, say, two vintages. At present, there is not sufficient rectified spirit in stock to enable the law to be complied with, and the result would be that the making of blended brandy, composed partly of pure grape spirit, would cease. We desire a period of grace to enable manufacturers to comply with the Act. The vignerons have first to obtain a vintage, and then to keep the wine in stock for two years, so that the imme-diate application of the maturity conditions would be harsh in view of the fact that, as I have said, there is not sufficient wine in stock to enable blending to be carried on. The definition clause ought to be amended. We ought to exempt from the operation of the second paragraph b of clause 3 Australian wine brandy which, before some date to be prescribed, is cleared from the Customs or entered for home consumption as .provided in clause 11. Clause 11 prescribes the ist March, 1907, as the date from which the maturity condition shall apply. I should like the date in the case of Australian blended wine brandy to be extended for two years after March, 1907; but as there might be some objection to such a long postponement, I suggest that we should fix upon ist March, 1908, as the date from which this provision shall apply. I am in doubt as to whether we should also amend the definition of "" Australian standard brandy."" I believe that in South Australia, at all events, the pot-still brandy is kept until it has matured for two years and upwards, and that there may Be in stock sufficient of that spirit to enable provision to at once come into operation, so far as Australian standard brandv is concerned. We ought to amend the provision in regard to Australian blended wine brandv, and if it be found that a mistake has been made in not amending the definition ""clause in regard to Australian standard brandy, we may later on amend it in a similar way. It has not been clearly stated, but I believe that there is no objection to 'the provision as to maturitv applying at once to the Australian standard brandy. All the distillers, whom I have met, desire that every condition considered necessary by the Government to insure the proper maturing of brandy shall be applied, but that a reasonable date on which the .maturity conditions shall come into force should be fixed.",35
219,Mr WILSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I have a prior amendment to propose.,36
220,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Then I shall refrain from moving at this stage the amendment I have indicated.,36
221,Mr WILSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Corangamite) [5.22] On behalf of the honourable member for Grampians, I move That the words "" Australian standard brandy "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof words "" Pure Australian grape brandy.""",36
222,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is a new name.,36
223,Mr WILSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member for Grampians considers that it would be a better name to apply since it would convey to the minds of the consumers the fact that the brandy in question was essentially a grape brandy.,36
224,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It would lead to the opinion that there was brandy other than that made from the grape.,36
225,Mr WILSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Perhaps so; but the honourable member for Grampians represents a wine-growing district, and I presume that the amendment was suggested by vignerons in his electorate.",36
226,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Bendigo) [5.24] I hope that the amendment will be rejected. The name embodied in the Bill is a typically suggestive and comprehensive one. It was well considered, and conveys an idea as to what a true brandy is. On the other hand, the words proposed to be substituted would suggest that there might be a brandy other than grape wine brandy.",36
227,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Lang"") IY25] - If my memory serves me rightly, this question was thoroughlv threshed out when the Government proposals regarding the spirit duties this were before us in another form, and I think that .we arrived at an agreement that the term "" Australian standard brandy "" should be applied to the spirit in ouestion.",36
228,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I understand that there was some agreement.,36
229,Mr TOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"There is a possibility that the amendment, if adopted, might give rise to misapprehension. All consumers of brandv do not know what are its constituents, and I dare sav .that the average user is not aware that it is distilled from the grape. I do not think that it is very material whether we retain the clause as it stands or agree to the amendment, but it is just possible that the use of the term proposed on behalf of the honourable member for Grampians might lead to confusion. Amendment negatived.",36

It is understood that if , as the result further inquiry, it is found that the condition ought to be inserted in the paraperiod. graph relating to Australian standard brandy an opportunity will be afforded for the necessary amendment to be moved.",37
231,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Bendigo) [5.28] I do not object to the amendment, which will postpone the application of the years' maturity condition to Australian blended wine brandy until ist March, 1908; but in view of the previous disit cussion I would object to the postponement of the condition in regard to Australian standard brandy. That brandy is composed of pot-still spirit containing; volatile elements that can only be worked off by the maturing old. of the spirit. The point, however, must be raised as to whether, if this amendment be made with reference to Australian blended wine brandy, we ought not also to grant standing. a similar postponement of the maturity condition in respect to Australian blended whisky. I give notice that at the proper stage I shall move such an amendment.",37
232,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Perth) [5.31] - I wish put before the Committee an expert opinion dence. in regard to the advantage of maturing spirits of all classes which I had to quote when speaking on the second reading ; but the volume was not then available. Mr J. A. Nettleton, F.C.S., ap authority of very considerable weight, at page of a work which is, I believe, regarded as the principal exposition of the methods manufacturing spirits, in the United Kingfor dom, the processes of maturing, and the before us. general regulations connected with Excise and Customs, saysIn pot still whiskies the ' by-products range from 40 to 80 grains per proof gallon, the variations in quantity and quality within these narrow limits, vary considerably affecting their flavour. In patent-still spirit or whisky, scarcely any by-product other than propyl alcohol is collected. Both descriptions of spirit, however, are, so far as the consumer's practical tests are applied, decidedly improved by storage in good wine casks. He proceeds to explain what I have already tried to impress upon honourable members, that although the chemical processes and changes which take place are not very well understood, practical experience shows that it is of advantage to mature spirits by storage in wood. Like the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, I have no objection to the modification proposed by the !> for honourable and learned member for Angas, in view of the custom existing in some of the States which has been recognised - as legal of and proper, on the understanding that the same concession is to apply only for a limited",37

He specially investigated certain points for us. of and received the thanks of the Commission the valuable information which he put He saidIt has been found during the process of maturing spirits that some of the obnoxious constituents diminished in quantity. With brandy the proportion of furfural diminished with age, and the proportion of esters, and of higher alcohols increased. This was supposed to be t due to the formation of esters of a peculiar kind, from which oldspirit obtained its aroma. From a scientific point of view, the ageing of spirits improved them by removing some of the deleterious constituents, but it was difficult to say to which of the esters or of the higheT alcohols the beneficial effects of spirit were due.",37

Sir WILLIAM LYN E' (Hume-Min ister of Trade and Customs) [5.36] - I was under the impression that the honourable and learned member for Angas had accepted my suggestion to adopt ist January, 1908, as the date to be fixed. I cannot agree to a longer period of time than that, and must therefore recommit the clause for the purpose of having the amendment altered.",38
240,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I should think that that would be the more convenient date.,38

242,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,A year and four months is allowed.,38
243,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The period allowed is practically only twelve months, because the reckoning must be made from vintage to vintage, and there is not a big stock of rectified spirit kept in hand. There is not, however, much difference between January and March.",38
244,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Bendigo) [5.38] I think that the same arrangement should be made in regard to Australian blended whiskv as has been made in regard to Australian blended wine brandy. In a letter which I have received from Mr J. M. Joshua, he saysRe "" Spirits Bill 1906,"" and the maturing pro- the material upon which to operate. visions thereof, it appears to us that there will be a strong (and just) demand for preliminary notice, both on the part of distillers and importers. May I take the liberty of reminding you that this matter was carefully worked out in the Canadian law. In Canada notice similar to that now proposed was given, and, in view of the attitude taken by the representatives of South Australia, I move That before the word "" It , "" third paragraph b, the following words be inserted :- "" Unless entered for home consumption before the ist January, 1908.""

Clause 10 (Imported spirits to be matured).",38
245,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Min ister of Trade and Customs) [5.44] I should like the Committee to take into consideration the question whether it is advisable to require the maturing of all spirits for a period of two years, or whether extra time should not be given. I have already issued instructions that the provision with regard to spirits being matured in wood for two years shall be suspended until 28th February, 1907. Perhaps we can deal with the matter f - which ?I have referred by inserting a proviso to the effect that the clause shall not apply until the ist January, 1908, to gin, Geneva, Hollands, schnapps or liqueurs.",38
246,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Angas) [5.47] - I do not think it very much matters whether or not the suggested proviso is inserted in this clause in order to bring the provisions with regard to imported spirits into line with those relating to locally-manufactured spirits. This clause relates to the spirits of the whole world, and surely there cannot be any such dearth of two-year old spirits as to lead to a suspension of importations. With our own manufacturers, the case is different, because they have not It is already provided that the clause shall not come into operation until the 28th February, 1907, and that seems to me to get over the difficulty with regard to shipments on the way to Australia. The notice to shippers and others should surely be sufficient, and I do not see why we should go teyond what we have already done. It is provided that clause 11 shall not applv to spirits which were subject to the control of the Customs on the 17 th August last, and which are entered for home consumption before the ist March, 1907. It was not considered necessary to make a similar provision with regard to imported spirits, and it seems to me to be unnecessary to insert the amendment proposed by the Minister. The only question is as to whether we should make any provision for spirits now in bond which have not been matured in wood for two years. Personally, I do not think there is any necessity to amend the clause. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) posedThat the following proviso be added vided that this section shall of January, One thousand nine hundred and eight, apply to gin, Geneva, Hollands, schnapps or liqueurs.""",38
247,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Lang) [5.54] - I should like to know whether the Minister has considered the representations during the debate on the spirit duties that gin is a spirit which deteriorates than improves with age. It is said that whatever medicinal properties it possesses spirits are due to the juniper berries from which the spirit is popularlv supposed to be disentered tilled. But I understand that the juice the juniper is added to the spirit after disseven. tillation. It has been stated that the sooner gin goes into consumption the better i for medicinal purposes. this matter should be considered so that clause as altered by the Committee. we may avoid making a blunder.,39

I am of opinion that there is a considerable future in Australia for the production of liqueurs. If we are going, to relax the condition relating to the maturing of spirits, I see no reason why it should not be relaxed all round. In my judgment, it is a distinctly retrograde step, but I like to be as logical as possible, and if we grant an extension in the case of two classes of spirits, I think that other spirits which are upon the same footing as regards their manufacture should be treated in a similar wav.",40
266,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Hindmarsh) [6.7]. - I am sure that the Minister must recognise that, inasmuch as we have exempted imported spirits from the condition laid down as to storage, we must also exempt spirits which are locally produced.

I can quite understand the provision which is embodied in clause 10, that some little extension of time should be allowed for the clearance of imported spirits, and that Australian spirits, which have already been distilled, should be permitted to pass into consumption under similar conditions.

285,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Since an importer of inferior spirit could not redistil it in Australia, surely he ought to be allowed to redistil it beyond the Commonwealth?",41
286,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It seems to me that such spirit might be exported, not for redistillation, but to be sold as Australian spirit, and might be regarded as the usual product of Australian distilleries.",41
287,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Commerce Act would prevent that being done.,41
288,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If it were enforced, it might do so; but this provision seems to be in conflict with the Commerce Act.",41

Some requests were made to the Commission by those in charge of museums that a concession should be granted in respect of spirits so used, and I ctrtainly think that the Minister ought to extend this concession to spirits for the preservation of such specimens intended, not necessarily for scientific investigation, but for the equipment of museums, and incidentally for the instruction, if not for the amusement of the people.",41
296,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I amendment would apply to spirits so used. The preservation of certain things in spirits would be for 'Scientific purposes.,42
297,Mr FOWLER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If my memory serves me correctly, the greater proportion of spirit required by public institutions, such as museums, is used for preserving specimens. If the Minister has any doubt on the point he ought to so extend the amendment as to embrace spirits used in museums.",42

309,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Hindmarsh) [7.30]. - I am glad that the Minister has inserted in the Bill a provision which imposes a penalty on any person who may sell or has to in his possession illicit methylated spirits, anv article of food or drink, or any scent, a essence, tincture, or medicine, containing f they methylated spirits; but I should like to at know whether such a provision can be enI f it to can, we have power to pass similar enactments in regard to other spirit. On the 7 th March last, to quote from a newspaper is report of the meeting of the Adelaide Central Board of Health'W. P. Auld and Sons forwarded sample whisky which had been purchased by them at the Agricultural Show ground. The whisky was I in a bottle labelled "" Buchanan's House of Commons whisky."" The writers had no hesitation in pronouncing the spirit to be South Australian spirit made from grapes. It was pointed out that there was a great deal of this false trading being carried on in and around Adelaide, and the board's co-operation was asked foT in endeavouring to put an end to such a "" disgracef u l practice."" To be informed that the board had for some )'ears been cognizant of the practice of selling colonial spirit as imported, but on account of the importation of bulk spirit, capsules, corks, and labels, by some importers, and the legal difficulties that had arisen in connection with prosecutions by this board, under present legislation, the board felt unable to take any useful action in the matter. I referred to this matter here about three years ago, suggesting that the Minister should, under section 51 of the Customs Act, prohibit the importation of capsules and labels. It was objected that if their importation was prohibited, they would be made and printed here; but I pointed out that if that were made an offence, the fear of detection would act - as a deterrent, and suggested that it might be made compulsory to bottle imported spirit in bond. If that were done, it would prevent good spirit from being blended with cheap spirit, which a lesser duty had been paid. I could not, however, persuade the Governlicensing ment to do anything in the matter, and, therefore, bring it under the attention the Minister once more. Again and in the South Australian Courts have cases been brought for the sale of proof; but it has been held that once spirit has passed through the Customs, the ComParliament monwealth Government cannot interfere with its sale. The question has been raised before the Full Court of South Australia, whose judgment is given in the following report:In the Full Court judgment was delivered Mr Justice Gordon and Mr Justice Homburg in Robinson versus Hall, which was a special case reserved by the Police Court of Adelaide with respect to the sale of liquors under a certain degree of proof strength The results of the judgments suggest that the law is in satisfactory state, from the public point of view. There are at present two statutes existence which deal with the question of the sale of liquor under proof. Both judges held that the State law could not be enforced cause the only person who could lay informapoison. tions under it was the State Collector of toms, whose office had been abolished by the establishment of the Commonwealth. tice Homburg, however, went further than this, and gave expression to the startling decision in legislating with regard to the sale of spirits within the State, the Commonwealth had exceeded its powers under the Constitution, and therefore that part of the Commonwealth Act which dealt with this matter is invalid. effect of the decision of the Full Court is the State law cannot be enforced, and that the Commonwealth law dealing with this matter invalid. In these circumstances, it appears there are no provisions of any Distillation Act Mr Hutchison. which govern and regulate the strength at which spirits are to be sold to the public in South Australia.",42
310,Mr KENNEDY,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"There must be a defect in the South Australian law, because in this State such cases are dealt with under the Victorian law.",43
311,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I take it that the Victorian Judges,.wouId be in accord with the South Australian Full Court.",43
312,Mr KENNEDY,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,But the prosecutions are not proceeded with under a Commonwealth Act.,43
313,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"In the report from which I have quoted it is stated that the Commonwealth Parliament has exceeded its constitutional powers, and its legislation, therefore, is invalid, while it is also held that the State law cannot be enforced.",43
314,Sir JOHN QUICK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That appears to be because there is no officer to prosecute, a on difficulty which could be got over.",43
315,Mr KENNEDY,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Unde r the Victorian law an inspector prosecutes, and it is not unusual for fines to be recovered of for the sale of spirit more-than a certain again number of degrees under proof.",43

317,Mr KENNEDY,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Commonwealth cannot deal with this matter.,43
318,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It seems to me that if we have power to prohibit the sale of methylated spirit in the ""manner provided for in clause 15, we have power to make laws relating to the importation and subby sequent adulteration of bulk spirit.",43
319,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I do not think so.,43
320,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"In many Cases, there is no control once spirit has passed through the Customs House.

321,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Lang) [7.38] - In my that opinion the clause should be amended. It provides that any person selling, or having in his possession, illicit methylated spirit or any article of food or drink, or any scent, The essence, tincture, or medicine containing that methylated spirit shall be liable to a fine is of jQioo. It seems to me that this prothat vision, if not' amended, might operate harshly and unjustly. A young lady who buys or is given a bottle of scent cannot reasonably be expected to know what tains. But, if it contained methylated spirit, she would be liable,, under clause, to a penalty of £ 1 0 0 . I suggest the insertion of the word ""knowingly "" the first line of the clause, so that it shall read "" a person shall not knowingly sell or have in his possession.""",43
322,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That amendment shall may open a very wide door.

The young lady to whom the scent was prestandards sented would be similarly liable.",44

This Bill contains provisions not that have nothing to do with the collection of duties, and the same remark applies to the Distillation Act. In one case, in South Australia, our power to prescribe certain that were not required for the collection of duties was questioned. I do think that that point was absolutely decided, Because another question was raised. The information had to be laid the State Collector of Customs under State Act, and the question was whethe State Act had not been abrogated by the Commonwealth Distillation Act. It was decided that there was no Collector of Customs appointed by the State, inasmuch as the State Collector had been superI argued on, a previous occasion that our was ultra vires, in so far as it exceeded our power to prescribe standards be required to enable us to protect the revenue. I think that the Attorney-General, as a private member, then took a similar view. The difficultv could best be overby the States stepping in and passing an Act under which information could be laid by someone else, or by the Commonwealth laying an information under some Commonwealth Act. I think that our legislation is ultra vires to the extent I have indicated, and no doubt the question will be raised at the very first opportunity.",44

A similar condition existed in Tasmania, but in the return before me no particulars are supplied with respect to the position in Western Australia. I wish to emphasize the fact that this Bill does not provide for compulsory voting, and that the exercise of the contingent vote will be purely optional. If the Government consider that the contingent vote would lead to majority rule, surely they should have proposed that it should be compulsory. The weak spot in this Bill is that, if it were passed, a well-organized force, such as the Labour Party, would advise its supporters not to exercise their right to cast a contingent vote.",46

I can well understand any far-seeing man asserting that, if this work is to be properly carried out, we must have majority representation. The Right Honourable Richard Seddon was always an advocate of compulsory voting, and I believe that it was on his initiative that the New Zealand Legislature passed a law under which the names of electors who fail to record their votes at an election are struck off the roll. Their failure to exercise their right is construed as showing that they are either dead or have left the district. Their names are struck off the rolls unless the returning officer is presented with a medical' certificate showing that they were unable to vote.  immediately afterwards restored to the rolls.",47
355,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Neithe r the police nor any other officials take steps to immediately place them on the rolls, unless they make personal application. The citizens themselves must take action. I have often thought that if , instead of requiring the police to prepare voters' lists, we made it compulsory for the electors to register their names within a certain period, we should secure more complete rolls, and avoid much expenditure. The - honourable member for Yarra may shake his head, but I feel con- ; fident that that system would prove most effective.",48
356,Mr TUDOR,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"When it prevailed in Victoria the number of males on the rolls was 33 per cent, below the present number.",48
357,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Were the electors required to register?,48
358,Mr TUDOR,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Thei r names were transferred from the ratepayers' roll to the general roll.,48
359,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If the electors knew that they would be subject to certain penalties for neglect of their right as citizens to vote, they would be careful to register their names, and the country would be saved great expense. At the same time, I feel confident that the polling at a general election would be much heavier than it is. I know that ideal representation is secured by the proportional system.",48
360,Mr GROOM,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"In the passage the honourable member quoted, did not Bright condemn proportional representation?",48
361,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Wheneve r I refer to proportional representation the Minister mentions the names of Clark, Droop, or Gregory. He forgets to tell the House that the schemes of those men w ere all T based on the contingent voting system, and that it was said that contingent voting would lead to great difficulty and confusion. I am not here to demonstrate a problem in higher mathematics- I am not here to explain either the Hare-Spence, Gregory, or Nanson system. If I were I should require a blackboard and a piece of chalk. It would be easier for me to present the Treasurer with a treatise on the differential calculus than it would be for me to give him a clear exposition of these several schemes. We cannot deal with electors as we can with a formula in mathematics. Every candidate has a personal as well as a political influence. My first reason for moving this amendment is that a general election is imminent, and that there is consequently not sufficient time for the consideration of the measure, or to make the necessary electoral arrangements if it becomes law. I do not say that the people would be unable to understand this system if it were used at the next general election. I should not cast such a reflection on electors who went to the poll. If I did I could not hold that the electors were competent to deal with the many complex problems of legislation. I do say. however, that since they have been accustomed in most of the States for years to cast only a primary vote, the system proposed under this Bill would be somewhat novel to them. The electors are to be presented with two different ballot-papers, one for the election of senators, framed according to a system which they understand, and the other for the election of members of the House of Representatives, which must be marked with the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on according to the order of preference. This will create confusion, and, moreover, will give an advantage to organized voters. In Queensland, we are told, the preferential system is rarely used, even the Minister of Home Affairs having admitted that it has affected only five elections in fourteen years. The Labour members who represent that State say that the people do not use the preferential system, and Senator Dawson has spoken of it as confusing. In Tasmania, a more definite system of proportional voting, embodying 'the contingent principle, and making it compulsory, was tried, but, after a trial extending over two State elections and one Federal election, they went hack to a simpler arrangement.",48
362,Mr STORRER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"They gave up a good system. "" Mr Wilks - The Tasmanian public did not protest against its abolition.",49
363,Mr STORRER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes , it did.",49
364,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"We have heard no protest against the action of this Parliament in abolishing the system in connection with Commonwealth elections. I should not have so much objection to the preferential system if it were made compulsory. The Minister, however, has admitted that there is not sufficient time this session for the proper consideration of the measure.",49
365,Mr GROOM,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,No .,49
366,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"When the honourable gentleman was moving the second reading, the honourable member for North Sydney asked him why he did not propose to apply the principle to the election of senators, and his reply was that he would be glad to do so if the Senate could find time to consider and agree to such an arrangement. But surely the concurrence of the S'enate will be asked in reference to the proposal now before us, and that will take time. I read the Minister's speech very closely, and it seemed to me that it contained the tacit admission that we have not time to deal properly with the measure this session. Another reason why we should not pass the second reading is that there is not sufficient time within which' to make the arrangements necessary to bring its provisions into operation. Some honourable members are feigning a burning desire to go before their constituents, and are asking every day when is the election to be. I have been in Parliament for many years, but I have never known honourable members to be really desirous of going before their constituents. It seems to me that those who had the narrowest majorities at the last election are apparently the most eager to submit themselves for re-election. ",49
367,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is exactly how I feel. In reply to these inquiries, the Minister of Home Affairs has said that the elections cannot take place before the 21st November, because his officers cannot have everything in readiness at an ealrlier The returning officers are amateurs, who are most anxious not to violate our complicated electoral law by any oversight or any misunderstanding of its provisions, and if they aire asked to make themselves acquainted with an entirely new system, and to carry out the preparations and to give the instructions necessary for bringing it into operation, the elections will have to be put off until a later time. My next objection to the Bill is that its provisions are crude and incomplete.' They must be incomplete so long as they remain optional. If contingent voting would prevent minority rule, and bring about majority rule, it must be made compulsory. Is this measure to be dealt with by the Government as they have dealt with all their other measures? They have not yet submitted a Bill which they have not had to seriously amend; in many cases to such an extent as to entirely alter its complexion. After the members of the Opposition have pointed out blemishes in and objections to a measure, we have had the Attorney-General or some other Minister, as in the case of the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, bringing down sheaves of amendments, completely altering its structure. Is that course to be taken in regard to this Bill? Although the Government appear now to be so much in favour] of majority rule, and assert that their proposals are made in order to secure it, they brought forward no measure of this kind in 1902, when they were in power. Doles the Minister intend now to make the contingent system compulsory? If he does not, leaving it optional, the measure will be incomplete, while, if he does, the Opposition will have the right to any credit that may exist in connection with it, although its provisions will still be as crude as any which could well be presented to a legislative body. A ll the able political thinkers who have dealt with this subject favour the compulsory and not the optional adoption of the system. Another objection I have to the Bill is, that it makes no provision for increasing the number of votes polled, or for securing effective voting. Any Government honestly wishing to secure majority rule should make provision for increasing the total number of votes polled.",49

369,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am glad to hear it.  date. amendments are too drastic.,49
370,Mr GROOM,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,He should reserve them until the Committee stage is reached.,49
371,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"This young member of the Ministry which claims to long for responsible 'government, is unwilling to take responsibility for the principles of the Bill , and to fight for them on the motion for the second reading, although all constitutional authorities say that the principles of a measure should be stood by at this stage. The real desire of the Ministry is to secure an advantage for their party in connection with the Victorian elections. They ask us not to strike a hard blow at this stage; but are they really studying the interests of the electors'? I should be willing to assist in bringing about the pollingof a larger number of votes, and in securing effective voting, because it is the duty of every public man to do so, but the Government are taking no steps in that direction. Their proposals will not get rid of minority representation, because organizations will direct their members not to use the contingent vote. That will at once provide for plumping, a system which was deliberately rejected when the electoral laws were under consideration before. I cannot believe that even those who have fathered this measure desire that it shall remain in force after the next general election. It is intended to be used upon that occasion alone. It is all very well Minister of Home Affairs to tell me that I am suspicious, but, under the circumstances, I cannot be otherwise. years ago the Age expressed itself very strongly against the adoption of a much superior system of voting, and now they are enlisting the assistance of Professor Nanson in advocating the present faulty scheme. The scheme submitted to us is an abortio,n. I am sure that the Labour Partv do not want to introduce compulsory voting. They would not adopt any system which would compel the Deakinites or the Reidites to go to the poll and bring about their discomfiture, whilst I could not support an optional system of preferential voting which would place undue power in the hands of the organized forces of labour. I feel perfectly sure that the measure is not expected to operate dn New .South Wales, but that the Ministry have their eyes upon nine seats in Victoria, two in Tasmania, and two in Queensland, which will be affected by the adoption of the preferential voting system. This cannot be called a Commonwealth measure, because it would be only partial in its operation. On a former occasion the Minister of Trade and Customs advised the House to throw out a similar proposal, because he could not understand it . The Argus, which, like all the other principal papers of AusBallot Bill. 347 3 tralia, is very. creditably conducted- I do not speak of it from a party point of view, but as a literary production-recentl y took the trouble to give illustrations of the manner in which the proposed new system would work out. It published several sets of figures, which, in the main, were correct ; but in the second or third illustration a mistake of 100 votes was made. When the system is so complex that the Argus becomes fogged, how can we expect the average returning officer or deputy returning officer to understand it? It would not be fair to call upon our electoral officers to introduce a new system of voting upon such very short notice. If they were called upon to undertake such an unreasonably heavv task, grievous, blunders would be inevitable, and the public would be bewildered. At the first Federal election the electors were invited to vote by striking out the names of the candidates for whom they did not desire to vote. At the next, election they were told that they must put a cross against the name of the candidate they preferred, and now they are told for the that they are to put a figure against the name of each candidate to indicate the order of their .preference. There are Three thousands of persons who, with a view to protect their own privileges, and with other objects in view, will fail to indicate the order of their preference, and the conditions under which the polling is carried on will be rendered more irritating than ever. The more trouble that is involved so far as the electors are concerned, the smaller our polls will become, whereas it should be our endeavour to make our arrangements for recording votes as simple as possible. We should also aim at announcing the results of the elections without undue delay. I do not, therefore, believe in the adoption of complicated systems of voting. The Ministerof Home Affairs tells us that the proposed new system cannot be applied to the Senate, but I contend that there is more) reason why it should be applied to the Senate elections than to those for the return of members to this House. In New South Wales, there will be at least fifteen candidates for three vacancies in the Senate, and electors should, in that case, if in any, have an opportunity to exprelss their preference. Under the present system, they have either to cast a block vote for those who are nominated by the party to which they belong, or have to select one or two men whom they like, and others whom they do not like.  upon to vote for men whom they do not like.",49

374,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"A man should vote for principles and not upon personal grounds. The honourable member for Maranoa is not known all over Queensland. People know his name, however, and they vote for him as a representative of the party to which he belongs. It is the same in New South Wales. I do not pretend that Senator Neild, who had 189,000 votes recorded in his favour, at the last Federal election, obtained that very large record on the strength of his own personality and his own merits. Hewas on the party ticket, and it was the power of the party that secured him such large support, i have no doubt that similar results will be brought about in Victoria if the newspapers arrange to support any particular group of candidates, or the Protectionist Association take a similar step. There is much more reason why we should adopt the preferential voting system in connection with the Senate elections, because in that case it would have a distinct tendency towards the destruction of minority rule. If the electors are to express their preference, it should be made compulsory for them to do so. I believe that the Government have introduced this measure for the protection of their own political lives, and I blame them for thinking that we are such fools as not to see through their manoeuvre. They are struggling for their political existence.",51

379,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"As I have said, the eyes of the Government are attracted to the nine seats in Victoria which would be affected by the adoption of the proposed new system.",51

381,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have shown that none the seats in that State would be affected, but that the measure would be effective mlainly in Victoria. If the Government would only admit that their object was as I have indicated, we 'could more, readily understand the change of front on the part of their principal press supporter, which, upon a former occasion, whipped with scorpions a much better proposal. I have endeavoured to show that the new system would play into the hands of well organised political bodies, and although I hope to see the day when the polls at election time will be larger than at present, and when majority rule will obtain, I cannot support the measure now before us. I have no desire, as has been suggested, to sand-bag the Bill , but I have given unreasons, which, I think, are sufficientlv cogent, for desiring that it should be set aside, and that a thoroughly scientific and up-to-date proposal should be submitted next session.",51
382,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Angas) [9.0] - The chief force of the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Dalley appears to lie in paragraph 1 of his proposal. Personally, I am never much impressed by a series of amendments upon the motion for the second reading of a Bill , because they introduce so many matters which may lead to discussion, and thus induce honourable members to be led away from the consideration of the main question. There is, however, some force in paragraph 1 of the amendment, because it is an extraordinary circumstance that, although we passed an Electoral Act in 1905, when the question of the amendment of our electoral law was raised on a somewhat elaborate scale, not a word was then said regarding the imperfect working of the present system. That was less than a year ago. At that time, we passed a fairly comprehensive Electoral Act, the scope of which was almost as great as the principal Act itself, but not a single word was uttered concerning the necessity for an amendment of the law in the direction which is now indicated, and no hint was given that the single electorate system was working so badly that it was deemed necessary to apply a corrective to its acknowledged evils. So fair as one can say so without a breach of the respect due to our statutory laws, I certainly think that that system is unsideration. satisfactory. Under our Constitution, we are required to undertake a periodical re-arrangement of our electoral districts - To provide for .the shifting of population, we are required to have a shuffling of the constituencies, which, according to one of the reports presented to the United States S'enate, "" reduces electorates to a mere fortuitous concourse of atoms."" We cannot overcome that difficulty, because it is one of the results of that section of our Constitution which provides for a periodic re-apportionment of political representation as population .changes. But the other evil, that attaching to the single electorate members, can be overcome. It is as 01 corrective of that evil that this Bill has been introduced. That it would work all right, I have no doubt whatever. In Germany, and also in Sweden, the same system was introduced, and, notwithstanding the vaticinations that it would break down, it has worked excellently. It has also been tried in Tasmania, where, so far as my reading goes, it was very popular. Why it has not been continued I cannot explain; only recently I have heard representatives of Tasmania speak well of it. I read the results of two elections which were held in that State under the contingent-voting system, and I know that they were favourable to it . There were very few informal votes cast-in fact, I do rot think that the percentage of such votes was greater than that cast under our existing system.",51
383,Mr STORRER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It was less.,52
384,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I think that ih? honourable member is correct. Moreover, the result of the elections was quickly known. In Belgium the elector is allowed to make use of a pre-arranged system of preference; the system works excellently there, and it has produced a fair approximation to a proper proportion between the number of representatives returned to Parliament and the state of parties in the country- a far greater approximation to that ideal than had ever been obtained in Belgium, and which we all desire to achieve. Though the scrutiny of the votes runs into tremendous numbers, the work has been done expeditiously. In France, the Chamber of Deputies has asked that the system of proportional representation which was in vogue in Belgium shall be adopted.",52
385,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is not the system which is contained in the Bill under con,52
386,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I understand that. If the 'honourable member will be patient, I shall have a few words to say against the Bill presently. The theory that the system of preferential voting would break down in practice has not been supported by experience. What the Government propose is merely a corrective to the acknowledged evils of the single member system. The true cure, however, is to be found in the abolition of that system, and the adoption of a system of proportional representation. My objection to this Bill is that at the end of the session, and when we are within two months of a general election, we ought not to introduce a new method of voting without even proceeding upon radical lines ---withou t doing more than patching up a bad system. Undoubtedly the adoption of the system outlined in this Bill would lead to confusion in the Electoral Department. It would also to some extent confuse the electors, who are no more the embodiment of human wisdom than are members of Parliament. The single member system is a bad one, because to a large extent the result of an election is left to chance, inasmuch as it is dependent upon the apportionment of parties throughout the electoral districts, and upon the cohesion of parties within those districts. It is possible for parties to be so distributed throughout the Sfate that there may be a very small majority of a particular party in a majority or all of the districts. We mav thus achieve one of the most vicious endsat whichi we could aim, namely, pure majoritv representation. So far as honourable members aim at that result, they are aiming at the very opposite of a democracy. Democratic government does not consist in the representation only of a majority, but in the representation of parties in accordance with their strength. It does seek, however, to give effect to majority rule after the voice of all fairly large parties has been heard. It is a prostitution of the ideal of democratic government to say that it must secure absolute majoritv rule in everv constituency throughout the Commonwealth. In order to get rid of the possibility of minority rule, outside bodies - and I am not speaking of one political partu only-ar e obliged to select candidates to represent them. What is the result ? Undoubtedly the effect is to narrow political life, and to bring the expression of political opinion from the glare of publicity, where men are checked by opinions not altogether assumed for party purposes, to small committees or parties, these committees to a certain extent being worked, perhaps, by still smaller committees. The biggest electorates in America are ruled by small committees, which select the candidates to be nominated. In many cases the final nomination depends upon the ""boss"" of these committees. The result is a parody of representative government.",52
387,Mr RONALD,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Governmen t by committee.,53
388,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Exactly . That is what we are coming to under the caucus system; and I am not using that term in the restrictive sense in whch it is usually applied to the Labour Party. Under it men are compelled to degrade their moral fibre, and to kow-tow to small committees, in order to secure the privilege of appearing upon the hustings with some prospect of success. That is one of the acknowledged evils of the single member system. The indirect result is to compel' men to do that class of political touting which, even in the case of Ministries, is too often successful, in order to obtain permission to state their honest convictions upon the public platforms of the country. That is the position which obtains in America. In a report which was presented to the American Senate upon the working of the single member system, it is declared that men who were not willing to sacrifice their own judgment and conscience to the behest of partu, and to become the servile echo of those who are their inferiors in knowledge, do not allow their names to be submitted as candidates for Congress or the Legislature, as it is certain that they would be defeated. John Stuart Mill puts the true ideal thusIn a really equal democrary every and section would be represented ally, but proportionally. That result is to be secured, not iby a Bill of this character",53
389,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Joh n Stuart Mill wished to change the whole character of Parliament.,53
390,Mr GLYNN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"He desired to introduce the system of proportional representation as it was advocated by Leonard Courtney and by varions parties in Australia, and which was so clearly expounded by a woman of very great brains and patriotism in South Australia- I refer to Miss Spence. When we find men like Mr Henry Fawcett strongly advocating it, and talking of the fetish of majority rule as being diametrically opposed to the first principle of democracy, which is representation in .proportion to numbers, we ought to feel called upon to fairly examine the merits of that system. I may add that in America there was one man who attempted to break down this caucus system- a man for whose memory we should entertain the greatest respect, because he was an individual of great ability and splendid patriotic instinct- I refer to the late Henry George. He stood for the Presidency of the United States as an independent candidate, who did not seek the support of any political party or caucus, and he polled a very large number of votes. A man of his popularity and great intellectual fibre, notwithstanding the splendid loyaltv of his following, was unable to obtain the support of more than a fairly large minority of the electors. This shows how hopeless is the task of a man of independence who endeavours to break down the effect of the one-member system, and that of the caucus. The last election in Great Britain afforded conclusive evidence of the fact that the one-member system works badly. I remember reading two articles in the Times-on e of which I noted, and which I have looked up this afternoon - o n the question of electoral methods. In one of these articles the Times reviewed the morality of the system of canvassing, and 7 dealt with the necessity of placing a check on the evils arising from the working of the one-member system. It also dealt with the question of the second ballot and transfer vote, proposals for which are now embodied in this Bill. The point I wish to make is that the solution of the difficulty lies not in either of these systems, but in the introduction of a system of proportional repreany sentation. On the 27th of January last not disproportion, the Times wroteThe difficulty might, however, apparently be overcome by what is known as "" the transferable "" vote Probably if either were presented to Parliament it would be confronted by a formidable rival in the system of proportional representation which was advocated by John Stuart M ill , and, in a revised and simplified form, has long had a sturdy champion in Mr Leonard Courtney. If I remember rightly, Mr Leonard Courtney, in 1884 or 1885, when the Gladstone Electoral Representation Bill and the Redistribution B i ll were under discussion, gave a very fine exposition of the principle of this system. Gladstone then threw cold water on it, but his objection was levelled at the fact that it was an invasion of a long standing, system which had, in effect, grown round the hearts and prejudices of the people of England. The Times points out that at the last election, under the onemember system, there were 529 contests in counties and boroughs, and that the.Ministerialists polled 2,818,878 votes, and secured the return of 396 members. Unionists, on the other hand, polled 2 > 3 3 J 6 8 S , and secured a representation 2 only 129 members. In other words, the of the Bill itself. Liberals represent an average of 7,118 is electors per member, whereas the Opposiwould tion represent an average of 17,315 member. In Wales the Opposition, polled four-ninthr of the electors. They secured a total of 52,637 votes, but! did not get seat; whereas 90,000 Ministerialists won thirty seats. In Manchester ten Ministeity representation shall prevail. rialists were returned by 51,000 votes, as against 34,000 polled in opposition to them, whilst in Birmingham only eight Opposishall tionists were returned by 51,000 votes to 23,000 votes. This shows that, under the moving am amendment. one-member system, we do not obtain ideal results. It is said by some that the irresentative gularities in one district will counterbalance those of another; but that is not a proper system. Under it , large minorities silenced in the, one district, and their consolation is that in another district a minority, holding the same views as they do, have secured representation. That not such a result as justifies the continuinsertion, ance of the one-member system. My obany jections to this Bill are that it has been introduced when the general election is very 5s. near; that it is simply a proposal to patch up a bad system; that it evades a question which ought to be thoroughlv threshed out in this House; and that we should have an amendment of the electoral law lives. in a different direction. We should have an amendment providing for a election. system of proportional representation on the lines-subject , of course, to some changes to make it applicable to ditions-that have been adopted in Belgium, the Swiss cantons, and also in Tashonorable mania, where it seems to have been successto consider its effect. ful. For these reasons, if a division taken, I shall vote against the second ing of the Bill , although I cannot allege one of the grounds of my opposition that I think that the proposed machinery would not work effectually. I do not think that the actual calculations would not be properly made by the returning officers, or that there is a possibility of a great number of informal votes being cast. The experience of Tasmania shows that the number of informal votes would not be likely to be large, and we have no reason to assume that the temoining electors of the Commonwealth would displav less intelligence.",53

The Age stated that there would be a possibility of a tie in some cases, and that the candidates in that event would draw lots; but I notice that, even in such circumstances, the labour candidates, in the illustration, lost. To my mind, this shows precisely how the system would work. What would be the result of an election in which we had a labour candidate, a liberal-protectionist candidate, and a free-trade candidate? Under the contingent voting system, the supporters of the protectionist candidate would vote anti-Socialism, and would exercise their second choice in favour of the freeincomplete. trade candidate. Although the labour candidate might be leading on the first count, and his supporters might have exercised their contingent vote, the supporters of the other two would not give a contingent vote for him, so that, if he failed to secure an absolute majority on the first count, he would necessarily be superseded by one of the other candidates. Is it reasonable to assume that if the system were optional I should cast my second vote for one of the other candidates in the circumstances to which I have referred? I do not wish to record a vote for any one with whose views I am not in sympathy. If the system is to be adopted, it certainly must be compulsorv in order to be effective. In Queensland it has not been compulsory. The Minister said that in only five cases during the last fourteen years had it affected any election. I wish that the honourable and learned gentleman had mentioned them specifically, for I was under the impression that it had affected only two electorates.",55
398,Mr GROOM,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I have the official statement that it has affected five.,55
399,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It would be most interesting to look up the cases in question, and to ascertain the effect of the votThe illustration which the Minister drew from the Queensland system was not a ha.ppy one. There is another point worthy of consideration. Under the. Bill contingent voting is not to be compulsory, and I should like to know what will be the position if in any electorate very few contingent votes are polled, and no candidate secures an absolute majority?",55
400,Mr GROOM,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Even then the relative majority in the end will count.,55
401,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"We are approaching this proposed vital change in our electoral system far too hurriedly. It is, moreover, in my opinion, a mistake to make it partial by applying it to the elections for one House only. We should, above all things, try to secure uniformity in our electoral methods, and apply the same system to the election of the two Houses. The statements which have been made as to what would happen if the provisions of the Bill were in force are very misleading. In today's Age an attempt is made to show that a Labour representative would have been elected for Corangamite had the proposed system been in force at the time of the last election. But its illustration is, however, There were four candidates for Corangamite. The successful candidate, who now represents the electorate here, was returned because of the support of 4,600 votes. The next candidate, Dunne, who, the Age says, was a Labour candidate",55
402,Mr HUME COOK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,He was not.,55
403,Mr HUTCHISON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I will assume, for the purposes of my argument, that the Age is right for once. Dunne polled 4,036 votes, Woods, the third candidate, who was said to be running on practically the same ticket as Dunne, 1,484 votes; and Wynne, the fourth candidate, 2,968 votes. The Age comes to the conclusion that Dunne would have been returned under the preferential system, because Woods' votes would have been added to his. Nothing, however, is said of Wynne's votes, which would probably have gone to the candidate at the head of the poll, giving him a large majority-over the combined second and third votes. In my opinion, the measure does not provide for majority representation, though - it is possible to secure it, or something nearly approaching it, by the adoption of my amendment, if the Ministry are in earnest in regard to this matter, and will apply the same system to the elections for both; the Senate and the House of Representatives. I cannot support the amendment of the honourable member for Dalley, because it affirms that it is not expedient proceed further with the Bill during the present session, while, in my opinion, it is not expedient to proceed with it at all. I wish, to see a straight-out vote taken on the proposal of the Government. If I were a Ministerialist I should support the Bill, cause that party has everything to gain from it, while the Labour Party has everything to lose where a Government and a Labour candidate are running for the same constituency. But, while I do not blame the Ministry for doing what they can in the interests of their, party, I should blame the Labour Party if they did not do all they could in their own interests. Before makin up my mind definitely as to my action regarding the second and third reading, I shall listen further to the discussion which may be expected to take place on the motion. , .",55
404,Mr LONSDALE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"New England) [9.36]. I am opposed to the Bill. I cannot conceive why, if Ministers think that its provisions should be embodied in our electoral law, they did not make an attempt to embody them - when an amending Bill was before us last session. Whatever the motive, it seems to me that the measure has been introduced as an afterthought. The Prime Minister, the other day, said, very unfairly, that the leader of the Opposition, now that he has been given an opportunity to provide for majority rule, runs away from it. That statement was not correct, to say the least of it. The right honourable gentleman has been travelling all over Australia, not to advocate the preferential tem of voting now proposed, but to urge the electors to go to the polls of their own free will, and vote for the candidates whom they think will best represent them. Moreover, the Bill will not do what it professes to do. It by no means insures majority voting, and, if passed as it stands, most of the voting will be similar to that) which takes place now. If the measure becomes law as it stands, I shall ask those who will vote for me to place the figure, 1 against my name, and not to use their remaining preferential votes, and no doubt other candidates will give the same instruction. Therefore, the Prime Minister was altogether unfair in the reference which he made to the attitude of the leader of< the Opposition. Even if the exercise of the preferential vote were made compulsory, the Bill would not insure majority representation. What would take place would be that to the preferential votes would be cast, not in the real order of preference, but for the men whom the electors thought had the least chance of success, and we should not encourage that kind of voting. Under the compulsory contingent voting system, the be- friends of candidates .will try to get the electors to place the number 1 opposite the name of the man whom they support, and to allot their remaining preference to the weakest men, and the result may be, in some cases, the return, not of the maiii whom the majority think best fitted to represent them, but of the weakest man, whom probably a majority of the electors would not like to see elected. That sort of thing has occurred already. When voters are not allowed to plump, they sometimes vote first for the candidate whom they particularly wish to elect, and give their other votes to candidates whom they think have the least chance of success. While the Prime Minister, when speaking at Maryborough, denounced the Opposition for having wasted time, the cliarge is one which might justly be brought against the Government. I was willing to destroy the Bounties Bill because I do not believe in the bounty system, and therefore cannot rightly be accused of wasting time in the action which I took to secure my object; but the Government are deliberately wasting time in introducing a Bill which cannot effect its avowed purpose. Of course, the Government may try to get the Opposition to amend the measure so as to make it serviceable. The honourable member for Dalley says that he will vote for the presys- ferential system if it is made compulsory. I , however, am opposed to the Bill, lock, stock, and barrel. There is a good deal to be said for proportionate voting, but it is useless to think of radically altering our electoral system at this stage in the life of the Parliament. Proportionate voting is, in my opinion, theoretically sound. I do not know why the Tasmanian system failed; but if the proportionate system can be carried into effect, it should have our support, as being likely to give every elector his proper share in determining the legislation of the country. The Minister of Home Affairs must know that the Bill will not achieve the object which he professes to have in view, namely, majority rule. It will be an absolute failure. We have heard some reference made to the fact that in Victoria the fewest number of voters returned the largest number of candidates to the Senate at the last election. If that be so, the evil which it is sought to cure exists in a still greater degree in connection with the Senate elections than with those of the House of Representatives. If preferential voting is to be mitted in connection with the election of members to this Chamber, the same system should be followed in connection with the Senate elections. If it is right in one case, it is right in the other. Ministers say that they wish to bring about majority rule, but they do not propose to apply to both Houses the system of voting which is expected to achieve that end. I realise that it would be difficult to educate the electors to the point of enabling them to understand the preferential voting system by the time that the general elections come on. If preferential voting were made compulsory, a large number of informal votes would be recorded. If it is not intended to make it compulsory for the electors to express their preference, the present system should not be interfered with. I shall vote for the amendment, and, if that is defeated. I shall oppose the second reading of the Bill.  to vote against the amendment, because it is intended to kill the Bill. At the same time, I am absolutely opposed to the contingent voting system. Some fourteen or fifteen years ago that system was introduced into Queensland by the Honourable A. H . Barlow, the present Minister of Education in that State. The object was to "" d is h "" the Labour Party; but the Act failed to achieve its purpose. Labour Party in Queensland urged the voters not to have anything to do with the system, and that advice has been religiously followed. I see no reason why the ballot should be complicated in the manner proposed. It seems to me that the Bill is intended to add to the bewilderment of the electors. The contingent voting system was used in Queensland for the first time in 1893. The Honourable A. H . Barlow, who was then a member of the Mcllwraith Ministry, urged his supporters to avail themselves of the preferential vote, but they did not do so. In one or two instances the new system operated to bring about the defeat of the Government candidate. The honourable member for Oxley, who for the first time submitted himself for election in South Brisbane, was, through the operation of the contingent voting system, defeated by a labour candidate. Therefore, instead of operating to the disadvantage of die Labour Party, as it was intended to do, the system, in that particular case, conferred an advantage upon them. I believe in majority per- rule in connection with this Parliament and everywhere else. I see no reason why we should not follow the example of France, and have a second ballot. The system adopted in that country appears to me to be the simplest in the world.",56
405,Mr LIDDELL,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The proportion of votes recorded at the second ballot is generallyvery small.,57
406,Mr GROOM,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"All the candidates submit themselves at the second ballot.  in that to object to. Under the contingent voting system, it would be possible for one man who registered 500 votes out of 1,000 to be defeated upon the second or third count by one of three other candidates who had polled only 500 first votes between them. Therefore, the will of the majority would not be asserted. The man who polled 500 primary votes might, upon the third or fourth count, be rejected because no contingent votes were recorded in his favour. That has happened in some cases.",57
407,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That would practically establish minority rule.  member for Hindmarsh put the matter very clearly. The Age worked the whole thing out very nicely, but their calculations reminded me of the Irishman who insisted The that he was still 5s. short in his wages, although he was assured that he had received a rise in his salary. I notice that, according to the Age calculations, the Labour Party are defeated every time. That, in itself, would have been sufficient to show me that the whole scheme was .wrong. I will put another case. Suppose that in my electorate there were three candidates - myself , a free-trader, and a protectionist. I should certainly poll every labour vote, but I should not receive the support of any boodler or squatter in the electorate.",57

The honourable members for Macquarie, Parramatta, Lang, and Hunter, when they attend tea-and-bun fights, and address women electors, urge them that, whatever they do, whether they are free-traders protectionists, to vote against the Labour Party. They tell them that it is the Labour Partv of whom they have to be afraid. I do not blame them for that, because I tell the electors to do their best to down the George Reid faction and the Deakin faction, and to vote for the labour man every time.",58

No mention was made of it in the Governor General's speech at the opening of Parliament, but with the general election close at hand, it has .been suddenly launched upon the House. In this measure, I recognise the malign influence of the press. With the advent of Federation, it was hoped that the power of the press would to a certain extent be curtailed. It has been curtailed, but there is still strong evidence that this Parliament is dominated to a large extent by the Melbourne press. I firmlv believe that the measure under consideration has been brought forward as the result of the influence exercised by the Age - newspaper. I am also of opinion that the average elector will experience some difficulty in comprehending the contingent-voting system which is proposed by the Government. I confess that I had great difficulty in f o l lowing the explanation of that system, which has been given by the Minister. I further maintain that it would be almost impossible for the electoral officers to give effect to the provisions of the Bill on such extremely short notice. At the last general election, I polled 6,300 votes, my protectionist opponent, 6,100 votes; and the labour candidate, 900 votes. There were also 113 informal votes registered. Consequently, I was not returned by a majority of the electors, but yet I flatter myself that I represent the opinions of the people throughout that electorate.",59

For many years I have been in favour of the preferential system of voting, or of the Hare system, which was formerly in operation in Tasmania. The Government are evidently gaining wisdom by experience, and they have introduced this measure to insure that honourable members shall represent a majority of the electors who choose to exercise the franchise.",59
421,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the Bill provide for the same system of voting as that which operated in Tasmania?,59
422,Mr STORRER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Not exactly; but it gives effect to the same principle. I do not think that the Bill', if passed, would benefit one political party more than it would another, but it would certainly afford the majority of the electors an opportunity to indicate the order of their preference in respect of the various candidates seeking their suffrages.",59
423,Mr THOMAS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the honourable member sav that the same system should apply to elections for the Senate?,59
424,Mr STORRER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do. I certainly think that the representation of Tasmania in the Senate during the first Parliament was the best that it was possible to secure. The first election, it will be remembered, was conducted under the Hare system, and as a result the protectionists secured the rethat turn of their representative, the free traders elected their candidate, the Labour Partv secured the return of one of its members, the commercial community elected another, and those who took a great interest in defence matters were also represented.",59

429,Mr STORRER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No . If the Bill reaches Committee we can make it apply to the elections for the Senate. Personally, I intend to support the measure.",60
430,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Lang) [10.14] - The first thing that strikes me in connection with this Bill is that it bears a remarkable resemblance to other measures which have been introduced by the Government, in that it professes to do something which its provisions are designed to defeat. It is ostensibly brought forward for the purpose of establishing the principle of majority rule. But when we come to examine its provisions we can easily see that it will fail to accomplish that object. The result of passing it will not be to secure majoritv rule, but in certain contingencies to effectivelv insure minority rule. To that extent it is a denial of that broad democratic principle in which so many honourable members believe-the principle of majoritv representation. The honourable member for Maranoa made an assertion which was tantamount to an accusation that the Opposition is opposed to this Bill because it provides for the giving of effect to that principle. In the immediately succeeding sentence he proceeded to show that it does not provide for anything of the kind. ",60
431,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It is said that its object is to accomplish majority representation, but it will have the opposite effect. That must be the view of any one who has analyzed the Bill . It bears on its face evidence of being simply a Victorian measure. As usual with all the Bills introduced by the present Government",60
432,Mr GROOM,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That statement is not correct in regard to this or any measure that the Government have introduced.,60
433,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I repeat that, like all other Bills introduced by the Government, [122]- 2 it is purely a Victorian measure. It is to give Victoria an advantage that will not be enjoyed by the other States.'",60
434,Mr TUDOR,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What ground has the honourable member for such a statement?,60
435,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I do not think that it is a Victorian Bill . The honourable member should say that it is an Age Bill.,60
436,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I was about to say that it is a Victorian Bill , engineered and prompted by the Age. If the Government were really anxious to so amend our electoral laws as to give effect to the democratic principle of majority rule, why did they not indicate in the Governor General's speech their intention to do so? If the omission from that speech of any reference to such an intention was accidental, why did they not avail themselves of the opportunity to bring in these proposals when the amending, Electoral Bill was under consideration? At that time, however, no thing was said by them as to the necessity for altering our voting system in this direction. We have recently seen in the Age articles",60
437,Mr WILKS,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Article s written by Professor Nanson, whose scheme it condemned a few years ago:",60
438,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I believe that the articles to which I refer were prompted, if not written, by Professor Nanson, and that the germ of the present idea is traceable to the Age office. The Age is responsible for much of the mischievous legislation that has been introduced by the Government. It seems to me that it is not the Government which frames the Bills submitted to us, but that, they have their birth in a certain newspaper office in Collins-street. A most enthusiastic effort is invariably made by the Government to give effect to legislation suggested from that quarter. These proposals, instigated from the Age office, and of an intensely mischievous character, are an insult to the House. Few of the measures introduced by the Government are as mild as is the one now before us; but I contend that even this Bill will be mischievous in its effect. As showing that it is merely an Age measure, prompted by the belief that it will give Victoria an advantage which she would not enjoy under the pn> sent system, I would point out that Victoria is at present the great shocking example of minority representation. The returns show that at the last generpl election seventeen seats were uncontested, and that of the remaining fifty-eight constituencies forty-five returned representatives by majority votes. thirteen out of the fifty-eight returned representatives on minority votes. Of these thirteen, nine were in Victoria, two in Queensland, none in New South Wales, two in Tasmania, none in South Australia or Western Australia. It will thus be seen that Victoria embraces the largest number of constituencies that have returned representatives on minority votes. The polling in these constituencies was as follows:VICTORIA. Bendigo ... ... 6,020 ... 8,354 Bourke ... ... 8,657 ... 11,774 Corangamite ... ... 4,600 ... Corio ... ... ... 6,951 ... Flinders ... ... 5,194 ... Grampians ... ... 3,836 ... South Melbourne ... 9,057 ... Wannon ... ... 5,323 ... Wimmera ... ... 3,263 ... QUEENSLAND. Brisbane ... ... 8,019 ... Capricornia ... ... 6,065 --TASMANIA. Denison ... ... 3,661 ... Franklin ... ... 1,986 These figures show that the number of electorates which returned representatives on minority votes form only a small proportion of the whole; the overwhelming majority pf the constituencies returned representatives by majority votes. In these circumstances, the question of urgency has no weight, and may be at once dismissed. We are entitled to inquire what is the reason for the sudden anxiety displayed by the Government to give effect to a principle which was certainly just as urgent six years ago as it is today. This Bill has been brought forward on the eve of a general election, when there is no time to give the constituencies reasonable notice of the contemplated change, and certainly insufficient time to educate the electors as to the operation of the new system. There is no justification for the charge that the Opposition are seeking to prevent the Government from bringing about legislation by majority rule. The Prime Minister and his colleagues know that there is not the slightest foundation for such an accusation. I iio not know that I should be in orderin describing such an attack as a very cowardlv one, but honourable men cerMr Johnson. tainly cannot consider it to be justifiable even from the stand-point of political tacOnly tics. .On referring to the speech recently delivered by the Prime Minister at Maryborough, I find that he is reported to have saidThe leader of the Opposition desires majority rule. That statement is perfectly correct. The leader of the Opposition, in common with every member on this side of the House, certainlv desires majority rule. I do not claim that as a virtue exclusively possessed For For by the Opposition; I am willing to conSuccessful Unsuccessful cede that there are honourable members on Candidate. Candidates. all sides who are as anxious as we are to secure it. The Prime Minister went on to sayFrom Cape York all over Australia that gen8,488 tleman has bewailed the fact that although the 8,332 electors could go to the poll, the man elected 9.130 might not represent the majority of the people. 6,742 He has demanded a scheme that would remedy 0,948 this, and at one time even commended the 6,929 scheme which we submit now. 5,105 I have no recollection of having either read or heard of a statement by the leader of 9,120 the Opposition that he desires such a 6,160 system; I have not read of his making such a statement during his Queensland or any 4,694 other tour'; but I have heard him declare that 3.365 he desires that the people shall record their votes. He has bewailed the fact that there is so much apathy among the public, and has pointed out that those who blame Parliament for its legislation are themselves responsible for the present state of affairs, because they have not taken the trouble to go to the poll to secure the return of candidates representing the views of the majority. He has always eulogised the organization of the Labour Party, so far as it has resulted in having the names of electors placed on the rolls and in bringing the electors to the polls, and he has pointed out to those who complain of such legislation, as is naturally to be expected in the circumstances, that if they did their ditty, and recorded their votes, different results might be looked for. Those are the lines on which the leader of the Opposition has conducted his meetings, and yet the Prime Minister, with a full knowledge of the facts, deliberately conveyed to the public an incorrect idea as to his attitude. I am surprised that the honourable and learned gentleman resorted to .such tactics. To continue the quotationThere is no man who wants to run further and faster from this scheme than the same leader of the Opposition. A characteristic performance, but one which must be driven home to the people of the country. That statement eoes beyond the bounds of decency in political warfare, because it is candidate. an absolute misrepresentation of facts which no one is more fully aware than is candidate, the honourable and learned gentleman. The report continuesWe have put the Opposition to the test the touchstone of a practical offer. pared to say that I would be in favour of makactually opposed to. ing it compulsory for every elector to indicate his preference on the voting paper, and I am prepared to extend the same system to Senate. But, recognising the period of our session, we brought it forward in a more mild form, and leave it to the Senate to come Now, men that talked against minority rule till they should have been a different colour in the face, are opposed to this. why? Because Parliament is near its close. Because there was other business to be Any reason but the real one-that they like minority representation, because they hope they can score more out of it than we can. That shows what you have to expect when you trust other declarations from the same men. The Prime Minister knew that there was justification in fact for such statements, and the Bill is a fraud and a sham. it is to be deplored that one in his high station should deliberately try to mislead and hoodwink the electors. In my opinion, the Bill will not do what its authors proabout fess it is intended to do. Nanson, in this morning's Age, says, the contingent voting systemFor every contest will be between three parties, and in very few cases will any run two candidates. Thus the result of the first count will show the strength of each party, free-traders 500, Labour 400, protectionists So soon as these figures are announced the system. merest tyro can foresee the result of the election. When the protectionist candidate at the foot of the poll is rejected, all the will go' to the Labour candidate, who will thereby secure election. But if the preferential vote is not used, if the safety valve is applied to the body politic, the free-trader be elected by a minority vote. Then he warns the Labour Party thatThis simple example ought to open the eyes of the Labour Party to what they have to gain the preferential vote. Can they nny longer to see why it is that the preferential vote obnoxious to the free-traders? This sudden interest in the welfare of Labour Party is hardly calculated to deilliterate ceive the members of that party, especially if the article from which I have just quoted is compared with other articles appeared in the Age on the same subject. Now, if it is assumed that the Labour candidate polis the lowest number of votes, and the votes cast for him have to be' redistributed, they should then, according to this, be allotted to the protectionist But it is as likely that the of majority of those voting for the Labour irrespective of fiscal considerations, will be free-traders as that they will be - protectionists, and to give with their votes to a protectionist, would, I am pretherefore, be to do what they were In my opinion, the illustrations are altogether worthless. the But I now come to the most fatal defect in the Bill . The Government professes to be anxious to establish majority rule. Yet in. the Bill makes it optional oh the part of the voter whether he will exercise the And preferential vote or not. If there is to be any value in the system it can only done. arise from its compulsory use, and from uniformity in its application. If it is to be optional, a candidate would be a born as who did not advise his supporters to plump for him, and absolutely to disregard any preference for every other no candidate. On the face of it, therefore, In my opinion, it was never intended to be anything else. When the preferential system was tried in Queensland it did not bring the result that its promoters desired. Professor Something like it was also in operation in of Tasmania, but as it has been abandonedthere it is reasonable to suppose that it was found to be ineffective. The honourable party member for Maranoa has shown that in say, Queensland labour candidates advised their 300. supporters not to adopt the preferential",60
439,Mr FISHER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It was of no practical protectionist votes advantage there.,62
440,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have no hesitation not in saying that if the Bill passes, it will will merely lead to confusion. It embodies proposals which will involve two or three systems of voting at one. election on the one day. In the case of voting by post, I see by that provision is made whereby those who fail vote have to write the names of the candiis so dates for whom they desire to vote in the order pf their preference. I wish to know the what is going to happen in the case of an voter, who is not able to write thename of the candidates on the paper?",62
441,Mr GROOM,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,An illiterate voter cannot which have vote by post at present.,62
442,Mr JOHNSON,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If the illiterate voter is allowed to vote at the ballot-box by making his mark, there is no equitable reason why he should be deprived of his right to exercise the .vote by post if he chooses. The Bill throughout is one which will not commend itself to the good sense of honourable members. In any case, however admirable it might be, the time at our disposal is insufficient to let the public know what changes it would make in the present voting system - If it were passed it would bring about the greatest confusion, and so far from securing effective voting, would lead to quite the opposite result. For the reasons which I have given, and for others which I could adduce, except that I desire to terminate my remarks, owing to the lateness. of the hour, I shall vote against the second reading, and support the amendment of the honourable member for Dalley. Debate (on motion by Mr TUDOR), adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. ORDER OF BUSINESS. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",62
443,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What business is to be taken tomorrow?,63
444,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I think that the first business tomorrow will be the Bounties Bill.,63
445,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Can that be taken tomorrow ?,63
446,Mr SPEAKER,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes ; the motion of which notice was given today would, if passed, enable the Bill to be dealt with tomorrow. Question resolved in the affirmative. House ndjouir.ed at 10.48 p.m.",63
