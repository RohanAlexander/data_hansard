2,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"I wish to know the decision of the„ Government regarding the remission of fines imposed ondeceased soldiers. I have already asked two questions, and .had a notice of motion on the business-paper on the subject.",21
3,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The information is being given in reply to is question on notice. THE WAR. - 'PEACE TERMS. . Mr JOWETT. - Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that - the Senate of the United States of .America is considering a motion by Senator Lodge to the effect that no further cornmunications be sent by the Allies to Germany except to demand unconditional surrender? Is the honourable gentleman prepared to .allow this House, hearing in mind that this is .a .self-governing dominion of the British .Empire whose soldiers have played a 'great and valiant part in winning this war, to consider the advisability of affirming a amotion to the effect that, in our opinion, no further communications should he sent by the Allies to Germany except to demand that all of her submarines and other ships of war, - and all her armies, shall unconditionally surrender to the Allied Forces ? Mr ""WATT - The Government has uo official information of the motion - which has been moved in the American Senate, though, in common with other members of the public and of this House, I have seen a brief account of it. There is a distinction between the American Senate and this Legislature. The American nation cannot make war except with the consent of the Senate, which, as the honourable member doubtless knows, conditions the actions of the Executive in peace and in war. Then, the American Legislature is an absolutely sovereign body, which we are not. There are many other differences, but those two are the main ones. The adoption of the suggestion that the honourable member has made in perfect good faith and right spirit would not, I think, make any easier the task of the statesmen of the Empire who are dealing with these matters. The Government, knowing something of the actual war situation, which it is not permitted close, does not propose at fhis stage to invite the House to discuss the matter, but later we may be in a position to do so. DESERTERS' DEPE1TOANTS. ALLOWANCES. - Mr HIGGS - Will the Acting Prime Minister tell us why he offered of any allowance made by the States to the dependants of deserting soldiers? I understand that three families connected with soldiers whose whereabouts are unknown have made applications for relief to the Victorian Government, and that' the honourable gentleman has said that Commonwealth Government will pay half the cost. I should like the Minister explain what it is proposed to do in eases, and whether there may not be cases in which the whereabouts of a soldier, unknown, because he no longer exists, is a prisoner of war in a ""foreign",21
4,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I think I 'intimated last week, in reply to a question from the other - side, that the Government's views on this matter had been extensively - outlined in a communication with the State concerned. I could not off-nand, and without reference to the files, repeat what we have, said, but if the honourable member will give notice of the question for tomorrow, I shall see that he is told why our offer was made, and the basis of it. SYDNEY ELECTRICAL SUPPLY.",22
5,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Is it a fact that the Commonwealth Government has commandeered the city of Sydney's electrical supply? Will the Acting Prime Minister tell the House the reason fortius, and whether the same thing has been done in all thecapitals of the Commonwealth ?",22
6,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I am not aware that the city of Sydney's electrical supply has been commandeered, but if my honourable friend will give notice of his question for tomorrow, I snail then be prepared with an answer. STEAMER ILLAROO.",22
7,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Will the Assistant Minister for the Navy state whether a permit has been given for the sale of the steamer Illaroo, and her transfer from the Australian. register ? In view 'of the to dispresent shortage of tonnage in Australia, will the honourable :gentleman - give the reasons for the granting of this permit?  ledge of the sale of the steamer, or of her transfer from the Australian register. I hardly think fhat she has been sold, but I shall let the honourable memto payihalf ber know tomorrow. NA ANNOUNCEMENTS ",22
8,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT,"As there are . thousands of taxpayers living in outlying parts of Australia to which there is not the - frequent mail communication, will the Acting Prime Minister, in future, when to there are important announcements to these be made like that relating to the compulsory contribution to the War Loan, is make them sufficiently early to enable or these people to know of them in time to country? comply with the law? <",22
9,Mr WATT,GOVERNMENT,"I shall consider the suggestion. ' The principle is a right one, though I cannot bind myself in regard to all futur e actions. POSTAL OFFICIALS' UNIFORMS. - Mr FINLAYSON - H as . a request reached the Postmaster-General from the temporary employees in his Department for uniforms to be supplied to them? If so, has he given the matter consideration? If not, will he give it favourable consideration ?Mr ""WEBSTER - The matter has been considered. The request cannot be complied with,. WAR PENSIONS. NA",23
10,Mr BRENNAN,MOTHERS OP SOLDIERS BORN OUT OF,"I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether he regards with complacency the fact that the mother of a soldier killed in action is, in one case of which I know, absolutely destitute because, since her son was born out of wedlock, she is not entitle'd to receive a pension. This woman is fifty-nine years of age-jus t too young to obtain an old age pension and too old to work. the Minister consider the advisabksnoss of issuing an amended regulation to permit of mothers of soldiers killed in action, and who were born out of wedlock, receiving a pension like othermothers who haye lost their sons ?",23
11,Mr WISE,MOTHERS OP SOLDIERS BORN OUT OF,I will bring the honourable member's question under the - notice of the Minister for Defence. NA WAR LOAN.,23
12,Mr KELLY,CONTRIBUTIO NS TO COMPULSOR Y,"I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he will lay upon the table of the' House any representations that may have been made to him by trustees and other. persons administering trusts in the direction of endeavouring to induce the Government to submit a measure which would enable them to meet the compulsory war loan provisions while keeping within the four corners of their deeds of trust? "" Mr Watt - I am mot aware that any such representations have been made to me. There may be communications on the subject in the' Treasury, but speaking from memory a regulation covering the matter has already been passed. I shall see that the honourable member obtains the information he desires. WHEAT POOL. PAYMEN TS TO FARMERS.  necessitous farmers with funds to enable them to cope with the approaching harvest, will the Treasurer take into consideration, as a matter of urgency, tha making of a further instalment to those whose wheat is in the pools for 1916-17 and 1917-181.",23
13,Mr WATT,CONTRIBUTIO NS TO COMPULSOR Y,"I think that the payments already made on account of the pools to which the honourable member refers are as large as can be safely made WEDLOCK. in the existing circumstances. I shall refer the honourable member's suggestion to my colleague who has charge of the Australian Wheat Board's activities. SPEECH BYDR . MANNIX .  Prime Minister taken any cognisance of a speech made by Dr Mannix before the Catholic Young Men's Association as reported in today's press ? If so, does he Will contemplate taking any action . in regard to the disloyal utterances contained therein?",23
14,Mr WATT,CONTRIBUTIO NS TO COMPULSOR Y,W it h great respect I must deprecate the practice of asking without notice questions of far-reaching significance. I ask the honourable member to give notice of his question. SEVENTH WAR LOAN. EXTENSION OF TIME.,23
15,Mr LIVINGSTON,CONTRIBUTIO NS TO COMPULSOR Y,"Will the Acting Prime Minister state whether it is the in tention of the Government to extend the time for receiving subscriptions to the ' Seventh War Loan in respect of which £37,000,000 has already been raised, .so that the outside public will not be penalized for their failure to contribute within the time originally fixed for the closing of the loan?",23
16,Mr WATT,CONTRIBUTIO NS TO COMPULSOR Y,"I am unable, at present, to announce whether the war loan will be extended for a few days. The Deputy Governor of the Commonwealth Bank has j u s t arrived on special summons from Sydney, and I hope to have an opportunity during the day to investigate with him the exact results of the loan up to the present hour. I may be - able to tell the House later in the sitting whether or not an extension of time will be made.",23
17,Mr BEUCE SMITH,CONTRIBUTIO NS TO COMPULSOR Y,"Bearin g upon the question just asked by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Livingston), I would remind the Acting Prime Minister that he promised last week to make an early announcement as to the date to which the time for making these payments would be extended. There has not been time for trustees and directors of companies to meet in order to determine how they are going to raise, as a contribution to the war loan, six times the amount of. their income tax. ""Will the honourable gentleman tell the House to what date he intends to extend the time within which compulsory contributions may be made? Mr ""WATT - It seems to me that the question put by the honourable member, although"" phrased differently, is precisely the same as that asked by the honourable member for Barker.",24
18,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONTRIBUTIO NS TO COMPULSOR Y,No ; it is a different question.,24
19,Mr WATT,CONTRIBUTIO NS TO COMPULSOR Y,"Then I have misunderstood the honourable member. "" I take it that what he desires to know is whether people who have not been able to put their money into the loan will be granted further time before the compulsory provisions of the Bill are enforced against them.",24
20,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONTRIBUTIO NS TO COMPULSOR Y,That is one part of my question.,24
21,Mr WATT,CONTRIBUTIO NS TO COMPULSOR Y,"That is a matter which I oannot at present determine. I should like to point out, however, that the community has had far longer notice than some members of the community allegethey have had with regard to the application of compulsion. When the House met after the recent recess, the honourable member was unfortunately absent owing to illness, but at that time the Government explicitly announced in a Minis.terial statement, which was printed by order of the House, that compulsion would be applied, and the date and hour. of the closing of the loan were then announced. The only point not specified at that time was as to the nature of the compulsion and the extent of the penalty, but the fact that compulsion was to be applied was announced by the Government, and was discussed in the House. RECRUITING PICTURES. Mr BfRENNAN - Will the Minister representing the Minister for Recruiting state whether he has noticed certain repulsive pictorial incitements to bloodshed that are posted in various conspicuous places, and notably on public buildings in and around the 6ity of Melbourne? To one of these special reference was ma'de last week by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Leckie). Will the Minister take steps for the withdrawal and destruction of these odious publications?",24
22,Mr ORCHARD,CONTRIBUTIO NS TO COMPULSOR Y,"The order for the printing of the poster in question was given before the war situation had reached its present stage, and we are considering the advisableness of withdrawing it. If the position were less favourable than it is today, it is just possible that the poster to which the honourable member has referred might bring home to eligibles the methods of the enemy whom we are fighting. NA INSTITUTIONS.",24
23,Mr MACKAY,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,"Will the Treasurer state whether the Government intend to - pay a maintenance allowance to old-'age pensioners in charitable institutions; and, if so, at what rate and when ?",24
24,Mr WATT,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,"At the Treasurers' Conference, held some six or seven weeks ago, the Commonwealth, for the first time, came tc aii agreement with the States a"" to these payments. I am unable offhand to speak of when they will be made, or of what the amount will be, but I shall endeavour to furnish ""the honourable member with the information tomorrow. POSTAL INSTITUTE . POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S POEM. MT. PINLAYSON - In view of the fact that a number of honourable members were unfortunately unable to attend the official opening of the Postal Institute yesterday, and that, although the. newspapers have fairly and fully reported the honourable gentleman's speech, none of them report in full the .poem with which, the honourable gentleman favoured the audience",24
25,Mr TUDOR,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,"Yes , the Argus did'.",25
26,Mr FINLAYSON,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,I was going to - ask the honourable gentleman if he would favour each member of the House with a copy of that poem as a record?,25
27,Mr WEBSTER,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,Probably honourable members' would wish to know who was going to pay the cost. NAVY DEPARTMENT. COMPENSATION TO CONTRACTOR.,25
28,Mr FALKINER,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,"Has the attention of the Acting. Minister for the Navy been drawn to the statement in one of the daily newspapers that his Department paid £25,000 on a clbjiim. by a contractor, and that the Comptroller of Accounts said that £7,000 would have been ample?  to was evidently written under a. misapprehension, altogether, and I have asked for a full statement, which I shall publish, probably tomorrow. There is no record in the Department that any officer recommended £7,000 as a final payment in connection with the claim made. There was a dispute over certain items, which, resulted in a law case, and an official recommended that there should be paid not more than £7,000, pending the other items being looked into. However, the honourable member shall have a fulL statement tomorrow.",25
29,Mr TUDOR,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,"Is the case referred to that of Cone, in connection with the fitting up of transports?  MAIL CONTRACTS. PREFERENCE TO RETURNED SOLDIERS. Mr JOHN T.HOMSON.^-Iu view of for the fact that tenders for mail contracts now being considered by the Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales, and seeing that this kind of work is. very able for returned disabled soldiers, that the Postmaster-General is not disEurope. posed to give these soldiers preference, cept when all other things are equal, will the Minister for Repatriation ascertain whether the two Departments can confer as to whether the benefits of repatriation may be extended to these soldiers, and ditionally surrendered. special consideration given to them in this: connection? MT. GROOM-.:- I will put the suggestion before the Minister for Repatriation, and inform the honourable member as to the result. CENSORSHIP. PEACE ALLIANCE - LETTE R AND OABLEGRAM. Mr OONSIDINE . ^ I desire to know from the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) whether the censor' has acted "" off his own 'bat"" or under instructions, in deleting from the policy of the. Australian Peace Alliance, paragraph e, words referring to disarmament, with a view to total abolition, and clause i , which refers, to "" organizations of workers and other associations with the definite view to. ending war.""",25
30,Mr WATT,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,I know nothing about the matter.,25
31,Mr WATKINS,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,"Will the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr Wise) ascertain why a cablegram and letter from the president of the MinersAssociation of Australia to the president of the Miners Federation of Great Britain were censored, if they were censored? I previously asked the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) this question, and was informed that it came under the Department of Defence.",25
32,Mr WISE,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,I shall make inquiries. RECRUITING BALLOT.,25
33,Mr SAMPSON,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,"Does the Minister for Recruiting (Mr Orchard) consider the enlisting .of recruits for reinforcements as urgent now as it was previous to the receipt of the information as to the peace offer from' Germany and the present news from the Front ? If so, will the Minister see that an early' date is fixed the closing .of the ballot, so that the are Government may consider the situation?",25
34,Mr ORCHARD,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,"If r is not our intention to relax our efforts in obtaining resuitcruits until something more definite is and knownin regard to the situation in We are proceeding with - the exballot, and we hope to hav.e the whole of the lists of eligibles completed within the next week or two.

35,Mr CHANTER,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,"I am informed that there has appeared in the Argus a statement to the effect that the Government are. making provision to issue return railway passes to all parents of ANZACs who are coming to Australia on f u rlough. I should like to know whether that statement is correct""?",26
36,Mr WISE,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,"I am not aware, but I shall make inquiries. BONUS FOR PAPER - MAKIN G.",26
37,Dr MALONEY,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,"Will Prime Minister (Mr Watt), request the Cabinet to consider the granting of a bonus for the manufacture the ratio of £1 for £1 on condition the Government receive half, or other proportion, of the profits of such .manufacture 1",26
38,Mr WATT,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,"As to the broad question of whether we should seek to encourage the manufacture of paper by the offer of a bonus, it is, I think, one that 1 is at present under the consideration of the Board of Trade. to commit myself in any way to a proposed ratio of £1 for £1. Dr. MALONEV - That is £ 1 way of assistance to the people who put their money into the enterprise.",26
39,Mr WATT,PENSIONERS IN CHARITABLE,"I thought the honourable member meant £1 for £1 in relation to the cost of production, which would be a fair l y generous deal. I shall see that the suggestion is considered when other phases of the question are being dealt with . NA NA",26

42,Mr BLAKELEY,DEPARTMEN T OP TRAD E AN D,"On the 20th"" September, I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs the following questions:.1. Whether it is a fact that officers of the Customs Department have been loaned to the .New South Wales Meat Board in connection with the rabbit contract between the - British the Acting Government and the Meat Board? 2. If so(a) How many officers have been so loaned, of paper in and what are their . names; that (6) What control does the Minister exercise over such officers, if any; and (c) Who pays such officers? Will the Minister expedite the answers? ' ' Mr JENSEN - The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. No. ' .2. See reply to question No. 1. I should not like AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE. NA MARTIALLED. for £1 by",26
43,Mr WISE,OFFICERS DISCHARGED AND COURT,"On Thursday last, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr . MoGrath) asked me1. How many officers of the Australian Imperial Force have beenp returned to Australia and discharged on the grounds that their services are' no longer required? 2. Is it true that officers so returned have had neither a court martial nor a court of inquiry? The answers areQUOTAS. 1. Seventy-iour. 2. Twenty-four of the above have Hcither had FORMS. a court martial nor a court of inquiry, accorda shire which ing to the records available. The"" honourable member also askedand 1. How many officers of the Australian Imperial Force have, during the last four years, been tried by court martial? amount was 2. How many have been found guilty? 3. How manyhave been sent to. prison? complete The answers arehowever, 1. 128. 2. 119. 3. One officer was imprisoned. In the remainder of the cases the sentences awarded have been thoseof cashiering, dismissal, for-' feiture of seniority or reprimand.",26
44,Mr WISE,OFFICERS DISCHARGED AND COURT,"Witl i regard to the matter of spinal beds for military hospitals which the honourable member for Wenttralia worth (Mr Kelly) mentioned in the House on the 4th instant, I find that since this question was raised the district authorities at Sydney have expressed the opinion that twelve beds of this kind would be useful at the present time. Por low :obvious reasons, equipment is not usually issued except on demand by. the medical authority in charge, and in this case the officer concerned had not requisitioned for the supply. Following upon this expression of opinion, instructions have been issued that the spinal beds required shall be supplied. NA GEOMETRICAL DRAWING.'",27
45,Mr TUDOR,MILITARY COLLEGE,"the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon notice In view of the fact that geometrical drawing is a compulsory subject at the Royal M i l it a r y College examinations this year for the first time, and that students who have not studied this subject during their course and desire to compete at the examination this year will obviously be at a disadvantage in consequence of their not having had any reason to think at . the beginning of the year that this subject would be made compulsory, will the Minister for Defence take steps to havethis disability removed, so that such students will not be penalized?",27
46,Mr WISE,MILITARY COLLEGE,"The - answer to the honororable member's question is as follows:It is incorrect to state that geometrical drawing is to be a compulsory subject for the first time at the approaching examination for admission to the Royal Militar y College. Its inclusion in the list of compulsory subjects was approved by the Minister in 1916, and District Commandants, and ' the schools throughout the Commonwealth were duly notified of the change. It was a compulsory subject for the Entrance Examination held in 1916, and it is not understood how any candidate could have formed the impression referred to by the honourable member. SALE OF WOOL CLIP.",27
47,Mr HIGGS,MILITARY COLLEGE,"the Acting Prime Minister , upon notice I. Has he seen the statement in the public press that, in the opinion of able business men in London, ""the opinions of British manufacturers have been permitted to weigh too heavily"" in ths negotiations for the purchase and sale of the Australian wool clip; also the SPINAL BEDS. statement by Sir Arthu r Goldfinch, Director of Raw Materials, "" that prices have been paid for wool during the last twelve months in North and South America very greatly in excess of the basis agreed upon with Aus"" ? 2. In this connection, will he state what was the average price paid for wool in North and South America during the last twelve montlis?",27
48,Mr WATT,MILITARY COLLEGE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as fol1. Yes. ' 2. I have no information on the subject, but 1 will see if it is possible to obtain it . MAJOR CARROLL.",27
49,Mr HIGGS,MILITARY COLLEGE,"the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Whether, in view of the Crown Solicitor's opinion (13th September, 1916) "" that. Captain Carroll was appointed by the late Lord K it chener to The rank of major, that approval EXAMINATIONS. of this appointment was given by the Queensland Government, that the appointment of Major Carroll to the rank of major in South Africa became de facto complete on the consent of the Queensland Government being given to such appointment,"" the Government intend to withhold from - M a j or Carroll the brevet rank to which he appears to be entitled? 2. If so, will the Minister state the reasons?",27
50,Mr WISE,MILITARY COLLEGE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. Yes.. 2. [a) The paragraph in the first question purporting to be a quotation is not aquotation, but is a collection of statements extracted from the Crown Solicitor's opinion, and is misleading. The Crown Solicitor states that a Cabinet minute has no legal effect in itself, and it is a question of policy whether it be given effect to or not. He further states that the effect of the appointment was not to give Major Carroll the rank of major in the Commonwealth M i l it a r y Forces, and would not have done so even if the consent had been given - by the Commonwealth Government and not the Queensland Government. Major Carroll is .therefore not entitled to claim any promotion as a matter of right in consequence of his servico in South Africa . (6) No promotions of officers for service in South Africa were made' u n t i l eight months after the second Cabinet decision of the 30th A p r i l, 1902, and, therefore, it is quite irrelevant to consider whether Major Carroll returned before or after that decision. The cases of all officers who returned from South Africa and received promotion (240 in all) were considered under the second Cabinet decision, and it is, therefore, not proposed, after a lapse of fifteen years, to single out Major Carroll for special recognition from amongst all those who returned meritorious service in South Africa . . The 29 officers out of the 240.mentioned above who received promotion other than honorary promotion were dealt with as special cases under the second paragraph of the Cabinet cision of the 30th April, 1902, and it is not considered that Major Carroll's service was such a distinguished nature as to warrant being selected for special preferment from amongst the otlier 211 officers, and, therefore, no action will be taken to reopen this case, or to alter the decision already given. SOLDIERS' DEPENDANTS. DEDUCTIONS FROM ALLOWANCESREMISSION OF PENALTIES.",27
51,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MILITARY COLLEGE,"the Acting sion, Prime Minister, upon notice I. Having regard to the question in reference ito deductions from the allowances of soldiers'- tion ? wives and dependants, is it a fact that the Dofence Department has received hundreds of letters addressed to it, protesting against practice of deducting from such allowances sums of money to pay penalties fbr the alleged. misconduct of the soldier when on service? 2. Will the Government consider the question of the justice and the effect on recruiting requiring the wife of a soldier to consent enlisting on the supposition that she will receive a certain portion of his pay, and afterwards visiting upon the wife and children the ment of the soldier by depriving them of portion of their sole support upon which they rely substitute for the wages which tliey have surrendered to enable the soldier to enlist? Mr Watt , - The answers to the orable member's questions are as follow:1. Communications have been received ing on this matter: 2. The consent of the wife to the enlistment of her husband in the Australian Imperial Force is not required. The soldier enlists with the full knowledge that penalties are provided for breach of discipline. It is not seen how dis- - while they are - answering questions. cipline can be maintained unless penalties breaches of such are enforced. It is not always practicable or advisable that the punishment should Be imprisonment, so penalty is the only alternative.",28
52,Mr FINLAYS ON,MILITARY COLLEGE,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Whether he is prepared to provide remission of all fines and deductions of pay in the case of men who make the supreme sacrifice in the war, so that their dependants penalized financially in addition to their regretable bereavement? 2. If the Minister is unable to make this arbelong? rangement in all cases, will he at least provide for it in the case of the widows and children deceased soldiers 1",28
53,Mr WATT,MILITARY COLLEGE,"Approva l has been given for the - remission of all monetary penal. ties awarded in the case of all members of the Australian Imperial Force who, after embarkation and subsequent to 1st July, de1918, are killed in action, or, whilst still of members of the Australian Imperial Force, his die as the result of wounds received in action, or from the effects of war service. NA EXAMINATIONS.

His relative seniority will also be preserved. If honhonorable members will indulge in a Greek chorus of comments and interruptions bearwhile answers to questions are being read, I shall have to resume the practice of merely laying the answers on the table.",28
55,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Complain t has been made about the interruption of Ministers I for ask honourable members to refrain froin making audible comments while answers that a monetary are being read. CHAPLAINS ON TROOPSHIPS.  for the ister for Defence, upon notice I.

If so, how many have been so appointed, and to what religious denomination do they 3. Are such appointments made by the Imof perial or the Australian authorities?.",28
56,Mr WISE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The answers to the honor- able member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. This procedure was adopted on representations by the authorities of the various denominations that it was essential one chaplain of the Protestant and one from the Roman Catholic denominations should he detailedfor duty on each returning transport, hut, owing the fact that chaplainsof the Australian I m - .they are paid for overtime; (d) whether em perial Force overseas are not always available, it became necessary toemploy clergymen for this duty selected by the senior'chaplains, tralian Imperial I'orce, of the denominations concerned.

Their employment terminates on disembarkation in Australia. The Chaplain-General of the denomination has intimated that he cannot at present fil l existing vacancies for chaplains of his denomination for service abroad, owing the shortage of clergymen, due to sickness and other reasons, thus preventing the return to Australia of Roman Catholic chaplains of the high pressure.

Special provision has been made, however, for men who are returned on account of ill-health to receive treatment for a reasonable period with a view to making them fit to resume their civil occupation, and allowances to dependants will, be continued during the period of treatment. 2. Under the navvies' agreement, a standard wage of £2' Os. 6d. is guaranteed from the date the man commences work up to and including the fourth working day prior to the departure of the man from. Great Britain on his return voyage to Australia, provided such guarantee docs not extend to the case where' time is lost by the worker from causes within his own control. An advance of £3 on voyage allowance is then paid to the worker prior to his embarkation. There is no such provision under the munition workers' agreement, but a sustenance allowance is paid by the Board of Trade, England, to all Australian munition workers who, from causes beyond their own control,- areout of employment in Great Britain. An' advance of £3 on voyage is also paid to munition workers. 3. The Ministry of Labour, England, is responsible fbr the placing of the men in employment.

In Committee of Supply: Ordered That the consideration of the General Estimates be postponed, until after the consideration of Estimates for Additions, New Works, Buildings, &c. DEPARTMENT OF WORKS AND RAILWAYS . Proposed vote, £165,865.",30
64,Mr WAT T,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Balaclava-Treasure r and Acting Prime Minister) [3.45] - It has been the invariable practice in recent years to postpone the consideration of the General Estimates in order that the construction of works may not be postponed. The total amount included in these Estimates for Additions, New Works, Buildings, & c , is £454,951 , which is £802,666 less than the provision made in the year 1917-18, when the total amount estimated to be payable from revenue upon Additions, New Works, Buildings, & c , was £1,257,617. The policy followed in framing the Estimates wasto provide for the completion of works already in progress, and only in cases of urgent necessity was provision made for works not already in hand. By this limitation, the Estimates now submitted are £541,000 less - than, the amounts which the Departments originallyasked to be provided this year. Seeing that the amount asked for is now confined almost to works that were in hand on 30th June last, it is to be expected that the bulk of t i e expenditure will take place in the earlier months of this financial year. Therefore, in order that there may be no break in the continuity of the work in hand, Parliament is now asked to pass the Estimates covering the whole year'. The principal items of expenditure are as follows: Quarantine buildings .. . . 25,183 Erection of drill halls and ordnance stores . . . .. . . 17,379 Other defence works and buildings .. 22,011 Sydney Telephone Exchange . . .16,980 Extension General Post Office, Melbourne .. .. .. 18,190 Parcels post building, Melbourne .. 21,170 Other postal buildings .. . . 22,324Water boring, purchase of scow, and other works and buildings, Northern Territory . . ... . . 10,000. Telegraph and telephone material for construction and extension of lines. .. .. . . 175,000 Warlike stores, including field' and machine guns, equipment, &c. .. 51,100 Small Arms Factory-addition s and installation of machinery and plant .. . . 25,000 Cordite Factory-addition s and extensions . -- 7,000 Woollen Cloth Factory-machiner y and plant .. .. . . . 5,000 Naval works .. .. . . 14,000 Vessels for Customs, quarantine, and lighthouse work .. Other works and buildings . . .. Total .. .. . . £454,951 Ministers will be in charge of their respective Departments, and will be prepared to give any information they possess which is asked for in respect to the various works appearing in the schedule. I hope that the Committee will facilitate the passage of these Estimates within a reasonable time, so that bo break in the continuity of some of these important works may occur!",30
65,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Y a r r a ) [3.50] - Honor able members, in voting for these Works and Buildings Estimates, should know what they are voting for. Expenditure is proposed for "" the establishment and equipment of research divisions, laboratories, and experimental stations in connection with the Institute of Science and Industry,"", and a number of new works are set down under the heading of "" Quarantine."" These proposals should have the scrutiny of the Committee. wish for information regarding the proposed expenditure on laboratories, and also regarding that on isolation hospitals for seamen. These are being provided in New South Wales and in Queensland. The Navigation Bill-the Committee work of which in this Chamber fell chiefly to the present Prime M in ister (Mr Hughes) and myself on the Government side, and the M in ister for Home and Territories (Mr . £ Glynn) and the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) for the Opposition - too k power to deal with sailors who are practically a menace to the health of the passengers on the vessels on which they are employed- The steam-ship owners have agreed that this is necessary, and isolation hospitals are being provided accordingly. There.is here a revote of £3,480 for New South Wales, and of £ 5 3 1 for Queensland, with an additional £ 1 3 0 for "" new service "" in Queensland. I wish to know whether there are isolation hospitals for seamen in the other ports of the Commonwealth, where they are likely to be required. As to the £3,000 set down for research divisions, laboratories, and experiment stations for the Institute of Science and Industry, I ask the Minister whether those who vote for this proposal will be taken to have agreed to the Bill which is 21,300 now. before the Senate. In my opinion, 3,314 it would have been better to extend the present laboratories, which are used in connection with Customs work, and to make them more available to manufacturers and others than to set up a new ma' chine, which, so far as I know, has yet done very little. I do not say that it is incapable of doing a great deal in the f u t u r e ; it may not yet have had a proper opportunity. I wish to know where the amount set down in the Estimates is to be expended, and whether the laboratories are to be in addition to that at the back of the Customs House in Melbourne, and 'that connected with the Quarantine Department at Royal Park, Melbourne. It seems inadvisable to duplicate expenditure. _ Besides those laboratories; we have that in whioh serum is being made, which is doing very necessary work at the present time. The sum of £16,980 is set down for the Sydney Telephone Exchange. Of £22,598 to be spent in New South Wales in connection with Postal Department work, I £16,980 is to be spent in Sydney. Of course, the expenditure may be more needed there than elsewhere. The sum of £1,600 is set down for the construction of "" parcels post and postal sorting and postal stores b u i l d in g "" in Melbourne, and £18,190 for the extension and alteration of the Melbourne General Post Office.",31
66,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That is for alterations to the ground floor of the Elizabeth-street building.,32
67,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I regret that the title"" General Post Office,"" which, so long as any of us can remember, has belonged to the Elizabeth-street building, has been transferred to the new building at the corner of Spencer-street and Bourke street.",32
68,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"r-To utilize the new building as much as possible, and because conditions are better there than they were in the old building, I moved as many officers as I could into it . The law requires that the building in which, the Administrative Branch is housed must be called the General Post Office.",32
69,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The new building is certainly a magnificent one, and provides a great deal of accommodation. If there is enough room there, it would haye been better to transfer still more officers, with a view to avoiding expenditure at Elizabeth-street. _ Another item upon which I wish information is that providing for the ' ' erecting of new buildings and re-modelling old Parcels Post . Building for telegraph operating room."" Is that the room that was used by the Customs Department in connection with the parcels post, to which there was an entrance from L it t l e Bourke street ?",32
70,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The premises referred to lie between Elizabeth-street and the Little Bourke-street office. They are the central portion of the block, the other section being used for other purposes.",32
71,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"We should have had some information from the Treasurer as to how much of the work which last year was provided for in tliese Estimates has now been transferred to the Loan Estimates. Apparently a great deal of work bas been transferred to the Loan Estimates. The construction of lighthouses, which was previously paid for out of revenue, is now being paid for out of loan money. I hope that the Minister will give the Committee some information on this and the other subjects that I ""have",32
72,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Wentworth) [ 4 . 2 ] ask the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) a question affecting the ministration of one of the biggest works to be carried out by his Department-tha is, the Arsenal.",32
73,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That work is provided in the Loan Estimates.,32
74,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"This question affects the administration of the whole Department. Since the House last sat I have been given certain papers which, to my mind, make it important that the matter should be cleared up at once. A Melbourne newspaper has printed the statement that "" Mr J . K . Jensen has been appointed to proceed to England vid the United States of America for the purpose of studying matters relative to the business management of the proposed Australian Arsenal."" The mere fact that a man has the same name as a Minister is promptly made the ground for insinuation, and I have here a d r a f t question which I would not like to put without these covering words. It asks, "" Whether this gentleman has been appointed ? If so, how long has he been in the Government service ? What are his qualifications for the position, and what positions has he previously filled?"" Of course, similarity of name is nothing; what is important is a man's qualifications. I ask the Minister to show that if this appointment has been made, it is one that should have been made in the public interest.",32
75,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Darlin g Downs-Minister for Works and Railways [4.5] - The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) raised a question in regard to the proposed vote for isolation hospitals for seamen. These works were previously authorized, and are proceeding towards completion. In three of the States provision has been, made in connection with the quarantine stations for dealing with seamen who have to be isolated. 3",32
76,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Includin g Victoria?,32
77,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"No . The Director of Quarantine, with the Minister, has under consideration the question of the provision to be made in this State. The matter has not been lost sight of, and its importance is full y realized. These are not new commitments, the amounts having been previously authorized. As to the proposed vote of £3,000 for the establishment and equipment of research divisions, laboratories, and experiment stations, I would point out I that any vote-given upon it cannot affect the question as to the way in which honadorable members should vote on the Bill providing for the establishment of an In t stitute of Science and Industry.",32
78,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,It might be said t h a i for since we voted fov this item to provide for new laboratories we should vote for th© Bill to provide for the establishment - of the Institute with which these laboratories will be associated.,32
79,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,This is a general vote in connection with the establishment of that Institute. It has not yet been determined where any particular experiment shall be carried on. This is merely a .general item.,33
80,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Is it not a grant in advance of the passing of the Bill for the establishment of the Institute?,33
81,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,It is necessary that this provision should be made. Expenditure is going on from time to time in. connection with thesundertaking.,33
82,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That expenditure is provided for in the general Estimates.,33
83,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,".Quite l so, but this item should appear in the works and buildings estimates. As to the fear - which the honourable memberexpressed,that large sums might be expended in duplicating work already being carried on in the State, I might say at once that we have no intention of doing anything of the kind. The proposal is that the Institute of Science and Industry shall not duplicate the work of the State Bureaux, - but shall rather co-ordinate that work, and take advantage of and assist the existing State institutions. The Institute of Science and ""Industry will operate with the universities, experimental farms and colleges, and other State institutions throughout Australia. We shall take advantage of their work, and shall not add to them. any unnecessary scientific establishments.",33
84,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Where does the Government propose to erect these laboratories?,33
85,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That question has not yet been definitely determined. It is one with which the Institute itself will have to deal. Honourable members will recognise that a grant of £3,000 would not permit of the establishment of an extensive laboratory. This sum might be made available to assist State institutions. It is a general vote to meet the purposes of the Institute to be established under the authority of a Bill now before Parliaments",33
86,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"If that Bill is not passed, this vote will lapse, I presume?",33
87,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I cannot say that it will lapse. An Advisory Committee has been carrying on scientific work, and has - done exceedingly well. Sir ROBERT P>EST --Doe3 the Minister mean that?",33
88,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It is, of course, a matter of opinion, but I think the Committee in question has done exceedingly good work.",33

90,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,B y the character and quality of the work done. Sir ROBERT BEST.;-Then the Minister can know nothing about it.,33
91,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I can only judge by the work done by the Committee - ',33
92,Mr UODGERS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"We should either have a big Federal movement or none at all. Mr GROOM;-It should be based on the principle of co-operation with the States, so as to carry out efficiently work that the States cannot undertake. That is the proposal. No one will claim that the Committee that has been sitting for' some time could properly take the place of a well-equipped Institute of Science and Industry. It is only an advisory body, and I do not claim .that it has been doing work equal to, for instance, that carried out by either the TJnited States of America or Canadian Bureau of Agriculture. It has merely been laying the foundation for the work of the Institute.",33
93,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,But it is most successful in spending money.,33
94,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I do not know every deco- tail of its expenditure, but I believe that it has been money spent in the right direction.",33
95,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Can the Minister give one instance of useful work done by the Committee? MT. GROOM - I should not be in order at this stage in discussing the whole principle involved in the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry; but I may say that the Institute will be carried on upon the basis of co-operation with the States. Wherever possible, it will utilize, and not duplicate, State agencies. It will not duplicate their activities, but will undertake work with which, by reason of their limitations, they cannot possibly deal. Tasmania, for instance, with its small population, cannot deal completely with the scientific work involved in coping with the pests that affect that State. And so with Queensland. In all tie States there are big problems of the kind which should be dealt with from an Australian stand-point.  such problems, and doing more than the Commonwealth is. "" Mr GROOM - We are asking now 'for power to do more of this work. When the Scottish Commission, which comprised a fairly competent body of experts, vestigated our conditions, they reported our scattered State Departments of Agriculture, and spoke favourably of the estabspend lishment of an Institute upon the lines now contemplated. They pointed out many pests and stock diseases were not peculiar to any one State, but were mon problems in respect of which Austility tralia, as a whole, was interested, and they urged that a Central Department should be established to deal with such matters.",33
96,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The Minister should give the Committee an assurance that money will not be expended unless the providing for the Institute of Science passed.,34
97,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I cannot, without makPage) ing further inquiries, give such an assurin ance. I ask honourable members not to question this vote, which will be applied to laboratory purposes in connection with the Institute.'",34
98,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"There can be no doubt > that we want more knowledge as to best methods of dealing with pests, but - require to be satisfied that this expendisoon ture in war time will not he incurred overlapping the work of State institutions already in existence. Mr GROOM;-Havin g regard to the importance of our primary industries, is more than ever necessary in war time to check the spread of the diseases pests thai; threaten them. This expendico-operate ture should be regarded as in the nature to of insurance.  the States are doing nothing in this direcInstitute. tion.",34

At that time, although there was no war in existence, we could not secure £50,000 for the inpurpose, but now, in war time, it is proon posed to spend millions in this direction. Mr TrROOM - It is not 'intended to millions. I have been trying since 1901 to establish such an institution. that Victoria, Queensland, and the other States were anxious to help in the work; comand it is only quite recently that hosin certain quarters has developed.",34
101,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,It is amusing to think that ' in those days you laboured and could gain nothing.,34

105,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Wimmera)_ [ 4 . 2 5 ] do not think there is any difference of opinion as to the necessity for the establishment of Institutes of Science throughout Australia in order to stimulate, our primary as. well as' our secondary productions; the only difficulty is in regard to the way in which we are to set about the work. If this proposal means merely the appointment of a ' certain number of University professors, who are to - make academic research work, without _ that being put to any practical test, it will be money thrown away. We are constantly told about the need for legislative au-, thority to take certain action in co-ordination with the States; but when .these proposals become concrete and effective, we find that work is simply being dupli-j cated at great increase of expenditure by I the Commonwealth.",35
106,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,To what is the honourable member particularly referring?,35
107,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am referring to, many instances of duplication of work done by the States-duplicatio n caused by the appointment of. Boards to. deali with various aspects of trade. However,, I do not wish to go into that question now, because I shall have an opportunity later on; at present, I ' merely wish to i refer to the fact that we are handing tobureaucracies work which Ministers themselves ought to do, as responsible to the taxpayers. I am glad to hear the M in ister say that this money will not be expended u n t i l authority is given by this House for the establishment of a permanent body. ",35
108,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I understood the Minister to say that this money will remain in suspension u n t i l - such time as authority is given for the establishment of an Institute. When this machinery is in operation in all the States, it is the duty of Parliament to' see that there is real co-ordination under one large scheme, and that work done by any academic bodies is practically tested in respect to both primary production and manufacture. Such an Institute should be in sufficiently close touch with the operations of manufacture to be able to gather all the necessary information. The work of co-ordination with the States should beundertaken' before any Bill is brought before Parliament. I know that we cannot discuss the Budget 'on the present occasion; but it is just as well to remember the - - I great increase of general exjienditure during the war. While we applaud the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) for cutting down the expenditure in various Departments, as indicated in the Budget speech, no one can say that that reduction goes far enough in this war period.' We, as a Parliament, which is talking economy, should first - set our own house in order, as an example to the people. So far as I can see, on looking at the general Estimates, the only drastic reductions are in connection with new works, with the result that very important undertakings, which would be reproductive, and amply supply interest and sinking f u n d , have been put on one side, while, in the various administrative Departments there is not only no reduction but, in many, an increase. This is quite j beyond my comprehension during this period of war. According to the Estimates, our works expenditure has dropped from £2,673,000 in 1914 to £454,000 in 1918. We all know that 1 expenditure on the 1914"" standard could not be continued under present circumstances,* and we are prepared to submit 1 to great reductions in connection with new works, and to lop off all expenditure not of a purely reproductive character. While the States are constructing railways out of money secured through the Commonwealth, in order to open up country and increase the production necessary for our present sustenance, and also for the demands after the war, we, as a Federal Parliament, are practically at a stand-still, so far as the extension df telephone works throughout the Commonwealth is concerned. We find that the expenditure on new works has dropped from £1,257,000 to £625,000, a reduction of more, than one-half; yet, in nearly every one of the administrative Departments, there is increased expenditure. In the Prime Minister's Department, for instance, in 1914, the expenditure was £149,000, whereas now it is £204,000, notwithstanding the fact that the Treasurer has adopted a process of devolution, and delegated large expenditure to other Departments. It is a question, whetlier the Prime Minister's Department, which has reached such huge expenditure, is at all necessary within the Commonwealth. The ' CHAIRMAN (Hon. J. M . Chanter) - The honourable member must not discuss that matter now. "" Mr SAMPSON - I merely wish to show by illustration how the constituencies of country members suffer by the increased expenditure by administrative Departments, while the expenditure on absolutely necessary and reproductive works is reduced to vanishing point. Prime Minister's Department has been built up because of the various utilities that have been undertaken by the Commonwealth during the last two or three years.",35
109,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The honourable member cannot discuss that matter now.,36
110,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am merely endeavouring, by illustration, to show how the country is suffering by reason of this curtailment of new works, in the face of increased expenditure in some of the administrative Departments. For in stance, in the Treasury the expenditure has increased from £217,000 in 1914 t "" £507,000 in 1918. ' The CHAIRMAN - The honourable member will have an opportunity later on to discuss these matters on the Estimates. If I permit him to continue on his present lines, other honourable members will claim the same right.",36
111,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I have no desire to go into a full discussion of the expenditure of the administrative Departments; but it is only fair that I should be per- mitted to give two or three instances by way of illustrations.,36
112,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable, member would not be out of order in alluding to these matters, but he is now discussing them in detail.",36
113,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I only desire to mention one or two. The expenditure of the Department of Home and Territories has increased from £169,000 to £203,000 ; of Trade and Customs, from £551,000 to £711,000 ; and on the Northern Territory, fro m £417,000. to £436,000. The expenditure in these and in quite a number of other Departments clearly shows'* that those responsible have not a due appreciation of perspective^ and have failed to apportion adequate amounts in directions likely to be of the greatest u t i l it y and benefit. I know that there are many works that might easily be postponed or cancelled. I have asked the Minister questions in regard to the cost of certain works at Canberra-the construction of a bridge and the running of a railway into the Capital City.",36
114,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,=That work was done some time. ago - It is not provided for on these Estimates.,36
115,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I do not blame all the present Ministers for the huge in The creased expenditure, and I will not say that Ministers could not give satisfactory replies in regard to the expenditure on some items to which criticism might be directed. But to illustrate what has been taking place during the war period, I will quote the expenditure on the Federal Capital. The Public Works Committee investigated f u l ly the lay-out of the Federal Capital site, the proposed creation of certain ornamental waters, and the construction of railways. The Committee reported against the making of lakes to conserve water for ornamental purposes for an indefinite period, probably twenty years, but no sooner was the report submittedthan expenditure was illegally Commenced in constructing the banks for the ornamental waters.",36
116,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That is not being done now.,36
117,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am merely illustrating how illegal expenditure is . in curred, and how this Parliament has no opportunity ofi reviewing the disbursement of money drawn from the pockets of the taxpayers under different taxation Statutes.",36
118,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"When was that work done ? * Mr SAMPSON - Not during the last twelve months. A f t e r the fullesti n vestigation the Public ""Works Committee recommended that a temporary railway should be built through the centre of the Capital only if _ the building - operations were to be proceeded with. The stoppage of building operations rendered the railway absolutely unnecessary; - yet, notwithstanding that fact, and in defiance of the Public Works Committee, the Director of Construction and Design, acting under the authority of a former Minister for Home Affairs, has started the construction of - a railway in accordance with his original plan. That expenditure is quite illegal.",36
119,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Is it continuing now? Mr GROOM.;-No .,36
120,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The sumof £5>00Q resources is provided' on these Estimates for completion of the railway.,37
121,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member is quite wrong. Nothing, like that sum will be required to. complete the line.",37
122,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"A further £5,000 provided for preservative works. The' people ? Minister should obtain at once a report on the railway project in order to satisfy himself that it is not absolutely unnecesfrom sary.",37

T know that all the money is not for new works, but I tend that a large reduction of expendiinstead ture might be made if a thorough inquiry were made with a view to setting aside any work that is not necessary for the preservation of undertakings already commenced, many of which ought never to have been started, and will not be of value for many years, even if the construction of the Capita] is proceeded with. In regard to the Northern Territory, we should hear a statement as to the results nf the boring operations) the quality of dealt with. water that has been Struck, and the valueit is likely to be in the development country; also as to what extent the new railway that has been constructed is a ing proposition, and how much stock it carried to the freezing works; and, rally, what progress is being made in the settlement of the Territory as 'the result of our huge expenditure there. The same expenditure continues year after year, without any definite policy that will place one additional person upon the land. There is no reasonable chanGe of any velopment of the agricultural or mineral of the Territory: under existing thecircumstances; I have always held; that a huge expenditure on public works in the Territory will be necessary before there will be any inducement>for people to settle, on the land. is.

128,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The Administrasends his own family south every year.,37
129,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I do not propose to discuss the-White Australia policy^at this to stage. We have in the Territory an areaunof 520,000 square miles, and unless we can expend huge sums of money on a developmental policy all our administrative expenditure is wasted. When it is impossible for us, during the war, to expend money on a big public works policy that like will result in settling people on the land at and developing the mineral resources of the Territory, it is the duty of Parliament to reduce the adminiscontrative expenses to a minimum. But, of a reduction, we find that there has been an increase in administrativecosts during the last three years. I am sorry that the Estimates are before us in a piece-meal fashion. This any Committee should have an opportunity to ""discuss the whole question of finance as disclosed in the Budget.",37
130,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The Committee will have that opportunity after this measure is Mr SAMPSON.r- I know that, but at of the a time when we are spendingbetween £80,000,000 and £90,000,000 in. connection paywith the war, and when the ordinary exhas penditure is increasingby leaps and genebounds, the Committee should have an opportunity of discussing the whole matter of receipts and expenditure as detailed in the Budget speech, and we should also have an early opportunity of dealing with the ordinary Estimates, so that we might cut down certain forms of expenditure, in deorder to make money available for expenditure on new works that would encourage the opening: up of the country. In connection with Australia House, for instance, we are asked' to .vote inoney for a buildingthat has already cost something like iEljOOOjOOO, and requires a large annual expendituref o r upkeep. At the same time, all the State Agencies-General are carrying on and expending money in the same lavish way as before the war. Inconnexion with Australia's representation abroad, there is three or four times theexpenditure that is necessary, and, notwithstanding that we are in the fifth year of war, no effort at curtailment has been made. I ask the Minister if it is. not possible for him to make a statement as to what negotiations have taken place between the Commonwealth and the States with a view to a reduction of expenditure in connection with Australia's-representation abroad. The Commonwealth Government have had ample opportunity to bring pressure* to bear on the various State Governments in order to bring about an amalgamation of the various departments of representation in London, and the housing of them all within theone building that has cost the Commonwealth so much money. We know the Commonwealth has advanced money to all but one of the State Governments for the carrying out of their public works policy; That arrangement should have been entered into cordially by every State Government ;: unfOTtunately., theNew South Wales Government rebelled. . Mr MCGRATH - I may tell the honourable member that there, are hardly any Australians' employed in our agencies in London. Mr SAMPSON. I am surprised to hear that. During the war the Commonwealth has had ample opportunity to enter into negotiations with the State Governments to reduce the expenditure in Loudon,, and. because of the financial stringency they could have brought pressure to. bear on them in order to compel them to come to terms in regard to this very necessary reform. The Committee is entitled to know, in what respect and to what extent there isa duplication of Commonwealth and State services-. ""We know that there is a duplication in the Taxation, Statistical and Electoral. Departments, and also in connection with, the Savings Bank. The Commonwealth and the States operate .rival institutions-; this means increased administrative expense and: a heavier burden on. the taxpayer*. The war period has. beem the most opportune of all times in our history for compelling the States to come, to terms with the Commonwealth in. the. interests of economy. I hope that the Minister will, be able to enlighten the Committee to a greater extent than hehasdone sof a r in regard to these Estimates as to the extent to which there is duplication of Commonwealth and State services, and the possibilities of a reduction of expenditure in the various administrative Departments and also as to a; greaterextension in country districts of. interest-paying: works.  there is one thing more than another that the Committee should do during ' this strenuous time of war, it is to economize as much as possible. But as a Queensland representative, I object to the economy being exercised at the expense of Queensland, and for the benefit of Victoria and New South. Wales. I . suppose that the revenue of Queensland is not more than half that of Victoria, yet in these strenuous.times expenditure in Victoria amounting to tens of thousands of pounds is proposed, whilst the expenditure in Queensland is to be reduced to £1,700. Is there any fairness in that? If there is to be economy, l e t it be applied all round, and I , as *a Queensland member, will not complain. But I do complain when the Governmentcut off al} our reproductive services. Por years we have been promised telephone communication between Charleville and Brisbane. We were told that provision for it would appear in these Estimates, yet in them. I do not find any reference to it . Charleville, which is in the south-west of Queensland, is' an i m portant centre for cattle sales. It is situated on.the principal stock route from the Gulf country and the Peninsula to New South Wales and Victoria. The whole of the expenditure upon these Estimates f b r new works and buildings in Queensland amounts to £1,700.",37

135,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"In connection with that item, there is a re-vote of £2,399, representing the unexpended balance of the preliminary amount authorized last year, and £15,79 1 is the amount which is necessary to complete the building.  tion because when I get back to Queensland my constituents will ask me why so much money has been spent in Melbourne and Sydney, while Queensland cannot get the services it needs. There is another item of expenditure in Victoria, in which £21,170 is asked for the erection of a new building and the re-modelling of the old Parcels Post building for a telegraph operating room.",39
136,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That is a work which is essential for the. conduct of the Department  time ?,39

139,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I doubt whether the Commonwealth .has the power to enforce that prohibition against the State Governments.  State Governments to fight out. While the Treasurer issues this warning, the Commonwealth Government are prepared to spend £21,170 upon the erection of a new telegraph operating room in Melbourne. .1 do not think that is a fair propositon. The Government should economize all round. Until the new building of the Institute of Science and Industry is erected, what do the Government propose to do with the staff? Last year we voted £6,00 0 for this Institute, and this year we are asked to vote £20,000 for it , when every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth is .as heavily taxed as possible, and in the face of the Treasurer's declaration that the burden must be still further increased, the Government come down with a proposal for the creation of a new Department. They preach economy, and yet they throw their money about in this reckless manner. .The honourable member for W i m mera (Mr Sampson) has referred to the growth of Departments. We have as many civil servants now as there are-blowflies in the sheep of Queensland, and if we proceed with the establishment of a Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry, I suppose there wil l be moreexperts to deal with the blow-flies or cane beetles than there are blow-flies or cane beetles to be dealt with. If the Government will not take a pull, the House should compel them to do so. We all know that our Customs Houses are working at very low pressure; in fact, so far as some Queensland ports are concerned, at no pressure at all. Yet we still maintain the Customs staffs which"" were necessary in busy times. Economy could be effected in that direction, and if the Public Service Commissioner will not do it the House should take the matter in hand. '  a Government servant.  get r i d of Government servants, but we can ref use to pass their salaries. In 1884, when Sir Thomas MCHwraith was Premier of Queensland, he sent for the heads of the Departments, and told them what he expected the revenue would yield, and asked them to cut down. their expenditure in order to bring it below that figure. They spent a week upon the task, and returned to him with estimates of expenditure showing a reduction of some £8,000 or £9,000. He said to them, "" Has it taken you all that time to hatch out that much 1 I will show you what to do with it . "" Thereupon he took his pen, and ran it through the items providing the salaries for the heads of the Departments. .In this way he saved at least £80,000. When these gentlemen found that they were likely to lose their they very soon came along with a supplementary recommendation acquiescing in what the Premier required. That is what this House should do with some of these Departments that are growing so quickly. How many , times have we heard Ministers come down to the House in the earlier days of this Parliament saying that they desired the establishment of such and such a Department, which, they pointed out, would not cost more than £4,000 or £5,000 per annum.? In my foolishness I have acquiesced and agreed to vote the necessary money. But what did we find? For a Department requiring £5,000 in the first year, double that amount was required in the next year, treble the amount in the t h i r d year, and then eight times the amount in the fourth year. It will probably be found to require £500,000 at the present time. These Departments get what they ask for, and they are still growing. Surely the Government, instead of establishing an Institute of Science and Industry in war time, should practice a littl e of the economy that they are asking the public and the State Governments to observe. Por many years past the Queensland Government have done good work in the direction of tackling the prickly pear and Texas fever problems. They have sent experts to. America, and obtained all the information it was possible to gain. They are still battling against the ravages of the blow-fly pest, and I understand that in some of the districts it is being overcome. Why is it necessary in war time to duplicate the machinery already in existence'? I suppose that the proposal will be to quadruple it in peace time. It is all very well to do this sort of thing if one has certain friends he wishes to put into good positions, but once a Department is established, there are sub-Departments created immediately, and they grow and grow. I should like to know how many clerks, senior clerks, accountants, and other officers there are to be in the Bureau of Science and Industry. If the vote is in creased from £6,000 to £20,000, they will all have a right royal time for the next twelve months. Officers have been pere- grinating about Australia, but what they have done .no one knows. A private employer who sends out a traveller on his business requires from him statements about what he is doing. billets, Mr Rodgers.^-We might as well have a full-dress debate on the Bureau _ of Science and Industry and the trade and commerce proposals.  The Bill providing for the Institute of Science and Industry is still before the Senate, and may remain there for a long time. :",39
140,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Does the honourable member suggest that Government Depart- . ments should be run on business principles ?  Government has no time for those who will run ' Departments economically and on business lines. A private employer-"" offers his"" manager a bonus on the reduction of his working expenses without im pairment of efficiency, but a Government does the reverse. It says to an officer, "" The bigger the staff you get together, the larger will be your screw.""",40
141,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member is a piece-work advocate.  work if I could get piece-work; but if the piece-work system were applied to Government employment, there would be a great number of public servants out of work. "" I ask the Minister to ascertain why the same staff is being employed in Queensland . in the Customs Department how as was employed prior to the war. They are getting outsiders"" into the Bureau of Science. In Brisbane, they are tumbling over one another to get into these cosy berths, where they can sleep like a lizard in a log, coming out to sun themselves in fine weather. We shall hear of them only when they are drawing their screws. In Queensland- I speak of that State only-ther e is a duplication of machinery. Until recently there .was a botanist from the Melbourne University there, Dr Jean White, but she discontinued her investigations of the prickly-pear pest to get married. The Government .has an opportunity now such as it :never had before, and will never have again. Under the War Precautions Act it can do anything that it likes. The honourable' member for W i mmera (Mr Sampson) referred to the duplication of Commonwealth and State Departments. There is too much duplication. A great deal could be saved by amalgamating the Taxation Departments of the Commonwealth and the States. Mr TUDOR, - A million and a .half.  vernment should compel the Governments to consent to the necessary - amalgamations.",40
142,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It could do so only for the duration of the war.  how .satisfactory the - arrangement was, they would not give it up. The Electoral Departments should be amalgamated, and so should many others. I am willing, to give the Government every assistance in saving money, even though the State authorities may"" not always concur. We ar.e asking the people to economize,, and we should set them an example. In stead of doing so, we are at present spending money wholesale. The sum of £16,000 is set down for erecting a new building and remodelling the old parcelpost building in Melbourne. Surely that work could wait u n t i l after the war. Then there is the new Postal Institute, for the opening of which the Postmaster General composed a set of verses. They get all the good things in the cities; the people in the bush are treated very differently from the city populations. But while T favour economy, I feel that reproductive expenditure must hot be stopped,, and that the public conveniences must be maintained. I have been told on reliable authority that in Queensland --and doubtless what happens there hap236ns in the other States, too - every trunk telephone line pays handsomely.",41
143,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Until recently the venue fro m the country telephone lines was making good the deficiency on the city telephone lines.  Melbourne line. Economy should be carried out properly. The saving should not be all at the expense of those out back. The pastoral and agricultural interests are the backbone of our prosperity, yet when people in the country ask for postal and telephonic services they are met with obstacles, although telephone extensions and the like are readily granted in the big cities, where the telephone is used as much for the discussion of social' affairs as for the transaction of business. Those in the country deserve more consideration, and the Postmaster-General (Mr Webster), as a country representative, knows their needs, but he is the worse Postmaster-General that we have ever had.",41

I cannot 'take advantage of this opportunity to make any general remarks; that will be possible on another occasion; but I wish to direct attention to an item which should be .carefully scrutinized. It , is that in which £3,000 is provided for re- the establishment and equipment of research divisions, laboratories, and experiment stations in connection' with the Institute of Science and Industry. This is a new item. It has not appeared in this particular form before; but last year there was expended a sum of £6,961 under the camouflage of "" Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry, in cluding expenses of Advisory - Council pending <establishment of permanent Institute."" In regard to salaries, contingencies, and other items, a sum of practically £7,000 was expended. Fortunately, this Advisory which managed so successfully toexpend that sum of money, has furnished a report, and that report has indicated to all practical industrialists and to the business men of the. community that the money was absolutely thrown, a-way. wish to make any personal reflection upon the University professors who are associated with the Advisory Council: They are all eminent academicians in their own particular sphere, but on the subject of practical, scientific research and assistance to industry they have failed.",41
151,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMMONWEALTH BANK,And always will.,42
152,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"No doubt. That being so, when the. Government come down, with a. proposal that this Advisory Council shall be granted this year £20,000 to continue a work which represents so much waste of money, I , for one, must strenuously oppose the granting of any such sum. The money could be expended to infinitely greater advantage in. other directions. If the Institute of Science and' Industry is established, I take it that the Advisory Council will be swept aside. The fact remains, however,, that we have on the general. Estimates an. item of £2.0,000 in respect of: the A d visory Council, and on these Estimates one of £3,000 for the Institute ofScience and Industry. We should have from the Government an assurance that if the In stitute is established the item of £20,000 in respect of the Advisory Council will not be expended. If , on the other hand, the Hpuse, in its wisdom, does not see f it to pas3 the Bill providing for the establishment of theInstitute, then the £3,000 that we are asked to vote here in respect of it should not be expended by the A d visory Council.",42
153,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"If that BOl carried the proposed vote of £3,000 will lapse, so far as works and buildings are concerned.",42

I hope the idea of the Government is that the Instituteshall co-ordinate the work of the various State scientific institutions.

162,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Brisbane) [5.28] It is not my intention; to repeat the arguments of honourable members who haye preceded me with regard to the proposed votes for new works and buildings. My is not complaint takes quite another form. I do not approve of a reduction in the- amount of money being expended or preposed to beexpended on public works. It is unwise to economize in the expenditure of money providing for the employment of men, and for the development of the country. The so-called economy proposed by the Government in connection with, the Works. Estimates this year amounts to only £170,000. Last year,, although a sum of £1,257,000 was voted for new works and buildings, the actual expenditure amounted to only £625,000. : The estimated expenditure this year is £454,951 , which-is about one-third of the estimate ior last year, and the difference between the estimated expenditure for this year and the actual expenditure for last year is, roughly, £170,000. I do not think it is wise economy. That economy is needed is freely and frankly admitted.. Economy, however, is required in respect not of those things which make for the employment of the people and the development of the country, but of Government luxuries that we can' do without.",42
163,Mr FALKINER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,What works ?,43
164,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"There are not many works that we can afford to do without. It would be unfortunate if we adopted the principle of economizing by stopping the work of the country. There has been circulated today a new regulation under the War Precautions Act which provides that, It shall not be lawful for any person, firm, company, society, club, association, or organ, ization, or any Public Department 'of a State, or *any authority constituted under the law of a State, to undertake,- without the written consent of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, the construction or erection of any(a) tramway or tramway building or office; (6) market or market building; - (o) building to be used for a club, library, art gallery, school of art, institute, museum, or exhibition of animals; (d) hall or building to the owned or controlled by a friendly society society, association, or organization; (e) church or building to be owned or controlled by an organization connected with a church the cost of which exceeds £1,000; (f) building in which intoxicating liquors are to be sold; or (g) additions or alterations, involving an expenditure"" exceeding £250, to a work or building of any of the classes specified in this regulation. That is a very drastic regulation. means that the Treasurer can veto building operations carried on throughout the Commonwealth, not only by the Federal Government,' but by the States, as well as private individuals, municipalities, and associations. Even private individuals - might be interfered with in the erection of homes. We daily have evidence in the newspapers that building particularly in the direction of private. homes for the peojale, are very necessary.",43
165,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,In what regulation is there any reference to the building of homes.? *,43
166,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I want a declaration from the Government as to whether or not this regulation would prevent the construction of homes. Building operations throughout Australia should not be interfered with unless there are very satisfactory reasons for doing so. At the present time such operations are being penalized to a very serious extent. No individual would readily undertake the expenditure of money on building at the present time, the cost of labour and are they- material, particularly ironmongery, .being very high. Here, however, is a ""regulation which practically puts a stop to building operations throughout Australia.",43
167,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The regulation does not include homes'.,43
168,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It seems to prevent any person spending more than £250 on any building or alterations without the consent of the Treasurer. It is proposed to reduce the expenditure on works to the extent of £170,000 this year, and to prevent expenditure on building operations by private individuals; indeed, the Government are even proposing to interfere with the right of the States to carry out such works. That is economy of the - wrong kind. In tha Estimates area number of items on which, I think, we can economize, and I hope to have the opmechanics' portunity of showing where economy can be. exercised. There is no doubt that economy must be exercised, but my conor other tention is that economy at the expense of the work of the country is false economy-that it will not help us to meet our .obligations, but, rather, make us less able to carry on the affairs of the country. Another complaint, already voiced, in part by the honourable member for Mara to the Postal Department. Out of a total It vote of £78,664 it is proposed to vote for postal buildings. in New South Wales £22,598, and in Victoria £46,902.",43

Queens land and the other States will always be at a disadvantage so long as the Seat of Government is situated in Melbourne. «- New South Wales may be at a less dist advantage than other States, but it is at a disadvantage under the circumstances. country districts of Australia will not get that consideration to which they are entitled in regard to buildings, or any1 thing else, so long as the Parliament has We Melbourne as its head-quarters, and the to sooner we get to Canberra the better it been - Mr GROOM - The honourable member of asked the question whether the building postregulation applied to the building of is homes.

175,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am glad to have that assurance. I was hopeful that this Government did not intend to stop building operations, especially so far as regards r . homes, because that would be most unfortunate at the present juncture. In pursuance of my argument that it is false economy to cut down expenditure on buildings, I desire to refer to one item of expenditure out of loan.",44
176,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am afraid I cannot answer any questions regarding, that on",44
177,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I merely wish to make a passing reference. The item of of expenditure to which I refer is that of the to Acetate of Lime Factory at Bulimba. is not in my electorate, so I am not looking at the matter from any personal that point of view. I happen to know that, ui the production of acetate of lime from there are various by-products considerable value, particularly at the . present time.

On another occasion, when passing the Factory on a steamer in company with some other visitors from, the south, I called their attention to the .good work there displayed. I am certain that no more satisfactory job has been turned out by any 'Commonwealth or State Public Works Department.",44

181,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I cannot give any figures; I should be very glad to know the facts. However, the brick and wood work is a credit to the Works and Railways Department. I do not know who the supervisor was. I .am told that, one by-product that is escaping just now is alcohol, that would be eminently useful for power purposes. We are faced with the fact that power alcohol is increasingly in demand, and has, as a fact, revolutionized transportation, not only by road and river, but by rail and in the air. It will be seen that we have to develop our resources of power alcohol, and, as T. have said, I <amo formed that immense quantities are escaping at the present time from this Factory.",45
182,Mr HECJTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALTH BANK,-Is the wasted?,45
183,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It was, some time ago. I am told that the expenditure necessary to effect the saving would be very light; and Tf by some addition to the amount provided in the Estimates we can secure at least this one by-product, a very satisfactory advantage will have .been gained.",45
184,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The alcohol can be obtained, ""but it cannot be denatured.",45
185,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The extraction of this alcohol, properly denatured-so as to make it useful for commercial purposes, opens up a .field of exploitation of immense, advantage to the Commonwealth.

But until provision is made for the ex-, traction of them we shall be deprived of this advantage. I wish to impress upon the Government the necessity for paying attention to this matter. ' Can the Minister advise the Committee as to whether any progress is being made with the establishment of cement works at Fairy Meadow? Some time ago the Public Works Committee reported favourably upon the proposal to °* construct at that place a factory for the manufacture of cement for Commonwealth purposes. An area of about 56 acres was acquired, and an additional area of 250 acres was recommended for subsequent purchase. On the Loan Estimates appears an item of £8,138 for-the purchase of land at Pairy Meadow. I am aware that there is difficulty in getting machinery at the present time, especially the special class of machinery required for 'the manufacturing process recommended for this factory. I do not know whether any further steps are being taken in this matter, whether the machinery is on order or whether the in - Government expect to place an order. But from what we know of - the possibilities - of the construction of ""buildings in reinforced concrete, the time is approachalcohol ing when an immense'quantity of cement will be required for future operations, and the Commonwealth can, by the erection of the cement factory, at Fairy Meadow, secure to .itself a very satisfactory and almost unlimited supply of cement for. its own purposes, and at the same time save considerably on the present prices.",45
186,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The Government may have the same experience at Fairy Mea-dow as they had in regard to the shale deposits on which the brick kilns at Canberra were erected.,45

188,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Perth) [5.54=] - At the present time the Government cannot he too drastic in cutting down expenditure sq_ long as the cutting down is done in - the right places. To my mind it is most remarkable and regrettable that the Government .seem to have applied their energies in that regard in quite the wrong way. I agree with the honourable members who have deprecated the swelling of our already numerous army of civil servants; indeed, if the increase sontinues at the present rate it will he difficult find any adult member of the community who is not a civil servant.  member advocate the wholesale dismissal of those men.?  such panic legislation or administration. We have no right to cut down the normal staff, but I do protest most vigorously against the creation of a new and altogether abnormal staff in the present circumstances of the country.  member realise that a large number of the increases have been absolutely necessary ?",46
189,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"There is no doubt that certain increases are due to war activities, and are absolutely necessary. I have no objection to them.  must realise, also, that by reason of Arbitration Oourt decisions and ordinary increments which would not be stopped in any case, - the amount we .have to pay in salaries has been increased considerably since 1914.",46
190,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I quite realise those circumstances, but others have been created by the Ministry which, I think, run us int o a very considerable amount of expenditure that could very well be obviated. However, the point T rose to speak upon was the cutting down of expenditure that would show a profit. It is most remarkable that in instances where a profit could be shown the Governmentshould refrain from spending money, and, indeed, take.a course of action that ordinary common sense and business principles would show to be entirely 'wrong. I agree with the honourable members who 'have urged the - necessity for developing those services to the community - that are especially included - within the activities of the Postmaster-'General's Department. But whilst I agree that a considerable amount of attention should be given to the country districts, there is a great possibility of profitable expenditure, even within the cities.. To mention one in stance, the Commonwealth has been erecting a new General Post Office in the city of Perth. The building has been urgently required for many years, and is being rapidly brought to the stage at which it will be able to give effective service to the community. But the Government are stopping short of the completo tion of the building, and it is undoubtedly a mistake to do that when the officials of the Department have already shown that the further expenditure honourable would be likely to return a profit. Two more stories must be added to complete the building. - Mr BAMFORD - Are they included in the present contract?",46
191,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"No , but it has been shown by the officers of the Department that the building of those extra stories would be a profitable investment for the Government.",46
192,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That idea is exploded now, because the State has refused to acquiesce in the proposal.",46
193,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,There are other tenants who could have occupied . the space that would not be required immediately by the Commonwealth at quite as profitable a rent as would have been paid by the State Government.,46
194,Mr HECTOR LAMOTTD,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member does ""not advocate building for letting purposes.",46
195,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Not in ordinary circumstances; but on this building a temporary 'roof will be placed, and all the Wilding'material and conveniences at present there will be removed. In the course of a few years that roof will require to be taken off, and the two additional stories added. Surely the Department is adopting a most unbusiness-like attitude. I feel sure that if the expenditure fhat is required to complete the building were undertaken it would give a profitable return to the Commonwealth. . When one notices the many remarkable directions in which money is being lavished at - the present time, I think the completion of a building which has been in hand for some years is a reasonable proposition in any circumstances; and it is especially reasonable in this case, because the proposition is one that would be financially profitable to the Government.",46
196,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Dampier) [6.2] - I do not propose to delay the Committee long, because we shall have an opportunity, when dealing - with the Loan Estimates, to go more fully into the expenditure incurred by the Government on many projects. The items shown on the Estimates now before the Committee are fairly small, but some amounts are provided for naval works, the Federal Capital, and the Institute of Science and In dustry. I do not object to the last named project, because the reply given by the Minister to the (honourable, member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) is satisfactory to me. I hope that, when the Bill conies before the House, we shall have ample opportunity to discuss the project fully. It is well to try on every occasion to point out extravagances, in order that they may be obviated in the future. I have in my hands a photograph of some' filling . work that was done in connection with one of the avenues at Canberra. I think that, when the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) was Minister for Home Affairs, he stopped that work, and only a small amount of money is provided on the Estimates now before us for preservative-works in the district. I wish honourable members to realise, however, to what projects the country is being committed. This avenue is one of about a dozen to be constructed in connection with the formation of the Capital city. The photograph shows an embankment about 25 feet high, and, although the avenue is only 40 feet wide at present, it is ultimately to be 200 feet wide, and, approximately, 1,000 feet long. Then, of course, the country on both sides must be filled up; in fact, mountains must be levelled down to fill up the valley.",47
197,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Does the honourable ber propose to have that photograph put in Hansard?,47
198,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I do not think that the Minister will get the censor to again, as happened in - the case of my speech of Friday last.",47
199,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"""Was the honourable memof ber's speech 'censored in Hansard?",47
200,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"No ; but it was m the press. However, I intend to persist in what I am saying, and I take this portunity of pointing out the enormous expenditure that is ahead of us, and necessity for the House exercising greatest care before it passes Estimates which make provision for it. Two years ago, when the Public Works Committee was investigating the proposal to build an Arsenal in the Federal Territory, the departmental engineers estimated' that it would cost £25,000 to build a railway to the site. To-day the estimate for building that railway is £62,000.",47
201,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Is not the site different?,47
202,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"If a man in business proposed to build a factory, and engaged an engineer to pick out a good site and estimate the cost of establishing railway communication with it, what would ihe think of an engineer who, after first estimating that a railway to the site would cost £25,000, revised his figures two years later and said, "" We cannot build the - railway from that spot; we must build one 4 or 5 miles further away "" ? Surely Government officials should work exactly as do men working for private individuals.",47
203,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Was the estimate of £25,000 for a railway to the Tuggeranong site?",47
204,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yes ; but the engineers now find that, on account of the grades, the railway cannot follow the route upon which they submitted that estimate. They should have ascertained that before. Something in the nature of an inspired paragraph appeared in the Argus on Tuesday in regard to the maintenance of work at the Small Arms Factory, Lithgow. There is provision on these"" Estimates for works in connection with that Factory, and I wish to repeat what I said the other day in regard to what I can only term a scandal-the fact that after four years of war it is only within the last six memor seven months that the establishment has produced the mark 7, Imperial service rifle, and has never produced a machine gun or a shell. However, we are not permitted to talk about these things. We work should have an Arsenal capable of producing rifles and guns as well as private enterprise can turn them out, but the cry secrecy is always raised when one endeavours to talk about these questionsThe ostensible object is to prevent knowledge of our operations reaching a foreign opPower, but that foreign Power knows perfectly well what we are doing, and it is the absurd to think that we can keep those the operations secret. We are told that we are not to know the number of men who are employed, otherwise a foreign Power will know what we are doing. Of course, there may be certain processes and certain features about the work of an Arsenal that we ought to keep wholly to ourselves, but we should be in formed as to the real facts concerning the output of an establishment such - as the Small Arms Factory is. It will help people to realise that, so far, Australia has not done its duty in these matters. We have been promised time after time that a balance-sheet of the operations of the Small Arms Factory would be prepared to enable ' honourable members to ascertain whether decent work was being carried out in that establishment, but we cannot get the information. Is it due to the fact that - officials in the Department cannot prepare one? According to the Budget papers, the expenditure on the Factory last year was £342,701. That is not capital expenditure. It merely represents the working expenses of the estab-lishment. The receipts are put down at £309,000. I do not believe that 30,000 rifles were produced last year; but, assuming that number to be the output, it gives an average of about £ 1 0 per rifle, whereas when Parliament was first in duced to agree to the building of the Factory it was said that working under Australian conditions rifles could be produced for £ 3 9s. I d . each. From what I can gather, they cost anything from £11 to £ 1 3 per rifle in the first couple of years after the Factory commenced operations. I have been able to secure information that 'has not been available to many other honourable members. honourable member for Herbert (Mr . Bamford), the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), and the honourable member for - Franklin MCWilliams) were taken into my confidence, and helped me to approach the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce). The result was that an inspector was sent to the Small Arms Factory, and there was a big improvement in the work turned out there; but it has to . be realized that the Minister for Defence, who appoints this inspector, also controls the Factory. I am sure that we would get far better work done and far better value for our money if similar establishments were removed from the control of the Minister for Defence. The Defence Department could give instructions as to the class of small arms or munitions it required, and the order could go to a Factory under the control of some other Minister. The trouble with the present system is that if an inspector begins to find faul t with the management of a Factory or with the class of goods produced in the establishment, he is lodging complaints against the administration of his own Minister. The .Defence Department would be better served if the control of these, factories could be transferred to some other M in ister. We shall deal more full y with the work which is being carried out - at the Naval' Bases and at Cockatoo Island when we are discussing the loan Estimates, but the Minister should make inquiries into certain ' matters in connection with these works. Altogether £720,000 has been spent on the Henderson Naval Base, in cluding £120,000 for land purchase. Would the Minister for Defence, who has recently paid a visit to the Base, dare to defend the expenditure of £600,000 on the work which can be shown to have been carried out there? The Public Works Committee, which inquired into portion of the work at Cockburn Sound,- pointed out that the reclamation work, certain parts of which were simply a matter of blowing down limestone and sifting sand, was costing more per cubic yard than the Eremantle Harbor Works, under exactly the same day labour system, were paying, although they had to blast rock, dredge it , and dump it into the sea 4 miles out. The The Public Works Committee recommended that unless the Government could employ large steam navvies in sufficientquantity- I think about a dozen were re(Mr quired-the work ought to have been stopped.",47
205,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Thos e machines have been ordered, and some of them are now on the way from America.",48
206,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am glad to hear it. The way in which work is being carried out is no credit to the departmental engineer. I have very high regard for Mr Settle, who has recently been appointed to take charge of that work. He is keenly desirous of doing his work well and economically, but he cannot do it unless he is provided with the proper class of machinery. I suggest the stoppage of these works, more^ particularly when there are so many young fellows here who ought to be away. cause some o£ them to starve or clear out of the country. If the Government had adopted the-policy that President Wilson pursued, many men like the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) would have had to do so. It would have been a good thing for Australia, and more to its honour. MT. CONSIDINE - I am pleased to one of President Wilson's new converts.",48
207,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"He' "" converted me ""the moment he followed that policy after the war broke out, and I am sorry that the honourable member was not livin g in America at the time. I am sorry that our Government, instead of going to the country and asking for the power which they knew was absolutely essential for them to have for the sake of the honour of Australia, did not pursue the policy which President Wilson adopted. I am very much afrai d these extravagances to which I have drawn attention are likely to continue. According to the Budget statement, £1,122,000 has been spent on the Cockatoo Island dockyard. All thishuge expenditure is proceeding year after year. The Public Accounts Committee has drawn, attention to its extravagance-. Later, another Committee reports,, and this is what it said in regard to the cruiser BrisbaneAt the date of. transfer of the Cockatoo Island establishment from the New South Wales Government, H.M-.A.S. Brisbane was in course of construction, and it was stated that the sum of £30,000 had already been expended. Although the Brisbane was commissioned on 31st October, 1910, the accountant at the island hae only within the last month been able to arrive at the. approximate cost, which is now stated to be £.746,459. Obviously this does not include the full cost of the ship to the Commonwealth, as no charge has been included either for depreciation of plant or for interest on capital. We have ascertained that a ship similarly fitted could, at that time have been purchased from the. Admiralty for £331,000. The Brisbane has cost 100 per"" cent, more to. build on Cockatoo Island than she could have been purchased for-that 100 per cent, more without . any charge for interest or depreciation. These matters will come up again for decent order. discussion on the Loan Estimates, and the Ministry should then' be prepared to tell honourable members what reforms they propose. We should be given the absolute, assurance that ' all GovernI t would ment trading concerns shall be debited with - interest on outlay, depreciation, and the other ordinary and proper overbead charges of such establishments, so that fair and eciuitable comparisons may be possible. However ugly the facts may be, we should know them. We should know exactly what it costs us to build our war-ships and to manufacture the various things that we axe making. I hope that see when the Loan proposals are before us the Government will submit a clear and definite scheme for dealing with our trading concerns, and that we shall be told what it is proposed to do with those who are responsible for the very serious losses that have occurred in the past.

215,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Melbourne Ports) [7.47] - Althoug h a representative of a city constituency, I believe that the telephone facilities provided for country districts are not what they ought to be. Whenever I visit a country district I , in common with other representatives of city divisions, am charged with being unmindf u l of country interests. This complaint, however; is not well founded. City members are willing that the best possible telephone facilities should be provided for rural districts since the telephone is one of the absolute necessities of modern civilization. I appreciate the desire of the Postal Department that the telephone service should pay; but I fail to see why it should be expected to yield a profit. The provision of adequate telephone facilities incountry districts is of greater concern than the making of a profit.",50
216,Mr WEBSTEK,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Does the honourable member know that we are already bearing 60 per cent, of the loss on many country telephone lines?",50

219,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The metropolitan service. It finds money to subsidize country services.,50
220,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I accept the Postmaster-General's statement; but even a casual visitor to a country district will [252] recognise that increased telephone facilities are necessaiy. Country residents are not allowed to provide a service which they think would be sufficient for their requirements; they must conform to a Departmental condition.,50
221,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"But for those conditions lines might be erected which would not give the expected service-, and endless trouble would arise.",50
222,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"W h i l e that may be so, country people would be satisfied with a service that did not come up to the maximum requirements of the Department. Newspapers voice the cry that we hear, in rural districts, that our public expenditure is, for the most part, for the benefit of city constituencies. The Postal Institute, which was opened yesterday, will undoubtedly improve the service, but in connection with that and many other outlays, we are charged - with catering for city - requirements, and overlooking country wants. I should certainly like a better telephone service to be provided for country residents. I am well aware that the Postmaster-General, who is himself a representative of a rural division, has given this matter consideration; but I hope he will look into it further. Many city residents who complain of a slight increase in the telephone charges would be prepared to double the present rate rather than be deprived of the service, and if the telephone is absolutely necessary in the closely-populated metropolitan areas, how much more necessary must it be in scattered country districts? The telephone today in every country is an actual necessity of civilization, and I think the Postmaster-General, in the very near future, should ask the Treasurer to provide him with more money with which to extend the telephone service in .country districts.  for failing to give the Postmaster-General the money he wants.",50
223,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I admit it .,50
224,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The newspapers from time to time publish statements so. about the waste of public money here and there, and are pleased to refer to the present Administration as ""a spendt h r if t Government."" They compare the expenditure over a period of two or three years, with the object of showing how greatly it has increased, but they do not show the increased services which the people have obtained as the result of this additional expenditure. The Governdown ment ought not to be afraid of newspaper attacks, but should push on boldly with country telephone extensions.",50
225,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Eve n if I had money for such work I could not go on with it at present, since we cannot obtain the material.",51
226,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I hope that during the next twelve months the whole quesin tion of country telephone extensions will be carefully considered. My experience is that honourable members who represent city constituencies are not unmindful the needs of country residents, and hope that the Postmaster-General will hang. see that in the near future there is a more liberal extension of the telephone service in country districts.",51
227,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Hindmarsh) [7.55]. - There is a good deal of force in the views expressed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (MT . Mathews), there can be no doubt that greater conthis sideration should be given to the requireit ments of rural districts. On every hand there is a demand for economy, and rule the general public are outdone in this cry by members of Parliament. Last year £399,000 was appropriated for "" telegraphs and telephones,"" but actual expenditure amounted to only £203,000, so that-the Department did not expend £196,000 out of the amount voted for these services last year. This the estimated expenditure is £175,000. Whether the Department intends to exthe pend the whole of that amount I do know, but I do not hesitate to assert that nine-tenths of it will be spent in Sydney and Melbourne. I am a thorough beLoan liever in the exercise of economy under existing conditions, but as the Minister has said, it would be obviously unwise to go on with works already in hand. is a curious fact, however, that finished works to which this proposed vote relates are, for the most part, in progress in only two State capitals-Melbourne and Sydney. The unfinished works in the other capitals are apparently so small that practically no provision has to be made for them. The honourable able members will observe that in the  ferred to the position of Queensland in this regard, and as a representative of a the South Australian constituency I urge that if there is to be any more "" cutting to the bone"" it should be applied all round, and not to a few of the States. If we allow the bulk of this expenditure to take place in only two capital cities the it will be a reflection on the representa- tives of other State capitals. I have not gone through the Loan Estimates, but I dare say we shall find that they, too, are loaded up with proposed votes for works Sydney and Melbourne. It seems to me that even in time of war the policy of the Department is that if there is any money to spend it shall be devoted to of works in the two capitals I have named, I and that the rest of Australia may go Proposed vote agreed to.

229,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yarra) [8.5] - Honor t we have just passed there are two items to be paid for this year out of Loan Funds, namely, machinery and plant for Cockatoo Island Dockyard, £200,000, and wireless telegraphy, £30,500. At a time when we are piling up loans such a transfer is merely absurd, seeing that it is merely shifting the liability from one pocket to another. However, I understand that the vessels specified here - includin g a Customs motor launch for New South Wales, a wooden Customs launch for Queensland, a fumigatingbarge for the same' State, a light-ship, and so forth-ar e real ships, and I use that term because people are beginning to talk about "" dream "" ships.",51
230,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"There is another class"" green "" ships.",52
231,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yes , ships built of green timber that have to be caulked from stem to stern and from deck to keelson. I may mention that even lighthouses, in a future item, have been transferred to Loan .Funds, and this is just as absurd as in the other cases. This would, I think, be a fitting opportunity for the Minister to make a statement in regard to shipping.  ister for the Navy [8.8] - I understand the honourable member to be referring to what has been termed the new policy of mercantile shipbuilding. Honourable members are aware that contracts have been made for fifty ships altogether, or, to be accurate, _fifty-one, for I have recently made arrangements for an additional vessel at Cockatoo Island. Of these vessels, twenty-seven are of steel and twenty-four are of wood. The steel ships are 5,500 tons dead-weight capacity, while the wooden ships are 2,300 tons, and some 2,600 tons. At present six of the steel ships are in course of construction, and one, the first, will be launched at ""Williamstown by, I think, the end of the year. ""We have a large quantityseveral hundred tons-of the material already riveted, and a start will be made on the assembling of the second vessel almost immediately. At ""Walsh Island there are three steel vessels laid down, and the first of these will be launched about February next. At Cockatoo Island one of the vessels, a collier, will shortly be finished, and a mercantile ship will go on what is known as the Adelaide slip. There aTe now employed, directly and indirectly, on this shipbuilding some 1,200 men.",52
232,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That is a "" flea-bite.""  niunber of men employed is small compared with what there will he in the future. But we must remember that [252]-2 ' when the work was started on the mercantile ship, only forty men were employed, and that at least six months is occupied on the preliminary work, seeing that a ship has to be constructed, practically in wood before a hole is drilled in the steel. I am pleased to say that the results up to date, so far as the labour is concerned, are very satisfactory indeed. The only difficulty that we have, and it is in consequence of the war, is that we have to pay a veTy high price for steel. . In this connection, however, we do suffer in comparison with the cost of steel in the Old Country. According to the last report of the Board of Trade, it is estimated that the price of rebuilding the ships after the war is over, to replace those lost through submarines, will cost £103,500,000 i u the Old Country, on a basis of £29 per ton. I may say that I have let contracts here at prices which it may be interesting to compare with those placed in other parts of the world. Here there is an arrangement as between the three Government yards at ""Williamstown, Cockatoo, and ""Walsh Island that the price paid at all shall be that at Williamstown; that is to say, if the cost be £28, £29, OT £30 at Williamstown, that is the price paid at all the Government yards.",52
233,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Does that include interest and wear and tear to machinery?  thing. The manager at Williamstown is, in my opinion, an exceptionally capable man, and in a newspaper interview he stated that the work done at Williamstown, although it had to be started with raw hands-and even boilermakers have much to learn when they are first placed on the hulls of steel ships-is quite equal to that done at any yard in the Old Country or in the United States of America, under similar circumstances. The report of the Commission appointed by the English Board of Trade .shows that to make good the losses in mercantile steel shipping in the United Kingdom to the end of 1917, will cost £103,500,000. The total loss of the world's shipping . was 13,000,000 tons deadweight. ' A certain - amount of shipping has been constructed in the meantime; but, after giving credit for this, aud adding interned ships which are now in use by the Allied authorities, tliere is still a shortage of 5,500,000 tons. But that does not tell - all the tale. Under ordinary circumstances, the normal increase of the world's shipping construction is about 5 per cent. If there had been no war, and the shipping had increased at the normal rate, there would have been at the end of 1915 27,000,000 tons; - at the end of 1916, 28,000,000 tons; and at the end of 1917, 29,000,000 tons. That is at the normal increase of 4 per cent.  have been scrapped.  obsolete vessels is allowed for. end of this year there would have been in existence, but for the submarine campaign and war influences generally, 31,000,000 tons. Instead, the total world shipping at the end of 1917 was -21,000,000 tons, showing a shortage of about 33 per cent. When I tell honourable members that the total British steam shipping at the same date was only about 11,000,000 tons, they can realise what the loss in tonnage has been. In order that construction might be spread over all the States, and that as many keels as possible should be laidbecause the output depends upon the number of slips in operation- I found it necessary to make contracts with private firms. Of course Government shipyards do not construct for profit, but private concerns must get a return for the capital they have invested. A f t e r a thorough investigation of the subject, and a consultation with the Acting Prime Minister, I came to the conclusion that we could not get private shipyards to undertake shipbuilding unless we made some arrangement as to the maximum profit they should derive. Finally, it was suggested that they should receive 1 \ per cent, on the turnover. But the trouble I apprehended was that the higher the cost of the ship the more profit the builder would derive, and in that way there would be an incentive to increase rather than keep down the cost of construction. some difficulty I arranged a scale of payments which has the very opposite effect, and it applies to the two big firms which have undertaken the construction of eight steel ships. The scale of profit starts on a basis of £ 2 6 per ton. turned out at that price, the builder will make a profit of £13,000, or a little over 1 \ per cent., and the ship will cost the Commonwealth £156,000.. As the 'cost per ton increases the profit decreases, unt i l on a ship which cost the maximum ;of £ 3 3 per ton-and all constructing costs are subject to inspection by the departmental officers-the builder will receive no profit at all. I claim that this scheme will have a tendency to speed up construction whilst keeping costs down to a m in i mum.. Honourable members may be curious as to how our maximum cost of £ 3 3 1 per ton for privately constructed ships compares with American prices. Prior to entering into this agreement, I cabled to America for information as to the rates paid there for a similar class of construcA t the tion, and the reply was $190 to $200, or £38 to £ 4 0 per ton. I assume that that is the average price. British estimates of costs in connection with the restoration of British tonnage to the pre-war standard are based on an average cost of £ 2 9 per ton.",52
234,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"How do the costs of raw material compare?  of raw material in England is much higher than it was before the war, but not nearly as high as it is in Australia. Steel plates in England cost £11 10s.' per ton, as against £ 3 0 in Australia. Steel sheets in England cost £16 5s. peT ton, as against £49 10s. and £54 10s. in Australia. The advance in the price in England is largely due to the increased cost of labour. One of the most pleasing features in connection with the shipbuilding scheme is the interest that the workmen are taking in it . It is true that one organization, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, has refused to enter into agreement with the Commonwealth, but there are thirty-one organizations connected with the scheme, and nearly all the men are on piece-work. Honourable members may see at Williamstown what is being done by the men on the piece-work system. Mr. Curchin assured me today that the cost of labour is very satisfactory; his A fte r only complaint is of having to pa*r £ 3 0 per ton for steel plates. Of course, we cannot avoid that, because, even if we attempted to get the steel from England and shipping were available, it would cost us more than £ 3 0 per ton landed here. If a ship is We would have been further ahead with our construction if we could have obtained the steel ordered from America for the first six ships. We had great difficulty in getting supplies there, and, unfoitunately, owing to some bungling in the United States of America, the material that was required for later stages of construction was shipped first, and that required for the early stages of construction was delayed. Of course, we have not lost time in assembling the parts, but we have not been able to go straight ahead with our construction. U p to date, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company has been able to roll all thicknesses of plates we require down to § inch. Since I have been in charge of the shipbuilding scheme the company has installed a new plant at a cost of about £50,000, and Mr Delprat informed, me by letter last week that the company is now in a position to roll plates of all thicknesses from i inch upwards. Por the f u t u r e we shall have no doubt about being able to get all our supplies of steel from the works at Newcastle. All structural steel, such as ribs and angles, is being obtained from Newcastle now.",53
235,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Surely the company will supply the steel at cheaper rates later.  the company will do later. Only this afternoon I decided to ask the company to reduce the present margin of profit; but I do not know what the answer will be.,54
236,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Apparently , we are turning out ships at the same price per ton as they are costing in England, notwithstanding that the price of raw material in Australia is double.  mentioned relate tq dead-weight tonnage. There is about 1,000 tons of steel plates and roughly 600 tons of other structural steel in the vessel being built, with a weight carrying capacity of 5,500 tons.",54
237,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Takin g the cost of ships in Australia, and comparing our price of raw material with that obtaining in Great B r it a in, it would appear that the Broken Hill Proprietary are charging an extortionate price. Is it not possible to have that price brought down, seeing that the Commonwealth Government are the only purchasers?  plained that they are charging a very high price, and I am arranging to interview the Broken Hill Proprietary people in order to see whether we cannot get a . reduction. It must be realized that there is only one steel works turning out this class of steel.",54
238,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"But there is only one customer for that steel.  hope to give the House further particulars, but I can say that everything is proceeding very satisfactorily in regard to steel ship construction and in relation also to three firms which are building wooden vessels. I believe that we can show a record that will be quite as creditable as that of any other country in regard to shipbuilding.",54
239,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Brisbane) [8,33]. - The Minister's statement is the most satisfactory that we have had upon this subject, and perhaps the most pleasing feature is the fact that obvious efforts are being made tq have these ships built in Australia, of Australian materials, and by Australian workmen. That policy should commend itself to every party in Parliament. Many of the supplementary parts required in vessels-compasses , b i noculars, and scientific instruments-ar e not immediately available in Australia, but if sufficient inducement is given they can be manufactured here.",54

Unfortunately, the Controller was in such a hurry to secure the articles that he could not afford to give the firm time to enable it to arrange its plant and secure supplies of material. I would like the Minister to see whether he cannot look far enough ahead to give firms in Australia an opportunity of supplying these articles. I presume that there are other people who would take the matter. up if the opportunity offered.",54

In round figures £37,000,000 has been contributed, which is £3,000,000 short of. the requirements.

SECOND READING .",55
247,Mr WATT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Balaclava-Treasure r and Acting^ Prime Minister) [8.43] -(B y leave)-- I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This measure embodies one of the methods proposed to make ends meet during this financial year, namely, by the i m position of increased postal rates. The proposal is to charge the following sums in addition to the postage now existing:Newspapers posted (without condition as to the number contained in each addressed wrapper) by registered newspaper pro' prietors, or by newsvendors, or returned by an agent or newsvendor"" to the publishing office, i d . per 20 ounces on the aggregate weight of newspapers so posted by any one person at any one time.

Packets, as prescribed, consisting of any of the other postal articles specified in the A f t e r con- first column of part II . of this schedule, id. per packet. The Bill deals only with articles posted within the Commonwealth for delivery This will therein. It is not intended .to increase similarly the charges for the carriage of articles oversea, because the Governor General in Council already has authority to impose extra rates for such deliveries, and this will be done by Order in Council instead of by Statute. The Postmaster General's Department estimates that the proposed rates will bring in an additional annual revenue of £790,000, after allowing for the decrease in the numher of articles carried that will occur as the result of the increase in charges. As the additional revenue can be collected for only about eight months of the present financial year, the amount expected to be received by' the 30th June next . is £516,000. Postage is usually regarded as a legitimate source from which to obtain increased revenue in times of stress. This is shown in the fact that in very many countries postage rates have been substantially increased during this present war, notably in Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and India. I propose to furnish to honourable members at a later stage a list of the other countries of the world in which increases have been made. In the United States of America postal charges have recently been substantially increased, and in France legislative authority has been given for similar increases.",55
248,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,Will the revenue received from the increased rates go into the Consolidated Bevenue of the other countries you have mentioned?,56
249,Mr WATT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"It will in some cases; I cannot speak of all. In view of the necessity for obtaining additional revenue, the Government think that there should be no objection to the proposals now made, seeing that the money will be drawn more or less from all classes of the community. There will be no special war stamp, such as was originally contemplated. We find that we can effect our purpose without one, and without adding to the inconvenience of the public. I feel that the people of Australia, in view of our huge and increasing obligations, will cheerfully accept the extra impost that we are forced to place on them.

250,Mr HIGGS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Capricornia) [8.49] - I do not propose to debate the motion at any length. In my opinion, the Government is making a mistake in proposing it, because there is no need for curtailing members' speeches. Ministers may plead that they are busily occupied with war work, but it must be remembered that every Minister has handed over a great decla- part of his duties to Committees and Boards of various kinds. We were told, when this Ministry was formed, that we were to have a return to responsible goaffirvernment, but no Ministry has exercised less responsibility than this. No Ministry has had the assistance of so many persons in various walks of life outside Parliament; estimable men, of wide experience, but men absolutely without responsibility to the electors. Ministers cannot plead that they have little time for atten-: tion to parliamentary duties. Take the question of wool tops, which-the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) says is burnt into his brain. It has been handed to Sir John Higgins and the Central Wool Committee. So with a hundred other governmental activities. Ministers could meet Parliament during several additional months' of the year, and provide opportunity for the discussion of their various measures. Their proposal is calculated to drive us to the press for the discussion of public affairs, which will mean that Parliament will lose its standing, and the country will be governed by the newspapers issued from the offices in Collins-street, Melbourne; King and Hunter streets,' Sydney; and the other cities of the Commonwealth.",57

Many persons think that Parliament has outlived its usefulness. Members like the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) are By their Conservatism increasing in the community what is known as the Industrial Workers of the World element. Parliament is passing nothing in the way of democratic legislation; it is adopting the habits and customs of tyrants. Why should we not meet during four or five months of the year to discuss the measures of the Government? At the present time legislation is too hurried. A little while ago the Ministry introduced a Bill to impose a tax on eligibles. It was driven through the House, members not being allowed to discuss it fTeely. Had a ful l discussion been allowed, probably the Government would not have proceeded with the Bill. As it was, it became law, but has never been put into operation. Then, when the Loan Bill was before us, and the honourable  that the Government be instructed to issue no more loans with, interest free of taxation, the "" gag "" was moved after the proposal had been under discussion for about an hour, and the Government proposal was carried. A few months later the Government adopted the suggestion of the honourable member, and now the interest paid on war loans is subject to income tax. The Government may pass this motion, and they may or may not put into operation the proposed new standing order. I . a m inclined to think that the guillotine will operate before the session closes. If it does, we shall have a great deal of slip-shod legislation, which either will not be put into operation or will have to be repealed by subsequent Parliaments. I protest against what is being done. The passing of this motion will be one of the things for which the public will punish the Ministry at the next elections.",57
253,Mr MAHONY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Dalley) [8.56] - I enter my protest against the proposed standing order. Before proposing the drastic curtailment of debate, Ministers should show that members are abusing their freedom of speech. It is for the other side to prove that the tactics of the Opposition are preventing the passing lation and the transaction of the business, of the country. That has not been done. No reasons have been given in support of the proposal.",58
254,Mr CORSER,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,They are too obvious.,58
255,Mr MAHONY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Le t the honourable member tell the House what piece of lation has been delayed by the Opposition, or what Estimates this party has blocked. He cannot show any. If he could, i would be a reflection ou the Government, because it has a majority with which i can do what it chooses. The Standing Orders empower the Government to deal with tactics that are not reasonable and fair. Were I to exceed my rights I should be dealt with under the Standing Orders. Ministers have at their command a majority sufficiently large to enable them to carry their wishes into effect.",58
256,Mr JOWETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,That is not the way we govern.,58
257,Mr MAHONY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"What is proposed is ten times worse, than what is already in existence. Under the new standing order it can be determined by a vote of the House how many members shall be allowed to speak on a question, and how much time shall be allowed for the discussion of any measure. All that will be necessary will be to declare the business urgent, whether it be a Bill or a set of Estimates. The time that shall be allotted for the discussion of a proposal is to be fixed, and thus members are to be prevented from giving expression to the views of those who sent them here. I warn Ministers not to go too far. Proposals like this may have a boomerang effect. The time may not be far distant when ""those now in office may be no longer enjoying their snug positions. The whirligig of time may place some other party on the Treasury bench. What will honourable members opposite say then if this standing order is applied to them? The proposed standing order directly restricts the freedom of debate, and makes Parliament a mere machine for churning out legislation. The last speaker referred to ' the measure for the taxing of - the single eligible men of Australia, which was rushed through this House despite the protests of the Opposition. Had it been given the consideration it deserved, it would not have been passed; and the result today is that the Government are afraid to put it into operation. of legis- They are going to repeal it.",58

259,Mr MAHONY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Firs t they say they will, and then they say they will not. At all events, it was placed upon the statute-book by the Government, backed up by the majority, and yet the Governlegisment are afraid today to put it into operation. One never knows what may happen in regard to legislation proposed t by the Ministry. We have on the business-paper Bills that must seriously t affect the financial position of Australia Are they to he rushed through without adequate discussion? Is legislation to be carried without reasonable debate merely because it is declared by the Government and their supporters to be of an urgent character? Only two or three members of the Opposition will be allowed to speak on any measure declared to be of an urgent character. Surely we ought not to legislate in such a way for a country that is passing through a time of crisis. We should carefully consider all the business put before us. We have confronting us today the most serious problems. If we are to have this limitation placed upon the discussion of measures in this House, how are we to properly consider the great after-war problems with which we shall have to deal ? How can we hope, for instance, to deal adequately with the great question of Australia's trade relations with other countries, which must receive our attention as soon as the war is over? Are such questions to be disposed of after a discussion extending over a few minutes? I am convinced that if the Government and their supporters were to give serious consideration to this standing order, they would recognise the danger of it , to not only the Parliament, but the people. I urge the Government, in the interests of the Commonwealth, to withdraw the motion, since the existing Standing Orders are quite ample to provide for the proper conduct of business in this Chamber.",58
260,Mr JOWETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Grampians) [9.5] There is an old adage that ""desperate diseases require desperate remedies."" have no hesitation' in saying that this is a most desperate remedy, and that we have a right to ask ourselves whether the disease to which it is to be applied is so desperate as to call for it . My own sonal experience in this House satisfies me that there is no necessity for such a standing order. Under it , it sible for a majority of the House to decide that a Bill is urgent, whereupon it may be rushed through with less debate than takes place in connection with measures of perhaps less importance. My experience of this House is short, ""but I have given close attention to the measures which Have been put before us since I was returned to Parliament, and it seems to me that the great defect of this proposal is that it will lead to questions of special importance receiving less attention than is given to measures of minor significance.

It seems to me -%that some of the acts of .the Ministry - during the progress of the war will require more discussion than will some of their acts after the war is over. This is an entirely wrong proposition. No necessity has been shown for the passing of such a standing order. What is the history of this Parliament in respect of last week? Any one member of the Opposition could have prevented the Treasurer' from making his statement on the Compulsory War Loan Bill on the day on which he obtained leave to introduce the Bill , but no one raised any objection to his doing so. Then again, the Bill to amend the Entertainments Tax-on e of the most monstrous taxes ever proposed in any Parliament, placing as it does a heavy impost on the poorest section of the community-wa s also dealt with last week. A f t e r it had been disposed of, the Acting Prime Minister, at about 9.40 p.m. on Thursday, brought down a Supply Bill providing for an expenditure of £4,500,000 , and suggested that it should be passed that night, and that the Works and Buildings Estimates, so far as works out of revenue were concerned, should be disposed of before we rose on the Friday. After some discussion it - was agreed that we should' take the Supply Bill only on the following day. No honourable members on this side "" stone-walled.""

From time to time the discussion of it was dropped in order to pass' other measures, and so provide work for another place, and as we never knew when it would come on for discussion the result was an ill-digested measure.

The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) remarked that most of the matters that come under our consideration are very serious, and that is quite true. For instance, there are the taxation proposals; and out of regard for those whom one honourable member has described as the "" victims,"" these proposals ought to be discussed full y and freely. There are great differences of opinion as to war taxation, even between city constituencies and country constituencies.",61
280,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,The honourable member will not be in order in going into that subject; the question before us is simply the question of the duration of the proposed standing order.,61
281,Mr WEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"This is such a tyrannical proposal that it is very difficult for a man. of liberal views to keep within bounds; indeed, it makes hi m question whether he is really in a Parliament. If the Government desire to keep this House in such a temper as to .prove of assistance in the work of legislation, they ought not, especially during war time, to attempt to persecute honourable members in this way. rushed As has already been pointed out, there is no justification for such a proposal; no concrete case has been cited showing anv necessity for it . A Parliament of men should have sufficient spirit to resist the temptation to smother discussion on questions of great importance to the people. Are we a Parliament of pigmies, or what are we ? If we are men, we ought to have sufficient Backbone to resist tyranny of this sort I cannot think that after this debate honourable members opposite can seriously agree with this motion-this unwarrantable proposal. When the present occupants of the Government benches were in Opposition, their utterances against the Government of the day were almost intolerable, under circumstances less serious than those of the present time. If I were asked for a good electioneering cry for honourable members on this side, I could suggest nothing better than that the Government should introduce a motion of this kind during war time, for nothing Would appeal more to the people than an attempt on the part of the Government to bludgeon those who differ from them. In all my experience of Parliament I have never known an Opposition more anxious than the present one to assist the Government, and a motion of this kind is a stigma on the Parliaments of Australia. It will go forth to. the world that this Parliament is prepared to smother freedom of speech on the part of the people's representatives. What are the Government measures which come before us 1 When they are introduced they are so many pieces of paper, the meaning of which - the Government themselves hardly know, and it is not u n t i l they have been criticised by the Opposition that the possibility is presented of passing measures that may be of some use to the people. When the Leader of the Opposition rises in the Imperial Parliament, the Government are anxious to know what the members on the front Opposition bench think of the proposal before the House, and until the view of the Opposition is obtained no measure is regarded as having a possibility of becoming law. That is the quintessence of legislation by Parliament. Although honourable members on the Government side considerably outnumber the Opposition in this House thef votes cast for the Government at the last election - were only a few thousand i cess of those cast for the Opposition. we cannot do that? Why, therefore, should the voices of - orable members on this side be stifled every time our views offend the susceptithis bilities of the Government? There must be some . ulterior motive behind motion. The Government do not desire common sense and reason to reign supreme; and they are afraid that by criticism their measures may be made appear ridiculous. No other construction can be placed upon this drastic, uncalledwho for, and unnecessary standingorder. during war time. The purpose of our Standing Orders is to give every honourable member the same privilege and the same opportunity of pressing his opinion on all questions come before the House. The proposed standing order aims at defeating that purpose, and I hope that the supporters of the Government will never allow it come into operation. When the people have an opportunity of knowing what, Government have proposed, they will call quorum. the National party to account. Political history in Australia has shown that when any Government become tyrannical, and deprive those sitting in Opposition of their privileges, the people visit upon them punishment they deserve. Disraeli at time refered to "" Her Majesty's Oppoand sition."" We are His Majesty's Opposithat tion, and as such are part and parcel of tion. this Parliament. It is absurd to propose that three members on each side of the House shall be allowed to speak for only ten minutes each on a matter of grave im portance affecting, for instance, the taxathe tion of the country. When the Labour party first entered this Parliament, the nual expenditure did not total more than £10,000,000 or £12,000,000. To-day ordinary Estimates total £30,000,000, and we are spending huge sums of loan money in addition. If . when any meaHouse, sure is brought forward, the explanation of it does not satisfy honourable members, they are entitled to criticise the proposal and ask for fuller information. should the people be asked to obey that may not represent the will and inteltrol ligence of Parliament? It has been laid down in the British Parliament that ' ' Liberal laws the people obey; laws are tyrannical the people will not obey."" As long as I have breath in my body I of. danger. shall oppose any proposal that will prive the representatives of the people their right to express their opinions n exParliament. What will Parliament be if The hostility of honsome honourable members on the Government side towards honourable members on side would lead them to adopt any extreme measures. Last week two honorthis able members on the Government side were in such a temper because we, who were formerly their colleagues, asked our questions which they did not like, that to they could hardly speak. I feel ashamed that there are men in this Parliament would support a motion of this k in d If the Government are not entirely bereft of reason - they will see that there is no necessity for this exmotion, and will undertake that nothing that is done to deprive the representatives of the people of their right to express their opinions.",61
282,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I draw attention to to the fact that this serious proposal, to curtail the liberties of honourable members is the being dealt with in the absence of a [Quorum formed.']",62
283,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Wimmera) [9.37] At all times, and not only during the war period, the Government should have control of the business of the House, but that the control should not be attained by deprivone ing members of their proper privileges their right to debate all questions come before the House for consideraI t has heen said that this motion proposes a drastic means of dealing with the prolongation of debate, especially when measures are urgently required in interests of the country. I think that the motion in its present for m is calcuanlated to deprive members of their p r i v i leges, and the House of the proper conthe sideration of measures of importance, and might easily lead to the Government becoming largely the controllers of the and taking possession of the p r i r vileges that belong to the House. Nevertheless, too much time is occupied in debate, and in the interests of the country Why we should have some limitation of speech. a law The Government should have more conof the business of the House, but any proposal to that end should be so framed as not to deprive members of their right that to debate a question. The motion standing by itself is fraught with a good deal I see plainly that it w i ll be depossible for the Government to declare of any measure urgent, and require that the in vote shall be taken within twenty-four or forty-eight hours. The allotted time Will be occupied by a few members speaking for the full period allowed by the Standing Orders, and when the guillotine is applied probably the bulk of the members will have been deprived of the opportunity of making their contribution to the debate. Thus the people may lose the opportunity of getting the well-digested legislation that would be the result of a full expression of opinion from all sides of the House. I think that an economy in time can be effected by an amendment whioh I shall propose, without a drastic interference with the right of honourable members to address themselves to a question. In the present constitution of the House there is an overwhelming majority on the Ministerial side, and if the Government, acting under this proposed standing order, were to place a time limit on a certain debate, Mr Speaker, following the usual practice, would call upon honourable members from each side of the House alternately. Thus honourable members sitting in Opposition would have the same share of time as the much larger number of members on the Ministerial side, and many of the majority members would be deprived of the opportunity of participating in the debate. That would not be fair. After the next election there may be quite, a different distribution of parties. But we should regard this proposal not as a party matter, but as one affecting the privileges of the House, and we should all unite in order to deal with legislation,, especially war-time legislation, in a way that will best serve the interests of the people. The amendment whioh I intend to move will reduce by half the time allowed to each speaker. The Standing Orders at present limit certain speeches to 1 hour 85 minutes each; other speeches to 1 hour each, and speeches in Committee to halfan-hour. I propose, by reducing those times by 50 per cent., to give twice as many members an opportunity of contributing to any debate upon which the Government impose the time limit. not propose at this stage that this limitation of individual speeches should be applied to all debates. It is a matter for consideration as to * whether there should be a further general reduction of the time now allowed by the Standing Orders for each speech, but the amendMr Sampson. ment I intend to propose will apply only to those debates which will be affected by the suggested new standing order. I think the amendment would immensely improve the motion that is now before the House, would help to preserve the privileges of - honourable members, and would enable the bulk of those who wish to contribute to a debate, to do so. We must give consideration to"" the fact that the Government would not declare measures to be urgent unless there was very good reason for doing so. An amendment of the Standing Orders in 1905 gave the Government the opportunity to apply the closure to a debate and also to silence any individual member. There have been occasions when that standing order has been applied drastically, but we know that Governments have learned certain lessons from its operation. I believe that no Government would exercise its. right to apply the closure unless there was big justification for it , and Ministers would only attempt to declare a measure urgent after a very grave consideration of the consequences that might follow their use of this power too lightly, or too frequently. I do not fear the consequences of allowing a responsible Government to make use of the opportunity to declare a measure urgent so long as it is found possible at the same time to safeguard honourable members from being deprived of their right to make a proper contribution to the discussion.",62
284,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,The honourable member's proposed amendment would not accomplish that object.,63
285,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"If the proposed standing order is adopted in its present form, some honourable members, by using the full time allowed to each honourable member to speak, would exhaust the whole of the time allotted by the Government for the debate on the measure; but my amendment would at least enable double the number of honourable members. I do to speak in ihe time available.",63
286,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,That depends upon the time the Government allow for the consideration of a measure.,63
287,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Certainly , if the Government fix one hour for the conclusion of a debate, it wiU enable not more than two honourable members to speak; but no one would imagine a Government fixing sucb. a short limitation for an i m portant measure. If a debate is carried on to an inordinate extent, the Government may fix an early hour for the con' elusion of it , just as they may now apply the closure; but I conclude that they will follow the House of Commons practice, and declare that a debate must close ' within twenty-four hours, or forty-eight hours, or on a day in the'following'week. However, the Government cannot take away the privileges of the House. Honourable members have, first of all, to vote on the motion when the Government bring it forward; and I do not think that honourable - members of the Opposition will find honourable members on this side of the House allowing any Government to get up and declare measure after measure to be urgent, and secure a majority of honourable members to support them in ' doing so unless reasonable time is.afforded for the conduct of debate. I think that, with a further limitation on speeches, we will have better speeches. They will be more condensed, and thus will be more valuable contributions to the debates. In fact, the proposal should tend to improve our legislation. At the same time, my amendment will afford honourable members an opportunity to express their views and make any representations they may wish to make according to the particular interests they represent. not in favour of the. amendment submitted by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) . I - agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Tudor) that measures brought forward during'a time of war are of such importance that we should have just as much opportunity of discussing - them as we would have in time of peace. Instead of seeking to defeat the Government's proposal, it should be our endeavour to improve it so that the object sought may be attained, while at the same time the privileges of honourable members are not too seriously curtailed.",63
288,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Melbourne) [9.51] It seems to me that the phrase the gladiators of ancient Borne made use of, ' ' We who are about to die salute the, Caesar,"" is appropriate. The Csesars are on the Ministerial side. The gladiators are on this side, fighting for a little more freedom of speech. Whether we shall die or not, politically, the f u t u r e can show. As long as I have speech, I shall continue to object to the curtailment of the very limited powers we now have. The Government which is asking for this additional power has allowed work to accumulate day by ^ day which should be done by Parliament, and it must accept the blame for any congestion that may occur. I am perfectly certain that if the people had the initiative re- ferendum and recall there would be no need for this motion. The existing Standing Orders would be quite sufficient. It is the duty of Parliament to clear off every motion on the notice-paper. There are many awaiting discussion by this House, yet I can say without contradiction that I am the only private member who has succeeded in carrying a motion here since the war began. The very idea of having a day set apart for private members' business is a farce. The Government would be far more straightforward and honourable if they would say to the people, "" Y o u r members oan bring forward no private business."" Couch this motion in whatever language one likes, even if it be amended as the honourable member for Wimmera proposes to amend it , it will be understood by the people of Australia to mean a furthe r limitation upon the already limited amount of business in which the Government permit private members to take part. One factor that causes so much I am debate is the absence of control by the people. The wide spaces of Australia do not tend to cause excess of talk during debate. If honourable members spoke in three separate languages our proceedings would ocoupy a greater time. If , for instance, the Postmaster-General made one of his famous speeches, and it had to be_ translated into another language for the benefit of honourable members, and then a second time had to be translated into another language, our debates would be greatly prolonged. Three languages are spoken in the Swiss Parliament. If one member ""of that Parliament makes a lengthy speech, and the representative of a German-speaking State claimed to have it translated, as he has the righ t to do, and then a representative of one of the. French Cantons, made the same claim, as he has the righ t to do, the proceedings would be unending.",64

292,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I think about 16s. It is the duty of members to put on the business-sheet those motions which their patriotism has inspired. There is this argument that might be advanced in support of the proposed new standing order: that it will lead to more work being done. The burden of parliamentary life, however, is not so much that imposed by the sittings in this chamber as that imposed by the work that has to be done outside, and during the recess our work is heavier than - when Parliament is sitting, because one can frequently get a matter attended to, or an injustice righted, by asking questions of a Minister in his place in the House, when, in recess, two or three weeks of correspondence Would be necessary. I cannot support either the amendment of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson) or the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Kelly) that the proposed rule shall have force only for the duration of the war. I would prefer that the rule, if imposed, should be limited to the duration of the war; but I do not think that It it is likely to be continued after the war, The and I urge honourable members to reject it altogether. I am, I think, the only private member who since the war began has carried a motion. My motion had reference to the promise of Home Rule"" for It Poland made by the late Czar. No member oould take a rule like this' before his constituents and say, "" We want to shorten the speeches in Parliament o c that we may lessen our sittings."" If he did his constituents would reply that Parliament should sit more days in the year to attend to its duties properly. The proposed rule provides for an affirmative vote of not less than twenty four members on the question that the Estimates of Expenditure, a Customs or Excise Tariff resolution, or a motion shall be considered urgent.

300,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"May I draw your attention, Mr Speaker, to the fact that honourable members who intended to support my amendment did not hear any request by you for a seconder to it .",67
301,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"If honourable members did not hear my call for a seconder to the amendment I must throw the blame upon their own shoulders. I distinctly called for a seconder, but there was no response. If an honourable member had arranged to second the amendment he should have been alert when the call was made. I would also point out that under the Standing Orders an amendment must be signed both by the proposer and the seconder, and that I had no such signed amendment placed in my hands in response to my request to the honourable member to give me his amendment.

303,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Darlin g Downs-Minister of Works and Railways) [10.29] - The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr . PAIRS. Kelly) asked a question this afternoon with reference to the appointment of Mr . J . K . Jensen to the. position of secretary to the Commonwealth Arsenal, and in quired whether he was related to the Minister for Trade and Customs. He is not related to him. I promised to f u r Watkins, D. nish a reply on the motion for the adjournment of the House, and I am able now to make the following statement: Mr J. K. Jensen was appointed aS secretary to the Commonwealth Arsenal because it was considered that his training as an officer of the Department peculiarly fitted him for the duties of the position. He was first appointed to the Defence Department in 1898, and, after a term in the Victorian Ordnance Stores, was transferred to the Records Branch at Central Administration. Shortly afterwards he was specially chosen to proceed to the TJnited States to assist Sir William Clarkson (then Engineer-Commander Clarkson) in connection with the contract held by Messrs. Pratt and Whitney for the supply of rifle-making plant for the Small Arms Factory, as well as to procure and study all information necessary for efficient factory organization. He was subsequently appointed accountant and chief clerk to the Small Arms Factory, being primarily responsible for the accountancy and industrial side of the establishment. He was again brought back to the Central Administration when the war broke out, and was placed in charge, under the secretary, of all matters connected with the administration and organization of the Government factories, and the industrial matters connected with the Department.  ister for the Navy) [10.33] - I desire to clear up a misapprehension on the part of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews), who made a statement the other night with reference to Mr Curchin, the gentleman in charge of Government shipbuilding. The honourable member spoke of that gentleman as having brought from England some of his relatives, and placed them in positions in the Williamstown shipyard. I wish to state emphatically that the officials referred to are not relatives in any sense, nor are any of the men who came out from England related to one another. I desire also to clear up a point in connection with the statement made by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr . Kelly), who the other night referred to a boy who had been rejected at the Naval College on account of his having had an epileptic fit. The honourable member' stated that the Secretary to the Naval Board, Mr Maeandie,- had sent him a letter which was incorrect, and had misled him. I have made inquiries, and I find that on the day the letter was written by the honourable member to the Secretary - a letter to which the honourable member said he received a reply within two days - the Secretary was with me in Sydney at the launching of the Adelaide. Sydney we went on to Newcastle, and were away, I think, ten days; so that it will be seen, at any rate, that the blame is not attachable to that* gentleman.",67
304,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"But what if somebody used the Secretary's signature. officials have their signatures on rubber stamps, and the blame, if any, may rest upon a person who used such a signature on behalf of the Secretary.  which I have to refer is connected with some remarks by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) about the Albert, of which the following is the history:The Albert was a tug belonging to the Department of Ports and Harbors of Victoria. The Navy Department had a claim on the services of another tug, which bad been transferred to the State Department some years ago, and, in satisfaction of this claim, the Albert was accepted, free of cost, by the Navy Department, as a tug was required for duty in connection with dredging at Flinders Naval Base. Before the Albert was accepted, she was surveyed by a Board of technical officers, who reported that an expenditure of £4,600 would render her quite efficient for the service required. The vessel was accordingly sent to Cockatoo Island, Sydney, under her own steam, for overhaul; but when the ship was opened out, and the boiler removed, it was found that a new boiler and considerable repairs would be required. The Naval Board would not approve an expenditure in excess of what the original report of survey stated would be necessary, and as the vessel could not be put to any useful purpose without a considerable expenditure, tenders were invited, and she was sold to the highest bidder for £806. The Department has no knowledge of how the engines of the vessel were disposed of by the purchaser. No letter has been received from Mr Kelly making any inquiry about this vessel.",68
305,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,Who purchased the Albertl  formation; but it will be seen that no blame is attachable to the Navy Department.,68
306,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Barrier ) [10.35] This afternoon I asked the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) a question with reference to some fresh vagaries on the part of the. Censor. The Australian Peace Alliance is an organization of about a dozen bodies, including, amongst others, the Clerks Union, the Federated Store. men and Packers Union, the Peace Society, Victorian Socialist Society, the Society of Friends, the Women's Political Association, the Plumbers and Gas Prom Fitters Union, and the Australian Union of Democratic Control. These are banded together for the purpose of promulgating the idea of'peace as opposed to war from a general stand-point. This organization, in pursuance of its objects, has issued its Some platform, in which, amongst others, clause e advocates, or proposes to advocate, that "" Great - B r it a in shall propose as part of the settlement of the present war a plan for the drastic reduction of armaments by consent of all belligerent Powers with a view of their total abolition."" The Censor, in dealing with that pamphlet, allowed all the words of that clause to stand except, "" with a view to their total abolition."" - Then in sub-clause i of the same clause there appeared the words, "" the organization of workers and other associations with a definite view to ending war."" The Censor caused the whole of that to be struck out. I fail to see, and I think honourable members on both sides will agree with me, that there is anything in the phraseology of this form or in the words ordered to-be elimif nated, calculated to "" help the enemy,"" ""prejudice recruiting,"" or ""involve the safety of the Commonwealth"" - the phrases which are utilized by the Censor when he cuts out what he regards as objectionable portions of documents or speeches from time to time.",68
307,Mr MAXWELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,There seems to be nothing objectionable from any point of view.,69
308,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"That is what I say. The Peace Alliance was formed long prior to the war, with a view to inculcating love of peace generally. We have been told that the object, or one of the objects, for which this war is being waged is to render future war impossible - that it is a war to end war. Mr ""WATT - Some speeches are all right in the afternoon, but are no good at night, and some proposals about peace are good at certain times, and not good at others. There are two hints in this interjection.",69
309,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I am dealing with the other "" h in t "" the censor got - The Acting Prime Minister will admit, if he examines the platform of the Peace Alli ance, and reads the words which the censor has struck out Mr ""WATT - Why not show me some of these things, and not make long speeches about them here?",69
310,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I should expect the Acting Prime Minister to know, without being told, what comes under his juristhe House. diction. Of course, the honourable gentleman cannot know everything, but honourable members have repeatedly drawn his attention to the escapades of the censor. I do not think that the words struck out of this pamphlet would come under the parliamentary ban. I fancy that an honourable member on either side could speak in advocacy of all the planks of the Peace Alliance platform, and not have his remarks objected to by the Crown Law authorities, or find any action taken by Mr. Speaker to have them .eliminated from Hansard. Why is it that the censor is not given some direction as to the procedure he should adopt-som e definite lines to go on? Why is not'some Minister made responsible for the censor's actions, so that the censor may be checked ? There is no redress for censorship of the kind to which I have drawn attention. People who desire to promulgate their views in platthe direction of peace are at present harassed by the censor; and we know that the regulations concerning outside matters have been considerably tightened up with a view to giving the censor more power. Nobody could say that this pamphlet, or the words eliminated, could affect the issue of the war one whit; it merely incul: cates peace sentiment, which should be encouraged and not suppressed by the censor.",69
311,Mr GBEGOKY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,Not now.,69
312,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"If not now, why should he leave in some of the words I have quoted and cut out others? There does not seem to be any. sane principle guiding the censorship.",69
313,Mr WATT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,There are some things in the pamphlet which should have been cut out before those quoted by the honourable member. It is something like the man who cut the tail off the dog and threw away the wrong piece.,69
314,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I do not know anything about such surgical operations, but I do not think it would be out of place if the censor were curtailed. The Acting Prime Minister must admit that, in this instance at least, the work of the censor has not been guided by any fixed principle. If the Acting Prime Minister, or the Cabinet generally, would take some measure to control the censor, or give him some definite line of action, honourable members would know where they were, and would not be repeatedly troubling",69
315,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Melbourne"") [10.46]. - I draw the ""attention of the Acting Prime Minister to the danger of what is known as the Spanish influenza. I hope he will see his way clear to cable to Capetown and ask for particulars of the latest treatment that has been found efficacious there-.",69
316,Mr JENSEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,That has been done already.,70
317,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"May I ask that the information will be widely published in the press, so that the. people will know how to treat the malady, either independently of a doctor or until medical aid arrives. Mr JENSEN:-Yes .",70
318,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"When an honourable member asks a question in the House he is. entitled to an answer. The A u d it Department on three separate occasions has failed to give an answer to my question as to the date of the special audit of the accounts of the Northern Territory. The Department has replied that there has been a continuous audit. That is not the information I seek. I desire to know when a special audit of the Northern Territory accounts was made, independent of the local auditors, l t is of no use to me to be told that.a special auditor is in Papua or floating about the summer seas, and will reach Darwin in time. I expect an answer from the Government, just as, if I were a shareholder in a bank and asked a director for information, I should expect him to get it from the manager. Tf I cannot get from the Government the date of that special audit I shall have to make independent inquiries and follow up statements contained in letters I have received from Darwin. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.48 p.m.",70
